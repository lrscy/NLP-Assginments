The social dimension is not inimical to competitiveness.
As we have often mentioned in this debate, the Nordic countries have been able to implement reforms successfully because they have negotiated them and arranged for them to be accompanied both by collective investment in research and innovation and by a new economic flexibility and significant compensation for workers in terms of social benefits, lifelong learning and protection of rights.
However, all this presupposes that a high level both of tax deductions and of social redistribution will be maintained.
In the same way, Germany has come up with all the aces where exports are concerned and, in common with other European Union countries, has demonstrated that, even with high salary costs and a system of social protection that is among the most efficient in Europe and among the most extensive in the world, it can remain competitive internationally.
Let us, then, stop invoking global competition as a way of denigrating the European social model.
Let us invoke it with a view to investing more in Europeâs assets, in human capital and in research and innovation.
The route to renewed growth is now basically via consumer confidence, an increase in internal demand, a boost to purchasing power and a fairer distribution of income and added value between shareholders and salaried employees.
In conclusion, MrÂ Winkler and MrÂ Barroso, I should like to say that the European Council will be judged on two counts: on the one hand, the lessons it will draw from Parliamentâs vote on the âServicesâ Directive â there must, emphatically, be no return to Bolkestein â and, on the other hand, freedom of movement for workers from the new Member States within the European Union. It is time to grant them that basic freedom.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Barroso, MrÂ Winkler, ladies and gentlemen, I take a positive view of the fact that the European Union is using its weight to ensure that the whole is worth more than the sum of its parts, by boosting research and development to release the potential of companies, to foster enlargement and the best possible use of the quality of the labour force, with measures intended to secure energy supplies â but this is all subject to one basic premise: the added value of Europe can only emerge fully if it is the product of the work of a genuinely united European society and economy and if the results are achieved through the âcore businessâ of the European Union.
The establishment of the single market and of a Community united socially and politically in developing the wealth of its cultural identities is a factor of great importance: there is no single market, no European society able to express its full potential without the physical integration of Europe and without transport infrastructure and services providing mobility and ensuring that every point âaâ of the Union has access to every point âbâ.
This objective should not be viewed as an almost obsolete one compared to the new challenges we are facing; it is a fundamental premise: there is no research without the opportunity for face-to-face contacts, there is no effective potential for companies if markets are not integrated.
This is a fundamental precondition that we solemnly promised to achieve by approving resolution 884-2004 here in Parliament one year ago, making a commitment to complete the trans-European transport network as rapidly as possible by 2020.
Unfortunately, there is no trace of this goal in the Commissionâs statement â contrary to the initial proposal â or of what happened last year when they made a sober reflection and guided us in that direction, also urging the Member States to do the same.
If we also add the Council's proposals for a drastic cut in funding for that sector, making achievement of the goal virtually out of the question, or at least delaying it enormously, we are in a situation of red alert.
In any event, I view the intervention of Parliament as an attempt to stiffen its resolve and an invitation to all the parties involved to ensure that the trans-European transport network actually sees the light of day.
My heartfelt appeal today is to avoid a disastrous political error: a true political error since, after resolution 884, intellectual, political and financial energy was unleashed in Europe, with enormous expectation surrounding the idea of continuing the TEN project.
There is no corner of Europe in which the TEN is not being discussed.
Today, however, it is one of the items not included â and therefore inadequately supported â in that Plan D that is intended to bridge the interest gap between the European Union and its citizens.
If we fail to keep our promises or respond to those expectations, the results will be much more far-reaching and serious than those that we are seeking to achieve in the attempt to construct the European project.
I hope this idea is not approved and that we are able to avoid the disastrous effects that a possible interruption of the project would have on the expectations of many European citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, if we envisage Europe becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, we need to boost investment in education and in the field of research and development.
Unfortunately, Europe now suffers from high emigration of our own researchers towards the USA.
In todayâs Europe the best way for a researcher to excel is by joining a leading American university.
We need to compete with the USA by improving our policies to help our scholars remain in the European Union.
We need to launch a European research area, with the aim of analysing and finding ways to improve the field of research and make it a useful tool for the needs and purposes of our researchers.
I believe we must link the Lisbon Strategy to the Bologna Process in order to establish a good connection between our university system and our economic and welfare policy objectives.
If we do not improve the current educational and R[amp]D instruments at EU Member State level and at the level of supra-state bodies, what is known as the Lisbon Strategy will prove to be a big failure.
Â Â  â Mr President, It goes without saying that the Lisbon Strategyâs goals â of 20Â million new jobs, a 3% average annual growth in GDP, and a similar increase in the amount spent on research and development â are the right ones, but I have to tell Mr Lehne that the problem lies not in the destination, but in the strategy whereby it is proposed that we reach it.
Let us consider the present-day realities: our economic growth is averaging out at 1.5% and we have created only something like a quarter of the new jobs we hoped for â and very badly paid ones at that.
That is the fundamental problem.
This is the course we have been steering for six years, and the newly-adopted guidelines, which now have to be implemented as part of the national plans, reflect it.
Just take a look: in every Member State of the European Union, profits from productivity are going through the roof!
But what about wage rises?
Wages are staying where they were!
How, then, do you propose to stimulate domestic demand?
What is done always reflects the idea that social security benefits have some sort of adverse effect on a national economy, yet they do no such thing; they do it some good!
In the final analysis, high wages result in economic growth, but policy needs to be thought out all over again.
What we do not need is permanent deregulation and privatisation.
We do need competition, but what we need to compete for is higher social standards and higher environmental standards.
We need to come to the insight that the goods that we produce need to be manufactured in line with international labour standards.
That is what we need!
We will then have a chance of really following through the Lisbon Strategy to the goal we want to reach, and we will not do that by constantly reducing social security benefits in order to give businesses even more freedom; that is the wrong way to go about it.
Â Â  Mr President, each year in March, we hold debates in preparation for the spring summit, and since 2001, we have discussed why the Lisbon process fails to meet the prescribed goals.
To that question, the Kok report, back in 2004, gave an unambiguous response: the Member States must shoulder their responsibility and set down to the task of reforming their economies and their welfare state, thereby making room for sustainable growth and employment.
Now that economic growth is back on the cards, the necessary reforms are at risk of being shelved, but growth alone is insufficient to keep our social model intact.
Could the Commissioner indicate what the Commission intends to do to avert this danger and implement the conclusions of the Kok report?
I hope that the period of reflection will also be discussed, for that is desperately needed.
It appears that Europeâs elite is unable to discuss the EUâs future without the excess baggage of a rejected constitution.
Nine months of reflection should be sufficient for a first follow-up.
Â Â  ( Mr President, it is a great shame that the high-flown talk of implementing the Lisbon Strategy has come to nothing more than words.
The Lisbon Strategy relates in particular to the competitiveness of the Union.
As we all know, increasing competitiveness mainly requires an increase in productivity, which in turn threatens jobs.
This threat will not materialise if the increase in revenue created by greater productivity is sufficiently high and is not limited to individual countries but also applies to integrated economies such as those of the EU.
However, increased productivity requires not only the implementation of technological advances, but also the relocation of production from locations where it is more expensive to those where it is cheaper.
The increase in revenue resulting from these activities will be beneficial to all in the Union, while abandoning the process threatens to result in stagnation and decreased competitiveness, as the world does not stand still.
Therefore we must choose either certain stagnation or a risk which could pay off.
We should not be afraid of the Lisbon Strategy.
It is an opportunity for us all.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
Our view is that the actions to achieve the Lisbon goals â growth, employment and competitiveness â have been few in number and lacking in clarity.
More support is required for small and medium-sized enterprises, the core of our industrial fabric, such as improved access to credit, European finance and research and technology programmes, as well as better defence of high-quality European industry against unfair international competition â I refer, for example, to the textile and food sectors.
We need an energy plan to free Europe from the current geopolitical instability, and maximum attention should be devoted to new sources of energy in order to ensure sustainable and durable development â also on an environmental level.
In specific terms, we need to invest in education, training, research and innovation in order to render our production processes competitive.
Finally, we need to safeguard our primary resource â workers and human capital.
We must not allow our citizensâ jobs and well being to be viewed as less important than the laws of the market and international trade.
We must not forget that industry must be at the service of the workers, not vice versa.
Â Â  Mr President, chairmen, ladies and gentlemen, I do not make a habit of paying compliments, but in this debate it would be really improper not to express any appreciation for the co-rapporteurs MrÂ Lehne and MrÂ Goebbels.
They deserve our congratulations for the draft resolution they have prepared, which is more than satisfactory and which we back 100%.
It goes without saying that as coordinator of my group in the Lisbon steering group, I would also like to extend my appreciation to the group colleagues who have given the necessary input.
The discussion of this resolution was far more constructive in Parliament than last year, and I hope that this bodes well for the hoped-for implementation itself of the renewed strategy for growth and jobs.
The mid-term review seems to be fruitful, the Member States appear to be cooperating, and I wish the most courageous Member States perseverance and the others courage of the conviction to make a start or to pick up pace.
We also have a responsibility as a European institution, of course, though, and in this connection I welcome the intentions, from both the Commission and the Council Presidency, to deal with the services directive swiftly and in this connection, to respect the difficult balance we have struck after much hard work in this House.
We are familiar with the nature and extent of the challenge Europe is facing.
We like to live well in Europe and we want to keep it that way, but in order to make our dream come true, in order to retain our level of prosperity and keep what we call our social model intact, we must become a competitive global player.
I cannot put it any better than did the German President yesterday: we must be all the better the more expensive we are.
We must translate our restlessness into creativity and we must have faith that only by changing can we retain the potential to realise our ambitions.
We know what we have to do.
Let us act accordingly on all fronts, for there is no other option.
Â Â  Mr President, the chairman of my group, the PSE Group, has spoken about the necessity for action now.
It is time for action.
I shall focus upon that.
We all know that we have slightly better economic growth, but 2.2% instead of 2.1% growth a year as an average is not creating enough employment to seriously bring down our unemployment of 19.5 million.
I therefore fundamentally agree with President Barroso and the President of the European Council. We need more growth.
I have two short questions. Number one: investment.
President of the Commission, do you envisage that at the forthcoming European Council meeting the governments can get together â perhaps we do not have the capacity and powers in the Treaty to force them â to make a sort of intergovernmental agreement to decide to invest in the next two to three years in the goals you have recommended in your papers and recommendations?
If you could envisage that, I would be happy because then we will have taken a step towards coordinated investment action.
Secondly, I was happy to see that the Employment Council took a decision on flexi-security on the basis of the proposals from the Commission.
President-in-Office, do you envisage that the conclusions will ensure not only flexibility, but also modern security?
In France I see a government which only focuses on flexibility and I have seen the reactions of the young people.
That is why it is so necessary that we ensure both.
I would like your response and if you could give us that response today it would be very timely and wise.
It is time to deliver and I hope that we will all join forces.
I will do what I can in the European Socialist Party and I know that my colleague, our group chairman, will do what he can to deliver, because it is now time and people expect us to do that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I want to offer a few general reflections on the whole Lisbon Agenda.
In my view, it is based on a misunderstanding of the way in which economies â and, for that matter, human civilisations â develop in the course of history.
There was a period in history â beginning at the end of the eighteenth century and continuing through the nineteenth - when Europe became the worldâs most dynamic knowledge-based region.
It began with changes in the United Kingdom, including legislation on economic issues and the abolition of the guild system.
Huge and rapid progress was made, which spread incredibly quickly to large parts of the world.
Other countries too began to use steam engines and the spinning jenny.
That is how development proceeds.
The idea that there might today exist unusually wise people who know in detail what measures European countries should take in order to help Europe develop into a dynamic knowledge-based region is quite wrong.
It is the countries themselves that try to find their way towards solutions, keeping an eagle eye on each other and copying constructive solutions.
That is how development proceeds.
To go on as we are doing now will set us thinking in the wrong way.
We should occupy ourselves with proper issues in the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the next spring European Council will have to respond to the challenges of our time, including those presented by the environment and by energy policy. The expectations of our young people will have to be taken into account, and there will be a duty to recognise our ever growing number of older people.
All this presupposes the adaptation of our infrastructures. Our society is undergoing huge changes, and that is what worries people.
We need, therefore, to help them out by anticipating the difficulties of the next few decades.
The all-encompassing welfare state of the Eighties is no longer the answer.
We have to reconcile flexibility and security, to find other ways of according priority to employment and to give our fellow citizens their confidence back â confidence in their politics and in a Europe that is getting its act together.
It is a confidence that would spontaneously give a boost to growth, as well as to the birth rate, which is a good barometer of the state of our society.
It is a confidence that would lead to immigration being considered a great opportunity and that, instead of hampering private initiative, would free it up and encourage and support it. This restored confidence would enable us to train our researchers better and then to keep hold of them.
It is in the interests of a more successfully knowledge-based society that we should do these things, although, in view of what is happening with Erasmus, there is genuine reason to be worried about the prospects for such a society.
Finally, this is a Europe that would be without taboos and that would therefore dare to talk in terms of nuclear power and of independence where energy sources are concerned.
I could give many more examples of what it could do.
What is the point of speeches, however, without an appropriate budget?
We are now told, MrÂ Barroso, that a choice will have to be made between the trans-European networks and Galileo.
Is that possible?
No, it is not.
Galileo is needed, and the internal market needs to be completed by means of better communications.
Allow me, moreover, to put in a word here for the Lyon-Turin rail link.
I do not, then, want this morning to be the umpteenth occasion for talking about the Lisbon Strategy.
Words, words, words âŠ It is time to translate words into action.
I would call on the Heads of Government to take their courage in both hands.
The Lisbon Strategy is the only antidote to the various forms of national protectionism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I shall use this brief minute to concentrate on an amendment by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in which we welcome the proposal by the Heads of Government of six countries that a European pact for equality between women and men be set up.
We propose measures in three areas.
We wish, firstly, to reduce the imbalance between the sexes in the labour market; secondly, to make it easier to combine gainful employment and parenthood; and, thirdly, to introduce an equality perspective, to be followed up in all policy areas.
The purpose of this equality pact is not to create a new process but to reinforce already existing processes, such as the Lisbon one, so that the objectives of sustainable growth, full employment and social justice become attainable.
The objectives in terms of child care and of being able to combine gainful employment and parenthood are particularly important.
Â Â  â Mr President, the meeting of the Council later this month will provide an opportunity for Member State governments to affirm the vital need for reform to proceed more rapidly than it has before.
On two issues I believe that the Council should speak clearly and forcefully in its conclusions.
In the light of the Commission document âTime to move up a gearâ, launched in January, this is certainly not a time for drivers to now run out of fuel.
I am delighted that MrÂ Barroso seems to be running on high-octane fuel and long may that continue, but the rising tide of protectionist rhetoric and protectionist actions by Member State governments is unacceptable.
It is extraordinary that the European Union should still have governments wedded to an outdated protectionist mentality and the promotion of economic and industrial patriotism.
I welcome the Commissionâs statements condemning that drift.
I welcome the recent comments of the German Economics Minister, who said that we do not need industrial patriotism and said that foreign investors should be welcomed with open arms, not just tolerated.
If the national reform plans submitted by governments are anything like those provided by the United Kingdom Government, then heaven help us.
The debate on protectionism goes to the heart of the debate on future economic development.
There is no room for the policies we have seen of late.
The time for diplomatic niceties has passed.
We must allow the voice of small and medium-sized businesses to be heard.
On the Services Directive, the compromise package agreed by Parliament must be improved upon by governments.
We have made progress, but not enough.
The Council should get its act together on the Doha Round and work harder towards world trade agreements.
I am afraid that at the moment the jury is out.
I urge the European Council to show the same vigour and determination as Mr Barroso.
I urge it to avoid the usual fudge at the meeting later this month and give some real leadership.
Then we can judge it on its resolve and we can then give our verdict.
Â Â  â Mr President, even MrÂ Poettering, in his opening statement today, finds himself obliged to criticise the Austrian Presidencyâs representation â specifically the absence of Chancellor SchÃŒssel â and it may well be the case that that absence has something to do with the fact that the news that the Austrian Presidency had to convey is very far from being either something to boast about or even adequate.
Such a thankless task is one that he is happy to leave to someone else.
The message is modest and inadequate in terms of the objectives, particularly of the intended reduction in unemployment, if we bear in mind just how much unemployment there is and what we originally intended that the Lisbon process should achieve; it is not merely modest and inadequate, but also false, in terms of the means to be applied â these goals, modest though they are, will not be achieved by structural reforms alone.
The EU and the Member States must get their hands on more money.
If you do not pay up, the band does not play â that, too, we learned from Mozart.
Â Â  Mr President, a competitive European economy as set by the Lisbon Agenda cannot be built upon insecure gas and oil deliveries.
It cannot be built on differentiated and uneven access to and security of energy supplies.
It is contrary to the logic of the single market and competition principles.
It is welcome, therefore, that security of energy supply constitutes one of the Presidencyâs and Commissionâs priorities.
It is high time that the Union undertook concrete action in this field.
Security of energy supply is crucial for the economic activity and competitiveness of the EU economy as a whole.
Energy, as we have witnessed recently, is also sometimes used as a weapon for exerting political influence.
Hence, it should also be considered within the context of foreign and security policy of the Union.
Recent problems with energy supply expose our weakness, vulnerability and dependence on third parties.
Therefore it is essential for the EU to develop a true energy security policy.
If we treat the internal market and the Lisbon Agenda seriously, we should endow our economic operators and citizens with equal access to and security of energy supplies.
Steps taken by the Presidency, and especially the Commissionâs Green Paper, are going in the right direction, although they are too modest.
Solidarity is one of the main principles of European integration; it creates an obligation to assist all those states that are in difficulty.
We must extend this principle of solidarity to problems related to energy supply shortages caused by political action.
What we need in securing external energy supplies is cooperation and solidarity, not competition between Member States.
Energy security also has a financial aspect: the biggest cutbacks in the Financial Perspective, as agreed by the Council, occurred in the field of trans-European energy networks.
We have to remedy that situation in the course of budgetary trialogue, otherwise our priorities will remain on paper.
Energy security also constitutes one of the cornerstones of the neighbourhood policy.
Close cooperation in the energy security field is indispensable and the most effective confidence-building measure, both within the European Union as well as between the Union and its neighbours.
Â Â  Mr President, there are three priorities for the spring summit â action, action, action: action on the fact that over a third of our working-age population is economically inactive, which is a disgrace.
You cannot embrace globalisation while abandoning large numbers of our citizens.
We need proactive labour markets.
We need to take action on the implementation of legislation: too many Member States are not implementing legislation they have agreed to and, frankly, that is a situation which is unacceptable.
Finally, 13 years after creating the single market, it is time we accepted that there is a European single market which demands European champions, not national champions.
So, let us see less of the talk of this summit and instead see many more plans for concrete action from Member States.
Deliver, do not talk!
Â Â  Mr President, this debate is about the spring summit and we have a fine resolution with splendid recommendations.
After all, the European public are still being promised more growth and more jobs, but let us not pull the wool over each otherâs eyes, for paper can wait.
When after the summit, next week, the Heads of Government return to their capitals, they must also take with them ownership of Lisbon, for it is the Member States, in tandem with the social partners, national and regional politicians, who will ultimately bring about an increase in employment.
The message to the Member States is both simple and clear.
The internal market must become a reality, come what may.
More should be done in the area of research and development; innovation must be supported and education and training must be organised on a more efficient and better-quality footing.
The Lisbon Strategy also has a social dimension, though.
We will not become competitive if we reduce our principles and values on solidarity with the weakest, our citizensâ own responsibility, social justice or wages to such a level that we start to compete with our Asian competitors.
That is not the European answer that will inspire public confidence.
Reforms are necessary, though.
Demographic change, in the shape of an ageing population and a declining birth rate, must be addressed.
We should summon up the nerve to scrutinise the ways in which social security systems are funded, for the demographic reality is drawing nearer at ever-increasing speed.
There is no point in pondering an entrepreneur-friendly climate or lifelong learning, if we fail to deliver.
There is work to be done.
We have arranged the European structural programmes in such a way as to ensure that three quarters, or 55Â billion, will contribute to the Lisbon objectives, and if the funds for those programmes are lacking, or if the Member States are not prepared to pay up, then I have to conclude that growth and employment in line with Lisbon will not be achieved.
As far as the ageing population and the declining numbers of young people are concerned, we will need to adjust social security and employment policy in such a way that active young people and fit elderly people can make their contributions to society in the near future, to prosperity and happiness for our citizens.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to talk about two of the issues which I regard as highly important to fulfilling the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, or in other words growth and employment.
The first of these is the completion of the single internal market.
It seems that the concept of the four freedoms underpinning the European Union is something that, sadly, often exists only on paper.
We took a very important step here last month with the first reading of the Services Directive.
I firmly believe that this was a step in the right direction, but I would like to say something about the free movement of persons.
The report from the European Commission, which has already been mentioned here, stresses that labour mobility, not only between the new and old Member States, but also within the âoldâ EU, is still insufficient.
And yet it is precisely this mobility upon which economic growth relies.
The second of these issues is the approval of the Financial Perspective.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we do not have the Financial Perspective by the middle of the year, Europe will face a crisis.
An economic crisis, a political crisis and also, I fear, a crisis of confidence.
I would therefore call on all three institutions to work hard at this issue so that the Financial Perspective will be, so to speak, âhome and dryâ by the end of June, or in other words by the end of the Austrian Presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I would like to thank President Abbas for giving me this unexpected opportunity to contribute to this debate.
I thank Lisbon for giving us the Agenda, and the son of Lisbon on the Commission front bench for his leadership of that Agenda.
There is nothing more important to Europe than to ensure that the Lisbon Agenda succeeds.
That is the way to give our people new hope that Europe will contribute to their futures and that we can cooperate together to give new hope to other parts of the world as well.
I want to highlight two aspects of the Agenda highlighted in this resolution.
The first is the health of the people of Europe, because I believe that is a prerequisite of Lisbon.
Without healthy people you do not have a healthy economy.
It is important that we look first at some of the health threats that we are facing, including the possibility of a flu pandemic, and at health opportunities such as those now arising from patient mobility, and see these as part of the Agenda.
As my colleagues have said, we need to look at the ageing population to ensure that ageing is an opportunity, and not just a burden.
We need to see a healthy environment too as a prerequisite for our economy.
That too is not a threat.
The opportunities for business to innovate and meet the demands of the higher standards that we expect in our environment will stand them in good stead vis-Ã -vis the rest of the world.
We have the opportunity to lead the world on sustainability, on innovation, on eco-labelling and so forth, and I believe that is a challenge that the Commission must take up with Parliament.
Lastly, let me give credit and pay tribute to the Austrian Presidency for the work it has been doing in both these areas, in relation both to a healthy people and a healthy environment, because that will lead to the healthy economy that Lisbon can bring us all in the very near future.
Â Â  Mr President, on 15 March, Hungary remembers the fight for freedom and revolution of 1848.
Looking back, we can say that the lasting results of the revolution have been the change in the economic system, the freedom of people and the continuing competitiveness of the country.
Today, competition is no longer between nation-states, but between continents, at a global level.
Therefore, lasting competitiveness, too, must be created at this level.
The European Union needs a serious change in its economic philosophy.
We must, at last, switch from the outdated, unproductive competition between Member States to a European internal market ensuring the highest level of freedom and human dignity to its citizens.
The Lisbon Strategy is not only a five-ten year plan, but the foundation of our competitiveness and survival for the next 100-150 years.
In 1848, politicians understood the message of the times and spearheaded the change.
I ask the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Prime Ministers preparing for the spring summit to finally understand and implement the message of the 21st century.
This is what we, European citizens, expect of them.
Â Â  â ( Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in March 2000, European leaders decided on the shape of Europe in 2010.
They had understood that the actions of individual Member States would be even more effective if supported by joint action from their fellow Member States.
Today, the growing gap between European growth and that of the United States and Asia, as well as the ageing of the population, require the Lisbon Strategy to be implemented urgently in order to make up for lost time.
Moreover, it will be possible to achieve better results by adopting the additional measures and structural changes agreed within the European Union.
Timely intervention is needed in the sectors previously identified, in order to make Europe more attractive for researchers and scientists, to complete the internal market in order to permit the free movement of goods and capital, and to create a genuine single market for services.
In order to create a more favourable climate for companies, the recommendations of the European Employment Taskforce need to be implemented rapidly.
Individual Member States have made progress in some of these sectors, but none of them has obtained positive and lasting results.
To achieve its goals, Europe must show a far stronger commitment, even bringing pressure to bear on individual Member States.
The Member States must give up their old national habits and devote more resources to building Europe.
The citizens must be made to understand that todayâs sacrifices are tomorrowâs advantages.
The European Parliament is a key player in the strategy for growth and in the commitment to build the new Europe.
It therefore has to act increasingly as a stimulus for all parties interested in relaunching Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, we have obviously now driven ourselves into a corner of the Union.
The majority of the Member States are slowing down the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy for totally selfish reasons, and for short-sighted ones too.
Every week, for example, we lag badly behind the United States of America and Japan in terms of investment in information and communications technology.
At the same time, China and India are competing with us ever more fiercely.
We are completely stuck, and we are going nowhere.
The Nordic countries, however, have maintained peak levels of competitiveness, the welfare state and a large knowledge base.
That has happened now.
I would ask MrÂ Barroso, President of the European Commission, whether it is possible that you have the sort of southern temperament to pass this example on to those who are still afraid of the bold solutions which we adopted a long time ago.
It has not turned us upside down, and not even the cold winter has made us change direction.
In other words, it is possible; why should it not be?
Â Â  MrÂ President, when we discuss the Lisbon process, we can see how different countries are succeeding with it to greater or lesser degrees.
Those countries that have implemented reforms and changes are coping that much better with globalisation and managing to be that much more competitive.
Those that have not introduced reforms are faring less well.
What is remarkable, though, is how little has in actual fact happened at a common European level and the limited degree to which we have given new companies, services and markets more room to expand and products more scope for development.
The Commissionâs primary and overarching task is to combat the new protectionism we see developing among governments and politicians in Europe.
This new protectionism is directed against the new Member States and the world outside where the big future markets exist.
However, it is directed against the old Member States, too, in relations between which it is also increasingly to be found.
If the Lisbon process is to be managed successfully, the main task is that of combating this protectionism, which contravenes the Treaty and everything that European integration stands for.
Europe has fantastic potential, and where we have implemented reforms we have been successful.
Look, for example, at the telecommunications market, where we are most successful of all.
What the Commission must do is drive home the importance of safeguarding the free trade that is at the root of Europeâs prosperity.
It should be positive about globalisation, but it should, above all, be sure to implement measures leading to more new companies and new jobs.
It must be the results that count, and not the objectives.
Then, we shall be able to give Europe a new future.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Barroso, I wish to make just a couple of points.
In order to achieve the objectives of growth and job creation, gender mainstreaming in the Lisbon Strategy needs to be enhanced, especially in the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines.
We need to raise the rate of employment among women, develop an active ageing strategy and build a society characterised by lifelong learning.
The second point relates to the financial perspective.
There is an urgent need for an interinstitutional agreement.
There is no time to waste.
The Council, the Commission and Parliament must act quickly to reach agreement.
The citizens of Europe will not accept any more postponement.
The time has come to âLisboniseâ the EU and adopt a budget that will promote growth and more and better jobs for all, including women.
Without women, the Lisbon Strategy will not be a success.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I promise that I shall keep this as brief as possible.
Many important and interesting things have been said on this subject, and I can assure Mr Poettering and Mrs Berger that the Federal Chancellor, even though he is absent, is following very closely what your House has to say.
It goes without saying that what you have to say will have an important part to play in the preparations.
I would like to tell Mrs Berger that my being here today must not be taken as an indication of any lack of ambition; on the contrary, the Austrian Presidency has the ambition of joining with the Commission in achieving great things for the benefit of Europeâs citizens.
I can also tell Mr Schulz that we are of course well aware of the need to deploy the necessary financial resources.
We are not talking here only about European resources, but also about national resources, and their quality and efficiency are what matter; for we should not always consider only the quantity of resources, but should also take care that the right resources are deployed in the right place.
Mr Watson, I certainly agree with you that there are many subjects which the European Council ought to deal with, but with limited time not everything can be dealt with.
As to your reference to Metternich, I assure you that Metternich is not a role model for us.
His way of seeing Europe is not the way we see Europe.
We do not want a directory of five big countries that rule the rest.
Let us recall that he was the head of a police state, which we do not want either.
What I would like to tell Mrs Harms is that sustainability does of course play a major role in the European Union, and I can remind the House that the sustainability strategy is to be revised before mid-2006.
I can assure you that sustainability will also, of course, play a large part in everything that the Council and the Commission endeavour to do.
I also have something to say to Mr Bonde.
I would like to firmly repudiate the idea that those states that wish to exercise their sovereign rights by pressing on with the process of ratifying the constitutional treaty are acting illegally.
I would refer you to the decision of the June European Council, which, in ordering the period of reflection, also stated explicitly that the validity of continuing with the ratification process is not to be called into question.
I believe that the Council is going full steam ahead in order to achieve the goals we have set ourselves.
It might very well be, MrÂ Kirkhope, that the Council does not operate on high octane, unlike the President of the Commission.
Maybe we operate more on biofuel, in accordance with the spirit of our time.
Several speakers mentioned, in this context, the Commissionâs âbetter lawmakingâ initiative, and for this I would like to thank in particular Commissioner Verheugen, who is here with us today, and encourage him to press on with this initiative, for it is the sort of initiative that the public understand and that brings the European Union closer to them once more.
Mr Rasmussen and others mentioned the issue of âflexicurityâ, and I can confirm and emphasise that we are concerned here with flexibility through security as an overarching paradigm for reforms in the fields of labour law and social policy.
It goes without saying that the intention here is to achieve a balanced relationship between flexibility and security on the European labour markets.
Mr Titley, I agree with you that action is needed, because this will convince our citizens.
We, together with the Commission, are determined to take the right steps towards taking this action.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although âgrowthâ and âemploymentâ are the keywords of the Lisbon Strategy, it seems to me that they need again to be clarified.
When we, in twenty-first century Europe, use the term 'growth', we cannot be talking about any kind of growth other than that which is sustainable, socially defensible and environmentally responsible.
Anything else would mean that we had learned nothing from past decades, and I ask that that be taken to heart once and for all.
When the Commission talks about growth, it is talking in terms of sustainable growth, which involves environmental innovation, energy efficiency, competition for higher quality rather than for lower social standards, lower environmental standards or lower wages, so I hope that is now clear once and for all.
When we talk about jobs, we are not talking about just any old jobs, for we have come to recognise that the great social question of our time is whether we will, in amidst the storms of globalisation, succeed in making available sufficient well paid and skilled jobs.
That is the big issue with which we have to deal.
Our concern is not with just any old jobs; what matters is that they should be jobs that will last in times when competition is getting tougher.
The consequence of that in our present situation is that certain clear demands must be made of the Member States, which must be told quite firmly that the time for a change of course is now upon us.
Now is the time for us to take â and with all the determination we can muster â the step into the knowledge-based society.
We cannot afford any societies in Europe whose educational policies exclude rather than foster or discriminate against people rather than integrating them.
We need an education policy that makes the fullest possible use of this continentâs reserves of education.
We cannot afford social policies that, while allowing young women to get a good education, do not thereafter give them the chance to make something of it for lack of any compatibility between family life and working life, and we cannot afford social policies that simply spit older workers out of the production process because it is believed that they are no longer needed.
Today, none of these things is a viable proposition any longer, and our strategy makes that abundantly clear.
We also affirm that the European single market, a policy that faces up to international competition, is good for growth and employment, and it is for that reason that this Commission does not believe in economic patriotism of any kind whatever.
We wish to reiterate that those who want a big European internal market must also accept the fact that businesses are coming into being in order to operate in it without reference to borders.
If there is to be a European market, there must also be European enterprises.
The Commission notes with concern the renationalisation of economic thinking in some parts of the European Union and warns against it, for â as almost all speakers today have said â the right way is to address Europeâs problems together.
I also, though, have something to say to European businesses.
For years now, we have been pursuing a policy of improving conditions for European businesses, but what we expect of them now, at a time when the biggest of them are doing better than ever before, is that they should be aware of their responsibility for Europe as a business location.
Businesses are not only under an obligation to make short-term profits; they also have a responsibility for the site where they make them.
If a company undergoing structural change resorts to making staff redundant, then the primary responsibility for this does not lie with policymakers; on the contrary, we are dealing in such a case with a failure on the part of the business, for businesses can recognise in good time when structural change is going to become necessary and when it has to be set in motion, and we demand of European businesses that they do more to give structural change a positive outcome.
Laying staff off is always the worst way to handle it, and it is one to which they must not have recourse.
There is something else we must say to European businesses, however: It is that it is possible to grow by using high business profits to create new products, to develop new technologies and new capacities, rather than only to buy up other businesses.
I would like to point out â in the most friendly way possible â that all our experience with the buying-up of businesses over the past twenty years has shown, in the vast majority of cases, no positive effect on the business or on the economy as a whole.
I would prefer it if European companies were to use the huge profits they have made in recent times to invest in new research and production capacities in Europe rather than for funding campaigns to take over other businesses.
There is also something that members of parliaments need to do.
It has been complained, and quite rightly, that the general public have not been involved in developing the strategy for growth and employment.
That is a task for national policy-makers and national parliaments.
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to talk to your counterparts in the national parliaments in the countries from which you come, and get this issue put on the national policy agenda.
It is, after all, no part of the Commissionâs business to prompt opposition politicians in the Member States to do their jobs and to ensure that this issue is put on the agenda.
That is for parliamentarians to do, so I really do urge you to bring your influence to bear here, for only if we succeed in setting in motion a broad political debate in the Member States and their legislatures will we succeed in creating the necessary awareness of the need for a joint effort, not only by policymakers, but also on the part of the public, if our competitiveness is to be unimpaired.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to warmly thank Commissioner Verheugen for the speech he has just delivered, which was an excellent one.
With my headphones on, I was able to listen to it, although I have to say, Mr President, that if I had not used them I would scarcely have been able to understand it, the Houseâs loudspeakers notwithstanding.
There is no point in you, in your characteristically amicable way, speaking your own language into the microphone to tell the Members to sit down; the fact is that they will not understand you if what you say is not interpreted for them.
If you wanted to get them to sit down, you ought to have wielded the gavel.
I would just like to address a request to the House, and I do so as one of its own Members.
I do not think it is acceptable if we are unable to exercise the very minimum of courtesy and listen to those who address us.
Â Â  I hope that everyone here will treat what has been said seriously.
I accept the criticism and will therefore call Members to order either in a more widely-spoken EU language or using the gavel.
I have received two motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  Mr President, I just want to raise a small housekeeping point.
Some of us have received no e-mails since 11 Oâclock this morning, except through webmail.
I do not know how many this concerns, because there is more than one server.
However, one server is down and it was down for a while yesterday morning as well.
I believe this is a problem particularly related to Strasbourg, which, of course, is another joy of coming here.
Could you please ensure that the administration gives priority to solving this problem, which is deeply inconvenient?
Â Â  â We shall bear it in mind, Mrs Ludford.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it was specifically RuleÂ 140 of the European Parliamentâs Rules of Procedure to which I intended to refer.
This states that we are entitled to consult documents directly via Parliamentâs internal computer system.
I should like you to review the agreement with the private company that is supposed to provide this service.
It is in both our democratic and economic interests to do so.
Â Â  â Thank you very much.
We shall look into it.
Â Â  The spring meeting of the European Council looking at Europeâs economy takes place just at the moment of an outbreak of protectionism in a number of European Countries, especially France.
President Chirac often tries to portray France as a champion of European integration and blames other countries for any perceived lack of enthusiasm.
Yet Franceâs record of applying EU law is one of the worst, its attitude to trans-frontier mergers is obstructionist, it has deliberately failed to meet its obligations under the stability and growth pact and it has consistently slowed down the pace of CAP reform.
The European Council should be an opportunity for other Member States to press France to put its house in order.
Â Â  Themes linked to competitiveness and growth have always been at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy.
Today â and I want very much to say how excellent a development this is â the resolution on which we are to vote introduces the social dimension.
The resolution must not be regarded as extending the time it will take to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy as it will, for example, give all European Union nationals access to a high-level education and to lifelong learning. I would point out the importance of a European exchange programme for apprentices.
I should also like to emphasise the role played by small and medium-sized enterprises in achieving the Lisbon objectives. Such enterprises are among the main sources of tomorrowâs jobs.
We must therefore provide ourselves with the resources for removing the obstacles that stand in the way of these companies, particularly the smallest ones, and, over and above that, give them resources for innovation. Hence, the importance of an ambitious budget for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP).
As you will have appreciated, I deplore the lack of a budget to match the ambitions of the Lisbon Strategy and hope that we shall manage to improve the financial perspective with a view to remedying this situation.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I ask that the second part of the amendment be altered by removing the figure stated and substituting a wildcard.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I ask that the vote on the legislative resolution be adjourned pursuant to Rule 53(1) of the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, since the problem of global warming cannot be solved by the EU alone, my oral amendment seeks to enlarge the audience by adding the words âand the international communityâ after âEU and its Member Statesâ.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to table an amendment so as to clarify matters.
A fund designed to support workers affected by restructuring is going to be set up.
MrÂ Cottignyâs report refers to this as a growth adjustment fund, and I propose that, in order to avoid any confusion, we revert to the name used by the European Commission, that is to say a European globalisation adjustment fund.
Â Â  Mr President, my group would like to propose an oral amendment to this paragraph.
Our split vote concerns the deletion of the time-limit.
We would like instead to insert the words: âwhich should enter into force as soon as possibleâ. This is to conform to the wording which will be proposed in the 2004 discharge report, in paragraph 55.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wanted to take the floor initially to propose the withdrawal of Amendment 1, which has finally been rejected.
As regards Amendment 24, I should like to propose to our fellow Members from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that a word be changed via an oral amendment.
I should like to replace the term âeducationâ with âhigher educationâ because we are concerned here with cooperation between research, the private sector and higher education.
I believe I can say that I am tabling this oral amendment on behalf of MrÂ Lehne and MrÂ Lambsdorff, who is also in agreement.
âThat concludes voting time.
Â Â  . It is my view that the partnership between the European Community and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) on fishing in the FSM should be concluded in accordance with the proposal for a Council regulation.
The Western Pacific is one of the richest tuna fisheries in the world and scientific studies show that the current state of stocks is such that it can be extended to third countries.
The agreement provides for benefits for both sides, and safeguards a sustainable fisheries policy in the FSM.
Although I lend my backing to this fisheries agreement, I should like to draw attention to the excessive fees for longliner licences, which constitute a prohibitive burden for some shipowners.
Â Â  We are highly critical of the EUâs destructive fisheries agreements with third countries and thus regret the fact that the EU is choosing to conclude fisheries agreements with new countries.
A series of reports has shed light on the harmful consequences of such agreements for the coastal populations of the countries that conclude the agreements.
The agreements lead to over-exploitation of fishing waters, which hits the local populations.
Both the Commission and the overwhelming majority of the European Parliament choose, however, consistently to close their eyes to this criticism.
According to one of Parliamentâs opinions, the fishing agreement at issue may, moreover, have harmful environmental consequences.
At the same time as the EU recommends increased aid efforts, peopleâs taxes are used to finance fisheries agreements that militate against development.
This is neither a consistent nor credible policy.
We believe that the fisheries agreements should be phased out with a view to their eventually being cancelled.
Those EU Member States whose vessels operate in third countriesâ waters should be liable for the costs of the agreements.
Those same Member States should then decide independently whether they are to fund this expenditure by, in turn, levying charges in relation to their own particular fishing vessels.
Â Â  . In light of the reform of the common fisheries policy, it has become vitally important to update Regulation NoÂ 3690/93 of 20Â DecemberÂ 1993.
Information on fishing vessels must be brought into line with new rules on managing stock conservation, in order to ensure compliance with the key principle of âmanagement of fishing effortâ.
The amendments that are being proposed, such as the introduction of the Community Fishing Fleet Register number and the staggering of the fishing methods used by the vessel, are important elements not included in the original regulation.
The Commissionâs proposal and the amendments tabled by the rapporteur in his report are worthy of my support.
Â Â  We Moderates have chosen to vote in favour of the current report, but we regret the fact that the protection of fundamental rights has not been highlighted sufficiently at EU level and believe that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice should extend to individualsâ fundamental rights in relation also to issues concerning internal security.
Â Â  Thanks to MrsÂ Hazanâs own-initiative report on evaluation of the European arrest warrant, we can further increase the legal certainty enjoyed by our citizens.
The report points to improvements that have been made.
I wish, however, to emphasise the problems mentioned in the report that still constitute obstacles to guaranteeing legal certainty.
It is incredibly important for people arrested in connection with the European arrest warrant to be guaranteed legal aid and help in the form of translation and interpretation.
It is the responsibility of each Member State to solve this important problem that at present leads to human rights violations.
Â Â  This report shows that efforts are clearly being made to obtain increased cooperation within the area of criminal law.
The Council is called on to prohibit the Member States from reintroducing systematic verification of double criminality, as well as to integrate the European arrest warrant into the first pillar.
The report reveals major problems in implementing the arrest warrant.
The Member States have clearly shown that they wish to retain parts of the traditional extradition system.
Some countries have refused to enforce the arrest warrant against their own citizens, citing discrimination or the infringement of fundamental rights as grounds for not doing so.
Others have retained or reintroduced verification of double criminality.
The June List believes that these are clear signs that the Member States are safeguarding their sovereignty in the area of criminal law.
Few measures that can be taken against an individual are as far-reaching in their effects as legal proceedings or the requirement to serve a sentence.
That is why legal certainty must take precedence over the simplification and efficiency that, according to the report, the European arrest warrant brings about.
The June List rejects increased supranationalism and believes that this is an issue for the individual nations.
We have thus chosen to vote against the report.
Â Â  . As we pointed out in 2001, the Commission put forward proposals on the pretext of the fight against terrorism that advocated the supranationalisation of crucial aspects of justice, thereby sidestepping necessary cooperation between Member States and existing legal instruments such as extradition.
This was tantamount to an attack on the sovereignty of Member States and their duty to safeguard their citizensâ rights.
We said at the time that the European arrest warrant, which is aimed, , at removing the principle of double jeopardy, albeit to a limited extent, would be a Trojan horse that would lead us further along the supranational path.
The report before us confirms our criticisms.
It looks upon legal sovereignty as an obstacle and refers to the political authoritiesâ current âinterferenceâ in the extradition process, even on the grounds of respect for human rights.
It is significant that the German Constitutional Court has decided to annul the legislation transposing the European arrest warrant and that, in light of that decision, a number of Member States have returned to applying the extradition instruments.
The rapporteur criticises these decisions and supports the activation of the ââ referred to in ArticleÂ 42 of the EU Treaty, thus integrating the European arrest warrant in the first pillar.
Â Â  .Like the European immigration policies, the European arrest warrant is very dangerous and fraught with consequences for everyone.
It is concerned, in actual fact, as much with serious offences as with minor offences (terrorism, theft, deliberate damage, insulting behaviour in meetings, remarks considered racist and xenophobic and so on) and, in every instance, peopleâs rights are less protected than they were with the extradition procedure that previously existed and that, for its part, permitted the political power either to agree to, or refuse to, extradite a person.
The arrest warrant has today become an exclusively judicial procedure as a result, on the one hand, of the abolition of the administrative and political phase and, on the other, of the control exercised by the administrative jurisdictions.
This arrest warrant has been hastily created in response to the attacks of 11Â September, and, for the sake of protecting their media image rather than of being sensible and responsible, the EU Heads of State or Government have not hesitated to dispense with everyoneâs individual freedoms and rights of defence.
The European arrest warrant, which was devised by our Eurocrats ideally as a tool to protect the fundamental rights of the person, today appears in its true colours: as a tool of totalitarian repression, which is potentially dangerous for each and every one of us.
Â Â  . I welcome this report which attempts to evaluate the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), its effectiveness and the problems it has encountered since its adoption.
The EAW's role in strengthening judicial cooperation and mutual trust is extremely innovative and improves the Member States' ability to fight against organised crime and terrorism.
I agree with the recommendation that the Parliament should be more involved in the evaluation of the EAW and that fundamental rights in the context of the EAW need to be ensured in order to make sure EU citizens from different Member States do not experience any discrimination.
Â Â  â The European Arrest Warrant is yet another link in the chain of measures to complete the institutional network to safeguard the power of capital, within the framework of the Euro-unifying 'area of security and justice'.
It allows nationals of the Member States to be extradited and it basically abolishes the principle of double jeopardy and the facility for the political leadership to decide on the extradition of an individual, thereby reversing the basic principles and guarantees of protection of individual rights safeguarded under previous extradition law.
It restricts national sovereignty, in that it questions the right of each Member State to exercise criminal jurisdiction over its citizens, while at the same time touching on basic, constitutionally safeguarded personal rights and guarantees.
The report calls for even more reactionary changes to the European Arrest Warrant, by proposing that the abolition of double jeopardy be extended, that all rights of the political leadership to intervene in the extradition of individuals for reasons of national policy and expediency be abolished and that all judicial verification of the compatibility of the warrant with fundamental rights be abolished.
'Terrorism and organised crime' are being used by the European Parliament once again as the necessary pretext, in order to provide a more stable foundation for yet another means of restricting rights and freedoms, to be used against the grass-roots struggle and against all those fighting and contesting imperialism and the exploitative capitalist system.
Â Â  . It is quite incomprehensible that the Hazan report, as adopted by a large majority in this House today, should testify to such enthusiasm for the European Arrest Warrant.
What is most objectionable is that it recommends that the judge who is to execute the arrest warrant should ânot be required to systematically examine its compatibility with fundamental rightsâ.
In other respects, too, it is concerned to do away with control by judges.
This decision takes Europe further down a wrong track of opposition to fundamental rights.
If decisions, whether or not arrived at by courts, are to be mutually recognised in the absence of uniform standards, then fundamental rights in the European Union will lose out.
The fact is that the accused risk being mangled in the machinery of the quite totally different criminal law systems that exist in the European Union.
There is not the least hint in this report of the fact that individual states' â such as Germanyâs â attempts to incorporate the European Arrest Warrant into their laws have been rejected by their constitutional courts on the grounds of their plain unconstitutionality.
Despite that, the Member States are still being urged to âact without delay to take the measures needed to remove constitutional or legal obstacles to the application of the European Arrest Warrant to their own citizens.â
That means no more and no less than that the German legislators are being called upon to violate their own constitution in order to make it possible for the European Arrest Warrant to be enforced.
Â Â  . The positive aspect of the analysis of the European arrest warrant is that it addresses one of the most important judicial cooperation mechanisms in the EU, at a time when such cooperation is both increasingly necessary and increasingly more difficult.
Traditionally, the national authorities have not found it easy to share security-related information, and have had difficulty in cooperating on judicial matters.
The European arrest warrant goes against this particular grain by seeking to impose cooperation, which is vital, both from the point of view of increased security â it is the most effective way of preventing criminals from benefiting from the advantages of the freedom of movement â and from the point of view of greater legal certainty, which is a similarly fundamental asset.
That being said, it is unfortunate that Member States need reminding that they must take âthe appropriate measures so as to avoid any constitutional or legal obstacles to the application of the European Arrest Warrant to their nationalsâ.
We also wish to mention, with some pride, that Portugal was one of the first Member States to transpose the framework decision in question.
Â Â  .I abstained from voting on the GrÃ€ssle report aimed at reforming the Financial Regulation.
I believe that, instead of increasing the responsibility of the administrators, which would have meant having greater flexibility and clearer rules, Parliament is further adding to the complexity and bureaucracy.
All of that does not help to make Community action effective and does not result in the Unionâs funds being administered better.
I do not know of any other public, and least of all private, entity in which 40% of the workforce is involved in financial management and management control.
The Union will soon have more auditors than auditees.
Â Â  .A Financial Regulation is the same thing as a financial constitution.
It is therefore important.
We must reform this regulation, which is jamming Europeâs bureaucratic machinery, because it is the benchmark or expression of Europeâs pathologically proliferating bureaucracy.
If bulky manuals are needed in order to understand this Regulation, if a âhelpdeskâ is needed to come to the daily rescue of those officials who are lost in the maze of its procedures and if businesses, institutes, organisations, small farmers and Europeans cannot take advantage of all of the subsidies or participate in all of the markets, then it is quite simply because the Financial Regulation is based on the fundamental philosophical principle running throughout European integration: the smoke and mirrors principle which, in 1905, the Italian financier Puviani called the financial illusions principle and which consists of using complexity to hide the truth â the European truth in this case.
Â Â  . I fully support this resolution and urge the Football Association, and football clubs, to help end human trafficking and forced prostitution and prevent international sports events triggering dramatic increases in this horrific trade.
They must 'Show the red card to forced prostitution'.
They should work with the clubs to inform and educate the general public, and especially sports fans and supporters, about the scale of the problem of forced prostitution and trafficking in human being.
Up to 800Â 000 women are victims of trafficking every year, 100Â 000 of them in the European Union.
This is one of the most serious abuses of human rights in the world today.
Organised criminals are now preparing to exploit the World Cup.
Thousands of poor women will be lured to Germany by false promises of work, only to be forced into prostitution and a life of misery.
We need Europe-wide action and the involvement not just of the police and politicians but also of the Football Association, clubs, and the fans themselves.
I urge all fans attending the World Cup to be alert to this scandal and to report any suspicions of trafficking that they might have.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this resolution on forced prostitution, which recognises the reality of the situation in Germany and the need to take the opportunity presented by the World Cup to condemn the trafficking of human beings and prostitution.
We have always maintained, however, that forced prostitution is not the right term to use, as it suggests that there is such a thing as voluntary prostitution.
Of course, the fight against forced prostitution and the trafficking of human beings is very important, but it must not be forgotten that all prostitution is forced, even when there is no trafficking.
It is the result of poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, precarious and poorly paid employment, and the psychological pressure of the consumer society.
Prostitution is therefore always an attack on human rights, an attack on womenâs dignity and is tantamount to slavery.
It is appalling that attempts are made to market everything, including the female body.
Hence our struggle for social inclusion and for the rights of all women to dignity.
We also condemn all forms of trafficking of human beings and call for effective measures to guarantee all women and all human beings a dignified life.
Â Â  The distinction between legal and forced prostitution is an artificial distinction.
It is also hypocritical to condemn forced prostitution, because it stabilises and extends legal prostitution.
Whether prostitution is legal or forced, what is being sold is the human body, as a commodity subject to all the rules of the market.
The legislative framework regulating the rules of hygiene which must be complied with by registered prostitutes basically recognises prostitution as a profession and manages the problem.
Thus, in the face of this spiralling social phenomenon, prostitution is being legalised as a profession; in other words, it is being uncoupled from the social causes which produce and reproduce prostitution (unemployment, poverty, impoverishment and lack of social benefits).
In other words, the rot in the exploitative system is being concealed and exonerated, and it is rejecting its responsibilities and referring the problem to the individual sphere.
Prostitution cannot be called a profession or a free choice, because it is incompatible with the value and dignity of the human being, it is the most extreme form of attack on human rights.
Prostitution, when called a profession, goes on to the career guidance list, as an alternative to the unemployment which affects young women with such barbarity.
At the same time, it legalises investments in companies on the prostitution market, establishing the porn culture, and promotes the prostitution of young women.
We say no to all forms of prostitution.
Â Â  . I welcome this resolution, which, in preparation for the World Cup, attempts to put a stop to the dramatic increase in the demand for sexual services by protecting trafficked women who are the victims of organised crime.
The resolution stresses the need for an integrated Europe-wide campaign and therefore calls on Member States to launch and promote the âRed cardâ campaign in close cooperation with NGOs, the police, law enforcement agencies, churches and medical services.
As well as seeking to inform the general public, the resolution calls on the International Olympic Committee and sports associations, including FIFA, UEFA, the German Football Association and others, as well as sportsmen and sportswomen, to support the âRed cardâ campaign and roundly condemn trafficking in human beings and forced prostitution.
Â Â  . In voting for this resolution I am concerned that, in particular, the FIFA World Cup is producing a major and unacceptable increase in the trafficking of women.
In tackling those incidents, and in general, the Commission and others should ensure that the priority must be to tackle the gangs which force women into these situations, rather than 'softer options' of targeting often vulnerable women forced into sexual slavery.
Â Â  We support the resolution because we think it important to focus on measures to reduce the number of victims of human trafficking for the purposes of sexual slavery.
However, we take the view that the resolution should extend to include all prostitution.
The term âforced prostitutionâ might be interpreted as implying the existence of its opposite, so-called voluntary prostitution.
We believe that all prostitution is forced, for no woman chooses voluntarily to prostitute herself.
She is forced to do so for one or more of a variety of reasons, for example poverty and unemployment.
Above all, however, there are clear links between a woman choosing to prostitute herself and previous physical, psychological and/or sexual abuse.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the Fourth World Water Forum to be held in Mexico City from 16 to 22Â March 2006 because I believe that water is one of the key elements of our fellow citizensâ well being and of world peace.
The European Union must rise to this global challenge, which consists of giving human beings access to this precious natural resource that is water.
We have a collective responsibility to monitor this issue, which affects the fundamental rights of human beings, animals and plants.
At the same time, I wonder whether the time has not come to examine whether the Union should reflect on an extensive European water policy in order to guarantee EU citizens, wherever they find themselves on EU territory, a sustainable and renewable supply of sufficient quality and quantity.
I believe that the Commission should anticipate submitting to the European Parliament and the European Council the report provided for in Article 18(1) of Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23Â October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy.
Â Â  Nature provides water free of charge; water belongs to everyone and everyone must have access to it.
It cannot be a commodity for the profitability of capital, because access to water is a fundamental right, closely connected with health, environmental protection, development and the quality of life.
The management of water resources must be the sole responsibility of the state, so there can be a universal supply of good quality water at an affordable price.
The Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico will basically take place under the aegis of the World Bank and its class policy; in other words, its policy of privatising water supply systems, which means a lack of drinking water for the poor, grass-roots classes and new profits for capital.
The ÎU is promoting the policy of liberalising services within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
It agreed on services (GATS) with the other imperialist centres during WTO negotiations.
The privatisation and destruction of forests and mountain massifs, which are important water storage areas, comes within the philosophy of profitability, which holds basic human needs in contempt.
We MEPs of the Kommounistiko Komma Elladas express our opposition to the Fourth World Water Forum because, in the face of profit, basic human needs are being held in contempt.
We call on the working class and the grass roots to fight to overturn the barbaric, anti-grass roots plans of their exploiters.
Â Â  â Mr President, in times when dividends and profits are rising, and managersâ salaries with them, the jobs available are doing the opposite and decreasing in number.
Looking at Europe as a whole, as many jobs are hit by restructuring as by insolvency.
In Austria alone in recent years, between 15Â 000 and 20Â 000 jobs are estimated to have been lost to the new Member States.
Restructuring is a panacea enabling todayâs businesses to depict themselves to the world as success stories, on paper at any rate.
There has been even more restructuring in the public services than in the private sector, not least in response to guidelines from the EU.
It is now coming to be realised that there is often a high price to be paid for economy measures, in the shape of lost quality, know-how, competence, staff motivation and strategic potential.
Despite the great risk of failure if restructuring is used as a substitute for a clear strategy, this is a trend that the EUâs privatisation guidelines and preferential treatment for subsidy tourism has positively encouraged.
It is high time that it faced up to its responsibility and desisted from further enlargements, to which these developments are in part attributable, and got back to being more concerned about social justice.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the report on restructuring and employment because we must continually prove to our fellow citizens that the European Union is the source of solutions with regard to todayâs profound economic and social changes, and not the cause of problems.
The seriousness of the economic and social issues linked to restructuring, and particularly industrial restructuring, requires a strong European policy aimed at reconciling the necessary changes with the Unionâs competitiveness.
I welcome the proposal to set up a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
There was a growing need to be able to reconcile, on the one hand, the inevitable industrial restructuring processes linked to the economic changes with, on the other hand, the protection of the main victims that are the redundant workers and the economic activities that depend on the restructured sectors, foremost among which are sub-contractors.
Finally, I totally support the idea of having the European Union step in to help those regions that, after having gone through restructuring processes, must move into new economic areas.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on restructuring and employment, which proposes financial resources, an enhanced role for the social partners and tools for analysing and anticipating restructuring.
Businesses are restructured for various reasons, sometimes for the purpose of defending them and sometimes in order to make them more combative, but the process always has the same effects on employees, who are the adjustment variable where the strategies of industrial groups are concerned.
It is commendable and necessary that the European Union should be looking into this problem with the aim of anticipating the consequences of restructuring for employees, but it is the EUâs duty to establish an economic and industrial policy that is dynamic and concerned with preserving and creating jobs for Europeans, as well as social and territorial cohesion.
I regret, therefore, that the EU itself encourages competition among the Member States by allowing social and fiscal dumping to prevail.
Â Â  .Industrial restructuring is a long-standing and permanent phenomenon, which results from technical progress and improved productivity.
Restructuring often cannot be avoided if competitiveness, and hence long-term employment, is to be maintained.
It always has a high social cost, particularly in regions housing traditional industries in which employees who are poorly qualified and not particularly mobile have difficulty in changing occupation.
The social consequences of restructuring must therefore be alleviated.
That is why I voted very firmly in favour of the Cottigny report on restructuring and employment.
I sincerely hope that its proposals are taken up by the Council and the Commission and that they result in practical measures.
The European Union should adapt its responses, enhance the role of both sides of industry and put in place tools designed more successfully to anticipate restructuring.
Increased attention to SMEs, the creation of a globalisation adjustment fund, the right to lifelong learning and so on are all measures that should enable us to show the people that the European Union is aware of their concerns and that it is as anxious as they are to obtain genuine social cohesion.
Â Â  In the report on restructuring and employment, the rapporteur, MrÂ Cottigny, adopts the same unfortunate attitude also present in the report on relocation in the context of regional development, which we voted on yesterday.
We voted against such economic protectionism yesterday and are doing the same today.
Once again, it is our firm view that it really is not for the state or the EU to tell companies how to engage in restructuring.
That being said, we obviously must not put our heads in the sand and pretend that the restructuring and relocation of companies does not in some cases affect people and basic social conditions in the area affected.
We support the demand for closer dialogue between the social partners where these issues are concerned, but we can counter the harmful effects of restructuring and relocation in ways other than that of preventing the private sector from developing.
Instead, we should invest our energies in improving the basic conditions in which a greater number of long-term jobs might be created by more companies.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on restructuring and employment, which proposes financial resources and an enhanced role for the social partners, as well as tools for analysing and anticipating restructuring.
Businesses are restructured for various reasons, sometimes for the purpose of defending them and sometimes in order to make them more combative, but the process always has the same effects on employees, namely that they become the adjustment variable where the strategies of industrial groups are concerned.
It is commendable and necessary that the European Union should be looking into this problem with the aim of anticipating the consequences of restructuring for employees, but it is the European Unionâs duty to establish an economic and industrial policy that is dynamic and concerned with preserving and creating jobs for Europeans, as well as social and territorial cohesion.
I regret, therefore, that the European Union itself encourages competition among the Member States by leaving the path clear for social and fiscal dumping.
Â Â  .This afternoon, I will be in the town of Le Syndicat in the department of Vosges.
An event is taking place there that symbolises the consequences of the policies laid down in Brussels.
The SEB group is going to close a production unit in the town, since competition from low-price Chinese imports has become intolerable.
More than 400 employees are out of a job, and that is without mentioning the subcontractors who are losing one of their main customers and who will also have to lay people off.
This is a labour market area that is devastated by unemployment.
Nevertheless, the SEB group is doing well.
Its profits are growing.
It is setting up overseas and buying up brands and so on, but it is closing down factories in France.
That is because, caught between bureaucratic and financial constraints â stemming directly or indirectly from Europe - and the unfettered global competition negotiated by the EU, it has no other option.
It is not SEB that has established the rules of the game; it is Brussels.
In an attempt to curb the logical outcome of European competition policies (restructuring, relocation and so on), the Cottigny report now proposes a list of bureaucratic measures that will not solve the problem, but rather will accentuate it and cause it to develop more quickly.
The entire rationale must be changed, starting with the cult of âfreeâ competition coupled with the proliferation of regulatory and fiscal constraints.
The job market would gain from this being done.
Â Â  . The EU has for a long time taken political measures to cope with restructuring within different sectors.
This report contains some constructive proposed changes to these measures whereby, for example, resources paid out from Community funds would be monitored more efficiently and such funds not used for relocation within the EU.
The June Listâs basic attitude is that the consequences of relocation and restructuring are a matter for the individual nations.
We do not believe that the EU should take measures to ensure that companies accept liability for such consequences.
Important issues of this kind must be decided on in the Member States.
The European Parliament wishes, among other things:
â to establish criteria governing the conditions under which it shall be permitted to carry out restructuring (in order to save jobs and increase competitiveness and not purely, for example, for the purpose of making a profit);
â to set up a special âgrowth adjustmentâ fund;
â to have the EU accept responsibility for the âhidden effectsâ of restructuring, such as the consequences for workersâ health, psychological problems among workers and increased mortality among those who are dismissed;
â to bring about equity participation by employees so that they might then participate in decisions concerning restructuring;
â and to take a dim view of Member Statesâ requiring workers to take early retirement as a consequence of restructuring.
No matter what political views are taken in relation to the aforesaid issues, they are issues to be dealt with by the individual nations.
We have thus chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  The Lisbon âstrategyâ, which is supposed to offer us a brilliant future, will be a bitter failure, and a few extra funds by way of support are not going to save the casualties of an industrial sector that, in my region of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, has seen its jobs destroyed for nothing.
This is a sacrifice that will not have enabled economic and social prosperity to be exported elsewhere in the world.
Not only do we not need charity, but we do not need yet another interventionist report designed to correct the bad habits of the European Commission.
The destruction of jobs in France and in an enlarged Europe will continue, despite our churning out tonnes of paper, which only express our powerlessness and our submission to the rules of unfettered globalisation and of the ultraliberal approach of zealous Europhiles.
Europe is also suffering from a kind of neo-Marxism favouring more state interventionism, thus adding European bureaucracy to our national bureaucracy, which is already characterised by its administrative red tape and overwhelming emphasis on taxation.
The driving forces of our economy are fleeing, only to be replaced by immigration on a huge scale, the negative contribution of which is an unbearable economic and social burden.
We need economic nationalism, the re-establishment of customs and tariff barriers, Community preference in Europe and protection and national preference in France.
Â Â  . â I have voted in favour of the Cottigny report following the achievement of a sufficient majority for amendments tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which incorporated proposals I had made in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
The restructuring of businesses needs to be seen in a nuanced light.
On the one hand, the relocation of businesses to cheaper sites abroad results in a collision between different enterprise cultures, with the loss of the synergy effects that this is often said to bring about and workers â including those at management level â losing out.
On the other, restructuring is necessary whenever businesses need to respond to the demands of new markets, the proximity of customers and the need to become more competitive.
In order that workers in the EU may be better prepared to be as mobile as they will need to be, they need adequate support in further training and retraining and to be involved in lifelong learning programmes.
It is SMEs that should benefit most from restructuring aid, which must be in line with the Lisbon objectives.
For the purpose of determining whether or not subsidies are lawful, it must become easier to trace funds back to their source and thereby facilitate the recovery of wrongly-obtained funding.
Since the structural funds we have at present are inadequate, I welcome the creation, as an expression of our solidarity, of a special fund, amounting to EURÂ 500 million per annum, for retraining and help with switching jobs.
There remains, however, the need for discussion of its criteria, since it is envisaged that it will operate only in the case of relocations to non-EU states and where a given business makes more than 1Â 000 workers redundant.
Administering it must not result in the creation of new bureaucracy within the European Commission or in the authorities at national level.
Â Â  . I welcome the report written in response to the Commissionâs communication on restructuring and employment.
The report agrees that restructuring is not necessarily synonymous with social decline provided that such measures are correctly anticipated and managed through good collaboration between the affected firms and trade unions, plus a suitable training policy for workers.
It calls for support to be given to SMEs and proposes that the financial programmes under discussion for 2007-2013 should be geared more closely to anticipating and managing restructuring.
To prevent âsubsidy tourismâ, the report argues that firms subsidised from EU funds should not receive any further Community aid for a given period of time if they relocate part or all of their activities within the EU.
Â Â  . I voted for the Cottigny report on restructuring and employment.
I voted for paragraph 9, part 2, on the endowment of the globalisation and adjustment fund by businesses as this is a voluntary donation.
Â Â  . Globalisation is not simply a process of drawing closer together, reducing distances and maximising scale; it is also a process of speeding up.
These days, everything is about movement and everything moves faster.
It is therefore understandable that some people are apprehensive about the high-speed nature of modern times.
The end of a cycle, the dismantling of a model, a break with the past; this is always a time of crisis.
It is clearly unlikely that the victims of these processes would believe in the virtues of 'creative destruction'.
This, however, is as real as destruction itself.
I make these remarks in response to the Cottigny report on restructuring and employment, which falls down precisely because it is out of tune with reality.
Social structures, especially public ones, must be ready for the impact of the transformations that this time of economic revolution is set to bring.
After all, we cannot turn our backs on those who have been excluded from progress.
Then again, nor does it strike me as desirable to reverse the process entirely.
Our objective should consist of endeavouring to make the most of this time for our economies and for our citizens, and this is the project on which our efforts should be concentrated.
Â Â  The report is constructive in the main and sheds light on many of the problems entailed in an economy geared to short-term speculation.
I am therefore voting in favour of it.
However, the report refers in positive terms to the fund that the Commission wishes to set up.
This fund would involve direct payments to individuals and be the start of a process whereby the EU would assume power over social policy, which would be an unfortunate development.
If this fund were to be introduced, it would however be helpful if private capital were used to finance a fair share of it.
I am voting against new EU directives on labour legislation in relation to restructuring because this would undermine the Swedish model of collective agreements between the social partners.
Â Â  â ( Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mrs Bauerâs report on social protection and social inclusion and I should like to ask a question to the European Council â that is, to the 25 Heads of State or Government â to which I hope they will reply: why are pensions constantly falling in value and increasingly proving inadequate for subsistence?
The reforms that the 25 Heads of State or Government are pushing through are designed to pay ever smaller pensions to our retired population.
In Italy alone, by 2050, young people will receive a pension of only one third of their final salary.
I want to send this DVD recording of my voice to the 27 Heads of State or Government, who I hope will clearly say what they intend to do.
Perhaps abolish the status of retired citizens or provide for the survival of those who have worked in the past but are now too old to do so.
Â Â  This report contains a long list of exhortations to the Member States concerning the action they should take to deal with relative poverty in the individual Member States.
There are obviously good reasons for the Member States to cooperate on issues of this type by, for example, voluntarily sharing experiences and best practice.
Social integration and poverty are, however, issues that must be dealt with nationally or through voluntary cooperation between the governments of the Member States.
It is difficult to see what added value or specific competence the European Parliament is contributing by churning out opinions on these and similar issues.
The report contains proposals to the effect that:
â the Member States should increase the opportunities for lifelong learning (paragraph 11);
â the Member States should provide access to affordable, good quality care services for children (paragraph 24);
â the Member Statesâ pensions systems should be reformed so as to guarantee social justice to the greatest possible extent (paragraph 44);
â reforms of public pension systems in the Member States should not lead to an increase in the total tax burden on labour (paragraph 45);
The June List recommends that important issues such as those referred to above be resolved by means of broad national debates, whereupon the Member States should, either independently or by cooperating voluntarily with other relevant players, use the ordinary democratic channels to decide on suitable legislation and other appropriate measures.
We have thus voted against this report.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs report on social protection and social inclusion confirms that Member States are stepping up their efforts to combat poverty and to ensure that pension schemes remain capable of delivering adequate incomes for pensioners.
The report points out, however, that more than 68 million or 15% of the EU population were living at risk of poverty in 2002.
In spite of significant structural improvements in the labour market in the EU, employment and participation remain inadequate.
Unemployment remains high in a number of Member States, particularly among the young, older workers and women.
Labour market exclusion has a national but also a local and regional dimension, according to the report.
I wholeheartedly back the Bauer report, which commends the measures put forward by the Commission aimed at helping the Member States to recognise the difficulties facing people at a disadvantage and to support the integration of such people, to boost job creation, training and career development, the reconciliation of professional and family life and the right to equal access to healthcare and decent accommodation, and to ensure the sustainability of social protection systems.
Â Â  . I welcome this report which focuses on a number of key policy priorities including: increasing labour market participation; modernising social protection systems; tackling disadvantages in education and training; eliminating child poverty; ensuring decent accommodation; improving housing standards and addressing the lack of social housing for vulnerable groups; improving access to quality services such as health and long-term care services, social services and transport; and overcoming discrimination and increasing the integration of ethnic minorities and immigrants.
Â Â  In the final vote, we have chosen to vote in favour of the guidelines for the 2007 budget procedure, in spite of our having serious objections where two points are concerned.
We are opposed to the devising of a statute for Membersâ assistants, who would then be in danger of living under quite different conditions than the people with whom they have to work closely in the constituencies.
There would also be a significant risk of the profession of Memberâs assistant becoming a distinctive lifelong career.
We are also opposed to setting up a Centre of European Houses in Brussels for the purpose of conducting a policy for providing information about the EU.
Â Â  .I voted against the Grech report, because I do not agree with questioning the establishment of the European Parliamentâs headquarters in Strasbourg and the establishment of Luxembourg as a place of work.
Â Â  . I am voting for the Grech report.
I voted for both parts of Article 47, because I believe there should be a statute for Membersâ assistants by 2009.
Â Â  We welcome the introduction of more environmentally friendly fishing methods.
We are not, however, in favour of the proposal that the EU should introduce a system of support and compensation for professional fishermen affected for the worse by such methods.
The report makes no mention of any particular sum by way of compensation.
Nor does it state from which budget item such compensation should be taken.
We are in favour of fishermen and their representative associations being involved in determining measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild depleted stocks (Amendment 1).
We are not, however, in favour of the proposal that the suggested compensation measures for fishermen be funded by the Community (Amendment 2).
We disapprove of further budgetary expenditure within the EU and have chosen to vote against this report in its entirety.
Â Â  . Following the previous debate, we welcome the support of the Commissioner for Fisheries, Mr Borg, for the amendment that we tabled, which stated that decentralisation and co-management are two principles that are fundamental both in guaranteeing the involvement of fishermen and their representative associations in measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild depleted fish stocks, but also in guaranteeing the effectiveness of such measures, bearing in mind that it is the fishermen and their associations who will be applying such measures, who have first-hand knowledge of the state of resources and who are most concerned to ensure their preservation.
We also note his openness to considering our proposed amendment, which calls on the Commission to propose socio-economic compensation measures, with the guaranteed Community funding, for plans to rebuild depleted fish stocks.
The majority in Parliament has inexplicably rejected these proposals, which is something we regret.
Â Â  . A sustainable fisheries sector based on the very latest scientific and technological research is crucial if we are to meet one of the EUâs main objectives, namely an exploitation of living marine resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions.
This Commission communication is a step in the right direction, playing a stronger role in promoting the ecologically sustainable management of fisheries.
I should like to reiterate the importance of these measures for fishermen; making any economic activity more environmentally-friendly is in their interest because it would guarantee healthy fish stocks to them.
Given that these measures could have a significant socio-economic impact in the short term, the interested parties should be involved in the planned reforms and we should look into ways of compensating fishermen adversely affected, in the short and medium term, by environmentally-friendly fishing.
In light of the points I have mentioned, I feel that the content of the communication before us makes a relevant and significant contribution towards building a positive future, for those whose livelihoods depend on fisheries and for environmental protection.
Â Â  .I naturally voted in favour of this report, which encourages fishing methods that are more respectful of the environment.
The priority today is to achieve a reduction in the intensity of fishing activity in order to allow stocks to replenish.
This is a sensitive subject, we know, but it is urgent.
46% of the 28Â 000 species of fish surveyed in the world are threatened.
Furthermore, the United Nations programme for the assessment of ecosystems stresses that 25% of commercial species are over-exploited.
We must clearly take account of socio-economic imperatives and not penalise the fishing sector, which is already subject to excessive constraints.
Reducing fishing activity is acceptable if it is linked to compensations.
However, other measures may provide significant results, such as strengthening the fight against pollution from ships or promoting sustainable fishing methods.
The sustainability of fisheries resources is an essential objective, and that is the principle upon which my opinion report on the Commissionâs communication on a Community approach towards the eco-labelling of fisheries products is based.
Â Â  . I support the goal of modernising the European economy through the Lisbon partnership for growth and employment.
I accept that this strategy also has to be seen in the wider context of sustainable development requirements - that our current needs have to be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Undoubtedly Europe has the resources to sustain our high living standards, but we need to take action to unlock them.
I would like it to be on the record that while I support the overall objective of Parliament's resolution on the Spring Summit 2006, I do not support amendments which state that nuclear energy is a viable alternative to Europe's current energy dependency.
Ireland in no way supports the use of nuclear energy.
Â Â  . Almost a year has passed since the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, agreed by the Spring European Council last March.
In its Annual Interim Report on the Lisbon Strategy published on 25Â January ahead of the next Spring European Council, the Commission says that although it recognises the significant progress made since then, the priority is now to produce results and the time has come to speed up the reforms.
Accordingly, it has identified four priority areas for action, whereby EU Heads of State or Government must commit themselves to taking the following specific additional measures, at national and European level: greater investment in education and innovation; unlocking business potential, especially SMEs; responding to the challenges of globalisation and the ageing of the population; and setting the wheels of an affective, integrated European energy policy in motion.
The motion for a resolution before us offers comments and suggestions on the four priority action areas, which I wholeheartedly support.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  . Although I am disappointed that the resolution that we tabled was rejected, it is worth pointing out that some 100 Members of the House either voted in favour (79) or abstained (20), which is more than double the number of members of our group and indeed more than the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance put together.
It was similarly significant that an even bigger number refused to vote for the joint resolution, which was nevertheless adopted by the majority.
Experience has taught us that the open coordination method provided for in the Lisbon Strategy has not reduced poverty.
As a result of the Lisbon Strategy, the priorities have been liberalisation and privatisation of public sectors and services.
Given that poverty is a violation of human rights, greater attention must be paid to its causes.
Accordingly, the necessary measures must be taken to promote social inclusion, as viewed from a multidisciplinary perspective.
We therefore advocate replacing the Stability and Growth Pact with a genuine development and progress pact, and the Lisbon Strategy with a proper economic and social cohesion strategy.
In turn, we believe that the accent should not be placed on the proposal for a directive on the creation of the internal market for services.
Â Â  . I will be supporting this resolution, along with my colleagues in the Socialist Group and the Labour delegation, but nevertheless I must point out a key omission in the section on energy policy, namely tidal power.
Global warming pushes us away from conventional power, while safety and security concerns threaten nuclear power.
The gap can be filled with renewables only with great difficulty, whether solar, wind or biofuels.
The one opportunity that is being neglected is tidal power.
The French built the power station across La Ranche estuary demonstrating the technology; in the UK both the Mersey, on a small scale, and the Severn, on a massive scale, are suitable sites.
The Severn scheme alone could supply nearly 10% of Britain's energy needs.
Why are we neglecting 'big' renewables in favour of covering our hillsides with windmills and our roofs with solar panels?
Â Â  . â As a general rule, this Parliamentâs resolutions on the preparations for European Councils consist of a litany of desiderata to the governments and the Commission.
What they have in common is that they never point out that the difficulties being experienced by our countries are caused by European integration, and always call for more interference by Brussels in the policies of the Member States.
Salvation cannot come from the Europe of Brussels, because the majority of the problems mentioned in this text come from there.
For example, we are now at a point where the problems resulting from the liberalisation of the internal energy market â which Brussels wanted and which was based upon the sole and sacrosanct principle of competition â are prompting Members of Parliament to call for a common energy policy, even a single policy. This field of action is not provided for in the Treaties, however, and there is good for reason for that: the opposition of the governments, which are aware of the strategic importance of this sector and of their diverging interests.
The general impression is that European integration, as it stands today, is an end in itself and that it feeds off the negative consequences of its own mistakes.
We must put an end to this vicious circle.
Â Â  In this resolution, the European Parliament enters into areas that it is for the parliaments of the Member States to attend to in order to achieve the agreed European targets concerning increased growth and employment.
The basis of the Lisbon Strategy is that the Member States should implement what has been agreed on.
The Lisbon Strategy must not be used as an argument for constantly demanding increased appropriations to the EUâs budget.
The June List believes instead that the respective Member Statesâ budgets must make provision for the Lisbon Strategy.
ParagraphÂ 3 of the resolution states that the EUâs budget must be increased if the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy are to be achieved.
For that reason, we are choosing to vote against the resolution.
The resolution contains many positive proposals but is based on the EU having a financial perspective that we do not support.
Responsibility for implementing the Lisbon Strategy lies with the Member States, which is why it is important for their contributions to the EU not to be increased.
Rather, they should have scope themselves for taking care of what is required by the Lisbon Strategy.
We have therefore voted against the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
Â Â  . What will take place on 16 and 17 March could be termed the employersâ general assembly, and it is no coincidence that it has been scheduled for shortly before the European Council.
It will be attended by the Austrian Chancellor and President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Commission and the Commissioners, along with the big guns from business, industry, the environment, research and the media, not to mention government representatives from the so-called national reform programmes.
The captains of industry will set out their wish list calling for the implementation of the so-called structural reforms, which is a euphemism for the politics of the Right, the true meaning of which is well known to the workers: that is, more precarious work, lower salaries, longer working life and working hours, later pensionable age, the dismantling and subsequent liberalisation and privatisation of public services, with the accent on energy and communications, social security, health and education, and research, with exploitation, unemployment and poverty following in its wake.
The majority in Parliament has joined forces to adopt this agenda, although we voted against.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues fully support all measures within the Lisbon Strategy which genuinely enhance the competitiveness of European economies.
This requires real economic reform that delivers more growth, flexible labour markets and higher employment throughout the EU.
While we are fully supportive of the efforts of the President of the Commission and some Member States to reduce burdens on business and impediments to job creation, we are concerned that some of the measures outlined in the resolution could lead to higher costs on business and detract from the over-riding priority of making Europe more competitive in the global market place and thus significantly reducing unemployment levels.
We cannot support those suggestions in the resolution that would lead to a Financial Perspective higher than agreed at the European Council in December 2005.
On these and other grounds, we have decided to abstain on the resolution.
Â Â  The joint motion for a resolution signed and being promoted in the European Parliament by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the Lisbon Strategy aims to speed up capitalist restructurings even more, by drawing up national programmes.
The attack by Euro-unifying capital is being extended and embraces all the basic links, with the invasion of capital in and the commercialisation of health, education and energy, the dismantling of labour relations and the sweeping away of any rights acquired by the working classes, with the new attack on its insurance and pension rights.
The Lisbon Strategy is also based on the Maastricht Treaty and the four freedoms (of capital, of trade, of workers, of services) voted on jointly in our country by Nea Dimokratia, the Panellinio Socialistiko Kinima and Synaspismos.
The Kommounistiko Komma Elladas has given the working class and the people timely warning of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
It calls on the working class to step up its fight against the barbaric attack by capital, to make its fight an anti-monopoly, anti-imperialist fight and to build up its alliance for grass-roots power and prosperity.
Â Â  . It is scandalous that, even 20 years after the Chernobyl disaster, two-thirds of MEPs should endorse the continued use of nuclear energy by voting in favour of the resolution on the Lisbon Strategy.
Nuclear power remains a high-risk technology with incalculable consequences.
The spiralling use of nuclear power violates fundamental rights and irreparably worsens the living conditions of future generations.
The extraction of uranium entails the massive over-exploitation of nature and the radioactive pollution of groundwater.
Uranium can also be enriched, which is a means of producing material capable of being used in atomic weapons.
It is in fact not really possible to absolutely separate âcivilâ from military use of nuclear energy.
Even the normal operation of nuclear reactors involves a permanent state of risk through such things as low-level radiation and the risk of contamination of the rivers used for cooling them.
There are recurrent instances of reprocessing plants causing the radioactive pollution over wide expanses of land and sea.
To date, nobody has been able to solve the problem of how to manage and store highly radioactive waste, more of which is being produced on a daily basis and which will continue to emit radiation for another 10Â 000 years at least.
The EURÂ 3.1Â billion allocated to nuclear research by the EUâs seventh research framework programme (2007-2011) is double the amount allocated by its predecessor.
Instead of investing in nuclear technologies, the EU should do more to develop renewable forms of energy.
Decentralised supplies from renewable energy sources are the only way to guarantee long-term security of energy supply.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the input to the Spring 2006 European Council in relation to the Lisbon Strategy, as I accept most of the points it raises and the proposals it makes.
I particularly welcome the proposals relating to a demanding, competitive and innovative approach to the European economy, which sets out a roadmap for European economic reform marked by the completion of the internal market, investment in research and development, and solidarity between communities and generations.
There are some points that I feel need to be clarified.
In my opinion, it is regrettable that one year on from the 2005 Spring Council, we remain more or less exactly where we were, in many areas, namely freedom to provide services, freedom of installation for citizens from the new Member States, the deepening of the internal market and reform of budgetary priorities.
These points have certainly not led me to vote against the resolution, but they do reinforce my disappointment at the lack of commitment to EU reforms.
Â Â  The next item is the statements from the Council and the Commission on the results of the informal Council of foreign ministers (10-11 March 2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, in the western Balkans the EU can really make a difference.
This was discussed at the Foreign Ministersâ âGymnichâ meeting in Salzburg.
The region is at the crossroads and the EU will guide it down the peaceful and reformist path.
We have seen many positive developments in recent years, but we should not be lulled into a false sense of security.
This year the remaining status issues, Kosovo and Montenegro, must be solved with patience and determination.
We must also move the region beyond the era of war.
We must thus clear the way for progress on issues that really matter to the citizens of the region: economic and social development and bringing the countries into the European mainstream.
How can we best encourage the countries to stick to an ambitious reform agenda?
Most importantly, we must stick to our commitment that the countries can make progress towards the EU with membership as the ultimate goal, once they have managed to meet the rigorous accession criteria.
Moreover, we must strive to make this perspective concrete and tangible, as the Commission has done in its recent communication.
Let me mention a few examples of our concrete objectives and proposals.
Firstly, we should remove obstacles to trade, production and investment.
The Commission, together with the stability pact and the countries concerned, is pursuing the creation of a regional free trade agreement, which would replace the existing patchwork of 31 bilateral free trade agreements.
This may be attained through a simultaneous enlargement and modernisation of CEFTA, on which there will be a CEFTA summit meeting in April in Bucharest.
Secondly, we should âEuropeaniseâ the next generation â or why not the current generation?
That is why we have proposed increasing the mobility of researchers and students by increasing the number of scholarships provided for them.
Thirdly, we need to facilitate people-to-people contacts.
We shall put forward measures on visa facilitation, and I trust that the Member States will move them quickly forward through the Council, so that we can start negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission agreements.
Let me underline the fact that the more the countries in the region can do to ensure border controls and document security, the easier it will be to convince the EU Member States to make progress on visa facilitation.
I am glad that the EUâs Foreign Ministers in Salzburg last weekend endorsed these practical measures and, even though she is not present today, I want to pay particular tribute to Mrs Plassnik and her personal commitment to ensuring progress in the western Balkans.
Finally, I must say a few words about the death of Slobodan Milosevic.
When we received the news of his death at the end of the Gymnich meeting, my immediate reaction was to remember my visit to Srebrenica last July, at the tenth commemoration of the most appalling massacre in post-war Europe.
I regret that Milosevic died before justice could be served for the hundreds of thousands of victims of the crimes for which he was indicted.
In his memoirs, Chancellor Kohl writes that each generation must work for a necessary consciousness of history to avoid repeating our mistakes and to ensure that âthe voices of victims are heardâ.
These are very wise words.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is putting on record evidence that will help the Serbs of current and future generations to understand that many crimes were committed in the name of Serbia, while certain individuals were responsible for these crimes.
The death of Milosevic makes it even more important for The Hague Tribunal to complete its work and for the remaining indictees to be transferred there.
This will help Serbia to close the tragic chapter of history over which Milosevic presided and to come to terms with the legacy of its past.
Today Serbia is truly at the crossroads and I sincerely hope that the leaders and people of Serbia have the will and wisdom to choose the European future instead of the nationalist past.
The country now truly holds its future in its own hands.
We can help the Serbs to make the right choice by keeping the European prospect open for them.
Â Â  â Mr President, this was announced as a debate with the Council.
You have just said that the Council is not yet present, but I do think we should wait for it to arrive, for what we want to do is to hear, and then discuss, a report on the Salzburg summit.
There is no point in us having the debate before we hear the report; it would be a pointless ritual.
Â Â  I agree with Mr Posselt's remarks, although it has come to my attention that the minister will be arriving shortly.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I would like to add my voice to Mr Posselt's protest, because I believe that we in this Parliament must not forego what is really important just because of a failure to comply with formal arrangements, and if a debate with the Commission and the Council has been scheduled, the Council should be present.
Mr President, I would like to say that, as if the situation in the Middle East and in Palestine following Hamas's victory were not complicated enough, the assault on the Jericho prison by Israeli troops â which I believe we must condemn â makes the situation even more complicated and has unleashed a wave of indiscriminate violence which has harmed European Union citizens and interests and which we must condemn in the strongest terms.
Mr President, since I know that it has been debated in the informal Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers, I would like to ask the Commission what approach the European Commission and the Council, which is unfortunately still absent, is going to take to European Union aid to Palestine, and whether it is going to insist, as is logical, on the need to demand that Hamas renounce violence and recognise the State of Israel and the previous agreements.
Secondly, Mr President, with regard to the issue of Iran, which has been referred to the United Nations Security Council, I would like to ask the Commission whether it prefers a gradual approach, that is, that the Security Council should issue a statement, or whether it is hoping that sanctions will be applied.
With regard to enlargement, Mr President, in view of the comments by the French Home Affairs Minister, MrÂ Sarkozy, to the effect that there is a degree of fatigue when it comes to enlargement and his request for a debate in the Council in June on assessing the limits to the European Unionâs capacity for absorption â and MrÂ Brokâs report is the next item on the agenda â I would like to know whether the Commission agrees with Mr Sarkozyâs request to the Council and whether it believes that the Austrian Presidency of the Union should provide a definitive response to the issue of the geographical limits of our political project.
Â Â  Some of the issues that you have raised should be addressed to MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, who is not here at the moment, whereas many of your other questions will be answered as part of the debate on the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA), which will take place in due course.
Â Â  . Mr President, due to the fact that speaking time for the Commission is tight for this debate and it would be impossible to report on such a wide scope of issues, covering all external affairs, all global issues, it was agreed that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner would deal with Iran and Palestine and the cartoon crisis when she speaks later this evening.
That is why I have concentrated on policies relating to the Western Balkans.
This is how the Commissionâs contribution will be allocated, meaning that after the debate I will respond regarding the western Balkans and MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner will respond on the other issues later this evening.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Rehn has described how things stand, so let us now discuss the Brok report, which has to do with enlargement, before we move on to doing everything else when MrsÂ Plassnik has got here.
I urge you to do it this way, or else we will be unfair to the Commissioner and the debate will not be in the proper order.
Â Â  I understand the unusual situation in which we find ourselves, but unfortunately, according to the agenda, the debate on the Brok report will take place after statements by the Council and the Commission.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too have a proposal to make.
We can of course take a break if the absent Presidency of the Council invites us to take coffee with it in the meantime.
Â Â  Mr President, I am perfectly aware of the pressures involved in the drawing up of Parliamentâs agenda, but you have said that we have a particular order of business, and what we cannot do is establish an item on the agenda which says that we are going to deal with the Informal Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers when it turns out that the Commissioner responsible for the majority of the items relating to that Council has decided that it should be done at a later point in our debate.
I believe that what Mr Posselt and Mrs Pack have proposed is entirely justified.
If the Commissioner responsible is not here to deal with the main issues of the informal Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers, let us debate Mr Brokâs report and then we can deal with this item when the Commissioner responsible comes, because it is not acceptable for subjects to be distributed without hearing the opinion of the Members.
Â Â  I understand the concerns that you are raising, but I have to say that I am unaware of anything in the Rules of Procedure that would help us resolve this problem.
Â Â  â Mr President, the problem is, of course, that certain Members who are down to speak on the Brok report are not there now and will be arriving only later on.
We can, of course, rearrange things somewhat.
MrsÂ Napoletano was ready to speak, and I am speaking now because I do mainly speak on the subject of the Balkans.
We can now, of course, simply combine the two, but some Members will be cross at not being able to speak to the Brok report because they were not there.
That is the problem!
Â Â  â Mr President, can I just, politely, ask whether you are in possession of information as to when the Council is actually going to turn up?
If what I hear is indeed the case, and they will be here in another quarter of an hour, then we can wait for a quarter of an hour, for we have had plenty of 15-minute delays in this place.
What I would suggest, then, is that, if the Council is going to be here in 15 minutesâ time, we can suspend the sitting for that long.
If they are going to turn up in an hourâs time, then we will have to think of something else.
We have no information on this whatsoever, but perhaps you do.
Â Â  I suggest that we suspend the sitting for a few minutes while we wait for the Council representative to arrive.
Given that the Council representative has now arrived, we can resume proceedings.
Â Â  . Mr President, I crave your forgiveness for our late arrival.
We have just had two traffic accidents to contend with, one on the road to the airport in Vienna and one on the road from Entzheim.
Thank you for the opportunity to inform you about our informal, Gymnich-format, meeting of foreign ministers, which took place this weekend in Salzburg.
This was primarily concerned with two subject areas, the first of which was the challenges to foreign policy currently facing us, notably the developments in the Middle East and the imminent elections in Belarus and Ukraine.
The second day was devoted to the Balkans, the Thessaloniki agenda, its implementation and its future.
If you will permit me, I would like to discuss the Middle East first and then move on to the Balkans.
To the Middle East, then: this region is, following the elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council and in the run-up to the elections in Israel, in a transitional stage, one in which we have a very clear and consistent message to send to the future Palestinian Government, for we need to make clear what are our own fundamental principles, on the basis of which we are prepared for further cooperation.
The fundamentals are perfectly clear and consist of three elements.
We are calling upon them to abandon violence, to agree to negotiations â which means recognising the existing agreements â and to acknowledge Israelâs right to existence.
It is on this clear and consistent basis that our policy is developed, and on which we have launched an appeal to our partners in the Middle East.
Hamas, in particular, will have to become aware of the fork in the road and come to a decision as to which path it wants to take in future.
It must make clear which route it is going to take; we have spelled out what the conditions are, and in no respect has there been any change in them.
We shall continue to support the Palestinian people, and also took the opportunity at âGymnichâ to discuss what shape financial support might take in future.
What is clear is that any such support must benefit the Palestinian people rather than being used for terrorism or for violence.
We are, then, with a great deal of attention, following developments, the efforts being made to put together a new Palestinian Government, and its future programme.
Yesterday, President Mahmud Abbas and his delegation visited Vienna, where we had the chance to raise these issues with him.
He and the interim government have our support in this difficult period, and I shall be happy to discuss events in closer detail if I get the opportunity to do so later on.
Turning to the Balkans, this issue was and is an important one for the Austrian Presidency, and I therefore regard the Gymnich meeting and its engagement with it as a message of encouragement, even in a dual sense of the term, addressed to the people of the states of the Western Balkans.
The road they have to travel towards Europe and towards meeting European standards may well be a difficult one, but the journey is worth it, and on that road they have our good wishes and support.
It is also a sign to our own peoples, encouraging them in the belief that it is indeed possible to find solutions to difficult problems â even to the most difficult ones.
I therefore see it as a sign of hope and confidence that we succeeded, in the Salzburg Declaration, in underlining and making visible the prospects that the Balkan states have of acceding to the European Union.
For it was important, particularly at a time when people are talking in terms of 'enlargement fatigue', that this signal should be sent out in order to give our partners a good idea of what to expect in view of the extremely difficult decisions that we will have to take in 2006.
It was evident from the guest list for our Salzburg meeting just how much the path we shall take this year will demand of us, for our guests included Martti Ahtisaari, the UN special envoy to Kosovo, and his deputy Albert Rohan, and we were able to discuss with them the future of that region.
We had also invited Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina; SÃžren Jensen-Petersen, the head of UNMIK was present with his delegation, as was Ibrahim Rugovaâs successor as President of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu.
I was also pleased that this segment of our Salzburg meeting managed to achieve something of a âfirstâ in the presence of Mr Brok, the chairman of your Foreign Affairs Committee, who took part in our discussions.
The Balkans are at the heart of Europe, and without them, European unification will be incomplete.
We know that the road ahead of us will be a difficult one, but we are determined to go down it.
We have decided to take a step-by-step approach to the work in hand, working through the issues one by one and resolving each of them in turn.
It is working on the European standards that is actually the core issue for each and every one of these countries.
Yesterday, the Bosnian Prime Minister visited me in Vienna, and told me that what was crucial was not a date or a particular point in time in the course of development, but working together on European standards.
Javier Solana, who has been keeping an eye on developments for a long time, describes what has been achieved since Thessaloniki in 2003 as a success story capable of being read on the agenda, and, more specifically on the order of business for the Salzburg meeting, since the issues with which this meeting concerned itself were issues of easier and improved trading arrangement, the fight against organised crime, young people and the facilitation of easier travel.
We gave attention to the visa issue in view of the need to address the expectations that the people of these countries have of us.
We also, though, have to make clear to them what options are open to us, and join with them in seeking, step by step, solutions to the problems that remain outstanding in this area and elsewhere.
There is no doubt about it: Europe is making a difference in this region, but we have also emphasised the responsibility that the countries concerned have for themselves, for in some of them, which have already been stabilised, we need to move on to their dynamic Europeanisation.
As we proceed down that road, it must be made clear to them that they need the willingness to take the necessary action and demonstrate that quality that is described so well by the English term âownershipâ.
We have stressed the need for regional cooperation, especially in view of the work being done on a regional free trade area, with a single free trade agreement, based on CEFTA, intended to replace 31 individual agreements.
Speaking personally, I am very grateful to Commissioner Rehn and to the Commission as a whole for their commitment to this.
The Council and the Commission are working on this hand in hand and side by side in the best sense of the word.
I wish to thank the Commission for its communication at the end of January, and also for their willingness to join us in continuing to work towards the achievement of the goals set out in the Salzburg statement.
Continued work is also called for on the part of the ministers of the national government within their own remits, for it is they who, along with other things, will have to network with their partners in the Balkan states in addressing actual problems.
The ministers of the interior, in particular, are highly committed to this and bear a great responsibility, for it is they and their cooperation that determine what practical headway can be made on important issues.
We also discussed the topic of the EUâs assimilation capacity and explored its implications.
As you know, this is a topic that I brought into greater prominence last autumn, and I believe I was right to do so, for we are not seeking to put up an additional obstacle, but, essentially, to make us more aware of something that ought to be quite obvious, that being that it is not only the candidates for accession of whom homework is to be demanded, but the European Union itself also needs to do its own.
At this joint meeting, at a moment at which all of us were united around one table in Salzburg, we all had an experience that was not only disquieting but also, at the same time, gave us a sense of hopeful confidence: our deliberations were interrupted by news of the death of Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ, and there was a European symbolism in our being able, at such a moment, to work on our common European future.

Â Â  . â Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would just like to make two brief observations on the subject of the Middle East.
Firstly, we are right to demand that Hamas should face up to reality and renounce violence, but that must not be licence for Israel to continue with its policy of unilateral violence, which is what we have just seen it engaging in.
Secondly, Europe, and the USA, must be consistent in their nuclear policies, particularly in view of the different ways in which India and Iran are being treated, and the International Atomic Energy Authority in Vienna must be given a larger role in a multilateral system of uranium enrichment and nuclear waste management.
If we stick with these principles, we will make progress.
Turning to the Balkans, it strikes me that our actions are being guided by the principle that progress is to be defined as whatever is not regress.
I have to say that my group and I are very embarrassed by the conduct of certain Member States, which are making themselves culpable for the way in which the business of making Europe fit for the accession of new Member States is being played off against the Balkan countriesâ prospects of accession.
Europe will not, however, be made any stronger by the Balkan countries being robbed of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future.
The guiding principle must still be the vision of EU membership, for which this House â my group included â has so often voted unanimously.
Perfectly understandable though it is that demand should be made for the EU to be made more capable of welcoming new members â I am thinking here of the constitution and of the financial basis â this cannot be used against the countries of South-Eastern Europe and as a means of fending off their efforts at accession.
Preparations for this on our side and in the Balkans must run in parallel.
The preparation of both sides must be consistent and thorough, and while it is in progress, practical action needs to be taken to prepare the countries of the Balkans for accession to the European Union, not least by making visa arrangements simpler and easier.
Further to what you had to say about the ministers of the interior â Mrs Gottes and Mr Ohr â I hope that they will do something tangible in order to give this regionâs young people, in particular, a chance to get to know Europe at last.
Despite Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄâs death â which was in many respects premature â it remains in the interests of the victims and of Europeâs shared future that all those who committed crimes should be brought to The Hague for trial, and on that we must certainly insist.
The countries of the Balkans, which have so often in the course of our continentâs history been the playthings of the European Great Powers, must progressively be integrated into the European Union.
We will not, in any case, accept their being relegated to an earlier stage of their relationship with it.
When, tomorrow, we vote to adopt the Brok report, we must do so stating clearly only that which is in the text, and without the interpretations that have, regrettably, been placed upon it in the last few hours and have the effect of falsifying what it actually contains.
We defend the Balkan countriesâ prospects of membership of the European Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I had hoped that a strong and positive message would have come out of the Balkan Conference.
I believe that was also the hope of both the Presidency-in-Office and the Commission.
You each can ill afford to voice your disappointment, so I will do it for you.
We all acknowledge that the entire Balkan region remains volatile and potentially unstable, which is why clarity is absolutely indispensable.
The joint press statement, notably weaker than previous declarations, states that the future of the western Balkans lies in the European Union.
We note the absence of any mention of membership.
It adds that a debate on enlargement strategy is due in 2006 and that the EUâs absorption capacity has to be taken into account.
That is disappointing.
I will come back to that during the debate on the Brok report.
Allow me to comment on the Middle East.
I fully share my group chairmanâs reaction to the deplorable and unacceptable behaviour of Israel in Jericho yesterday, not to mention the strange behaviour â to say the least â of US and British troops.
Needless to say, that action makes the EUâs position more difficult.
While my group strongly agrees that Hamas must renounce violence and endorse existing international treaties and agreements, we must note with sadness that Israel is making it increasingly difficult to hold this line.
We will nevertheless do so, but we must also make it very clear that actions like those witnessed yesterday run totally counter to the search for a peaceful outcome.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mrs Plassnik, the reason why we suspended our sitting in order to wait for you was that there are things about which we are very concerned and which we wish to discuss with you.
At the time they began their presidency, the Austrians were planning ThessalonikiÂ II, yet there is no word of it in the Salzburg statement; nor has anything more been heard about the prospect of Member State status for the Western Balkans.
The statement is a compromise, one, insubstantial though it is, that is given a critical hearing in the Balkans and was in no way a sign of encouragement, but at best invited misinterpretation.
That, at any rate, is the valuation I would place on the statement by Mr Brok, who also took part in Salzburg and who has, since Monday, been telling the German media about an end to the Balkansâ EU prospects and talking up what he calls a third way, a privileged partnership.
If Europe wants some credibility, we have to uphold the European prospect for the Balkans not only in words but also by our actions, and this is where I agree with Commissioner Rehn in what he has said.
Mr Brok, let me conclude by saying one thing, namely that a third way is precisely what the Libyan Head of State, Colonel Gaddafi, was looking for as long ago as the 1980s.
He, fortunately, failed miserably in this, and you will have the same experience.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me just say a few things about the matters that have nothing to do with the enlargement countries, which I shall shortly be discussing as part of my report.
I would like to say something briefly about the Middle East.
We find ourselves in ever-greater difficulties, as a result not only of developments over the past few days, but of those that have taken place over recent weeks and months.
On the one hand, there is the situation with which both sides in the Holy Land itself are presenting us; on the other, there is the issue of how probable it is that Iran will be deterred from a military nuclear programme.
And if, as is indeed possible, there is a closing of the circle â with Iran, Syria, a multilateral agreement in Lebanon with Hisbollah and contacts with Hamas â there arises the great danger of an alliance that is highly problematic and to which we have to find a response, not only in order to secure peace and fight terrorism, but also to guarantee the security of our energy supplies.
I am grateful, Madam President-in-Office, for having been able to be present for some of the discussions.
Whilst the negotiations will see us tackling hard political facts, we must also ensure that there is a real dialogue of cultures, so that the fundamentalists will be unable to prevent the moderates â who are present in all the regions â from forming a majority.
Perhaps, Madam President-in-Office, I might be permitted to address another aspect of great significance in some areas, that being the issue of the European Unionâs mission to the Congo.
I would be very interested to know whether there is already a mandate in place for this, setting out what it is to do and for how long and over what geographical area it is to do it, and whether the Congolese authorities have officially invited such a project and the European Unionâs participation in it.
If decisions are to be taken concerning this both here and elsewhere, it is extraordinarily important that there should be clarity as regards what the Presidency of the Council and the High Representative are doing about organising such a mandate.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, MadamÂ President-in-Office of the Council, it is excellent that you are giving the Balkans a high profile.
We do all have an interest in the region being stabilised and democratised, and the EU really has an opportunity to play an important role.
I wish you both good luck in the task of raising the ambitions of your colleagues in the other Member States to the same high level.
Be assured that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is with you on this.
The various initiatives for getting the countries to cooperate with each other and with ourselves are excellent.
It is also good that, in the end, the decision has been taken to use CEFTA, which already exists and is already up and running, as a basis for doing this instead of creating something new, as there was talk of doing previously.
I think that this was an extremely wise decision.
At the same time, we are also talking about different countries with different traditions, different histories and different degrees of development.
It is therefore important that we keep sending out the message that all these countries are welcome to apply for membership of the European Community if they wish to do so and that, in that case, they will be treated on their own merits.
There is at present a concern in certain quarters that we wish to lump the countries together again and that they will be treated as a unit.
I believe that that anxiety is exaggerated, but it is very important to be extremely clear on the point that has been made, namely that each country is to be treated on its own merits.
With regard to the death of Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ, we are talking here about an odious dictator, responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and a large part of the tragedy that has taken place.
I also regret that the trial could not be brought to a conclusion, and it was, I believe, an obviously quite pathetic man who ended his days.
We must still be crystal clear about the need for Radovan Karadzic and Ratko MladiÄ to be extradited and to be so right now.
There is no room for compromise on this.
Â Â  Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on Saturday, the Unionâs Foreign Affairs Ministers redefined the European prospects of the Western Balkans and stipulated that the ultimate objective of the stabilisation and association process under way with those countries is no less than accession to the European Union.
They have therefore gone further than the Thessaloniki declaration of 2003, which talked about the great challenge represented by the integration of the five countries of the Balkans and their eventual accession to the Union.
The MEPs from the UMP agree with this vision and this prospect and are convinced that, without the Balkans, European unification is not complete.
They also share the view that it will be a long journey with many obstacles along the way, but first of all they would ask that, in relation to the Balkans and any other possible future enlargement, the real questions be set out clearly.
What are the real questions?
Firstly, does the European Union have the capacity to absorb these countries?
I would point out that this is one of the Copenhagen criteria, a criterion that is too often forgotten; financial capacity, institutional capacity, but also political capacity.
Are our Member States and their people ready to receive other Member States into the Union and, if so, when and how?
Furthermore, another member of the Union, France, has amended its constitution, making it obligatory to hold a referendum on any further enlargement, following the accession of Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia.
Our partners may welcome this, or lament it, but that is now the institutional reality.
Finally, for years, the MEPs from the UMP have been calling for an in-depth debate within the European Union on the subject of Europeâs borders.
It is high time that that debate took place!
We must look reality in the face and make a mature choice on the future of the European Union, in terms of political content and geographical borders.
This is a duty for us, and it is a duty towards the countries that are knocking at our door.
We must take on our responsibilities.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, while I would like to endorse what Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck said about my groupâs stance on Israelâs policy over the past few days, I would also like to respond to what you said about the importance of this transitional stage.
It is one in which the EU should send out a clear message highlighting the principles of cooperation, those being renunciation of violence, acceptance of existing agreements and the recognition of Israelâs right to exist.
That is incredibly important, and the EU must not distance itself from it in any way.
That is why I believe the EU is making a grave mistake in continuing to give the interim government financial support.

While the EU should send humanitarian aid to the Palestinian areas and help the people who live in them, it should not be supporting the authorities there, for Hamas has neither acknowledged Israelâs right to exist nor renounced violence, and the message we are sending is a deadly one, in that Hamas has reiterated its view that the EUâs decision to continue sending money is an indication that it accepts its policies, while it is still refusing to negotiate with Israel on the grounds that it does not recognise its legitimacy.
The whole object of EU support is the promotion of the peace process, but it is wrong to give financial support to those who seek its downfall.
The EU must keep to the course it has set so far and must not abandon financial aid, which is its most important bargaining counter, and it is for that reason that I ask you to take another look at this.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I will start by congratulating you on your historic achievement in Luxembourg, in which you paved the way for the accession of Croatia, the only central European state other than Switzerland not yet to be a Member State of the EU.
I will also congratulate you on the great courage with which you launched there the debate on the frontiers of Europe, which is long overdue.
Secondly, let me say how grateful I am to you for having, in Salzburg, argued in favour of the other South-East European states being given the prospect of accession.
I do indeed believe that we must not budge on this; there must be no doubt whatever about the fact that the states of South-Eastern Europe are indeed European, and that they are entitled to become full members of the European Union as soon as all the criteria have been satisfied â which includes the enlargement criterion that applies to us.
Thirdly â and here I have to disagree with Mrs Koch-Mehrin â I would like to say that what we should be doing for Palestine is not just giving humanitarian aid, but also helping them to achieve pluralism â difficult though that must be conceded to be.
Corrupt and dubious though the Fatah state was, a state ruled by Hamas would be even more objectionable.
We must promote the peace process and pluralism by every means to hand in order to prevent an Iranian zone of influence extending from the Gulf to the Mediterranean coming into being.
Fourthly, Iran, which is second only to China as the oldest great power in the world, is not a monolithic block, and that is why we have to apply a combination of stringency and intense diplomatic effort to dealing with it.
Here, too, no matter how unacceptable the countryâs current President may be, we must not lose faith in dialogue.
There is more to Iran than its president; it is one of the oldest states in the world, and we Europeans must do everything in our power to reinforce the pluralistic forces within it and to prevent it from degenerating into aggressive uniformity.
Â Â  . Mr President, returning to the subject of the Balkans, I do believe that the time was ripe, and I feel even more justified in my decision to make the Balkans a priority for the Austrian Presidency of the Council.
The time was ripe for a debate on enlargement, and the one we had in Salzburg went well.
I see that as progress, for the worst course of action is to keep silent and fail to address the issues that need to be addressed, to fail to make the public aware of them, or to explain to them what is at stake, what is being done and why.
And so I am glad we had this debate, not least also that we gave attention to the frustrations felt by the states of the Western Balkans.
I reject the idea that the Salzburg statement was a superficial compromise or even a retrograde move, and I would ask you to examine the wording carefully.
Let me remind you that, in paragraph 3, we explicitly speak of EU membership as a long-term objective, as the âultimate goal in conformity with the Thessaloniki Declarationâ, and so what matters, and was our concern in our discussions, is that the prospect of accession be made more credible and tangible, not least for the people of the Western Balkans.
That explains why we discussed the topics we did, and why we discussed them in a very constructive spirit.
Moving on to the Congo, work is underway on clarifying the conditions in terms of time, scope and substance; this is being done at Council level, jointly with Mr Solana, and in liaison with the Congolese authorities.
It is very much in the interests of all of us that this matter should be clarified.
Moving on to Iran, we are now in a period of diplomatic wrangling in the United Nations, and, as one speaker pointed out, what really does matter is that the authority of the International Atomic Energy Authority be reinforced and the implementation of the many resolutions adopted on this subject be proceeded with apace.
Let me close by saying something, briefly, about what is currently going on both in Jericho and in Gaza.
What happened yesterday is a matter of grave concern to the presidency.
We have emphasised the need for appropriate action to restore peace and order; we have said that Israelâs use of force in Jericho and the activity by Palestinian extremists in response to it are both capable of further destabilising a situation in the Middle East that is already tense.
We have urged restraint on both Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
Both sides must now give very careful consideration to the consequences of their actions.
We denounced in strong terms the taking of hostages and â as Mr Winkler told you today â immediately called on the Palestinian Authority to do whatever was necessary, both now and in the future, to ensure the safety and protection of European citizens and buildings.
It has to be said that, while we are willing to give aid â aid of a humanitarian nature, that is â such aid can be effective only in a peaceful environment, and all parties must play their part in creating one.
Â Â  . Mr President, as I said before the break, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner will present the Commissionâs views on the Middle East, Palestine and Iran later this evening.
I will comment on the next agenda item: issues related to enlargement and absorption capacity.
I should also like to use this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Plassnik on her personal commitment to the policy on the western Balkans.
It has been extremely important and the Austrian Presidency has taken new steps towards integrating this region into the European mainstream.
That is indispensable to the security and stability of the whole of Europe and of the Union.
All participants in the debate have recognised that the road ahead for the western Balkans is a challenging one and that many reforms must be implemented before the countries meet the required criteria.
It is equally clear that there is a consensus in this House on the absolutely fundamental role the European Union plays and is bound to play in the western Balkans through a credible accession perspective â albeit a medium- to long-term perspective â but a credible accession perspective.
That is the driving force behind the reforms and that is the basis of our work on security and stability.
Especially with a view to the Kosovo status process, we all have to be extremely responsible as regards the western Balkans and its stability.
We should not undermine the EU perspective, which is the foundation of security and stability in the region.
Thus, to avoid eroding our own credibility, we cannot take back with the left hand what we gave with the right hand.
The key objectives to work for are security, stability and progress in the western Balkans.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0025/2006) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the Commissionâs 2005 enlargement strategy paper (2005/2206(INI)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, right up to the present day, the enlargement of the European Union has been the most successful aspect of its foreign policy, for it was a means of extending the area of stability and peace in Europe, and also of further advancing the cause of peace, freedom, human rights and the rule of law.
This is an important point, and one of which we must not lose sight either now or in the future.
It also has to be clear to us, though, that stability is an achievable goal only if the European Union is strong enough to develop the ability to master these tasks; that, for example, was why the Constitutional Treaty was a retrospective attempt at really making the addition of ten new Member States workable in institutional terms and in terms of the objectives involved, and the reason why we are in such difficulties now is that the ratification process is going nowhere.
We also have to realise that the European Union's capacity for accepting new members is one of the essential aspects of the Copenhagen criteria, although there are good reasons why that has been purely declaratory in nature.
When we reach the sort of interface that we will reach after Bulgaria and Romania we will, however, have to bring this into play and redefine it.
It is for that reason that we ask the Commission, by the end of the year, to define what is meant by the European Unionâs absorption capacity with reference to this and this will enable us to make use of it.
What makes that so extraordinarily important is that this is not just a constitutional issue but also touches on issues of the European Unionâs financial capacities and much more besides.
I also think that we have to make it clear to just what extent the European Union is capable of accepting new members, and that this can affect the âyes or no?â decision at the end of the day.
The prospect of EU membership is to be held out not only to countries that have already commenced accession negotiations, that have candidate status or to whom one has been promised post-Thessaloniki â which promise, let me point out for the avoidance of former doubts and in order to re-clarify matters, cannot be withdrawn â but also as an incentive to highly-important internal reforms and to such states as Ukraine, European states that are currently subject to dictatorships and need to have such a perspective if they are to be kept looking westwards.
For that, the Neighbourhood Policy alone is not enough.
In some instances, the countries themselves or the European Union itself are currently finding it too much to combine this with the prospect of full membership, for it can in many cases be realised only in fifteen yearsâ time.
If this project is to be credible, something between the two is needed, something with which these countries can have the prospect of full membership held out to them, without us being put under unrealistic pressure to give it to them at once.
This should be open to every state that is not currently a Member State of the European Union.
I would like again to emphasise that this can be the final stretch in countries such as Norway â which is also a party to the Schengen convention â so decide on the basis of their participation in the European Economic Area.
If I may be permitted to talk in terms of a âEuropean Economic Area plusâ, then there is much that can be done with such a multilateral project in the fields of the internal market, internal and external security, environmental policy and much else besides.
It can also be an intermediate stage, though.
If states that, today, have the prospect of accession held out to them post-Thessaloniki â such as for example the countries of the Western Balkans, whose development is expected to take different periods of time â should decide to use it as an interim stage to full membership, then what was promised at Thessaloniki would not be made void.
It is on this basis that we can achieve a new degree of flexibility by making this prospect credible, for things can happen at once without the intervening fifteen years of negotiations, and then we will have to say âyesâ or ânoâ.
So, yes, I do see that enlargement, in some countries, entails plebiscites, and so we have no idea whether ratification will eventually happen.
What that means is that this is not just an attempt at an âeverything or nothingâ strategy, but also at creating ways in which these countries might be given credible perspectives, while at the same time saving and driving forward the political project that is the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank your House and the chairman of its foreign policy committee for the thorough report on the Commissionâs 2005 strategy paper.
This topic is the subject of constant discussion in the Council, not least with reference to the practical decisions that we have to take.
