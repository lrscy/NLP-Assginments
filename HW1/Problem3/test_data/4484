Misunderstandings must be cleared up.
The concerns of the citizens of the Member States, but also of the citizens of the candidate countries, must be taken seriously and must be responded to appropriately.
As the initial accessions draw closer, more and clearer information must be provided than has been the case to date.
Enlargement offers enormous scope.
However, it also imposes conditions and restrictions on both parties.
The credibility of accession requires efforts on all sides.
The Belgian Presidency has pledged to maintain the intensive pace of negotiations.
It will ensure that the conditions for accession are met.
The candidate countries will still need to make great efforts in order to implement the acquis communautaire.
We have a very long way to go, but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
We can now start counting the months, rather than the years.
We can now also start telling all the candidate countries with which we have begun negotiations that they are future Member States.
Finally, there is no doubt that the accession of, certainly, twelve countries in the short term and that of thirteen countries in the somewhat longer term will turn our Union into something other than what we have known so far.
That has been the case with each new accession.
Each new acceding state, each new acceding nation has added something extra.
I will not enter into any detail, for that could lead to bad feeling and that is not my intention.
It is evident that this will also happen when new Member States join.
The adventure which we started around ten years ago - at least the concept of it - is thus reaching successful completion, but that success will only be achieved if we all make the efforts needed.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your extremely detailed speech and I shall now give the floor to Commissioner Verheugen. I would point out that, in principle, our guest speakers have limited speaking time, but we can, of course, be flexible where necessary.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is almost a year since the European Parliament' s last major debate on enlargement.
I therefore welcome the opportunity to take stock of the year and describe the tasks that still lie ahead of us.
I should like to begin by sincerely thanking the European Parliament and all its groups and committees for their great commitment to the process of EU enlargement.
You have all done a great deal to give this historic project political credibility and to give democratic legitimacy to the enlargement process.
In the decisive closing stage of negotiations the Commission continues to rely on Parliament' s support, and I am pleased to be able to say, on the basis of the contribution from Mr Brok, the rapporteur, and the presentation from the President-in-Office, that there continues to be a high level of broad solid agreement between the three institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
After the Councils of Nice and GÃ¶teborg it is clear that enlargement will come, and come soon.
The point of no return is definitely behind us.
The project is now irreversible.
I do not want to reawaken the controversy surrounding the Treaty of Nice, but I would like to point out that this Treaty contains essential political conditions for the conclusion of the accession treaties.
I, too, have my doubts as to whether the treaty is the best possible solution both to the question of institutional adjustments and to that of the combination of deepening and enlargement that many, myself included, believe necessary.
But I fear there will always be differences of opinion over the best possible solution to this problem.
But living in Europe means living with compromises.
The Commission is therefore pressing for ratification of the Treaty of Nice here in the European Parliament and in the parliaments of the Member States.
As we all know, the treaty fell at the first hurdle, the referendum in Ireland.
The answer to such a referendum cannot be a simple "as you were" .
If we simply close our eyes and continue, we shall be shipwrecked and miss out on a great historic opportunity.
Enlargement must not be sacrificed to growing alienation between Europe' s citizens and the European institutions and decision-making processes.
The answer to the warning signal from Ireland is also, but not only, a question of proper communication.
Perhaps Europe' s citizens are looking for a more fundamental and more complex answer.
As I see it, there is an intrinsic link between the debate about Europe' s future and the debate about our future borders.
We need to make that link.
Nice has paved the way for negotiations to be steered towards the really substantive questions, as the candidates urgently require.
The 'road map' presented by the Commission and approved by the Heads of State and Government is more than a timetable for negotiations.
At heart it is a commitment by the 15 Member States to find common positions by particular deadlines, even in areas where interests are widely divergent.
At the same time, this tells the candidates that their efforts are worthwhile and that nothing is being put off.
After almost a year, we can say that the Nice strategy has motivated the candidate countries enormously and that the transposition of Community law is running more quickly and more smoothly.
At the same time, the candidate countries are showing greater flexibility in adjusting their positions and there have been genuine breakthroughs in negotiations as a result.
The treatment of the free movement of workers issue is an instructive example of this.
The desired time frame for the first accessions was then clearly defined in GÃ¶teborg.
That came at the right moment.
On the one hand, the progress in negotiations made it possible to define the finishing line for those applicant countries that are adequately prepared; on the other hand, the GÃ¶teborg decision gives the parliaments and governments of the candidate countries the necessary political tailwind to mobilise all their forces and respond to the doubters that most certainly exist.
Making the 2004 European elections the point of reference for the accessions is an idea that originated here in the European Parliament a year ago.
We reached agreement on it in our debate last year.
I am very pleased that we actually managed to follow the way pointed by the European Parliament at the Councils in Nice and GÃ¶teborg.
I believe it was a wise decision not to set any specific accession dates for individual countries at GÃ¶teborg or to define groups for accession.
The basic principles of the process - namely individual merits, differentiation and the chance to catch up - are working.
If we stick to these principles, we shall arrive at a natural and real accession scenario that is justified by the results of negotiations alone.
The Commission will be sticking to this line resolutely.
I am also saying this to counter the view that in the end the decisions taken will be purely political, political here in the bad sense of the word.
The Commission will not propose the conclusion of an accession treaty for each individual applicant until it is convinced that the applicant is well enough prepared and satisfies all the conditions.
I am not therefore going to speculate today about how many, and which, new members will already be represented in the next European Parliament.
All I can say today is that 10 of the 12 countries we are negotiating with have decided that they want to use the GÃ¶teborg time frame.
It would be a serious breach of trust if we were now to say to individual candidates: "You are in, in any event" or "Whatever happens, you are going to have to wait a little longer" .
We shall therefore have to prepare ourselves for the possibility that we might have to accept an initial accession group of as many as 10 applicants.
That sounds more drastic that it actually is, because those 10 together represent around 75 million citizens, while all 13 candidate countries together make up a population of 185 million.
The President-in-Office has already indicated how much progress we have made in the negotiations.
I can, in fact, confirm that the question of the substance of the individual chapters is more important than the mere compilation of figures.
It is quite possible that countries which have concluded fewer chapters than others are nevertheless further on in their preparations.
The example of the free movement of workers has shown the difficulty of the issues we now have to deal with.
The compromise based on the Commission proposal will bring the most liberal and most flexible solution to the problem yet seen.
We shall need as much freedom of movement as possible, and for a number of years also as much security as possible.
I would also like to use this example to point once again to the Commission' s understanding of its own role in enlargement.
The Commission has to look to the interests of the Union as a whole.
It is in the interests of the Union as a whole that enlargement should not demand more of any Member State than it is actually able to give.
In making its proposals, the Commission also has to take into account what the applicant countries and future members are able to bear and what they are not.
Unless we are able to compromise, we shall not make the necessary progress, especially since we are now faced with highly controversial issues such as justice and home affairs, competition, taxation, transport, the budget, regional policy and agriculture.
When it comes to negotiating the chapter on justice and home affairs, the protection of the future external borders is a central issue.
We are faced here with a classic conflict of aims.
On the one hand, enlargement must not lead to a new division of Europe.
There must be no new dividing lines created.
Traditional cross-border contacts that often go back hundreds of years must not be made impossible or intolerably difficult, especially in places where the same language is spoken on both sides of the borders and there are close cultural ties.
On the other hand, at the end of this round of enlargement we will have an eastern border extending almost from the North Cape almost to the Bosporus.
That border will have to meet the security needs of today' s EU citizens.
A secure frontier is one of the essential prerequisites.
New members will not be able to be fully integrated into the Schengen system until the border system fully meets Schengen standards.
The other topics, such as taxation and competition, and to a large extent also agriculture, raise enormous social questions.
On the one hand, this concerns the functioning of the internal market, but on the other also the matter of social cohesion in the countries undergoing transformation.
We shall have to decide how much flexibility the Union is able to show so that enlargement is not experienced as a social shock in the future new Member States the day after accession.
When it comes to agriculture, we are dealing with an acquis that may change radically in the next few years.
Many observers believe it would be better to go for agricultural reform first and then talk to the candidate countries about agriculture.
If we were to do that, we would be setting a new condition.
There would not be an enlargement timetable that was anything like reliable.
The end of the project would be put off indefinitely.
As regards the financing of enlargement, the Commission will ensure that the budgetary effects of its proposals for negotiating positions are fully in line with the expenditure ceilings agreed in Berlin for the period up until 2006.
Account must, of course, be taken of the necessary adjustments for the number of new Member States provided for in Agenda 2000.
But even with those adjustments, we shall not exceed the ceiling decided in Berlin in 1999.
I want to turn now to the situation in the candidate countries themselves.
The transposition of Community law is now proceeding apace everywhere.
Most countries have taken highly effective organisational measures to deal with the massive amount of legislation in time.
The instruments deployed, in particular twinning and interparliamentary cooperation, have also proved their worth.
The Commission will be describing the progress made in meeting the Copenhagen criteria in the progress reports for the year 2001.
These reports will be discussed by the Commission and adopted in early November.
What we can say today is this: the trend of the last few years is continuing.
All the applicant countries with whom we have been negotiating continue to satisfy the political criteria.
It is clear that the prospect of membership has made a decisive contribution to stability in the young democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.
The value of the system' s stability for Europe as a whole can be seen everywhere where there are no concrete prospects for accession.
We see increasingly that a definite expectation of accession is the strongest and most effective motor for necessary reforms.
I should like to leave you in no doubt that in the negotiations the Commission is continuing to press for human rights and the rights of minorities to be fully respected.
That includes banning all discrimination on grounds of age, gender, sexual orientation or religious conviction.
We are continuing to observe carefully the position of minorities and the development of the rule of law.
It is symptomatic that national minorities in the applicant states are particularly keen on rapid accession because they see membership of the European Union as their most effective form of protection.
While the situation of the Russian minorities in the Baltic countries continues to improve, the integration of the Roma remains a thorny and substantial issue.
It would be pure illusion to think that social and cultural discrimination against the Roma could be abolished before accession.
That will take decades to achieve.
But we are asking all applicant states to develop credible strategies to improve the integration of the Roma and to put them into practice before accession.
I can also at last see light at the end of the tunnel as regards the condition of orphanage children and the adoption trade in Romania.
I want to be cautious because we have already experienced many disappointments, and in the past many fine words have not been matched by deeds.
But with the present government that is starting to change.
Its readiness to enforce a moratorium on international adoptions was an important sign.
There are such overwhelming indications that the existing system has knowingly and deliberately encouraged the abuse of children that the entire system will have to be radically reformed before international adoptions can be allowed again.
I am convinced that parents who really want children and reputable non-governmental organisations that help them to satisfy that desire will be the first to understand that protecting children against possible abuse must be the top priority.
At this point I should like to mention that the European Parliament' s rapporteur for Romania, Baroness Nicholson, has personally done the greatest service in uncovering an incredibly corrupt system and that the progress we can now see would not have come about without her persistence.
(Applause)
So far as the economic criteria are concerned, even when we apply the necessarily strict yardsticks we can see that here, too, the positive trend is continuing.
Free-market reforms have not yet been completed everywhere, but the market economy has been established everywhere.
In most cases, the applicant countries are already competitive on the internal market because the exchange of goods and services between them and the EU has to a large extent already been liberalised.
The overall economic situation is another matter.
We need to be very, very realistic here.
It is true that the candidate countries are achieving higher growth rates than the EU-15 average, but economically they are still a very long way behind.
It will be a very long time before we can speak of a real approximation.
Here, too, we should be speaking in terms of a period of a whole generation.
This means that, even after the accessions, enlargement will not have a drastic economic effect on the present Member States.
Most of the positive economic effects are already with us.
They will continue to grow.
But enlargement will not at first bring large annual boosts to growth for the EU 15, although, of course, border regions and the future Member States' neighbours in general will experience stronger positive effects.
All the same, the economic effect must not be underestimated.
There will be a sustained improvement in EU growth in the long term.
The European Union' s roll in international competition will be strengthened.
The economics and finance ministers and the Commission are watching the macroeconomic direction taken by the future new members closely.
In some of them, inflation rates and budget deficits are too high.
The balance of payments in some candidate countries has structural weaknesses.
There is intensive dialogue with the candidate countries about macroeconomic stability and there is no dispute about the objective.
In the light of the impending introduction of the euro I want to point out once again that the new members will not automatically belong to the euro zone.
That requires special preparation and a separate decision.
The Maastricht criteria will have to be satisfied in full.
But there will be no opting out of monetary union either.
At present, there are clear priorities: first the Copenhagen criteria for accession, then the Maastricht criteria for the euro.
I can already say that the Commission' s next strategy paper will focus on the assessment of the third Copenhagen criterion, namely the complete application of EU law.
That is a perfectly logical sequence.
Up until now, the main thing was the transposition of the acquis itself.
Now we are looking primarily at the ability to enforce and apply it in full.
As you know, there were still major deficits in this area last year.
We have strongly urged the applicant countries to remove those deficits.
I must repeat here what I said on an earlier occasion: severe deficits remaining in the areas of administrative capacities and the legal system may become serious obstacles to accession.
Before concluding, I want to say a brief word about two regional problems, Cyprus and Kaliningrad.
Our strategic objective is still to receive a united Cyprus as a new member.
We are therefore continuing to give our strong support to the UN Secretary-General' s efforts to find a solution to the Cyprus conflict.
I am very pleased to be able to say that we are working closely and confidently with the United Nations in this question.
It was no accident that the UN Secretary-General' s meeting with the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr Denktash in Salzburg last Tuesday was preceded by a meeting between Mr Denktash and myself the day before.
I must thank the foreign ministers of Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, the presidency and the special representatives of the United Nations, the United Kingdom and the USA for their close cooperation and constructive dialogue in this matter.
I very much hope that things will now get moving again on the Cyprus issue and that talks on substantive issues will soon begin.
We should now concentrate all our efforts on resolving the conflict and refrain from speculating about what we might do if we fail.
The Helsinki resolutions apply and give us all the room for manoeuvre we need.
Kaliningrad is an entirely different matter.
It concerns the effects of enlargement on our neighbours, in this case Russia.
While fully recognising Russian sovereignty over the Kaliningrad territory, we have made proposals to Russia about how Kaliningrad can benefit from its position as a kind of island within the EU in future.
Dialogue in the matter has started, albeit rather sluggishly.
We would like to see a faster tempo here.
The immediate neighbours in the region, Poland and Lithuania, share our point of view.
It is a general principle that enlargement should not harm third countries.
In Russia' s case in particular I am absolutely convinced that Russia will benefit once the political and economic dynamics of the enlarged Union on Russia' s borders show their full effects.
Now one question remains. How can we ensure that people in the European Union and in the candidate countries will agree to the objective of enlargement?
We need to make greater efforts here.
I agree with what Mr Brok said about it.
I have a proper degree of scepticism about opinion polls.
But we cannot ignore the Eurobarometer findings and the trends in opinion in the candidate countries.
However, we must not see the question of acceptance as purely a problem of communication.
If we have problems of communication in politics, in my experience the problem lies with the policy.
Many people are frightened by enlargement.
If those fears are based on fact, we can deal with them by information and participation.
But if the fears are unspecific or part of a very general unease about the way European things are going, then we need more than a communication strategy.
Then, the key issue is: What does Europe still mean to the people in the European Union?
How can we make the idea of European unification as inspiring again as it once was?
If today' s European Union does not inspire people, how can we expect the prospects of an even larger EU to give rise to positive expectations?
The answers to these questions must be found in another debate, but that debate has already begun.
If we can develop clarity of goals and of language, if we can find enough courage and vision, then social acceptance for enlargement will also be forthcoming.
(Applause)
Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to say a word to the Council.
Please do not take it personally, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, we think highly of you, we are always pleased to see you and you do excellent work.
But there were long drawn out negotiations over the date for this debate so as to enable President-in-Office Louis Michel to be present.
Then we agreed on this Tuesday.
Now he has stayed in Durban, which I do not want to criticise in itself, but I would like to say that the Council must be reformed,
that foreign ministers are the wrong people, not only because EU policy is not foreign policy, but because foreign ministers do not have the time to perform their duties in the European Union!
We are going to be talking about governance - Commission President Prodi will be saying something about it later -, and the change must begin with the Council, not only as regards transparency, but we also need new structures so that the relevant members of the national governments are also always present here in Parliament.
In other words, to be specific, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, if you had full powers over European policy and were not now dependent on your foreign minister, we would welcome that.
So that is no personal criticism of yourself.
(Applause)
We are very pleased that there is a broad majority across the groups here in Parliament - and with the Commission, too - on the questions of enlargement, and we say emphatically - as Mr Brok has also said - that enlargement is to everyone' s advantage, and we must say it in our member countries, too.
National politicians, too, must say that enlargement is to the advantage of the present European Union and of the accession countries.
No one would have thought 20 years ago that today we would be talking about the countries of central Europe being able to join our community of values.
That is a tremendous historical development.
And I would also like to say a word of recognition to the accession countries, which have embarked on tremendous reforms after 50 years of communism.
What they are doing is not a simple matter and instead of only ever giving voice, in the countries of the European Union, to certain fears about the dangers we should also say a word of recognition for the people in the accession countries for making this tremendous effort.
(Applause)The accession countries also have dignity.
I cannot understand why heads of government in the countries of the European Union tell the heads of government in the accession countries: Yes, we must demand a long period for freedom of movement because we have national elections.
The accession countries also have dignity and an internal political situation, and our national heads of government ought to recognise that.
(Applause)I do not believe there will be a mass migration.
I have the figures for the Federal Republic of Germany: in the last ten years, 900 000 people came to the Federal Republic of Germany from Poland, but 700 000 of them went back again.
Commissioner, you are quite right: If the countries have the prospect of becoming members of the European Union, their citizens will not migrate but will prefer to stay at home.
That is after all quite natural human behaviour, and so we should not demonise this question or abuse it for internal political reasons.
We need a great deal of flexibility for the questions of freedom of movement.
Commissioner, I very much welcome what you said about border controls.
On the one hand, the borders must remain open, the right to asylum must be guaranteed.
People wanting to enter the Union across the external borders must also be treated humanely, and that is why we advocate a European border police.
We should show solidarity, that is the countries with no external borders with the countries that have an external border.
A European multinational border police would be a sensible way of cultivating mutual solidarity here.
We must, of course, also think of the border regions of the present countries of the European Union, which will have problems, and I note from a press release that you are also particularly sympathetic to the problems of these border regions.
We will also increase acceptance in our border regions.
I would like to draw your attention to one very particular problem, Commissioner, namely developments in Romania.
We were very concerned to see that an opposition party that is not represented in parliament but which has a long tradition, the PNTCD, was banned there last week with dubious legal arguments, and I would ask you to look into the matter, because democracy and debate on a democratic basis are a high value and we ought to pay attention to that in those countries.
A final comment, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck: We know that in your case European policy is in good hands.
We are approaching the Laeken summit, and if the decision about the convention, about a conference, is taken there, would you kindly ensure that the accession countries, too, are involved in the process in a sensible manner for the purpose of consultation and information, because we owe it to those countries because we shall have a common future with them in the European Union.
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if anyone is looking for a juicy bit of controversy between Parliament and the Commission or Parliament and the Council, or even a juicy bit of controversy between the major parties here, I have to disappoint them.
We all want and continue to want to make enlargement a success and it is not a matter for party political sabre rattling, Mr Poettering.
I therefore have no difficulty in signalling to Mr Brok and everyone else that my group will be voting in favour of the resolution tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the enlargement reports and in fact all the country reports.
There may be a difference of emphasis here or there, but over all both the resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the country reports satisfy my group' s principles and criteria for the continuation of the enlargement process.
We also agree with, and support, the Commission' s strategy as explained by Mr Verheugen today.
We stick firmly to the principle of merit for the conclusion of negotiations with the candidate countries, and we also agree to your plan of saying that by 2004 ten candidate countries may have managed to conclude negotiations according to our criteria.
It need not be 10, but it may be 10.
We are prepared for that.
We also agree with attention being shifted in future reports from the transposition of EU law to the application and enforcement of EU law.
That is, in fact, one of the most important points that we must make clear and stick to until the accession treaties are concluded.
But we understand the target date not just as a window of opportunity for the accession countries.
We also see the target date of 2004 as a means of applying pressure on the Member States themselves not only to pay attention to how and to what extent the candidates are solving their problems but also to ensure that the Member States themselves do not create new problems for accession.
And that is the rub if we have set our eyes on the year 2004 as the target date.
Of course - and here I support what Mr Verheugen, Mr Brok and Mr Poettering have said - we shall talk about the risks, the burdens and the deficits of the present enlargement process.
There are many points there.
But if we want to win the people of Europe over to support what we are planning and what we have to do, we must not speak only about burdens and risks.
We must also speak about what all of us in Europe stand to gain from enlargement.
Then let us talk about how reform of the common agricultural policy is naturally about financing and about reform.
That is correct.
But let us also say that it is about strengthening consumer protection in Europe.
Let us say that the security of the Union' s food supply will be preserved and must be further strengthened after enlargement.
Let us say that enlargement presents no risk to environmental protection, on the contrary that in a few years' time EU standards will apply in the whole of Europe and not just in the western part.
That is an advantage for us, too, not just for the east Europeans.
Let us make clear to the people in the EU that we can fight international crime and corruption better in the European Union than if the countries of eastern Europe are left outside, if the laws we have created to fight international crime also apply in eastern Europe.
Let us talk about how enlargement will benefit us all because we will carry more political, economic and also ecological weight in the world, in a world that is becoming increasingly globalised.
That in Europe together we will have more chance of meeting the challenges of globalisation than if we in Europe diverge into east and west or north and south.
And economic and social cohesion, social solidarity in Europe will extend to Europe as a whole, and that is an advantage not only for the east, it is an advantage for us as well.
Funding up until 2006 is secured.
But that does not mean that enlargement will come at no cost.
Most surely not.
It has its price.
But non-enlargement is expensive, too.
It costs much more than enlargement.
Its price is economic, social, ecological and political stability in Europe, above all else its price is trust.
Failure to enlarge will deprive Europe of its future.
Basically, we are on the point of taking a step comparable to the situation in 1989/1990 for the whole of Europe.
What is at stake is not merely one or other transitional period, not that this or that project or programme or fund will work better or worse.
Neither is it only about this or that advantage for one country or another.
It is about something very simple: It is about the future of all Europeans.
And there we are only at the start of the debate.
After the failure of Nice we are also setting great hopes on the Belgian Presidency.
This debate about the future of Europe must not be conducted only in the Member States, it must also be conducted in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and in Cyprus and Malta.
Mr President, since our debate last year on enlargement, there has been very considerable and commendable progress.
During this past year, several of the states in the Helsinki group have already in effect caught up with those in the earlier Luxembourg group.
It is a year where the emphasis and the Ã©lan which was brought to this task by the Swedish Presidency has borne fruit.
This is a process that I am sure will be continued and deepened by our friends in the Belgian Presidency.
I welcome the fact that the European Council, with the encouragement of the European Commission, adopted the date of the next European election as a target timetable, all the while emphasising and respecting the fact that we should continue with a case by case analysis based on differentiation.
It may well indeed be possible that ten states could be ready by that time and if that is the case, that would be very welcome.
But we should not impose on those who are ready by that time the burden and failures of those who may not be and therefore we must still cleave to this notion of differentiation as the leitmotif through which we should analyse the outcomes.
There is a very disquieting level of public support indicated by opinion polls.
The Commissioner is right in that we should not get carried away excessively by following every poll but when they are so consistent, underneath it there is a message.
And again I would congratulate the Commission in the past 12 months on the deepening and extension of the information and communications policy.
But it is very clear that that alone will not be enough.
We need political leadership and political vision.
We need the big picture to be put in place to convince people what the nature of this historic project is of.
In that regard there is the question of the free movement of labour.
I am bound to say on behalf of my own group that the Liberal Democrats here in this House are unhappy at the pace with which the thought of having a systematic ban on the free movement of labour became the politique acquise.
We think that indeed there may be a burden but more empiricism and more reflection may have helped.
At the end of the day whether it is realpolitik or empiricism that brings us to this conclusion, my group would appeal that each Member State would reflect on its own position and where possible would opt out from this particular policy.
Already I understand four states, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden and Netherlands have given such an indication.
I would appeal to other states to do so.
But inside this there is another real issue.
The frontline border regions are the regions of our European integration process.
We here in this House must express our concern for an enhancement of regional policy focus in those places because these regions will carry the most immediate consequence of enlargement.
This solidarity is something we must inject into this debate, as Europeans, with greater vigour and not simply leave it to local or national interests to make the case.
On the question of the current state of the enlargement debate, I meet many friends in the candidate states in politics and diplomacy who worry about various tensions that have emerged.
My own sense is to say to them they should take reassurance from this.
We are now getting real.
The shadow boxing has finished and these tensions reflect the reality that we are now in a vigorous process.
Finally three very quick points which I do not have the time to develop.
I should like to be reassured by the Commission that the failure to establish paying agencies for Sapard in so many states for reasons which I understand will not mitigate against the carryover of funding that we have dedicated for structural agricultural reform.
Secondly, I welcome what the Commissioner had to say on Cyprus and Kaliningrad.
I salute what he says about the optimum desires for Cyprus and I hope the UN process will take off with his and others' encouragement but we must remember never to make the best the enemy of the good.
Finally, on the question of the Irish referendum, the message given both by the Council and the Commission today is an important one.
Yes there may be legal means to get us over the legal niceties but there is within this a political signal and message and the signal must be, that however we may criticise the Nice Treaty, and we all do, we must get over that hurdle as a precondition politically not to do with enlargement but to do it ourselves.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner, first of all I would like to say on behalf of my group that we are extremely pleased that during the year now ended negotiations have truly made rapid progress and it has been possible to close one chapter after another.
My group truly regards 2004 as a target timetable by which it is possible - not certain, but possible - that as many as ten new countries may join the European Union.
Simultaneous accession by such a large group would,, of course, bring the advantage that we would avoid new division lines between the applicant countries, and in my opinion this is something which we must earnestly strive towards.
Mr HÃ€nsch did a fine job of explaining how the enlargement process is one in which both the current and the future Member States of the European Union will benefit: everyone can benefit from this.
I wish however to stress that this means that we must truly be able to create an economic and social dynamic so that these benefits will be realised even in the pre-accession period.
Here I wish to stress the emphasis which my group places on this point: sustainable development must be sustainable not only economically, but also ecologically and socially.
We need to emphasise that the applicant countries must take very seriously any Community legislation which aims to strengthen these sustainable characteristics.
It goes without saying that children's rights and the principle of non-discrimination are the sort of principles to which we, as Europeans, must hold fast.
Mr. President, our group hopes that it would be possible to deploy additional resources in order to expedite this dynamic.
Here we refer to the fact that the Community's funding framework for the years 2000-2006 contains some resources which could possibly be freed, since quite obviously no new Member States will be joining in 2002.
Those resources which are freed on account of this fact could be deployed, even in the pre-accession period, as tools of agricultural and structural policy in order to strengthen this positive dynamic.
We would like to see the common agricultural policy strongly reformed in such a direction that, instead of making direct aid payments to large farmers in the European Union or in the applicant countries, these resources would be firmly shifted to rural development and quality-oriented food production.
Finally, Mr President, one very important shortcoming in this process is that the involvement of citizens has, up to now, been particularly poor.
We would like to take part in serious consideration of how we could increase the participation of ordinary citizens in the enlargement process also in the applicant countries, since at the moment what is happening is that it is only the narrow Ã©lites of society who find enlargement to their advantage, and it is these people who are pushing enlargement.
A great many people, however, are perplexed, and fear that enlargement will be to their detriment.
The position of women and the fight against poverty must be taken into account, and our group would like to emphasise these matters.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, on behalf of my group I should like to say that we - at least the vast majority - consider the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to the European Union to be of strategic importance and we strongly support this accession process.
Madam President-in-Office, if you have compared this accession process with others, I think it must be made even clearer that this accession process is qualitatively quite different, not only because of the number of countries, the languages, the territory, the population, but also historically, because it is a far-reaching cultural opening towards Central and Eastern Europe such as has hardly been discussed before, because it is an economic and social challenge on an entirely new scale, and, of course, also because of the far-reaching foreign and security policy implications.
In the light of that, my agreement to what many of the previous speakers have said must be qualified.
I think the policies pursued by the governments and also by the Commission are seriously flawed, even though I do recognise the commitment you have shown, Commissioner Verheugen, the progress made in negotiations and the great support given by the EU to the accession process.
I would like to highlight five questions:
Firstly, in my opinion the involvement of the citizens has been minimal.
Secondly, hardly any attempt is being made to use the opportunity presented by eastward enlargement to overcome the Nice crisis and for the democratic and social shaping of European integration.
Thirdly, equality for the accession countries has not in my opinion been adequately achieved.
That applies to the question, which has already been raised, of the excessively long transitional periods for the free movement of workers just as much as to the lack of clarity that is now emerging over transfers to agriculture.
Fourthly, I have to say clearly that the Commission' s recent decision on funding for border regions is irresponsible.
A year ago, Mr Verheugen, you made quite different promises in the regions concerned.
You are being measured against them there and I am measuring you against them.
As you well know and others here have already mentioned, these are the very regions, above all others, where expansion will be experienced directly.
Whosoever wants it to be an economic, social and political success and not a breeding ground for nationalist sentiment must change this position.
Fifthly, I find it totally unsatisfactory that the number of Czech and Hungarian members of this Parliament was decided undemocratically in Nice and that that has still not been changed.
Mr HÃ€nsch, I was also surprised that the amendment I tabled in the matter to the report on the Czech Republic was supported by the European People' s Party and others in the Committee on Foreign Affairs but was not supported by the majority of the Social Democrats.
Whether that was out of deference to the national governments that decided it, I do not know.
At any rate we should agree that Parliament will in this matter be calling uncompromisingly for a change.
I would like to thank everyone, including Mr Brok, for their reports.
I believe that here, too, a critical, thoughtful attitude was formulated towards many aspects of the eastward enlargement strategy.
But I would also like to draw attention to two differences, which in part also affect other reports.
The first is the stereotypical concentration on economic and social deregulation and privatisation at the expense of social division and destruction which, given the scale of it, are unacceptable.
The second difference concerns Mr Brok' s report.
When it says that the expansion of the EU and NATO are sensible complements to each other, I would think that eastern enlargement of the EU also offers prospects for a productive and cooperative shaping of the relationship between Europe and Russia.
But NATO expansion, especially under the conditions of current US and NATO policy, is in my view fraught with serious and in part incalculable risks.
Finally, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office, it remains my great wish that the citizens might be able to experience EU enlargement as something that concerns them not primarily through glossy brochures, but that they might help to shape it as a democratic, social and ecological reality.
Mr President, the enlargement of the European Union is an irreversible process. We must be quite clear about this.
The conclusions of the GÃ¶teborg Summit of EU leaders with regard to the enlargement negotiations and the accession process stated that the road map should make it possible for those countries that are ready to complete negotiations by the end of 2002.
I am confident that, under the Belgian Presidency of the European Union, extensive progress will be made with regard to the enlargement negotiations.
Key chapters of discussions which it was said will be opened during the Belgian presidency include competition policy, transport, energy, taxation, customs union, veterinary and hygiene aspects of agriculture, fisheries, justice and home affairs, and financial control.
The aim of concluding the enlargement negotiations with the more advanced countries by the end of 2002 is an achievable objective.
The leading candidates are provisionally closing chapters at an impressive rate and the leading candidate country, Cyprus, now has 23 chapters concluded.
But it is equally important that the European Union and the applicant countries get down to negotiating the more difficult chapters of talks, which to date have remained closed.
It is in the interests of all contracting parties that the bottom line issues that remain outstanding are debated, resolved and finalised.
We must all continue to play an active and constructive role in the enlargement process.
The enlargement of the Union is an economic and political opportunity for Europe.
The expansion of the single market should be of real and tangible interest to European exporters and to indigenous European companies seeking investment abroad.
On a continental level, the enlargement of the European Union will contribute to further stability.
An enlarged Union will be able to play a more positive and influential role internationally, both politically and economically.
It will help to consolidate democratic and civil structures in eastern and central Europe. It will contribute to the development of greater free market economies.
Our input into organisations such as the World Trade Organisation would be very much strengthened by the enlargement of the European Union.
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, I would like to take this opportunity of restating that the result of the Nice Treaty referendum in Ireland should not be interpreted or construed as a vote against the enlargement of the European Union.
Irish public opinion is strongly in favour of the enlargement process, as indicated by a recent Eurobarometer poll which found that 59% of the Irish people were in favour of the enlargement of the Union.
This figure is the second highest amongst the 15 Member States of the European Union.
Hopefully this Eurobarometer poll will be reflected when the Irish electorate next have an opportunity of making a decision on the issue.
Welcome
We are joined in the public gallery by many friends, politicians and diplomats from the applicant countries.
You are most welcome to the House.
I hope you are enjoying the debate and finding it constructive.
Progress of the 12 candidate countries in 2000 (continuation)
Mr President, Commissioner, this morning' s debate on enlargement has revealed considerable convergence of approaches and methods as well.
Moreover, it was observed on several occasions that enlargement is not just a matter of extending the Union geographically, economically and politically, of integrating 10, 12 or maybe 13 countries, mainly in Central and Eastern Europe, which have survived the tragic experience of 50 years of communism, but that, in enlargement, the Union itself is at stake.
It was President Prodi, in what is probably his best speech as President which he delivered at the University of Lublin, who said and I quote, "European integration is dependent on a shared understanding of what policy goals should be pursued in the Union" .
This does not, of course, simply mean that we must monitor carefully the candidate countries' respect for the three Copenhagen criteria: freedom, democracy and human rights, a competitive market economy able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union, and gradual incorporation of the Community acquis which, as Commissioner Verheugen pointed out this morning, also requires full incorporation of European law, which has proved to be maybe the most difficult part of the process for the candidate countries.
No, it is indeed a question of discussing, rethinking and reviving a European project all over again.
Neither can we expect immediately, so to speak, an easy outcome of the reforms, which are sometimes just institutional hot air.
As both Commissioner Barnier and Commissioner Lamy rightly observed, we cannot discuss the institutional reforms if we do not first define a political project.
Implementation cannot precede conception or else we will become so used to not saying what Europe does that we will not even know what Europe is.
What, then, is the project on which we should initially focus the debate of Parliament' s, the only genuinely democratic institution and maybe the only institution which is capable of involving the public as well?
A Europe which has a federal currency, an intergovernmental defence policy and an open economic market area clearly has considerable potential, but also areas of considerable confusion.
Some are of the opinion that these areas of confusion can be resolved by drawing up another document following on from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in other words a genuine Constitution; others wonder whether we really need a European Constitution, a form of constitutional patriotism based on the German model which is supposed to provide patriotism which would not otherwise exist.
For others, at the heart of the project lies enhancing and increasing economic cooperation around the euro, and, more then any other characteristic, this would make Europe' s relationship with globalisation clear and would indicate our ability to be a genuinely global force, at least at European level.
For still others, the core concern, the crux of the matter is the need for a foreign and security policy which is truly common.
Well then, if I may focus on this point for a moment, the debate which took place just this morning on the Middle East revealed that this is, if not the heart of the project, certainly the centre of our difficulties.
Commissioner Patten rightly said, this morning, that we feel that we have been frustrated in our desire to contribute to the peace process or, to be more accurate, the resumption of negotiations or, more precisely still, cease-fires in Palestine, by the events which have been repeated during the last few hours.
I am, of course, pleased to hear that anti-Semitic school books are not being financed with European funds, but, frankly, I do not think that this should be the focal point of the debate we must initiate within the Union.
What is missing is politics, political decisions, political action such as, for example with regard to the Middle East, the accession of Israel to the European Union as proposed so often by our radical friends and others. This decision would genuinely change the course of events, providing a new security policy and, at the same time, committing Israel and the entire region to it.
There you are, focusing on these issues - strengthening the euro, adapting the institutions and a genuinely common foreign and security policy - will give the European project what it lacks today and what enlargement requires of us.
Mr President, the June movement is voting in favour of enlargement, but the agreements must also be so good for the candidate countries that their electorates are inspired to vote in favour.
The EU Summit must learn from the referendums in Denmark and Ireland.
Given the way in which the enlargement negotiations are at present going, a majority of people in one or more countries is going to vote against.
Keeping documents and correspondence secret is a sure way of creating mistrust.
People will think that the EU has something to hide when it does not dare to produce documentation.
For a couple of years now, I have been trying to obtain a non-bureaucratic electronic copy of the rules the candidate countries have to accept.
The Commission still refuses to produce such a document.
Why not do voters the service of putting all papers on the Internet so that they can be read in Karup and Prague, Bogense and Budapest?
I am not demanding that internal negotiating positions or military secrets be made publicly available. However, papers that are to result in laws must be made available now.
We must also discuss whether we are making the correct demands of the candidate countries.
Where and when have our people demonstrated in favour of being able to buy cheap land in the countries of Eastern Europe?
Might we not offer transitional arrangements concerning agricultural and recreational land until such time as the countries concerned have, for example, 90% of our income?
Who in the West has any desire to pay subsidies to people in Eastern Europe whom we are forcing out of their jobs?
Might we not allow extended transitional arrangements so that they can adapt to competition in the common market but be allowed to protect local markets until such time as they are more competitive?
Might we not be a little more magnanimous and much more flexible?
Why not allow the 12 candidate countries to be involved in devising the basis for cooperation in the next treaty?
Why not disregard the Treaty of Nice and create a treaty which can be adopted in referendums in all the countries - a treaty in favour of an open, slimmer, freer and more democratic Europe?
The prospect of membership would then create enthusiasm among people and increase the turnouts at elections in such a way as to produce large majorities in favour of enlargement.
People want to be united instead of divided Let that be the challenge.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its report on the progress of the Czech Republic, the Commission writes, and I quote: "The Czech Republic continues to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria."
This is a remarkable statement.
The Commission's report does not contain a single word about the Benes Decrees.
The Commission overlooks the fact that upholding the Benes Decrees, which justify the expulsion and murder of many thousands of people after the Second World War, is clearly contrary to the accession criteria established by the Community.
The Czech Republic's stance, that it does not wish to repeal them, amounts to a disregard for fundamental basic values and human rights which the EU expressly upholds.
This means that Europe is sending out a signal which does lasting damage to the EU's credibility on matters of fundamental and human rights.
As a representative of Austria I should also like to say a word on Temelin.
Temelin has significant safety defects.
The Commission's report on the safety of Temelin also confirms that Austria's misgivings about the reactor are justified.
Notwithstanding this, the Czech Republic is trying, by activating the reactor, to present us with a fait accompli.
This is not the kind of behaviour that we expect when working in a partnership.
The place to resolve this problem is Brussels.
I await a European initiative to close it down.
Commissioner Verheugen, you described Temelin as the safest nuclear power station in Europe.
This is not only not very helpful, it is also counterproductive if we are to identify a strategy for abandoning the site which is acceptable to everyone.
We will resume this debate at 3 o'clock.
Mr President, I have taken the floor to inform the Members that, last night, responding during a debate on the oral questions tabled by Mr Harbour and Mrs Guy-Quint, Mr Kinnock said and confirmed that all the Members of Parliament would receive the Commission' s written answers last night, and the Vice-President of the Commission invoked this information in support of his answers to the Members present last night who did not know anything about this.
When I checked, I found that these documents did not arrive either yesterday or this morning, and it is not known when they will arrive.
I have mentioned this because - in view of the tone of yesterday' s debate - if the members of the Commission could manage to give the Members of Parliament correct information and not say one thing and do another, I feel that this would be an absolutely essential achievement.
We will take that up with the Commission services and see if we can get it to you as quickly as possible.
I am sure that if there was a commitment, it will be met.
Mr President, in relation to what Mr Dell'Alba has said I simply wanted to report, without wishing to defend the Commission, that I also spoke to the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Kinnock, today and apparently the reports are already on their way.
There has been a technical problem, so no one was being devious; there was just a technical hitch.
Mr President, as the joint initiator and author of this question, perhaps I might be allowed to say a brief word.
I also met Mr Kinnock this morning to discuss yesterday's responses.
His services told me that the report had actually been sent to Parliament yesterday for distribution to Members.
So that is something that should be looked at, because Mr Kinnock made it clear yesterday that the Commission was keen to give Members a response straight away to the detail of my question.
We ought to investigate this.
If the Commission sent the report to Parliament, it is our responsibility that it has not been circulated.
If the delay was on the part of the Commission, we should ask why there was a delay.
We will have a look at that and try to discover what has gone wrong.
VOTE
According to my text, it is quite clear.
It says: "... and the strengthening of European citizenship".
That is the text that we are voting on.
(Parliament adopted the resolution) President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Hans-Peter Mayer report (A5-0243/2001)
Mr President, Mr Mayer' s document is the first stage in the adoption of the directives on the European company, the European limited-liability company.
Only yesterday, when I spoke during the debate, I said that the European company is a good thing, so good that I could see myself celebrating the success of the European limited-liability company by swimming in a bath tub full of euros.
I would like to continue yesterday' s discourse by saying that many pensioners came in to see me and asked: "Seeing as you are swimming in gold, why do you not create a European pension as well, so that we pensioners can all become rich as well like the European limited-liability companies?"
I hope that there will soon be a European pension.
Mr President, I welcome the fact that at long last we have resolved this issue of the European Company Statute.
It is logical that if we have a single market there should be a single system of company registration, which ought to make registration simpler and reduce red tape.
In the defence industries in the last few years we have had considerable cross-border cooperation and consolidation but we have not helped those companies because we have not provided them with a single company structure.
Hopefully this will now do that.
We also have to bear in mind that there are other issues that have to be addressed, such as the manner in which companies are taxed and the way that is approached.
And if we are really to encourage transnational consolidation, we have to look at the question of how pension funds are dealt with so that people are able to take their pensions with them when working within a single company structure.
. Madame President, I, like many of my colleagues, was very happy to see that after 30 years of negotiations and many false starts, we eventually had a compromise text on a European Company Statute.
I fully supported the text as adopted by the Council.
However, I was and I am totally opposed to the amendments which have been adopted and which support the harmonisation of taxes.
We all wish to see the ability for companies to operate on an EU basis under one common regulatory system.
This can potentially lead to employment and assist economic growth throughout the Union.
Over the past decade, Ireland has been progressively reducing its taxation which has been led to an increase in employment, an increase in budget surplus and continued sustainable growth.
I am opposed to the standardisation or harmonisation of taxes and these issues can be and must be dealt with by means of co-ordinated measures.
. (PT) As we all know, this proposal for a directive has been under discussion since 1970 and, despite the very basic agreement concluded at the Nice European Council, with the creation of a regulation on the statute and a proposal on the involvement of workers, the first step was nevertheless taken to make the European Company a legal entity.
The fundamental aim of the European Company is to eliminate any obstacles to the mobility and functioning of companies that operate on a European scale, enabling them to merge and allowing multinational companies to extend their business activities to other countries in the European Union, thereby increasing the benefits of the Euro and the internal market.
Furthermore, the European Company is seeking to create a statute for a supranational society, giving an identity and a face to European capital.
The current regulation, therefore, broaches mainly constitutional issues, and calls for Community and national law to fill existing loopholes in legislation.
It is not by chance that the rapporteur mainly focuses on the issues of harmonising tax provisions and creating a uniform framework in other areas, such as competition, worker participation and insolvency.
The rapporteur is also seeking to use this regulation to establish a connection with the Directive on the involvement of employees and expresses concern at the situation of SMEs. Nonetheless, the aim of the regulation is to serve the huge multinationals and the interests of UNICE [Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe].
Consequently, the proposal on the participation of workers itself is inadequate. The amendments tabled by the ELDR Group are even more unacceptable and we have, therefore, voted against them.
A Statute for a European Company has been a subject of discussion in the EU since the Seventies.
Together with the Directive on employee participation, the European Company Statute known as SociÃ©tÃ© EuropÃ©enne (SE), upon which the Nice Summit agreed, appears to be as far as it is possible to go, given the different legislation of the 15 Member States.
We support the Council' s proposal and reject the amendments demanding uniform EU rules on taxation.
Mr President, I do not wish to make an explanation of vote.
I am simply here to listen to colleagues' explanations of vote, in particular Mr Fatuzzo's, and I would earnestly request that you do something about the level of noise here.
This shows an unacceptable lack of respect for those who are making explanations of vote.
I know the problem.
We can all sympathise with you, but it is very difficult to get colleagues to leave the Chamber quietly.
They always have something else to do.
However, we will make that point as often as we can.
Menrad report (A5-0231/2001)
Mr President, Mr Posselt, not only is there a great deal of noise while I am delivering explanations of vote, but I discovered this morning that an amendment to the Rules of Procedure has been tabled by Mrs Bastos, a Portuguese lady, proposing to reduce the number of explanations of vote and to force Mr Fatuzzo to shut up.
I support this initiative, although it will still have to be voted upon in the House, when I will learn to what extent Mr Fatuzzo' s explanations of vote are appreciated. With regard to Mr Menrad' s report, Mr Fatuzzo voted for the motion for he considers that it is right for workers to be informed about what will happen to them when their company closes.
I call for not just the workers but the ex-workers, the pensioners of such companies to be consulted as well.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the positive outcomes of the Treaty of Nice is the European Company and we are now debating this in the context of Mr Menrad's report on the involvement of employees, which I welcome.
My concern is simply that if we constantly extend workers' rights and in particular if we lower thresholds, as is the case in this report - from 1000 employees to 500 for the rules on worker participation to be applied - we will place too great a burden on this European Company.
The European Company is supposed to attract companies to Europe.
This new company model is intended to open up Europe as a business location and make it more attractive.
That is why it is also necessary, in particular where worker participation is concerned, for us to keep a sense of proportion and not to burden the companies adopting this model with these new rights in such a way that it is simply no longer of interest to those who wish either to enter Europe or to use the European Company to be more mobile within the European single market.
In my view sufficient account has not been taken of this and that is why I have voted against.
The European Council directive claims to grant additional rights to the workers of European companies.
These so-called rights are simply the participation of workers' representatives in 'the SE' s administrative or supervisory body' .
Even by taking Parliament' s amendments into account, these minority representatives will not be able to influence any decisions.
Furthermore, the legislator wants to ban them and even their freedom of expression with fellow workers by imposing a confidentiality clause on them.
As a result, these representatives are only summoned when required to approve their employers' policy or to be silenced.
We refuse to approve this farce.
That is why we abstained from voting on this text.
I believe that it is important to mention the background to this proposal for a directive, which seeks to supplement the regulation on the European Company with regard to the involvement of workers.
The first proposal for a European Commission regulation dates back to 1970 and was presented to the European Parliament at the end of the 1980s.
Some of the core elements of this directive are the binding provisions concerning the participation of employees' representatives, the information and consultation requirements within the administrative or supervisory bodies and the obligation to obtain authorisation before implementing decisions such as shutting down or relocating establishments, cutting back or expanding establishments, changing establishments, the establishment of subsidiaries or holding companies. Election procedures and the working methods of employees' representatives should follow normal practice in the Member State concerned.
These proposals have failed on the issue of participation.
A great deal more negotiating was needed before the Nice European Council reached agreement on 20 December 2000.
The proposal for a directive governing information and consultation of workers specifies that the scale of participation will be decided through free negotiations between the companies concerned and the workers represented by a special negotiating body.
Should the result of the negotiations lead to a reduction of participation rights, the majority required for a decision to approve such an agreement shall be the votes of two thirds of the members of the special negotiating body representing at least two thirds of the employees.
In the event of a breakdown of negotiations, a safety clause is provided to protect participation rights.
The purpose of the amendments made by the European Parliament is to establish minimum requirements for information, participation and consultation of employees; to harmonise the national implementing provisions of the Member States, since acquired rights are not called into question; to ensure that even in the case of substantial structural changes after an SE has been created, negotiations on employee participation are planned to take place at a later date; to lay down clear rules on management' s obligation to provide information, specifying areas to which this obligation applies; to ensure that the election or appointment of workers' representatives to the SE' s administrative or surveillance body shall take place according to the legal provisions of the Member States.
I must conclude by saying that I voted in favour of the amendment to change the legal basis of this proposal.
In my view, the European Parliament must use the co-decision procedure for a piece of legislation that concerns 75% of European workers.
Thirty years of difficult negotiations, exemptions and exceptions, a legal basis that only serves to give illegitimate powers to the Commission in Brussels, an attempt to transform a directive into a regulation using an implementation group.
Undeniably, the Statute for a European Company is a real labyrinth and economic and political actors are hardly enthusiastic about it, to put it mildly.
In truth, the only benefit of the European Company is that it is being imposed as if it were a true component of supranational law - it certainly is similar to the single currency, being an ideological construction that seeks to forcibly replace national structures and impose an uncontrollable level of Community decision-making.
Some claim to be concerned about workers' rights.
The Directive, however, clearly bypasses these rights in favour of the unquestionable right of the management board to create a European Company.
The Directive even allows a reduction in the right of workers to participation.
So this is simply another stage in the unrelenting globalisation process, which begins with everything at European-level being made uniform.
In this scenario, it would be an obvious advantage for all the ultra-liberals to have a workforce, which is also globalised and has the least amount of rights possible.
This is bordering on a perverse interpretation of global worker unification, as the so-called anti-globalisation left-wing extremists are now calling for, with the help of many slogans.
The greatest perversion of all undeniably resides in the objective alliance between capitalist internationalism and subversive or Marxist internationalism, which aims to impose levels of decision-making which override nations, their democratically appointed governments and their democratically elected parliaments.
And yet the nation is the only level at which social and political legislation for workers, freedoms and prosperity for all exists and can be defended best.
- (NL) Society cannot survive without businesses which produce goods and provide services.
However, that should not lead us to overlook the fact that businesses can also form a threat to society.
They want as low taxes as possible, as little worker participation as possible and as few rules as possible to protect against environmental pollution and animal torture.
Large businesses, in particular, are out to make the highest possible profits for the owners and also often to secure the highest possible share options for management.
In many cases, the pursuit of profits clashes with the pursuit of the healthiest possible living environment, the prevention of work-related illnesses, a safe working environment, democratic decision-making and the desirability of sufficient financial means to pay for public services.
That is why it is necessary to arrange for as much openness as possible, so that society as a whole can co-determine the actions of businesses.
Moreover, businesses which infringe rules should not under any circumstance receive contributions from European funds.
Menrad report (A5-0282/2001)
Mr President, a few days ago, I was on Lake Como, admiring the beauty of this wonderful Italian lake from a boat.
While I was in the boat, I met a worker, who said to me: "I am very pleased that you are going to adopt the Menrad report, which will mean that I, a worker, will be informed of the day when I will be made redundant.
I will know it a long time in advance, so this is certainly good news!
But why is it that workers are not informed not just of when they will be made redundant but also of when they will receive a pension, how large that pension will be and, in short, of everything it is important for workers to know about their pensions?
As things stand, they receive no information at all."
- (DA) We have voted in favour of Amendment No 4, not because we are opposed to appropriate sanctions in the event of employers' or employee representatives' not complying with the directive but because we are opposed to paragraph 2 of Article 2, no. xiii) which may create difficulties for national agreement-based systems which at present operate very well.
We did not want a negative vote to prevent the progress of this report, thus taking into account the desire of many of the trade unions.
By abstaining however, we are showing our rejection of the proposals, which, on the pretext of increasing the rights of workers, have obviously been written with employers' interests in mind.
The report talks of 'competitive needs' but disregards the need to provide workers with the right to live and earn a wage.
The author of the report perceives helping employers as a need.
Yet, when it comes to workers' rights, these are immediately restricted to the right to be informed about the redundancies that are to be made - preventing them is out of the question.
Workers' councils are being refused the simple right of veto, even though, faced with an increase in collective redundancies, often in large companies which have been making huge profits for many years, a simple ban on redundancies would be enough to protect workers.
So, what exactly is this 'partnership between employers and workers' advocated by the report, where one of the partners has the right to take decisions which ruin the life of so many workers, even an entire region, and where the other partner has no rights, not even the right to safeguard his job?
.
UK Conservatives believe in the principle of works councils. But we also consider that it is for companies and their employees to decide what best works for them rather than for the EU to set out one-size-fits-all legislation.
Works councils should provide a bridge between employers and employees.
Over-prescriptive legislation can turn them into a barrier.
Flexibility, not rigidity, is required.
The one area where there is a need for greater legal certainty is the issue of confidentiality at a time of mergers and take-overs.
We are no further forward on this.
.
(FR) Firstly, I would like to remind you that the main objective of Directive 94/45/EC is to eliminate any obstacles to informing, consulting and communicating with employees in Community-scale companies.
It is true that this directive has been transposed within the allotted time frame.
It is also true that its application has led to the creation of numerous European works councils.
Approximately 650 works councils have thus been set up in companies that employ at least 1000 people, with at least 150 of these in two Member States.
However, there are still 1 800 companies in the EU that meet the conditions, especially in relation to thresholds over which, according to the Directive' s provisions, a European Works Council should be set up.
Furthermore, the recent large-scale restructuring operations and redundancies that have highlighted the gaps in European legislation are still fresh in everyone' s minds.
It is unacceptable for employees to find out about decisions affecting their company through the media.
We are accountable to European citizens, who are ever more doubtful of the existence of a European social model.
This period of industrial change should prompt us to think carefully about how we can improve existing arrangements.
It is exactly this that the report from the Parliamentary Committee on Employment and Social Affairs sets out to do, for, on the occasion of this application report, it outlines the direction to be taken by the European Commission when it drafts a proposal for an amendment to the European Works Council Directive (scheduled for 2002).
This will be a matter of implementing the following improvements: precise definition of the concepts of information and consultation of workers; a general obligation to call extraordinary meetings of the European Works Council, as quickly as is possible and at an opportune time; the implementation of a consolidated consultation procedure on particular questions, specifically involving workers; the lowering of the threshold relating to the number of employees in companies affected by the directive from 1000 to 500 employees for a whole company and from 150 to 100 per establishment in at least two Member States; the establishment of penalties, at national and European level, to be applied in cases where the Directive is not respected.
I would therefore also ask the European Commission to incorporate these suggestions into its proposal for an amendment to the European Works Council Directive.
.
(FR) Less than 5% of the companies affected by the 1994 Works Councils Directive have meetings for employee representatives more than twice a year; 60% have not even set up works councils and, in the rare cases where they have been set up, it has been to the detriment of the representation of workers in national companies particularly in terms of time set aside for consultation and training.
This is a good illustration of the refusal of employers to inform and consult workers' representatives and their intention to decide alone on the fate of millions of employees.
The latest redundancy programmes drawn up by the management at AOM, Marks & Spencer, Lu-Danone and even Moulinex have, once again, shown that the interests of managers and small investors are completely opposed to those of employees and the needs of the population.
Today, the most important thing for employees faced with looming unemployment is the chance to block these redundancies, not just to have been told about them beforehand and by different means.
The resolution' s proposals relating to redundancies are merely symbolic and have no meaning for the thousands of employees that have already lost their jobs.
We support all the provisions that facilitate better information and more rights for employee representatives and all the measures which provide more resources to bring about the mobilisation necessary to thwart managers' plans.
- (NL) No business can operate without the people who do the work.
The shop floor has great insight into what goes wrong and how things can be improved.
That insight is often ignored; after all, these workers are not hired to pass judgement.
According to traditional power relations, only ownership and management count.
Workers seem nothing but a necessary evil who are completely irrelevant to the business and who are only hired temporarily from the outside world.
In the case of reorganisations, it is the shareholders and managers who make the decisions; the workers feature at the bottom of the list.
Thousands of people are asked to leave because another product requiring other skills is deemed more profitable, because production is shifted to a country where wages are lower or even because the business wants to penalise the workers for wanting better working conditions.
Unfortunately, the rapporteur is not suggesting that workers should be given the right to free access to information and to suspensive veto.
If suspensive veto were to be applied during restructuring, alternatives could first be considered and developed in full public view and with the use of all the expertise available, and the monopoly of management and owners of the businesses would subsequently be broken.
Blokland report (A5-0267/2001)
.
(FR) The fact that, after eight years of negotiations, the European authorities cannot even obtain reliable information on the production of waste, particularly industrial waste, and its treatment, is indicative of their powerlessness.
This is one way in which they have shown their incapacity to follow a policy in this field that is capable of limiting environmental pollution and preventing environmental disasters now or in the future.
The explanatory statement clearly records that "no agreement was reached" between Member States, that there was "considerable opposition in the Council" and that there was rejection by "business".
The treatment of certain types of waste, particularly from the nuclear, chemical and petroleum industries, requires cooperation on an international level, yet the powerlessness of the European authorities mirrors the intentional powerlessness of Member States.
Neither wants to clash with the private interests of large industrial groups or to impose upon them draconian measures that could reduce their profits, in order to preserve society' s environmental interests.
We have abstained because the proposals in this report are too vague.
Koukiadis report (A5-0250/2001)
.
(FR) We have voted resolutely against the Koukiadis report because, with a frighteningly clear conscience, it proposes to increase control measures to better apply Community Law, without first ascertaining whether the rapid rise in cases of poorly executed application could be indicative of the widening of the gap between Europe and its citizens.
Nowhere does the report ponder the thought that poor application may be the result of a kind of defensive reaction from nations or individuals against legislation that they feel is alien to them, too finicky, or adopted according to anti-democratic processes.
The solutions put forward intermittently in the European Parliament' s or Commission' s reports consist of increasing supranationality, increasing penalties and facilitating a swifter and more direct application of Community Law by increasingly bypassing national Parliaments.
In the recent Commission White Paper on European governance, there is even the astounding theory that European Law is too meticulous because the Council and Parliament are greatly increasing the amount of detail, because they do not have enough confidence in the Commission.
It would therefore, I suppose, be a better idea to give this institution a freer hand in order to improve the quality of Community Law.
Specifically, there are currently the stirrings of a movement aiming to speed up the transposal of directives into national legislation, employing rapid methods such as orders, as used recently by the French government.
These methods, which dispense with the fundamental role of national Parliaments, can only aggravate this gap between Community Law and the situations of Member States.
On the other hand, the only solution is to restore the role of nations and national Parliaments in the European decision-making process.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 13.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Mr President, I am interested in knowing what has become of the Commission - the Commissioner is there, we did not see you just now - and whether the Council is also going to take part in this important debate on the individual countries, which does actually constitute the substantive debate on enlargement.
I am very disappointed that this does not seem to be the case.
Perhaps you could note this in a suitable letter.
I believe that it shows a lack of respect for this Parliament if this important debate on the individual countries, which really is a central component of the enlargement process, is not followed by the Council.
Progress of the 12 candidate countries in 2000 (continuation)
Mrs Schroedter, you have been a little too hasty in your remarks.
I was still reading the reason why we are here, continuing the debate, after which I was going to tell the House why Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck has not yet arrived.
She is engaged here, in Parliament, in a meeting of committee chairmen who have requested her presence.
As soon as the meeting finishes she will join us.
Commissioner Verheugen, on the other hand, arrived punctually, in the middle of your speech.
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the progress of the 12 candidate countries in 2000.
In addition, I have received a motion for resolution in accordance with Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, it is now ten years since Estonia won back its independence.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world has become more secure, and our European home is now more dynamic and inspires more hope.
The conditions for European cooperation changed radically when the Wall came down, and the EU has so far been able to live up to these.
The presence of a successful Western Europe and of political visionaries such as Kohl, Reagan, Thatcher and, for that matter, Gorbachev, is partly responsible for this success, but it was, above all, individual people' s longing for freedom which made possible this revolutionary change to the age in which we live.
It was courageous men and women, both young and old, who feared reprisals but who loved freedom more.
It is a fantastic inheritance to have experienced this dividend of freedom and liberation.
Let us remind people of the way in which democracy triumphed over dictatorship and oppression was exchanged for freedom.
The enlargement process must be seen in this perspective.
Just as the Coal and Steel Union succeeded in its task of securing peace in the participating countries of Europe, we must now make sure that the European Union increases freedom and the opportunity for more people to participate in freedom of movement and that it increases prosperity, promotes diversity and contributes to solving our common problems involving crime and the environment.
This is probably not as dramatic a task as was once the task of reconciling historic enemies, but I think that it is at least as large a task, involving just as many benefits but being perhaps more difficult to carry out.
That is precisely why it is my political group' s most important task of all to continue to fight for freedom and now to enable our fellow human beings in Eastern and Central Europe to participate on the same conditions as ourselves.
In this way, we should also be showing, especially to today' s young people, that we believe in an EU that is able to change in order to live up to its own ideals.
This must not be some wait-and-see project.
The EU' s commitment will be commensurate with the active work done by the candidate countries.
I want to praise the Commission' s work on this aspect but still put a question mark over the Council' s ambition and ability.
Allow me to say a few words about Estonia, that fascinating little country on the Baltic.
Through singleness of purpose, sound political leadership and cooperation, Estonia has come a long way in its preparations for EU membership.
In my report, I tried to make it clear that, in many areas, the EU has a lot to learn from the Estonians, for example in the area of trade and within what we call the new economy.
In many respects, developments in Estonia constitute a success story in which an incredible amount has happened during the last ten years.
I addressed the subject of security policy in my report.
We cannot view enlargement of the EU in isolation or fondly imagine that the EU has powers it at present completely lacks.
The Estonians, who also want to see themselves participating in NATO soon, are aware of this.
The Estonians, who were oppressed, expelled from their homes and driven to despair under the Soviet Union' s Communist dictatorship, know that the only important thing is to defend freedom.
Those of us in the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats share their analysis and support them in this.
The Group of the Greens here in Parliament are anxious about poverty in a country that has experienced a remarkably greater degree of prosperity since the liberation.
I view the Greens' amendment as an attempt to defend existing structures and a social model that have entrenched unemployment in the EU.
I believe, for my part, that the economy of the EU needs more dynamism and less hegemony, and I do not therefore wish to support that amendment.
Finally, a few words about minorities, mainly a large proportion of Russian speakers in the case of Estonia.
It is not a straightforward issue.
We are concerned here with power, prejudices and ancient wrongs.
The precondition for integration and a successful sense of community is the successful rule of law, together with institutions and laws that are non-discriminatory.
However, that is not enough. When it comes to practical work too, political leaders must take these issues seriously.
That applies just as much in our own countries.
Overcoming differences requires tolerance and mutual respect and takes time.
In this respect too, Estonia is on the right road.
I want to thank those of my fellow MEPs who have been involved with this topic, and I also wish to extend my thanks to the Committee Secretariat.
Mr President - unfortunately I cannot greet the Council yet, although I have a number of things to say with it in mind - Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, amidst the squabbling over direct aid in agriculture or the future allocation of the Structural Funds, we sometimes lose sight of the fact that the project to heal our divided Europe is of historical importance and that its significance is such that it also determines Europe's standing in the world.
More fainthearted talk of delay not only harms the project but also Europe as a whole.
That is why I would call on the Council, together with Parliament and the Commission, to do all it can to ensure that the first new members are able to take part in the European elections in 2004.
Given the current state of play in the negotiations, we are realistically talking about 10 countries.
This also means that not just one Baltic country but all three will be involved.
Should enlargement be delayed further then there is also the danger that the negative implications of this for the people in our own countries will cause problems.
Even now the fact that increasing numbers of firms are relocating to neighbouring countries in the East because of environmental and social dumping is intolerable.
The EU's environmental and social standards can only be upheld, however, if there is actual membership.
I will give just one example from Latvia: I think it is incredible that EU companies can permit themselves to boycott the social dialogue while the Commission simply stands by and watches.
In any case, it is a characteristic of the enlargement process that the people's existing rights of participation play no part in it.
Why are we surprised at the diminishing interest of the people in the accession countries if enlargement is practically solely a project of the political elite?
Mr Verheugen, you mentioned the positive attitude of the national minorities towards enlargement.
I cannot say the same for the Russian minority in Latvia.
No debate of any kind is taking place in society about the successes achieved and problems experienced either in the accession process or with enlargement; neither is it a joint process.
The communication strategy is to have separate projects for East and West and as such is ill-conceived even in terms of structure.
It prevents people from getting to know each other.
How many people in the West are aware of the European treasures in the Baltic cultures; how many know anything about what is of significance there?
In our countries it goes without saying that projects in rural and urban areas are developed by the stakeholders.
In the accession countries it is a Commission-led top-down process.
Why do they not attach any importance to having the same quality of participation as is demanded here by the Member States?
In Latvia too the administration is the weakest point and of course an administration is only strong if it offers a service facility to all of its citizens, regardless of their social standing and language.
It needs to be able to organise and implement procedures to allow them to participate.
As a predominantly rural country, Latvia is particularly affected by the foolhardy project to export the EU's unsuccessful agricultural policy to the accession countries.
Surely we all need to work together to convert direct aid into ecologically and socially sustainable structural development.
It would be beneficial not only to Latvia but also to consumer protection and thus to the entire population of the EU and the accession countries.
I should like to stress once more that in this whole process the social dimension is being wholly neglected.
It is illusory to believe that processes of transformation in society can be managed by free market forces alone.
We cannot ignore the alarming gulf between rich and poor.
But we could reduce it if the idea of Europe were understood as a common political task for the people of Europe regardless of their region and social position.
Mr President, in debating the twelve reports on the twelve candidate countries today, we are making a positive contribution to a development without, as yet, any understanding of what the results of that development will be.
I hope and pray that Parliament and the Commission, the term of office of which expires at the start of 2005, will have the joy and honour of making these twelve countries members of the European Union in a new European configuration, the aim of which is obviously not to create new borders, but to create a community of states and nations working towards common objectives of peace, social prosperity and global collaboration.
I think that, as a political objective, this is the major objective for all of us and we must all serve it faithfully.
I am the third rapporteur for the Baltic states.
All three states have more or less the same problems, as do most of the candidate countries, given that they all have a history of the same socio-economic and political system and are now in a process of reform.
What is special about these countries is that, until recently, the enlargement of the European Union only involved countries with similar social and economic systems.
Now we are moving towards countries moving from centralised economies and state control to market economies and democratic procedures.
In this sense, this move, which unites Europe ideologically and politically without forming borders which divide something between us which we should not divide, is most positive.
Lithuania, on which I am reporting, has the same general problems and two specific problems. One specific problem is the Ignalina nuclear power station and the second is Kaliningrad.
I believe that every effort will be made at Ignalina to secure Lithuania's energy supply and deal with the secondary and primary repercussions on both society and the economy and I trust that things will go smoothly.
As far as Kaliningrad is concerned, it is indeed here in this Russian enclave that the policies which give us the opportunity to create a new Europe will be judged and, even if it is not integrated into the same economic and political system, it will work with us, exist alongside us and share a common future with us rather than clashing with us.
In this sense, I believe that Commissioner Verheugen, who has demonstrated sophisticated political skills, will help move things along here.
He has proven as much in other difficult cases because - let us not deceive ourselves - the real political problems will be numerous.
I should like to refer to Cyprus, given that it has already been mentioned and even though it is not the subject of my report, merely to say that it is because of Commissioner Verheugen's correct political handling of the case that he says, yes, there is the issue of Turkey's occupation of northern Cyprus; however, at the same time, he says that Helsinki expects the accession of Cyprus to proceed irrespective of whether or not the question of northern Cyprus is resolved.
Put simply, this is a message to all quarters that it is political Europe's intention to proceed on the basis of its own principles and perceptions and without allowing anyone to dictate how issues relating to human rights, democracy, international standing and international law are to be handled.
From this point of view, I hope and trust that Commissioner Verheugen will do his very best.
As far as tomorrow is concerned, the crucial question is: what do we as Europeans hope for? A united Europe which integrates as it goes along or a microcosm of economic transience and short-termism?
If Europe and its people truly want to achieve some sort of ideal, some sort of vision - and I believe that they do - then it must be a social and political vision, not a small-term or short-term economic vision.
In this sense, I think that we should move towards this vision of an integrated Europe of peace, collaboration, cohesion and development and impart visions of this sort of Europe to our people, leaving aside petty confrontations on transient issues which have no future.
Mr President, this is certainly not an easy time for the majority of the countries who are preparing to enter the European Union, especially Poland.
Precisely now, at the most decisive moment when they should be making the final spurt towards the finishing line, when there is most need of enthusiasm and single-mindedness, the Poles, like many others, are starting to have second thoughts and to wonder whether the sacrifices required of them, the supposed costs of accession, will not outweigh the advantages, the potential and future gains.
A certain alarming scepticism is becoming rife which is in danger of threatening consensus on accession to the Union.
Commissioner Verheugen mentioned this phenomenon this morning, and this is why we have tabled an amendment which I hope will be adopted tomorrow, calling upon the Commission to increase its commitment to European Union information and promotion campaigns in order to convince the Poles that their presence in Europe is essential for both us and them.
Factors which are certainly contributing to the scepticism of the Poles are a centre-right government which is about to come to the end of its term amongst difficulties and instability after a long period of clear, decisive action, and an economy which was the envy of the postcommunist world with consistently high growth rates of around 7 % per annum and which now, after the great dynamic progress of recent years, has started to show signs of slowing down.
To these must be added the natural disasters which struck Poland this summer, floods and tornadoes which caused severe damage both in material terms and in terms of loss of human life.
The left, the postcommunists, the current opposition - which will have the majority at the elections on 23 September, that is in a few days - are certainly not helping to calm things down and are tending to throw oil on the fire and present a picture of Poland which is not particularly reassuring so that they can then set themselves up as the saviours of the homeland.
Of course, when this same left comes to power, it will not do anything at all to change the resolute, competent action taken by the Polish government to make every endeavour to enter Europe as soon as possible.
There is no doubt that the left is committed to taking this path because all the Polish parties - both right and left - signed an explicit agreement a few days ago committing themselves to working together to this end.
We must not ignore the fact that there are still issues which need resolving, and we have listed them in our resolution; to cite some examples: environmental protection, which was totally disregarded and abandoned during the long period of communist dictatorship with the result that the environment is now in a pitiful state; improving air and water quality to European Union standards requires huge effort and investment which would be impossible without external aid or those transition periods to which Mr Brok referred this morning.
With regard to the environment, I would like to say to some of the Members, who are rightly sensitive to the argument and who have tabled amendments, that I support the amendments for the most part but that I have not accepted them because they are too specific and go into too much detail.
Another well-known problem is agriculture, which is suffering the consequences of the Polish farmers' heroic resistance to collectivisation under Soviet rule and is now extremely fragmented.
For Poland, 26% of whose population lives in country areas, the restructuring of agriculture affects and involves many other sectors, starting with the need to create new jobs.
A further issue is that of the borders to the east, which will become the Union' s borders with Ukraine and Belarus. These borders will have to be open, on the one hand, but also totally crime- and mafia-proof.
Commissioner Verheugen talked about that as well this morning.
To sum up, we are sure that Poland will enter Europe as soon as possible, in 2004, and we are pleased to note that the Belgian Presidency - as we heard this morning - wants to give fresh impetus and new dynamism to the negotiations.
Poland - the President-in-Office said - will enter, although it is more appropriate to say 'will return to' Europe, for it has occupied its rightful place in Europe for centuries and only a perverse dictatorship was able to deny it its true place in history and geography for many decades.
Mr President, I do not wish to say anything about the content of my report on the Czech Republic.
Anyone who has read it will also realise that the criticism that came from the Right at the end of this morning's debate was unjustified.
It does, in fact, contain a number of observations on these points.
Allow me to comment on the latest developments.
In the past week it has emerged from the Czech Republic that the government has a very ambitious programme, namely that by June 2002 it wants to have met the accession criteria and therefore to regard the accession negotiations as closed.
So far, 19 out of 31 chapters have been closed and by the end of the year a further six key chapters should be completed.
Commissioner Verheugen rightly said that completing chapters is not the only thing that counts and that neither is it an indicator of how far a country is.
Nevertheless, the Czech Republic is well on the way and we should not believe those who are confusing the people in the country.
Only last week a leading Czech politician asserted that the European Union was a rigid, unwieldy and costly concern.
With your permission, Mr President, I should like to analyse these three erroneously employed concepts.
The European Union is not rigid.
If there is one constant in the European Community - which today is the European Union - then it is the desire for change and the possibility of achieving it.
Since the Fifties, the European Community has been constantly changing and today we are even facing the possibility and necessity of enlarging this Union once more.
Anyone, therefore, who says that this organisation is rigid does not know what they are talking about.
Secondly, I turn to the charge that it is unwieldy. We should not confuse two different things here.
Of course the European Union is a large entity, but it is, nevertheless, manoeuvrable.
It can be compared to a great ship sailing across a wide ocean.
It can be manoeuvred and yet it is large, like the European Union.
The decision-making process is certainly lengthy in the European Union and it is sometimes tedious as well, but what do you actually expect in a Community of 15 sovereign states, where each state - and, incidentally, not least the small ones - is asked what its position is?
Everyone has a say, and this is something which those circles in the Czech Republic should bear in mind.
So the Union is not unwieldy and it is not rigid either.
The third argument, that it is costly, is actually the least accurate because the countries which freed themselves from communism would have had to undergo reform and a process of transformation anyway, regardless of accession to the European Union.
There is a further point: there are two possibilities in the European Union, either you receive money or you contribute money.
Those who receive money - and the Czech Republic is already one of them - actually ought not to complain at all.
Those who contribute money have also shown over the last few decades that they fare very well when they pay money into the European Community or Union because somehow they always get it back again.
These three arguments are therefore purely and simply populist, to put it mildly.
My final comment on this is that where cost is concerned there are also things which should not be measured or explained in terms of marks and pfennigs or euros.
These people in the Czech Republic who are blackening the name of the EU have forgotten one thing, namely our founding fathers' prime concern: peace in freedom.
This is something which up until now has prevented wars and, by the way, expulsion.
Despite a number of points which are explained in my report, for example in relation to Temelin, the Czech Republic is making good progress.
No one should take fright; Temelin is not an obstacle to joining the European Union.
Finally, allow me to make one further comment which I already made last year in my report.
I am from Saxony, which borders the Czech Republic; in the past in socialist times I was in the same boat as the Czechs and I should also like to be in the future, but in a different boat, a boat which the Czechs can help to steer.
Admittedly, no one in the Czech Republic should think that the Czechs will be the only ones deciding where the boat goes because it is not the European Union which wishes to join the Czech Republic but the Czechs who wish to join the EU.
Nevertheless, the Czechs are guaranteed to be one of those helping to steer the course of the European Union in the future.
Mr President, the current Slovakian Government has, since 1998, made considerable inroads into the accession process.
If Brussels was very sceptical at that time, the country is now joining the ranks of candidate countries that are first in line to join the EU.
It is no longer playing second fiddle to the members of the so-called Luxembourg Club if one considers the number of concluded negotiation chapters.
Credit where credit is due.
To the Slovakian Government, but also to the population which has managed to sit and wait for far-reaching reforms, which also have their drawbacks, of course.
Take the unacceptably high level of unemployment.
The high speed with which the negotiations have taken place is not merely a reflection of an energetic government.
Slovakia is one of the smaller candidate countries and can therefore afford a higher degree of flexibility.
The country is taking advantage of this.
The support for EU Membership remains as high as ever, and it is fair to say that there is political consensus surrounding this issue in Slovakia.
However, one can question whether a government of a different make-up would have managed to make the same progress.
Nevertheless, there are points of criticism.
In the light of the Council' s and Commission' s strategy to conclude a number of negotiations next year, these points of criticism deserve extra attention.
If Slovakia is to keep up with the frontrunners, an extra effort will need to be made in this connection.
That is why, with all due respect, it is not so much the role of the European Parliament to be kind, but rather to give the right incentives.
I have therefore adopted in my report many of the critical observations which my fellow MEPs have made in the various committees.
These observations will hopefully speak for themselves as it is impossible to list them all here.
Slovakia is transposing EU legislation at a rate of knots, which, in fact, as in other candidate countries, begs the question of whether all these new laws can actually be implemented and whether sufficient, qualified staff are available for this task.
This is all the more pressing in the sphere of financial control for which, admittedly, draft legislation has now been submitted in Slovakia, but in respect of which it is fair to continue to question the country' s aptitude to process EU subsidies in an adequate manner once it is an EU Member State.
Fortunately, the Slovakian Government is in the process of recruiting additional officials, which, in itself, is a considerable step forward.
Commissioner Verheugen was right this morning to declare this topic a priority, and I should like to give him my unqualified support in this.
I should also like to provide him with the word 'transparency' as a key concept in this connection.
In the spring, we were startled by the news of irregularities committed by a high official responsible for the distribution of EU monies.
Needless to say, the Government took action, which is praiseworthy in itself.
However, the inquiry is still under way. The matter should, in our opinion, be subject to a thorough investigation, particularly to establish whether this was simply one incident or whether this was a symptom of a more systematic phenomenon.
We would, in this framework, also like to receive the initial assessment of the anti-corruption programme which the Slovakian Government adopted a while ago.
I have, in the past, regularly expressed my concern regarding the large discrepancies in income between the different regions in Slovakia.
The country is not unique in this either, and it will soon have fresh opportunities to do something about it thanks to EU membership.
Nevertheless, I cannot shake off the feeling that many plans take a long time to come to fruition.
That is unfortunate because what matters is relations between rich and poor in Slovakia.
A worrying trend is that concerning the deployment of elected regional councils.
This decentralisation is important from an EU point of view, because the country' s administration will become more efficient and democratic control will improve as a result.
Parliament recently took a few decisions, but the Slovakian Government partners do not consider these to be satisfactory.
That is why the coalition has come under pressure.
A year before the possible conclusion of the negotiations, there is now the threat of a Government crisis, the implications of which are not entirely clear.
We do not decide on the regional re-division of Slovakia.
We can, however, ask that every effort be made to stave off a crisis.
The present coalition has a job to finish, and the involvement of the Hungarian minority remains every bit as important in this connection.
In fact, they themselves subscribe to this wish.
Surely during further discussions on this topic, it should be possible to reach a final compromise which is acceptable to everyone.
That means that everyone must be accommodating, for everyone is responsible for the cohesion within the Government.
A free vote in Parliament is not always the best solution in this connection.
We continue to receive complaints about the treatment of minorities, and not only from Budapest.
Progress has been made with regard to the Roma people.
Nevertheless, we can continue to question the speed with which improvements are being made and the willingness of local authorities to commit themselves fully to these.
Unpleasant incidents are still occurring.
I repeat once again that next year, at the - what we hope will be - final assessment, the first genuine and concrete results of the Roma policy will be revealed.
It will be an exciting year for Slovakia, a year of hard toil in order to maintain the momentum of the negotiations, and we hope we will be able to pass a verdict on the end result next year.
Mr President, whereas the debate on enlargement held last year happened to take place on the day commemorating the tenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, today' s debate, although it does not have the same symbolic importance, is nonetheless taking place in the wake of two very important events.
Firstly, the Nice Summit, at which the European Heads of State and Government undertook to reform the Community institutions so that these could accommodate a Europe enlarged by a further twelve countries.
We all share the conviction that failure in this area would damage the project of enlargement for many years to come.
Secondly, the GÃ¶teborg Summit, which brought the Swedish Presidency to a close.
In their conclusions, Europe' s leaders categorically stated that the process of enlargement was irreversible, having for the first time set a deadline at the end of 2002 for concluding negotiations with applicant countries that are ready, with the stated aim of these countries already being able to participate as Members in the 2004 European Parliamentary elections.
To this political commitment we must add the emphasis placed on the principle of differentiation, according to which the applicant countries will continue to be assessed solely on the basis of their merits.
It is in this context that we should consider the report on Hungary' s accession to the European Union and developments in its application process over the last year.
Hungary' s integration into the European Union is a truly national ambition for that country.
Tangible proof of this is the agreement reached by all the political parties represented in the Hungarian Parliament in favour of accession and by the consensus obtained on first holding a referendum on this decisive step for their shared future.
By channelling all of its energies into fulfilling this national objective, Hungary has already been able to conclude negotiations with the Commission on a substantial number of chapters, (22 out of a total of 30), which gives us hope that negotiations on welcoming Hungary into the European Union within the 2002 deadline set at GÃ¶teborg can be concluded.
This fact, combined with the existence of a 'road map' of clearly delimited negotiations, is of great political importance, since it has not only enabled Hungary' s leaders and the Community' s negotiators to plan and undertake their work in line with the previously established timetable. It has also contributed to preventing a climate of anxiety and disillusionment arising in Hungarian society as a consequence of it being impossible to give commitments on deadlines for concluding negotiations on joining the Union.
Mr President, with regard to developments in Hungary' s application procedure, the main aspects that I wish to highlight are obviously ongoing, although some new situations can also be mentioned.
As for the former, reference must be made, first of all, to Hungary' s economic situation, which is continuing to improve, despite signs of the slowdown that are being felt everywhere.
Gross domestic product growth stands at around 6% and exports continue to perform very well, as does investment in housing.
Consumption, employment and foreign investment have also achieved very healthy figures.
We can conclude that today, Hungary has a solidly developing market economy and if it continues to make progress in the field of structural reforms and in consolidating public auditing, it will be able to withstand the pressure of competition and market forces within the European Union, without having to jump through any hoops.
Nevertheless, inflation remains high, at around 10%, and the government must keep a close eye on this by implementing the appropriate measures for reducing pressure for price increases.
There is also the situation of the Roma population, which remains difficult in spite of the progress that has been made under the mid-term programme.
This is why we are warning that this programme must be complemented by immediate practical measures for social support in the fields of education, employment, housing and health, amongst others, in conjunction with representatives from that community, which will be jointly monitored with them.
Some of these measures are already in place.
Mention must also be made of the need, which has been fully accepted by Hungary' s political leaders, to step up the fight against corruption. The approval and implementation of a very thorough package of legislation against corruption, to enter into force with immediate effect, should be emphasised.
We are aware of the difficult situation inherited by countries in similar areas and with similar recent histories to that of Hungary, and we know that this battle must be fought throughout the European Union and beyond.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Hungary recently approved a law on protecting Hungarian minorities living in neighbouring countries, which evoked various reactions and controversies, particularly in Romania and Slovakia, where the largest of these minorities live and work.
The Hungarian authorities have insisted that this new law does not have any extraterritorial effect and will not have any consequences that are not in complete harmony with the legal systems in force in the neighbouring countries in which these minorities live.
In this regard, I must once again repeat what is stated in the report, which is that the Commission must provide an assessment of this type of law in terms of its compatibility with the Community acquis. The Commission must also appeal to Hungary' s spirit of good neighbourliness and cooperation with its neighbours and, in general, with all Member States.
The fact that this law contains a provision - Article 27 - laying down the supremacy of Community legislation over its national laws and the fact that the Hungarian government has demonstrated willingness to hold bilateral discussions with its neighbours on issues of the law' s interpretation and implementation give me grounds for optimism about the resolution of any potential problems that it may raise.
Mr President, in the short speaking time granted to me as rapporteur, I can only present the main conclusions of this report.
I am nevertheless convinced that my fellow Members will agree with me in my interpretation, analysis, and support for this report.
The European Parliament will therefore continue to make its essential contribution to the process of bringing together the European peoples and nations and of truly raising the awareness of the citizens of the Europe of Fifteen and of the applicant countries to the advantages and also to the obligations inherent in European integration.
Mr President, over the past year we have seen many very encouraging developments in terms of Bulgaria's progress towards accession.
While there have undoubtedly been many areas of disappointment, three months ago there was a very dramatic political development in Bulgaria.
In the general election on 17 June we saw the governing UDF routed by a new political force, the Simeon II National Movement, led by the former King Simeon who, as Simeon Sakskoburggotski, is now Prime Minister and will be visiting European Union institutions and NATO in Brussels for the first time next week.
In the elections some 60% of the electorate preferred to vote for parties that were not represented in the previous parliament.
It was a resounding vote of no confidence on the government in office, and a heartfelt demand for real progress, improvement and change: a leap of faith.
The previous UDF administration faced enormous difficulties and I wish to acknowledge its success in many areas.
It was the first of the post-communist governments to see out its full term.
It took forward Bulgaria's application for European Union membership and put Bulgaria in a position formally to open accession negotiations in February 2000.
As a result, 11 negotiating chapters have now been successfully closed.
A further 10 have been opened and are under negotiation.
It is expected that five more will be opened this year.
Only four chapters therefore will remain to be opened by the beginning of next year.
On the macroeconomic level there has been excellent growth in GDP.
Bulgaria has been a pillar of regional stability, first through all the international difficulties with the Milosevic regime in neighbouring Yugoslavia, then the Kosovo conflict and most recently with the tensions in neighbouring Macedonia.
Bulgaria has acted throughout in a manner supportive of European Union and NATO policies, but the regional instability has inevitably had an impact on the Bulgarian economy and on investor confidence in the region.
But the formal process of negotiation and the aspiration to take reform forward are clearly not enough.
Certainly the Bulgarian political system has confirmed its democratic stability.
Certainly structures have begun to be put in place to deal with the fundamental problems of weak administrative capacity, of corruption and of excluded minorities.
The fact is that most of the people of Bulgaria, through all these difficulties and upheavals, have seen little improvement in their own lives and standards of living.
My report is in effect a final report on the performance of the last government and an indicator as to the problems that need to be addressed by the new administration.
The challenge for the new government is to maintain its coherence and to translate its aspirations, its ambitious programme, into concrete reality.
I am very encouraged by what I have heard so far.
The new government team, particularly concerning the economy, balances its vitality and enthusiasm with professional competence and a degree of modesty in view of the tasks ahead.
The priorities for the government are continuity and the preparations for European Union and NATO membership, with acceleration of political and economic reform, concentrating on tax reforms to stimulate the economy, squeezing out corruption, reform of the judiciary, modernisation of the customs service and border security, and legal changes to ensure that Bulgaria has a functioning market economy through amendment of banking laws and improvement in the bankruptcy laws.
In many ways the new team offers a breath of fresh air.
It has a clear agenda and is willing to consider novel solutions drawing on sound experience from other countries.
It will be judged by the quality, rather than quantity, of its legislation, by its ability to implement its policies and by its determination to bring about real reform that will benefit the population at large in a tangible manner.
At a time of regional crisis and an international economic downturn, this will not be easy.
It is time to build the widest possible consensus for reform in Bulgaria.
Bulgaria previously set itself the target of concluding negotiations by 2004 with a view to European Union membership by 2007.
Many regard this as ambitious, but not unrealistic.
I have agreed to remove such references from my resolution for the sake of consistency with the approach adopted in the other enlargement reports.
I do not support amendments which would seek to add further conditionality to Bulgaria's membership application.
Of course each candidate country should be judged on its own progress towards accession, without any hidden political barriers and without having to follow the course of any other candidate country.
I trust this House will give every encouragement to Bulgaria and its new government on the path to EU and NATO accession and support my resolution.
I feel sure that the new government of Bulgaria will respond positively to the points that I have made.
Mr President, I thank my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for giving me another opportunity to work on Romania's accession to the European Union of Romania.
At the moment, Romania has a unique opportunity, unequalled in modern times, to make very swift progress.
For the first time in living history, it has a stable government, elected on a democratic mandate.
It has clear political leadership, a greater understanding of the European Union's Community values and exceptionally good economic signals.
The reform process is under way under the tutelage of the European Commission and with the efforts the Romanian administration has made on the acquis communautaire a larger number of chapters is under negotiation now than had been anticipated.
If Romania continues to move ahead in this way and has the courage to undertake the painful political structural reforms, there is nothing to stop Romania joining the European Union without delay and it is pleasing to know that 79% of Romanians are enthusiastic about this prospect.
The accession process is continuing.
The number of chapters is increasing and I am pleased to announce that the Commission could receive all the position papers from the Ministry by Christmas, if it is able to do so.
Certainly that is what the European Ministry for Integration in Romania is hoping for.
President Iliescu announced in Gothenburg that he hoped and believed that all chapters could be fulfilled during his period of office.
We in Parliament are dismayed and I am sure others must be too, that the visa restrictions have not yet been lifted.
The Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs are meeting today and I sincerely hope that they will come to the conclusion that visa restrictions are no longer necessary for Romanian citizens.
It is pleasing to note that the German Ambassador to Romania last week opened the new embassy by laying the foundation stone and saying that this embassy will have no visa section.
The Romanian Government has decided to be judged by action and not by words.
It has already done excellent foreign affairs work through Romania's chairmanship of the OSCE and made excellent progress in its relationships with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
It might be dogged by poverty, but good things have happened; industrial productivity has gone up by 17% and inflation is coming down little by little.
Romania's largest investor is still France, but other EU Member States such as Germany, Italy, Greece and the United Kingdom are coming in.
It has at the same time been cementing its relationship with North America and particularly with the USA.
But Romania's destiny remains in Europe and her future lies with NATO and the European Union.
Perhaps Ceausescu's bitter legacy, however, was responsible for the fact that the political will for change was slower to emerge in Romania than in some other former Soviet Union candidate countries.
Indeed, the treatment of children in Romania, as the Commissioner mentioned this morning, rapidly became a global media horror story.
Today, however, Romania is in the process of change, helped all the way along the line by the Commission's faultless work in Brussels and Bucharest and guided by long-term friends here in Parliament right across the political spectrum.
We are working as a team to assist Romania in her progress towards the European Union.
As the Commissioner said on another occasion, the progress of integration is unstoppable.
Romania is an integral part of that process and social change in the last few months has been rapid.
Gay rights are now part of law, an anti-trafficking law has recently been passed and domestic violence law has gone through.
A children's act, on children's rights, which will incorporate adoption law, both local and international, is now being prepared.
The high-level group for Romanian children is moving towards registration.
This will incorporate a wise persons' panel to assess Romania's capacity to come back into the inter-country adoption world when the time is right.
It is imperative that the children's act is not hurried.
Local adoptions have doubled in the last few months and 20 000 children are leaving special schools this week and will be going back into normal schools and normal life.
That is tremendous progress.
Here may I pay special tribute to my Spanish colleagues in the European Parliament, who have had many pressures on them from different families in Spain.
I am delighted that the new Romanian Government has nominated very competent officials to review the problems that these Spanish families are facing.
I will keep a very careful eye on this and report back to my Spanish colleagues.
In conclusion, Romania has much to offer the European Union and the world.
Its deep-rooted knowledge of its early European status in the Roman Empire gives it every encouragement to work through these difficult times and in due course become a full Member of the European Union.
Mr President, Slovenia hopes to be among the first of the 12 boats who will enter the European Union in 2004 to cross the finishing line, to use an image often employed by Commissioner Verheugen; just this morning it was stipulated that there can be no turning back now.
Indeed, Ljubljana hopes to finish incorporating the Community acquis during the Spanish Presidency, within the second half of next year that is, maintaining the steady rhythm demanded by the current Belgian Presidency as well.
The Slovenians have been diligent in closing the chapters of the acquis, and they have succeeded in resolving some very complex issues, a prime example being the environment, for which they received recognition from the European visitors to Ljubljana.
Slovenia surprised the European Union by concluding, before the deadline moreover, the negotiations on the free transfer of capital as early as spring 2001, despite some problems with opinion makers.
In Ljubljana, the difficulties which would arise for the Slovenian government in terms of public opinion if the dates were to be put back and the Slovenians, who were obviously very pleased to see the conclusions of the Gothenburg and earlier Summits, were not to enter Europe, were explained to the European guests.
As usually happens in the last stage of the entry of a country into Europe, the sceptics come out of the woodwork, but it is often a matter of internal political tactics.
Slovenia is aware that it must settle the issue of the restoration of goods within the time frames specified, even though in some - quite clear-cut - cases, appeals to the courts have slowed the process down.
However, the time limits for the charges have expired in any case, and there are also delays in denationalising foreign capital.
In any case, Slovenia is one of the countries where, despite macro- and microeconomic stability, foreign capital flows are very low and are often just the result of reinvestment from previous years.
Greater transparency - a word used very frequently in this Chamber - was required in order to proceed to privatisation, so that the launching of companies, banks and enterprises on the market does not end up being a purely national affair, with foreign investors being kept at bay.
The privatisation rules have finally been fixed with the large banks as well, in which the State will continue to hold - for a certain period of time at least - a sort of golden share or what is known as the 'veto' holding.
Foreign interest exists in this sector and negotiations are in progress.
Slovenia is currently working strenuously for stability in the central and southern region, and, following the disappearance of Milosevic, the issue has become a little less dramatic.
There are psychological reserves in this field: "We have not yet set foot in Europe" reflect some observers, "and already international capital is threatening to restrict our sovereignty" .
This is a development which is evident in other small ex-royal socialist countries.
Nevertheless, Slovenia gives the impression of realising that it must complete opening-up of the market within the time frames laid down in the agreement with Europe.
Various measures such as providing backup for the courts which are swamped with work or creating an ad hoc mobile group of judges to support the district courts with the greatest backlog are speeding up the work related to the many outstanding civil actions, most of which concern precisely the issue of the restitution of goods and property.
The Commission' s report bewails the sluggishness of the administrative system: laws have been adopted in this area too.
Slovenia is prepared to amend its Constitution to bring it into line with the conditions for accession to Europe.
With regard to relations with neighbouring countries, it has, notably, a cultural agreement with Austria in which it acknowledges the existence of a German-speaking community in the country and, not long ago - and this is a very important issue - the sea and land borders with Croatia were defined.
They are currently being ratified by the two parliaments. These are the major events which have taken place in the area of cross-border cooperation.
The macroeconomic indicators are still positive and inflation and unemployment are below the European average, while the GDP is not far off the European average.
Considering the preparations which have been made or are currently being completed, Slovenia seems well prepared for integration into the European Community.
Mr President, for the second year running, I have the honour of presenting you with the report on Cyprus' membership application to the European Union.
The motion for a resolution before you was adopted in committee by 55 votes to 2 with 1 abstention. It proves to be an account with many contrasts.
On the one hand, it underlines Cyprus' excellent performance in relation to the adoption of the acquis: 23 chapters have already been closed and the remaining chapters do not present insurmountable difficulties.
On the other hand, the motion deplores the continuing division of the island.
The hopes that the international community had placed in proximity talks, held under the aegis of the United Nations, were dashed last November by the unilateral withdrawal of Mr Denktash from the process.
This withdrawal has been supported by Turkey to this day.
Although precious time has been wasted in the process of trying to find a solution to the political problem before accession, I can only recommend that the European Parliament adhere firmly to its previous position founded on International Law and justice.
This position, which is also that of the United Nations, the Council of Europe and all the other European institutions, including the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, was confirmed on 10 May 2001 by the European Court of Human Rights.
The political solution we seek cannot include the persistence of a de facto situation created by force.
It must, on the other hand, turn the page on the past and resolutely face the future.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations made a proposal to both the Greek and the Turkish Cypriots for a federal system based upon a democratic model that would respect the distinct characteristics of each of the parties.
Such models work in many European countries - Germany, Belgium and Switzerland among others - where they have proven both their viability and their vitality.
Solutions to all longstanding issues can be found through the negotiation process, whether these issues be the reciprocal wrongs which have accumulated since 1960 (the problem of refugees, property, the retreat of troops, for example), with the support, as the need arises, of the International Community.
Cyprus' problems are not irresolvable if the political will is there to give a boost to proceedings now.
The cold war is over.
All the walls in Europe have been knocked down.
The enemies of yesteryear have become our partners.
It would be in the widely acknowledged common interest of all countries in our region, especially Turkey, to resolve this bone of contention.
Both communities on the island - and recent opinion polls are proof of this - want to be part of the European Union.
Those who have chosen stagnation as their only strategy, maybe as a strategy for survival, should respect this will.
By guaranteeing a large majority to the motion for a resolution on Cyprus, the European Parliament will strengthen the negotiating position of Mr Kofi Annan.
In late 2001 and early 2002, the General Secretary of the United Nations will have a last chance to make a breakthrough in intercommunity negotiations.
If, however, his efforts continue to be sabotaged by one of the parties, history will forever condemn those who are opposed to international order.
Should this happen, the European Union can only honour its engagement made at the highest level at Helsinki in December 1999, being conscious of the fact that a political settlement does not constitute a prerequisite for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.
In the meantime, I can only call on the legitimate government of Cyprus to contribute steadfastly to the removal of obstacles to remaining problems so that accession negotiations can be settled before the end of 2002.
Mr President, this is already the second report on Malta which I have had the honour of tabling.
The European Parliament without doubt views the accession process of Malta, this small Mediterranean island at the interface between the European Union and Africa, positively and is supporting it constructively.
The report is, on the one hand, guided by the Copenhagen criteria, which apply equally to all of the accession countries, and on the other hand, it examines Malta's special characteristics, which result from its island position and from its economic and social structure.
Malta's basic political situation is, of course, unchanged.
Malta is continuing to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria.
Its institutions are democratic and function smoothly.
There are no particular problems as regards human rights.
The overall situation as far as economic, social and cultural rights are concerned is satisfactory.
In terms of the economy, Malta is a functioning market economy and is in a position to withstand competition from the EU in the medium term, provided that it carries out the structural reforms that are still pending.
Malta is doing well in this field, with regard both to phasing out import levies on finished products by 2003 and abolishing the remaining capital controls by the end of 2002.
The far-reaching privatisation programme which was adopted in 1999, and which includes plans to privatise major utilities over the next five years, is also heading in the right direction.
The reduction of the budget deficit from 11.8% of GDP in 1998 to 5% this year is a positive and significant result, as are the positive developments in the economic data.
Despite oil prices, inflation stood at 2.4% in November 2000 and, after rising slightly in 1999, the unemployment rate fell to 5.3% of those capable of gainful employment.
It should be borne in mind, however, that this positive process needs to be consolidated by a further cut in structural expenditure.
The favourable progress that Malta has made towards joining the EU is also reflected in the stage that it has reached in the accession negotiations.
With 17 chapters, Malta heads the list of those candidates which were able to open negotiations only in 2000.
This shows that Malta has made up the time lost through the 22-month suspension of negotiations and is therefore well placed to be in the first round of new Member States.
As far as Malta's general political situation is concerned, namely the different positions of the government on EU accession on the one hand, and the opposition on the other, not only has nothing changed but the views of the government and the Labour opposition have if anything become more polarised.
As rapporteur, I can only note this with regret.
Of course this does not mean that the European Parliament should ignore the position of the Labour Party, which would like Malta to follow in Switzerland's footsteps.
Nonetheless, we must do all we can to safeguard the continuity of Malta's accession process and therefore to support a constructive dialogue with all its constitutive entities and at every level of its society.
The matters of particular concern to the European Parliament in relation to Malta's accession process, of course, include issues related to internal security and maritime safety.
As far as internal security is concerned, Malta has now set out an effective policy to combat corruption and money laundering, which will allow Malta both to accede to the Council of Europe's Criminal Law Convention on Corruption and to ratify the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and thus to respond to a short-term priority of the Accession Partnership.
In the environmental field too, we endorse Malta's efforts to support short-term priorities of the Accession Partnership to maintain clean air and water and to stem rising levels of waste, and are thus sympathetic towards Malta's policy to ban the use of plastic bottles.
In my capacity as rapporteur I also showed sympathy for Malta's specific concerns about the free movement of persons and its fears of there being an influx of foreign workers onto its labour market.
The Commission's concession on the free movement of persons takes account of this rather psychologically conditioned fear.
Malta is not a country in transition.
It has repeatedly referred to the fact that it should like to be treated on the same footing as the other accession countries.
The Commission's efforts to make sources of funding available here so as to make up for this shortcoming are to be welcomed.
On the other hand, the Maltese authorities need to make the necessary preparations to enable structural and regional aid to be administered on a decentralised basis.
I should just like to turn briefly to the Council.
Malta's position on the agricultural chapter should, I hope, also soon be on the table.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Like all the rapporteurs who have already spoken, I am delighted to see that negotiations are advancing and advancing well for all the candidate countries.
Despite the difficulties, the work that has been carried out is considerable.
It must be said that, on a technical level, the negotiators must be congratulated on the great efforts they are making and we also congratulate you, Commissioner.
However, I would like to insist on two points that have not been forgotten but which, in our opinion, should be emphasised.
In the first instance, I am thinking of the social repercussions of enlargement.
It seems that the Commission, the Council and the rest of us should take greater steps to face up to the disorganisation of society that will inevitably result and is already resulting from economic reforms forcibly imposed in the candidate countries.
Restructuring of companies, privatisation, modernisation of working methods, which seem necessary to us, create unemployment, disrupt social protection systems and have disastrous consequences for families and individuals.
Let us all make a greater effort to limit these social problems that could, if we are not careful, become serious political problems.
The second point I want to stress concerns contact with public opinion, both in candidate countries and Member States.
Negotiation should be left to the specialists.
I would once more congratulate them on their responsible approach.
However, the accession of a country to the European Union affects its whole population.
Opinion polls show this.
As the deadline approaches the amount of opposition increases, but so does the number of those who are concerned and anxious.
We need to provide more information and explanations, making things seem as undaunting as possible.
This is a huge exercise in public relations to which the Commission - and we ourselves as well, of course - should devote more effort.
Mr President, it is great to hear the Commission, the Council and Parliament commit themselves so strongly to enlargement, as has happened here today.
Beneath the happy surface, however, there are of course anxieties, also on the part of the people in the candidate countries, and we must listen to these.
As the Commissioner also said, these anxieties cannot be conjured away.
We must not in any way postpone enlargement, but we must listen to countries' requests for transitional arrangements, whether on the subjects of land purchase or the environment.
An agreement is only sound if both parties are satisfied.
We must not make demands of others that we do not make of ourselves.
I am thinking in this context, for example, of the environmental demands for waste water treatment with which Brussels does not yet, of course, comply.
We must therefore be willing to listen to those countries which wish us to be flexible.
Enlargement is not merely a gift to them on our part. It is also a gift from them to ourselves.
We want them to accede to the EU with their values and their knowledge of what it means not to have freedom and democracy, for that is the most important thing of all.
It is perhaps they who know most of all about this, for it is they who have experienced the loss of freedom and democracy.
Mr President, although I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs, the two minutes I have prevent me from doing so.
I should like to emphasise two aspects: the treatment of cultural minorities, and information and communication in respect of the population.
The European Union should be more than a market.
It is also a community of citizens and, in addition, a collection of peoples and of smaller and larger cultural communities.
