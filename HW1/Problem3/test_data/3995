Our group, too, is in favour of such a fund, but participation in it must be restricted to those enterprises that actually do take upon themselves the social responsibility for ongoing training and development rather than passing it on to somebody else.
That is the only way of preventing this fund being a merely token gesture.
It is for that reason that the involvement of the public sector must be conditional on participation by all the stakeholders, including the enterprises, in social planning.
Â Â  . This report addresses one of the main problems currently facing the EU, one which has serious ramifications in terms of unemployment, economic and social inequality and which hampers the development and even leads to the abandonment of vast areas.
We feel it is essential that company restructuring should only take place when it is for the purpose of saving jobs and helping the business to develop, and never simply in order to increase profits at the expense of redundancies or for purely financial or speculative reasons, as is happening with increasing frequency.
We therefore believe that a strong regulation is needed to combat such restructuring, which leads to investment without jobs and to thousands of redundancies.
There also needs to be effective public monitoring of how Community aid is used and granted to businesses.
The new regulations must ensure that the granting of aid is contingent on the protection of jobs with rights and on regional development in the medium term. Otherwise, business will be barred from receiving any aid.
Consequently, we believe that the workers â through their representatives, namely the European Works Councils â should have the right to be involved at every stage of the process, which means having the right to vote, and therefore call for the directive on the European Works Councils to be reviewed.
Â Â  . Mr President, I see that this afternoon we are to debate the European footwear sector.
I use that as a restructuring example, since I live in Northampton, at one time the capital of British shoe-making.
During the last 40 years the seven or eight big household names, the labour-intensive shoemakers in Northampton, have declined to barely one, while all the townâs engineering firms have gone.
At the same time, the town has doubled in size and there are twice as many jobseekers, but there has been no unemployment problem. The rate in Northampton is currently a little less than the UK average of 5.5%, which is the lowest in the EU â Sweden and Denmark apart.
So, how did we do it?
How did we restructure?
It was not done with EU schemes: this all began before the UK joined the then EC.
Nor were EU funds involved.
We did it by ourselves, by making our town attractive to the service sector.
Barclaycard, for example, which is one of the biggest credit card companies, has had its headquarters in the town for a very long time.
I know you do not like this self-help approach: it does not lend itself to EU interference, rules and regulations and the grand handing back of a countryâs own money via unelected regional assemblies and development agencies.
Only yesterday Mr Schulz complained that the elected MEPs in this House did not have as much say as the Council and the unelected Commission.
So let us cancel Lisbon mark 2 and let national governments and local councils of Member States do the job they were democratically elected to do.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, it is only to be expected that enterprises need to adjust to the new conditions and challenges resulting from a global economy, increased competitiveness and social changes.
Our role is to take appropriate action to ensure that such changes are aimed at increasing competitiveness whilst minimising the social cost.
As we consider new legal solutions at European level, we ought not to focus exclusively on the need to improve financial results and profitability.
Our main concern must always be the good of the citizens.
They are the people who elected us to represent their interests and promote their well being.
The resources we have available should be directed mainly at the weakest regions, and most of the latter are located in the latest Member States to join the Union.
In conclusion, and referring back to yesterdayâs debate on relocation in the context of regional development, I venture to point out that many people, including Members of this House, were quick to forget the hopes awakened in the new Member States in the course of the pre-accession campaigns.
There is also a tendency to forget the commitments made to those States.
We need to remember that those are the countries where the situation is particularly difficult and unemployment is at its highest.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
Today in this Chamber we stand once again at a crossroads: Europe must choose whether to continue opening up the markets in blind observance of the natural laws of competition or, on the other hand, to decide to protect its workers from the risks connected with excessive liberalisation.
Once again, as a reformist, I believe that the right path is the middle way: preventing restructuring is an idle dream.
What the EU can and must do is to hedge it about with incentives for small businesses, to make them as competitive as possible internationally, and disincentives against so-called subsidy tourism.
An appropriate strategy should also be introduced to facilitate by all possible means the full, satisfactory integration of our human resources in order to combat unemployment and prevent a brain drain outside our borders.
In cases of inevitable restructuring, the EU also ought to provide all the support necessary to restrict dismissals and give fair protection to workers, with the help of the funds that the rapporteur rightly called for.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with the Commissioner when he said on opening this debate that restructuring is necessary so that activity which is no longer sufficiently productive can be cut back.
The issue is how restructuring should be managed and who should do the managing.
Again I agree with the Commissioner that this should be for the companies themselves, for the employers, and the workers directly involved.
This report was originally due to be voted on in the February part-session, but the major political groups quite reasonably agreed to delay this for a month, to give time to try to improve it.
This extra time has certainly been necessary.
Progress has been made in terms of some of the amendments now tabled.
Indeed, my colleague Mrs Bachelot-Narquin has been very active in this regard and I thank her for that.
But we should not only be adopting the positive amendments, we really should be deleting some of the original paragraphs entirely.
Until we do, this report will primarily be about resisting change and promoting the power of the trade unions to deal with it.
It should be about enabling change and promoting the power of the workers to cope with it.
It will be clear to the rapporteur that I still do not like his report.
It needs not just improvement, it needs â may I say â restructuring.
As he knows, I was one of those who voted against his report in committee, in part to help us table further amendments for this part-session, but I should say now that my fellow UK Conservatives, as well as certain other national delegations that I know of, reserve the right to vote against it in the plenary sitting tomorrow.
Although it is a non-legislative report, it would be a pity to vote down a report on such an important subject.
But it would still be better to vote it down than to give the wrong message that this Parliament is more concerned with trying to preserve the past than with helping employers and employees come to terms with the future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the Hutchinson report, which we debated yesterday evening, the Cottigny report sets out the debate on the restructuring and relocation of businesses.
I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for having raised these socio-economic problems, which create more anguish and social insecurity for our fellow citizens than almost anything else.
It is fortunate that Parliament is debating these issues, because, Commissioner, the Commission must take steps as a matter of urgency.
These issues set the European Union the challenge of the economic competitiveness of our companies and of job security for European employees.
In the minds of European employees, relocation and restructuring are connected and practically synonymous, because they have the same effects: the same loss of their jobs after years of working in the same sector, sometimes even in the same company, and the same questioning of their value on the labour market.
This need not be the case, because restructuring is sometimes a sign of progress, technical progress.
Restructuring does not have the same economic causes as relocation, and the legislator needs to provide an appropriate solution to each problem.
I would like to focus on the issue of restructuring of companies caused by technical developments, which is actually the central point in MrÂ Cottigny's report.
This issue sets the European Union the challenge of adapting to the increasingly rapid developments of our age of technical progress.
It really sets us the challenge of anticipating those developments.
It has been said that to govern means to foresee.
Equally, to do business, to be at the leading edge of production and economic competition, also means to foresee.
It is a matter not of adapting to progress but of anticipating it, of inventing it.
In this respect, the responsibility rests solely with the companies â they must produce and they must help their employees to anticipate by providing them with continuing training.
That is the issue raised by the Cottigny report, and I would ask you, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to support these proposals.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am very grateful to Mr Cottigny for the very hard work he has done on this report.
I do, however, doubt that the reportâs underlying goal â that of lessening the social impact of restructuring â is actually capable of being achieved.
Firstly, the European Union sets enhanced competitiveness in global markets as the goal of economic activity and hence also of restructuring, and that amounts to nothing other than an attempt to seek out and find the weak areas outside the EU, to which the losers can be transported.
Secondly, if society really is to be able to alleviate the consequences of restructuring, the funds for those who lose out to globalisation would have to be so substantial that they would themselves reduce competitiveness.
If, then, we in the EU are not to export our problems, we should say âyesâ to restructuring, but ask ourselves how it should work.
What is needed is another way of managing things economically, another way in which societyâs goods can be produced, that really is founded upon social and global sustainability.
The object of this must not be to beat our competitors at any cost, and we must not allow this to shape our thinking.
That is the real challenge that we face.
Â Â  â Mr President, words are fine, but we need to move on to actions.
We need to go and say everything that is heard here in this Chamber in your constituency in Thessalonika or in Macedonia or in Naoussa, which is a dead town: relocations have brought unemployment, they have brought poverty, they have brought social injustice and death.
That is the truth.
IKEA opened in Athens and two and a half thousand small shops and handicrafts closed.
How are they supposed to restructure?
As you know, when big business arrives, small businesses drown.
It is now a jungle; it is an ocean in which the big fish eats the small fish.
Carrefour arrives with 20Â 000 square metres and all the small shops in the entire region close.
So what are we to do there?
What shall we do?
How can we help?
This is the reality.
We have a major problem.
We have unbridled capitalism, which invades life and buries the dreams of the weakest.
Nothing is working today.
We have approximately 20% unemployment in Macedonia, which was once the worksite of the whole of Europe.
What are we to do there?
How are we to save this world from want and poverty?
Let us make a new army of .
That is the problem.
That is where you need to intervene, that is where you need to help.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Commissionâs proposal on restructuring and employment contains the conclusion that policies aimed at blocking change and freezing economic structures can only defer the problem and thereby exacerbate the negative effects.
Various measures concerning restructuring that are mentioned in Parliamentâs report, however, unfortunately go in precisely this direction and could make it difficult for businesses to adapt to changes in the markets.
The reportâs analysis of the situation and conclusions conflict with the measures proposed.
For example, the report mentions the slow growth of the European Unionâs economy, the low competitiveness of businesses and workforce mobility.
Later in the report, however, it is suggested that restructuring should not be used to increase business profitability by reducing the numbers of workers.
The reportâs proposal for a growth adjustment fund is yet another example of short-term thinking.
The best way to preserve jobs is to create new jobs.
The report ought also to emphasise this aspect.
Thus, in the field of restructuring, policy ought first of all to be directed towards implementing those socio-economic models that are geared towards permanent change.
The measures taken ought to foster the development of self-regulatory capacity in the Member States and the European Union as a whole.
Only thus will it be possible to balance growth and high employment in the long-term too.
Â Â  MrÂ President, much has been said in this House about the fact that nowadays economies are increasingly globalised and competitive.
This is the way things are and entrepreneurs therefore need to implement modern management.
A key feature of the latter is the ability to react in a flexible manner to changing market conditions, particularly with regard to new competitive challenges.
Given the circumstances, it is not possible to manage enterprises effectively without ongoing cost analysis and a readiness to undertake necessary restructuring.
It is important to keep in mind that the consequences of shying away from appropriate restructuring are always painful for both the entrepreneurs and the workers.
We should keep this constantly in mind as we debate MrÂ Cottignyâs report on restructuring and employment.
I am sure the quality of the document is much improved as a result of the work by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Nevertheless, I am bound to say that in my opinion the text is still controversial, because it adopts an overly distrustful stance towards entrepreneurs restructuring their business or planning to do so.
As a Member representing one of the countries that recently joined the European Union, I am particularly concerned about the proposals to impose penalties on companies transferring all or part of their activities to those parts of the Union where the production costs are lower.
Entrepreneurs taking decisions of this nature are certainly not resorting to âimmoral or predatory tacticsâ â I quote from the document before us.
In my view, precisely the opposite is the case.
They are demonstrating sound management skills and taking responsibility for the companyâs future.
They are therefore acting to promote the development of the Unionâs economy and increase its competitiveness.
I would remind you that this is one of the fundamental aims of the Lisbon Strategy, so dear to all our hearts
Introducing elements of central planning into the European economy is not the right way to respond to the social consequences of restructuring either.
This has already been proved unsuccessful and not just in post-Communist states.
The only appropriate response is to improve qualifications, promote lifelong learning amongst the workers and encourage worker mobility.
I should like to send out a further appeal in that regard and call for the transitional arrangements for access to labour markets to be lifted at the earliest opportunity.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Cottigny on his report.
In my country, the Netherlands, restructuring and globalisation are weighty topics, and opinions differ as to how to deal with them.
The Social-Democrats, among whom I number myself, take the view that it is unnecessary to pump funds from the Netherlands to Brussels and back and that that is not the answer.
Whilst it follows that not everyone in my country is pleased with the proposed European globalisation fund, I should nevertheless like to express my support for it, and would wish to add that I think that we should draw on existing ESF structures as much as we can.
Why am I, all things considered, in favour of it?
It is because citizens need support in order to deal with the adverse effects of globalisation.
If that support is not forthcoming from their own governments â which, in the Netherlands, it is not in the case of certain regions, the north being one example â then we are happy to receive that support from Europe.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your discussion with interest and I feel that it has emerged from a period of thorough preparation and that the consensus displayed in it is very strong.
I would like to respond to some of the questions that have directly or indirectly been raised.
On the topic of informing and consulting employees, this is the second phase consultation with the social partners.
On the topic of safeguarding the right of employees to be informed and consulted in advance of restructuring measures, this obligation is set out in a number of Community directives.
These directives must be strictly upheld.
I would like to stress the fundamental importance of social dialogue in firms, as it represents an instrument for anticipating and managing restructuring, and the communication therefore presents the second phase consultation with the European social partners as something that involves company restructuring and European works councils in equal measure.
I hope that the social partners will begin to work intensively towards the introduction of mechanisms for implementing and monitoring the reference principles outlined a year and a half ago in relation to restructuring, and to make use of European works councils as mediators for change at a company level.
The Commission takes the view that this is one of their key tasks.
The legislative route cannot entirely be ruled out, but in the present phase it would be more appropriate and beneficial to let the social partners handle matters.
On the question of Community assistance for relocations, I would like to state that the current framework provides for the cancellation of aid from the Structural Funds in cases where a given business undergoes significant change, for example where it is relocated within five years of a decision being made and the allocation of resources taking place.
I would also say that, in respect of the 2007-2013 programming period, the Commission is proposing an increase of this guarantee to seven years, along with a requirement that any aid received must be reimbursed where this regulation has been infringed, and that any firm that breaches this requirement once would be excluded from receiving further aid in the future.
The Commission recently adopted a proposal for a regulation establishing a Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
It will be up to you to discuss it with the Council and to decide whether to approve it.
The Commission is fully prepared to discuss the terms applying to the fund, and I have noted a number of ideas that I regard as important in this respect.
Among these is undoubtedly the idea that the companies themselves must contribute within the framework of restructuring, and that the strategy of shifting all costs to the public purse cannot be supported.
I would also like to stress the direct and short-term nature of the assistance provided through this Fund, in contrast to the more structured activities of the Structural Funds, especially the European Social Fund.
This means that the Fund is wholly and explicitly conceived of as being complementary to existing instruments, supplementing them in areas where they are not effective.
As I have already stated, the Social Fund, as well as other Structural Funds, allows for long-term activities aimed at adapting regions, sectors and work processes to economic and social change, in contrast to the short-term demands of specific exceptional situations.
This is a priority set for the target of the Structural Funds, which is competitiveness and employment in the 2007â2013 period.
Ladies and gentlemen, the unifying idea in this discussion has undoubtedly been that restructuring provides opportunities, but that the human costs will be unacceptably high if it is not managed properly.
These opportunities arise from the fundamental structure of our society and the fundamental structure of modern development in general, in that it constitutes a search for ever more effective and more technologically advanced solutions in the economic and social spheres.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a basic component of the EU Treaty that the aim of our efforts should be quality of life in the everyday sense of the word.
In my view, the communication or report that Parliament is now putting forward is an inspiring document which represents a step in that direction.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30Â a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by Mrs Lissy GrÃ¶ner and Mrs Amalia Sartori, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality (COM(2005)0081-C6-0083/2005-2005/0017(COD)) (A6-0043/2006).
Â Â  , . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality answers a fundamental demand to provide a new instrument for the European policy of gender equality, enabling further progress to be made.
I am sure you will agree with me that gender equality is an economic just as much as a political goal, as well as being a fundamental building block of our democratic society.
It constitutes a defining principle of Europeâs economic, social and political life.
The full participation of women, with completely equal opportunities and full participation in the workplace has become a key element of the European economy within a Union that has to cope with an aging population and demographic loss.
The Commissionâs reports for the years 2005 and 2006 on gender equality show, however, that progress has been slow in this area.
There are still major obstacles in the way of this social aim.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we fail to exploit the potential offered by women, we will not achieve the Lisbon objectives, and moreover we will be unable to compete on a global level.
Gender equality, besides its underlying political aspects, constitutes a key competitive factor for us in the fierce arena of global competition.
In the interests of eliminating all remaining inequality between men and women, it is now a priority of the first order to redouble efforts at Union and Member State levels, paying regard particularly to the increased heterogeneity of the enlarged Union.
For these reasons, the creation of an instrument operating at a European level has since 1999 been viewed as essential.
The European Council, in June 2004, therefore called on the Commission to submit a proposal.
The Commission submitted the proposal to set up an institution which would be a technical instrument assisting European bodies and especially the Commission in developing policies and in guiding Member States on their implementation.
The priority task will be to gather, analyse and distribute objective, reliable and comparable data within a Community setting.
The institute will also develop appropriate methodological resources, aimed especially at incorporating a gender perspective into Community policies.
Eventually, it will also contribute to the greater visibility of Community policy, which is particularly important at the present time and which is in principle also a building block of the democratic political process, as it is imperative that issues are there for all to see.
Where an issue is not in view, or has been concealed, it is very difficult to mobilise public opinion and to achieve majority consent.
Our proposal is the outcome of numerous analyses and it takes account of the results of two studies into operability, as well as the countless discussions that have taken place.
One of the studies was carried out by the Commission and the other by the European Parliament, which has backed the establishment of the institute since 2002.
The proposal takes account of budgetary restrictions and does not represent new expenditure against the European budget.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission wants this institution to become a centre of excellence.
At present, no such centre exists on a European level.
There are some excellent university or other such bodies, but no centre of this type.
It is therefore necessary for us to respond, and the Commission has therefore decided to meet the pressing demand of all subjects.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, this House has, for a long time, been calling for an Equality Institute; not only do we raise this demand every year on International Womenâs Day, but we also want to see real improvements in the quality of equality policy, and that is why we endorse the Commissionâs proposal.
The Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, with the object of guaranteeing broad support, entrusted the work on the report to the two major groups, in the persons of Mrs Sartori and myself.
We agreed on compromises and jointly tabled a series of amendments generally aimed at slimming down the administration and ensuring the primacy of policy-making.
We want to avoid duplication and prevent overlaps with other agencies.
We want to ensure that all the expertise on equality issues that is to be found in the national institutes â the gender experts, the universities, the non-governmental organisations â can be drawn together into one network.
We have proposed additions to the Commission proposal with the intention of involving civil society in an advisory role.
The Gender Institute will have a very important role to play in ensuring that we, as political decision-makers, can speedily draw on the results of gender research and thereby improve the lawmaking process.
It is intended that the Institute should be a centre of excellence, and independent, although it will, of course, follow the guidelines set by the European Union and by our policies.
It will be a milestone, and will have an effect far beyond the borders of the European Union, but there is a risk that people will say â as some Members of this House are already doing â that we do not want an institute specifically for gender issues, but that it should, instead, be combined with the Human Rights Agency.
The great danger of that, I think, would be that it would no longer be ensured that the European Unionâs programmes were visible to the public.
As with the equality programme, what is needed is an instrument with an outward effect.
I do not believe that PROGRESS has enabled us to ensure visibility, and we must have the certainty that the Equality Institute will do that.
What is needed is a small, high-class institute that works to powerful effect.
Saying ânoâ to it today would be a major setback to the European Unionâs equality policy, and a major setback too to the equality roadmap that was so convincingly presented last week.
It was Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, who set out the timetable last week.
Let us, by saying âyesâ to the Sartori/GrÃ¶ner report today, ensure that the timetable can be kept to and that there are no delays.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my voice to that of my fellow Member, Mrs GrÃ¶ner, in support of a vote on this Commission proposal that meets a need felt in all the countries of Europe, and not just by women.
In reality, as has already been explained by both the Commissioner and Mrs GrÃ¶ner, this issue has been under debate for a long time: the idea of setting up a gender institute goes back to more than ten years ago, at the suggestion of the then Swedish minister for equal opportunities.
The work continued for five years, and debate was thorough; in 2000 the European Council of Nice acknowledged the need for a tool to promote the exchange of experience and for sharing information on equality between men and women.
The European Commission prepared a feasibility study and presented it, and one year ago, on 8Â March, this decision was taken.
It has already been said that this study was a joint and very significant effort by our Parliamentary committee, which took action to ensure that the institute becomes what we all wanted to see: a very flexible technical instrument, with the task of collating all the data supplied by statistical bodies and of disseminating this information in order to give all operators and all those responsible for legislating and taking action the opportunity to make choices that take into account the gender viewpoint.
Some people will wonder whether a gender institute is really necessary.
I definitely believe that it is, and this is confirmed by data available to all.
As an example, the European directive on equal pay was adopted thirty years ago, in 1975, but today in Europe we still have an average inequality of 15%, while in some countries the figure is very close to 30%.
Employment data also tell a story: Lisbon will only become a reality if increasing numbers of women have access to the employment market, not to mention the problems of a fall in the birth-rate and violence.
In my view there is a need for this institute; we still require an institute of gender for women, aimed at women.
The structure will be highly consolidated: there will be nine members of the governing board, plus a representative from the Commission and a representative for every country in the consultative committee.
I would like to end by saying that the opposing positions are of two kinds: some people want to merge everything into an institute for human rights, and there are already plans to set this up in Vienna.
If I wished to assist Commissioner Frattini I would agree, but I believe that this is not what women need.
Others believe that it would cost too much, but my reply to that is that in Europe we have four bodies working on employment and they cost EURÂ 66 million a year; this body, on the other hand, will only cost EURÂ 8 million.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed the case that we in the European Union need another effective instrument to enable us to take greater strides towards equality for women and men, for if we carry on mincing along in the way we are now, establishing equality will still be a struggle even for our great-grand-daughters.
The planned Institute for Equality Issues can be that additional instrument, but, as we European parliamentarians â and we women in particular â want not only to work hard, but also to do so to lasting effect, the future gender institute must also have the right framework conditions in which to operate, and those include the funding available to it, with which it will have to manage.
There are two comments that the Committee on Budgets and its permanent rapporteur on agencies would like to make in this regard.
Firstly, we already have 23 agencies, many of which are being set up or in the course of restructuring, and all of them need a lot of money.
If our agreement with the Council on the next financial framework results in less money all round than this House has proposed, this will affect the decentralised agencies too.
Secondly, the Commission has proposed â and to this proposal this House has not objected â that the Gender Institute should be fully financed through the Fifth Strand of PROGRESS.
In June of last year, this House, in its position on the Financial Perspective, allocated over EURÂ 850 million to PROGRESS, but the Council, in December, cut almost 300 million from that amount.
Without adequate funding, though, we will be unable to achieve any lasting effects where equality is concerned.
Real policy-making and real work require real money if we are not to find ourselves building yet more Potemkin villages, frustrating workers, and throwing sand in the publicâs face.
Â Â  â Before I offer a few thoughts of my own, I would like to express support for my colleague who spoke shortly before me about the importance of funding for the successful work of the institute.
I speak as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and I wish to express my satisfaction regarding the proposal for the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality.
I did in fact propose in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that it should be called an agency rather than an institute.
Through this amendment I sought to stress the political commitment of the institution, rather than its academic dimension, which would be conveyed by the word institute.
In any event, to coincide with international womenâs day as it were, by taking this decision the European Parliament is encouraging a new step in the establishment of equal opportunities, something I consider to be one of the fundamental ambitions of a modern Europe.
I hope that the institute will not be simply a passive statistical office there to measure equality or inequality, but will also be an active proponent of new strategies that will ensure actual progress in respect of equality.
I cannot resist the temptation to tell this distinguished Chamber about Sloveniaâs candidacy to host the institute.
If Slovenia is chosen, this will be an encouraging decision, for while on the one hand we have been particularly successful in our transition, the data do indicate, however, that men have enjoyed greater success than women.
On the other hand the authorities are striving actively to change things, and in this light establishing the institute in a new Member State would be an auspicious decision, since it would encourage positive shifts.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my deep gratitude to MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner and MrsÂ Sartori for their excellent teamwork within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
Let me take the liberty of asking an iconoclastic question: could we do without a monitoring centre dealing exclusively with the differences in the treatment of men and women?
Thirty years on, despite all of our European directives, the continuing lack of equality in the treatment of men and women in all economic activities is an insult to our democracy.
The demographic issue has not been resolved.
In the interests of fathers, mothers and children, we must reconcile family life and professional life as a matter of urgency.
The Lisbon Strategy has been far from successful.
Who takes the creation of the human capital of future generations seriously?
Who takes solidarity between the generations seriously?
These informal, unpaid economic activities are hard work, and are mostly performed by women.
Neither is the role of men in the process of gender equality taken into account at all.
I consequently think it is worthwhile to promote methods of monitoring and condemning the unacceptable differences suffered by women compared to men.
Any initiative that objectively condemns these injustices cannot fail to be welcome, going beyond any political differences of opinion.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the strength of oneâs commitment to gender equality should not be measured by support for the establishment of a Gender Institute.
The rapporteurs explain that they support that body: âsince it ensures that the overarching objective of gender equality ... will not be second to any other anti-discrimination policy at EU levelâ.
This misconceived objective explains why a separate institute is in fact a bad idea.
There is no hierarchy of oppression.
The promoters see it as more important to have the kudos of an exclusive body than the reality of an across-the-board transformation of society.
The Gender Institute should in fact be part of the new EU Agency on Fundamental Rights, just as the Anti-Racism Monitoring Centre will be.
If gender is the only equality objective that stays outside the Fundamental Rights Agency, that will create an unbalanced model as well as weakening the latter agency.
It may also ensure that gender equality becomes an isolated backwater rather than the highly visible flag-carrier that its supporters want.
It seems to me quite defensive to say that you need a separate institute to ensure that gender equality remains high on the EU political agenda.
On the contrary, women can spearhead the campaign for equality in human rights for all through the Fundamental Rights Agency.
That is the opinion of the UKâs Equal Opportunities Commission and I endorse that.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance gives its wholehearted backing to an independent and effective gender institute, and endorses Mrs GrÃ¶nerâs and Mrs Sartoriâs report in its entirety.
Many in this House ask why we need a new Institute.
Why do we need one?
We need one because gender equality is the distinguishing feature of the European Union, for the European Union has said that we see equality as one of the European Unionâs values, and because we know that women are still being discriminated against.
Contrary to what Mrs Ludford has just said, we are not talking here only about violations of human rights.
This discrimination is going on in the labour market, in sport, and in many other areas.
We know that women have a part to play in shaping the future, not only in terms of their potential in the Lisbon process, but also, for example, in terms of demography, where their role is positively crucial.
Mothers, in particular, have a central role to play as regards the violations of the rights of women migrants.
Yesterday, we heard from Commissioner Frattini how we still have too few statistics on forced prostitution.
This European Gender Institute is what we need.
In the past, the European Union was a beacon of equality policy.
A ânoâ vote would be a disaster; it would mean a real rupture in the European Union, and would amount to an admission by this House that its equality policy had nothing left to offer.
It is for these reasons that I urge the House to vote in large numbers in favour of this Equality Institute.
It needs to be made visible in this way.
The Gender Institute is not, however, a substitute for legislative initiative.
We will be vigilant in ensuring that equality policy does not run into the sand.
The Gender Institute must not be allowed to become a means of appeasement or of distraction from the lack of legislative action.
A Gender Institute will not make equality policy any less necessary a component in legislation, and we really will hold the Commission to that.
So let me again ask for really strong support for this report.
Â Â  I wish to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, especially MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner and MrsÂ Sartori, for their committed work on this issue.
I fully support this, as does the whole group.
We realise that an institute cannot in itself bring about increased equality but appreciate that, if it is designed in the right way, it can be an incredibly important tool for successful work in promoting equality.
I should like to indicate two proposals that would further reinforce the work of the institute: firstly, that it be possible effectively to evaluate the consequences for women or, as the case may be, for men of decisions at all levels; and, secondly, that the board be composed of six people from the Council, six from the Commission and a further three from, as appropriate, an employeesâ or employersâ organisation and a voluntary organisation.
I think that these last three should also have voting rights and that the voluntary organisation should be a womenâs organisation.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, in its effort to achieve equality between the sexes the European Commission intends to devote EURÂ 50Â million to the activities of the planned European Institute for Gender Equality.
This body is to be charged with ensuring equal pay for equal work, doing away with gender stereotypes and also promoting equality between the sexes beyond the European Union.
I would, however, like to remind the House that almost 70Â million of the 450Â million inhabitants of the European Union are living in poverty.
This represents 15% of the population and is a clear indication of inequality.
It is also a violation of fundamental human rights and an affront to human dignity.
In the interests of peace it would be appropriate to help the poor, do away with unemployment and sort out the situation in the health service.
That would be far more beneficial than encouraging ill feeling between men and women, which always has negative consequences for women.
Any inequalities relating to remuneration could be remedied by means of a single legal act, which would not require such extensive funding.
Instead of attempting to even out the natural imbalances in various areas of the economy and professional life, and promoting equality beyond the Union, we ought to be focusing on equality within the Union.
The aforementioned funds would be more usefully spent on helping at least the children living in poverty by improving their living conditions.
Promoting the family should take precedence over the elimination of gender stereotypes and would help reverse the current trend to relegate the family to the level of an outmoded cultural curiosity.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, equality between men and women is an oft-repeated mantra within the European Union.
Common sense tells us, however, that this is not at all a straightforward matter.
Men and women are referred to as such precisely because they are different.
They are equal in terms of dignity but they are different.
This is obvious in the world of sport mentioned earlier.
I have recently been attempting to discover how the European Commission understands this formula, especially as the formula is very often accompanied by the corollary in all areas.
So be it.
I therefore enquired if this equality stems from the law of nature or from statute law, and what can be done to enable men to bear children.
CommissionerÂ Å pidla replied that the principle of gender equality only applies to work and to access to goods and services.
That is contrary to fact.
After all, ArticleÂ 23 in ChapterÂ III of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union clearly refers to all areas.
If the European Commission is unable to resolve the problem in European law, I doubt the planned institute will manage to do so.
Â Â  MrÂ President, one thing is certain: there is no lack of structures and networks of all kinds devoted to studying and standing up for women.
There are the Institute for Gender Equality, various NGOs, ad hoc committees, fundamental rights agencies, consultative forums on women's rights, the European women's lobby, and our own committee within Parliament.
Therefore, is it really reasonable to set up a new European Institute for Gender Equality?
In this cloud of structures, not always operating in perfect harmony in terms of the exchange of information, will this new body, which is supposed to network all of this information, have actual resources allowing it to exist?
To be clear, can we now be sure that, beyond its future operationality, it will be completely politically and financially independent?
It would appear not, as the Commission is not inclined to give this future institute very much room for manoeuvre.
Indeed, its reluctance to allow the director of the institute to be answerable solely to the management board and not to the Commission is very revealing in that regard.
For all these reasons and more besides, I cannot vote in favour of this initiative to create what I would describe as just yet another labyrinthine system.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the founding of a European institute for gender mainstreaming, aÂ substantial long-term task highlighted by the Treaty of Amsterdam and positively influenced by the process that followed the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing, has become a theme of political discussion between supporters and opponents of the Institute.
IÂ am one of those who support the shared view of the rapporteurs, MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner and MrsÂ Sartori, who have managed to find aÂ common solution on behalf of the two largest political groups in the European Parliament.
IÂ admire and appreciate their work on this report, and in particular their patient awareness-raising campaign advocating the setting up of the Institute as a coordinator whose task will be to provide technical support for EU gender policy implementation, stimulating and acting in partnership with existing institutions, disseminating information and enhancing the visibility of issues relating to gender equality.
I do not support the amendment suggesting that the Institute be integrated into the EUâs Human Rights Agency based in Vienna, as the entire problem area would then become part of an existing agenda, and this would certainly not fulfil the EUâs ambition to strengthen its equal opportunities policy.
As the most recent reports also suggest, inequalities between men and women still persist.
The existence of inequality is a matter for society as a whole and not just for women.
Establishing the Institute will be a major building block for the recently adopted roadmap on implementing equal opportunity policy.
In financial terms, the Institute will not be aÂ significant burden, as funding will come from sources that are already in place.
The added value of the Institute will also include activities targeted outside the European Union, especially with regard to enlargement, where equal opportunities are, and will remain, a topical agenda.
In conclusion, I am convinced that locating the Institute in one of the new Member States will further the cause of even-handed institutional decentralisation in the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteurs on their report and express my satisfaction with the Commissionâs efforts to provide the European Union with an independent body specifically dedicated to gender equality issues.
I would like to emphasise the need for the Institute to have full independence, without conditions of any kind.
This is a fundamental objective if the Institute is to be able to fulfil its objectives, which go far beyond simply providing the Commission with technical assistance.
As a working method, I believe that the idea of creating a European gender equality network is clearly very innovative and effective, above all with a view to meeting the essential time and distance requirements for the sharing and exchange of knowledge, information and policies.
With regard to the structure of the Institute, I believe that an acceptable solution to the issue of the composition of the Management Board has finally been found.
This provides for a fair and effective distribution of functions amongst the three institutions, and one appropriate to the actual situation of a body that will unfortunately be under-funded and under-staffed.
In this regard, I would like to emphasise that, in order for the Institute to be able to fulfil its objectives, adequate funding that gives credibility to the European Unionâs commitment to gender equality is essential.
This is something that we must all bear very much in mind at the moment in the negotiations that are taking place amongst the different institutions with regard to funding.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am in favour of establishing a separate, active and independent European Institute for Gender Equality.
The EUâs firm policy on equality would be a resource.
Women are participating more and more in the labour market, and men less and less.
In the future we cannot afford to neglect or ignore existing human resources.
The Gender Equality Institute could, however, have an influence on this situation.
Within the context of the Lisbon Strategy, the equality standpoint carried a lot of weight at first, but it has been forgotten about.
The issue of equality should be made far more prominent, and in respect of that an active Institute could work to make the EU stronger and more competitive than ever.
Â Â  â IÂ would like to thank the rapporteurs for drafting this report, which should culminate in the establishment of the European Gender Institute.
The task of the Institute will be to collect and analyse gender equality data in the EU countries, as well as to organise conferences and campaigns.
It seems to me entirely wrong to call into question the establishment of the Institute and, in this regard, I also object to the way that doubt has been cast on the Slovak Republic as a potential location for the Institute.
I am not going to list every institution that is based in the territories of the fifteen old Member States.
I respect the fact that during the founding of the European Union such centres had to be established and further developed as part of a coordinated joint action.
I therefore urge you to cast your votes in favour of establishing this Institute.
The Gender Institute could function as an ombudsman for women, a mediator between the government and non-governmental organisations in eliminating injustices, such as discrimination in labour relations.
After all, it is widely known that the lowest wages are commonly found in so-called âfemale sectorsâ, that is, in education and healthcare, whereas the highest wages are typical of male-dominated occupations, such as the armed forces and police.
Are the health and education of future generations perhaps less important?
Â Â  Mr President, I would of course like to congratulate the two rapporteurs and all of the members of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, who have done so much work on this report.
I believe that this Institute needs to be a useful instrument, but how useful it is will depend on whether or not the governments really have the political will to achieve equality between men and women.
I say that because, as Mrs Sartori has said, there has been legislation to ensure that men and women are paid the same for the same job for more than fifty years.
Nevertheless, we are in 2006 and many women still earn less than men for the same job or have contracts that do not correspond to the work that they are actually doing.
These effective measures, therefore, which are what women need in our European society, require that laws be put into practice and not that more and more laws be created.
To this end, we need political will expressed through money, money that has to be provided for in the budgets, both national budgets and European Union budgets.
I want genuine equality, and what, of course, I do not want is political propaganda.
When governments that claim to be very progressive present plans such as, for example, the National Reform Plan that has been presented by the government of my country, they often include phrases such as âbenefits will be given for the contracting of young unemployed males of under thirty years of ageâ while at the same time not providing for any measure for women of under thirty years of age, amongst whom, in my country, there is a much higher rate of unemployment than amongst men.
I call this demagoguery: saying one thing but doing another, and that is precisely what we must avoid in the European Union.
I therefore say yes to this Institute, but it must serve a genuine purpose.
Â Â  I would like to thank the two co-rapporteurs, MrÂ GrÃ¶ner and MrsÂ Sartori, for their excellent work.
Indeed, this report adds to the Commission's initial text a number of improvements that I had also proposed in my draft opinion in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I would like to point to four of them.
First of all, there is the proactive role given to the institute, particularly through its analysis and expertise missions and the option it is given of submitting its recommendations and guidelines to the Community institutions.
Next, there is the importance of cooperation with the fundamental rights agency.
Then there is the need for balanced participation of men and women in the management board, and, finally, there is the role of the European Parliament, particularly concerning the nomination of the director of the institute and of the members of the management board and monitoring their work.
This Gender Institute is a vital part of a true Europe of citizens, and I was extremely disappointed that my draft report was rejected by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, 18 votes to 18, because part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and part of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wanted to prevent this institute from seeing the light of day.
That said, I am also pleased to see that the co-rapporteurs have incorporated the essential elements of my concerns into their report.
Â Â  â I am delighted with this report.
I believe that it is very important for the identity of the new modern Europe.
The equal opportunities problem is especially relevant in the states of Eastern Europe.
Indeed, it is no accident that Slovenia, Slovakia and Lithuania aspire to establish this institute in their countries.
Women in Eastern European states are still frequently regarded as homemakers and are not integrated into economic processes.
The European Parliament has its Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
In many European states there are ministries, departments and other institutions dedicated to gender equality.
That is why I believe it is logical to establish such an institution across the entire European Union.
I, therefore, endorse the efforts of rapporteurs L. GrÃ¶ner and A. Sartori, together with their argument that an independent institute can operate much more effectively than one which is part of another agency.
I would like to stress that the institute is needed for men as well as women, and it is a shame that the majority of those speaking today were women.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the feministsâ ridiculous slogan about gender equality is detrimental to women.
This slogan ascribes great value to male characteristics and suggests that women also possess them.
That is not the case.
Women possess female characteristics and the latter must also be valued.
References to wives that do not work are insulting, because these women work very hard in the home.
Their work should be valued and recognised as being worth at least as much as work undertaken by men if not more.
One of the most unfortunate features of contemporary society is that women are being forced to work outside the home for financial reasons, because it is impossible to bring up a family on a single wage.
This is happening against a background of high unemployment.
Women cannot be asked to contribute in the same way as men.
For example, they cannot be expected to work shifts or to spend several days away from home.
This is because we simply are not equal.
Women are of inestimable value due to their role as mothers, which is why they deserve special consideration and protection.
They do not need an institute.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a European Institute for Gender Equality is urgently needed, because even in the heart of Europe in the 21stÂ century we are regularly witnessing discrimination on the grounds of sex.
Women account for 52% of the population of Europe and they are constantly experiencing discrimination in many areas of their lives.
This new Institute must not simply restrict itself to gathering statistical data if it is to promote and implement a gender equality policy effectively in the enlarged Union.
It must focus instead on analysing the data in detail and drafting the advice and guidelines needed to mainstream the concept of gender equality effectively in the European legal system.
It should be borne in mind that gender equality, which the Institute is charged with promoting, is a fundamental right and a priority Community policy.
It is enshrined in the Treaty and must be implemented across all areas of social and economic activity, notably as regards access to employment and entrepreneurship.
It would be appropriate for the Instituteâs seat to be located in the new part of the united Europe, perhaps in Poland.
Poland is the largest of the new countries, and a country where not only is discrimination widespread, but is also played down by the authorities.
Â Â  Emile Zola said that a woman is the axis around which civilisation revolves.
This institute should become the axis around which European gender equality issues and its implementation revolve.
To make the European Institute for Gender Equality a reality, all there needs to be is an understanding of the problem, political will and some funding.
It is considerably harder for the institute's work to change attitudes towards women, and to eradicate the discrimination they endure in many European countries.
The institute should employ not just any specialists, but people of both sexes who are passionate about its activities.
The influence of the European Parliament in the formation of the institute's team and constant parliamentary control are a necessity.
The institute should evaluate the situation in every area, in every country and present proposals.
On this basis, EU institutions would take effective measures and would demand the same of national governments.
The institute should begin its work in one of the new EU countries.
Vilnius offers not only what Lithuania can achieve through the implementation of equality, but also the opportunity to combine the experience of the leading Scandinavian countries with the potential of Central Europe, and indeed the whole of Europe.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to your discussion and I hope you will allow me to touch on several of the issues that have been raised.
First of all I would like to express my appreciation for the exceptional quality of the report by the rapporteurs, which can only be described as brilliant, in view of the complexity of the subject matter.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the debate a number of arguments and opinions have been put forward, which in my view require a response.
The first opinion to be expressed was the view that this institution should become part of the human rights agenda.
A series of speakers in the discussion have taken the view, which I fully support, that the question of equal opportunities goes far beyond the simple issue of human rights, albeit that human rights are of fundamental importance.
The issue of equal opportunities is a broader issue.
There was a question as to whether it was right for the European Union to promote equal opportunities even in its international relations.
I must state my firm conviction that there is a need for this.
The EU is involved in countless international connections, both with the Member States and in the context of development aid and at a multilateral level, and each of these offers the opportunity of effectively reinforcing gender equality.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that gender equality, promoted and backed on a global scale, will provide a major source of global stability and is capable of pacifying many of our current conflicts.
I also feel that the argument put forward in the debate that the institute will provide greater visibility and political transparency for the issues of equal rights and equal opportunities is correct.
I fully support this argument.
It is also right to remind ourselves, as was frequently stated in the debate, that we have much work still to do.
Clearly, we are trying to define policies on the basis of argument, and that is one of the civilised outcomes of life in todayâs Europe.
I might add that these are policies based on practical proofs and practical opinions.
Even from this perspective the institute can enhance quality.
It is, in my view, apparent that there is a wealth of important information that is not being used effectively in political decision-making.
Which of you, for example, knows that in Spain men spend 52 million hours a year taking care of others while for women the figure is 200Â million hours.
This is certainly an important indicator of how unequally we share some of the duties and responsibilities that we have as human beings â men and women.
And yet none of this information feeds into political decision-making.
I am convinced that the institute will make many things possible.
Ladies and gentlemen, one of the sound principles of European parliamentary life is multi-lingualism and we often discover that a given matter can be expressed more elegantly and accurately in some other European language.
I hope you will therefore allow me to quote the German expression â.
I am fully convinced that to stay where you are means in reality to retreat.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express an opinion on the amendments that are defined in the report, or which form part of your upcoming vote.
The committeeâs attitude regarding the nature of the institute allows us to be flexible and to accept most of the amendments that strengthen the role and working methods of the institute, including the creation of the network for the institute.
These amendments are acceptable in their original form, either in part or after reworking.
The second category includes the amendments that increase the readability of the text and which the Commission equally can accept in their original form or after a small amount of reworking.
The third group are the amendments that relate to the legal presentation techniques, which, although they are constructive, mark a departure from the original provisions of the existing instruments and therefore cannot be adopted, for reasons of maintaining cohesion.
Finally there are the amendments that relate to horizontal questions, in other words to all agencies and organisations, in respect of procedures for selecting directors, extending their contracts and assessing organisations.
These amendments cannot be accepted, because it is necessary to maintain a certain principle of cohesion in relation to all agencies.
I have left to the end the question of the composition of the governing council.
We are delighted that the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality has come out in favour of limiting the number of members on the governing council and that it has followed the European Parliament resolution from December last year on an operational framework for future regulatory agencies.
We can now be guided by this proposal, although the number of Commission representatives is not the same as in the case of the Council.
The equilibrium between the two organisations and between the two levels of interest, which is to say the national level and the Community level, may be further secured if, in accordance with the proposal and where the Commission has responsibility, the voice of its representative carries the same weight as the voices of all of the Council representatives together, in the very limited number of cases involving the approval of budgets and programmes of work.
We therefore accept Amendments 66, 82 and 85 relating to the composition of the governing council and voting regulations.
In the same spirit we agree that the number of members can be reduced to a mere 25 representatives of the Member States, as stated in Amendments 67 and 83, and we consider it sufficient that participating parties are present at meetings of the governing council without voting rights.
We hope that the Council will be able to adopt your proposal for the governing council, which, together with the rotating system, will allow representatives from all Member States to alternate over a period of three mandates.
In conclusion, I would like to say that we took pains to adopt as many of your amendments as possible.
The Commission can now adopt Amendments 2 to 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 35, 36, 38 to 42, 44, 45, 48, 53, 55, 59 to 69, 74 and 76 to 85.
The Commission cannot adopt Amendments 1, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 21 to 23, 27, 30 to 34, 37, 43, 46, 47, 49 to 52, 54, 56 to 58, 70 to 73 and part of 75.
We should also pay regard to the discussions in the Council, and we must take every effort to ensure that an acceptable compromise is achieved by the end of the year.
The Commission is counting on the support of the European Parliament to set up this much needed European institute, and it is important to ensure that the organisation begins work in 2007, in the interests of progress and to raise the profile of the gender equality policy.
I will of course be submitting an opinion on individual amendments in writing later.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The June List believes that gender equality issues are important and that it absolutely goes without saying that women and men should be treated equally under all circumstances.
The EUâs new Institute for Gender Equality is to analyse equality in the EU by comparing data from different Member States.
The obvious question to be asked is: what added value will this authority contribute?
Will it have a practical and significant job to do, or will it mainly be a way for the EU institutions to demonstrate their ability to take action?
Will the authority help increase gender equality, or will it mainly constitute a type of alibi and way of showing that the EU cares about equality issues?
The arguments presented in the report are unconvincing.
The authorityâs tasks could be carried out within the framework of existing structures.
The EU already has its central statistics agency, Eurostat, which is able to produce comparative statistics on gender equality in EU countries.
There are also national authorities that work on equality issues and that can cooperate across national borders.
The Commission consists of 18 men and 7 women.
Approximately 30% of MEPs are women.
The EU institutions should begin by applying equality within their own structures and in that way setting an example, before new centralised EU authorities are set up.
Cooperation can also take place in more decentralised forms, without the EU growing larger as a result of new authorities being created for every important issue.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality, which will facilitate the elimination of all forms of gender discrimination throughout Europe, is of paramount importance.
I agree with the wish expressed by the rapporteurs that the activities of the Institute should not be restricted merely to data collection, record keeping and research.
The analyses should be integrated in the policies of Member States innovatively, with the objective that equal opportunities become a main political guideline and mainstreaming for legislators.
At the same time, the results of the research should be made available to the general public, to enable European citizens to adopt a conscious position regarding the issues surrounding gender equality.
However, this requires that the relationship of the Institute with the civil sector and the forums responsible for communication issues is strengthened and institutionalised.
I would like to call attention to the fact that cooperation with the media and the employment of modern means of communication constitute an important task of the Institute!
Resources must be made available to ensure that the results of research go beyond the professional sphere and are available and useable as widely as possible.
The work of the Institute will only be effective if it really operates as the European network of gender equality, if it is able to coordinate Member State centres, organisations and specialists involved in the general implementation of equal opportunities, and if its message reaches the governments and the citizens of Europe.
I congratulate the rapporteurs and propose that the document be accepted!
Thank you for the floor!
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Today's voting time will be divided in two to make space for the formal sitting devoted to the address by the President of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Â Â  I will now suspend the sitting for a few minutes prior to PresidentÂ KÃ¶hler's address.
We will return to the votes immediately following the formal sitting.
Â Â  Mr President of the Federal Republic of Germany, ladies and gentlemen, before welcoming our illustrious guest today, I must inform you that, during the meeting we held with President KÃ¶hler before coming to the Chamber, we heard the sad news of the death of Mr Lennart Meri, who was President of Estonia from 1992 to 2001.
As you know, President Meri was seen as a symbol of Estoniaâs fight for freedom and national identity, and his death deprives us of an important European personality, whose memory we shall honour here today.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me and the whole of the European Parliament to welcome you to this formal sitting today.
Mr President, please allow me to stress your personal commitment to the European project, which is particularly useful and necessary at a time when the situation in the European Union is causing many doubts amongst the citizens.
I know that this is a cause for concern for you, which you express with passion.
I know that you are very aware of the responsibility we all share in relation to the problems of concern to Europeans today, which cannot be resolved without more Europe.
We are aware of the initiatives that you are taking to extend and deepen the European debate.
One example of this was your invitation to your counterparts from Finland, Italy, Latvia, Austria, Portugal and Hungary to a meeting that was held in Dresden â about which I am sure you will speak this morning â with students and personalities from those countries, in order to debate European identity and the future of Europe.
This important initiative is not an isolated one.
You take every possible opportunity to exchange opinions with the citizens and in particular with young people.
Strangely enough, it is they who express the greatest scepticism about this project which is so important to their future.
You also combine words with actions: you do not just talk about âEuropeâ at official events, but you also work every day on specific issues on the European agenda.
Your personal experience makes you almost the model European.
You were young, a child refugee, during the final stages of the Second World War.
During my visit to Germany, you told me, very directly and personally, of your experiences: how you suffered the war and the exodus from the refugee camp, how you made a success of your life in a ruined country that was also gradually building its future upon the wreckage of history.
Your personal experience took you away from Europe.
You have lived outside Europe and you have watched us from that standpoint and, for that very reason, because you have had dramatic experiences inside Europe and have watched it being built from the outside, you know that Europe has no option other than its European Union project.
You also know, however, that those values and projects must be actively defended every day and that they do not come free or automatically, and I would therefore like to thank you for being here with us today to communicate your ideas to us, which will undoubtedly make a great contribution to our broad debate on Europe.
President KÃ¶hler, I am very pleased to give you the floor.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, honourable Members of the European Parliament, your honourable House is the centre of public politics and democratic opinion for the EU, and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this place about Europe and its future.
Europe presents a puzzling aspect to the world.
Why, so soon after its reunification, does it already appear so divided?
Why, when the European internal market has been so successful, does it not have more confidence in its advantages?
Why, with all its strengths and opportunities, does it display such hesitancy?
When I was working for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and for the International Monetary Fund, I got to know many countries around the world.
Looking at Europe from outside gave me a sharper picture of it, and I learned how other countries see our continent and the European Union.
For us, democracy founded upon freedom, the peaceful settlement of disputes and mutual solidarity among the twenty-five Member States have long been a fact of daily life.
Looking in from the outside, though, one sees much more clearly to just what an incredible achievement we owe what is now ordinary, a mere two generations after the Second World War and half a generation on from the removal of the Iron Curtain.
It is for this achievement that Europe is an object of admiration for many people around the world, but, while they admire us, they are slowly beginning to grow impatient with us and to be baffled by us.
Too many Europeans they see as remarkably lacking in self-awareness, beset by doubt and lacking in courage, and they say, in a friendly way, âEurope, if you are tired, step aside, we want to move forwardâ.
What do we say to that?

What I say to that is this: Europe will always be full of creative ferment; we Europeans do not fear challenges â we make use of them, and that is why the European Union has a good future ahead of it.
I want to back up the three things I have just said.
Those who want to understand Europe must consider its history and understand what are the ideas and ideals that bind us Europeans together.
What we regard as central is the inalienable value of all human beings, in all their uniqueness, along with their dignity and freedom.
Even thousands of years ago, people in Europe regarded these things as gifts of which one proved oneself worthy only by using them to the utmost and, if need be, by fighting again and again to secure them.
That is precisely what Europeans did â tirelessly and in the teeth of every dreadful setback.
Their use of their talents opened up to them the depth of the mind and spirit, in the shape of philosophy, the sciences and the riches of the arts.
In so doing, people in Europe also learned to question their own beliefs and to demand â and give â good reasons for every action, and this process of enlightenment will never come to an end.
It was very early on that we understood and took to heart the importance of social cohesion, self-determination and autonomy, not only in the city-states of ancient Greece but in the republics of medieval Italy, with not only the self-awareness of Spain, France, Poland and England, but also the colourful diversity of the âHoly Roman Empire of the German Nationâ.
In all these places, Europeans were as god-fearing as they were industrious.
Not only at home, but also in the outside world, they understood work as a religious obligation; they traded and learned how to co-exist with people of other faiths and cultures and live with them.
It is true to say that in doing this, Europeans more than once sinned terribly against other peoples and cultures and also against one another, but they did learn the right lessons from that, in that they now contend for human rights, peace and democracy and wish others to learn the same lessons that they have had to learn.
Europe also bears the stamp of a culture of active love of oneâs neighbour and of active striving for social justice.
These good qualities are, of course, to be found on all continents, and Europe has learned from them, but the specifically European blend of love of freedom, the striving for truth, solidarity and creative ferment is unique and found to be good by the many outside Europe who expect us to make our contribution to the peace and well-being of the world, just as it will be by those who will come after us.
Yet again, great challenges lie ahead of the European Union and its Member States.
Around the world, new growth regions are emerging, and the shape of competition is changing; there are new spheres of influence, and new lines of conflict are being drawn.
In many European countries, unemployment is at intolerably high levels.
The public and the electorate are becoming demonstrably alienated from the European Union, and the European constitutional treaty failed to win the approval of the people of two of the founding states of our Community.
So many challenges, so many opportunities!
We must again think back to how often Europe has succeeded in facing times of trial, precisely because it was capable of renewal.
You need only consider the European internal market and economic and monetary union.
Thirty years ago, the Dutch foreign minister, Van der Stoel, said that the motto of the European Communities was no longer âcompleter, deeper and widerâ but rather âinertia, reversal and flightâ.
Europe was, at the time, in a profound economic and institutional crisis.
Twenty years ago, the Single European Act set the internal market as a goal.
At that time, there were so many obstacles to the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital that, to take one example, Philips had to produce seven different versions of the same electric razor for the European market and Siemens had to produce twenty-five different electrical plugs.
Ten years ago, the goal of the internal market had largely been achieved.
The European Union has now put it on an institutional foundation and increased economic and social cohesion between the Member States.
Since then, European firms have had a domestic market of what are now 450 million customers for their products.
New opportunities for success have come into being, not least for service providers from the smaller Member States, who are now able to produce their goods in larger quantities and hence in a more competitive way.
And, above all, the internal market is a first-rate programme for making European businesses fit for global competition.
Those who manage to prove their worth in it, have no need to fear competition from overseas.
Economic and monetary union was and is the logical outcome of the internal market, shielding it against the possibility of again being split up through arbitrary devaluations, against monetary crises and waves of speculation of the kind that we in Europe were still experiencing at the beginning of the 1990s.
It gives businesses the security to plan ahead, enables consumers to compare prices without difficulty and does away with high charges for currency exchange and the high costs of hedging against exchange risks.
That is why the euro â like the internal market â has long been a success story, and its strength on international currency markets testifies to the worldâs confidence that was learned long ago is still true today, that Europe is capable of turning challenges into opportunities, and that is something you need to recall, again and again, day in and day out.
We will succeed again, albeit subject to two conditions: we must not allow our tried and tested principles and achievements to be undermined, and we must, earnestly and honestly, set to the task of correcting what has gone wrong and putting things in order where they need to be.
All that needs to be said about the first condition is that those whose protectionism weakens the European internal market are, at the end of the day, harming themselves.
Those who now revert to the old attitude that everyone should look after themselves first are misjudging the dimension of global competition and offering their citizens a false security.
In the long term, they are undermining Europeâs ability to maintain its position in the world, create lasting jobs and accrue the resources for a more equitable society.
It follows, then, that only the other way remains.
Europe must regain its fitness.
For each and every one of us, that task begins at home.
Some Member States have made considerable headway with the necessary structural reforms and have what is needed; others have yet to make more efforts in that direction.
There are many examples that show that the effort is worth it, and we must not fail to make it.
The European Union, too, is in need of reshaping.
The first issue to be addressed is that of where it, as a Union, should become active.
At the end of the day, it needs to do not everything that can be done, but rather everything that needs to be done, and that does not include those things that can already be done quite adequately at the local or regional level or by individual nation states.
Respect for the subsidiarity principles means respecting in so far as possible the personal responsibility and identity of the EUâs citizens, and anyone who knows how decisions are really arrived at in the European Union will know that this is an obligation incumbent not only on the governments of the Member States but also on the institutions of the European Union.
If, though, the European Union takes action with good reason, it needs to do so with as little administrative red tape as possible and in a way that people can understand.
After all, we are heirs to a great tradition of law and administration in Europe, and that should encourage us once and for all to let some air into the bureaucratic apparatus.
Our former enthusiasm for legislation has left us with plenty of places where we can do this, and so it is a good thing that the European Commission has set in motion a major programme of cutting through the thickets of legal verbiage that we have at present and simplifying European law.
I have just had a good discussion about this with Commissioner Verheugen.
The public will also appreciate it if decisions in Europe are arrived at in a more transparent way.
At present, the decision-making processes at EU level are often a world away from the people they affect, many of whom have little concept of who in Europe is actually responsible for what and of who, at the end of the day, is to be held responsible for what goes on, and, as a result, they become apathetic or suspicious â both of which are damaging.

The public, though, want to be more than spectators who understand the plot; in addition to the European elections, they seek as much democratic involvement as possible; they want to be heard, and they want to be able to take the initiative in influencing what the European institutions do.
To that, you will say that all these things â subsidiarity, democratic participation, the right to a citizensâ initiative â are to be found in the European Constitutional Treaty.
Indeed they are, and the treaty contains much else that is good and right, which should not too readily be surrendered, not least in view of the fact that 14 Member States have already voted to approve it.
Europe has now prescribed itself a âpause for thoughtâ, termed in German a ââ, which can mean both a pause for thought and a pause in thought.
We should use this period of reflection as an opportunity for a thorough rethink.
By then at the latest, we must talk to each other soberly and seriously â not only in the European institutions and parties, but also in all the Member Statesâ public fora for political debate. What that will demand of the Members of your honourable House is ideas and tireless effort â not least in discussions with those who were less than satisfied with what I have had to say.
This European debate cannot do other than benefit from diversity and creativity, but the only thing that will count will be the power of sound argument.
It will be enlightening in the best sense of the word if there is in-depth discussion in the Member States about the purpose and substance of European integration.
It will, in the long term, do public acceptance of the EU some good.
I have confidence in the people of Europe, in the European public; they must be trusted with something at least.
We Europeans expect good reasons and give them; that is something I regard as characterising us.
I believe, then, that there is more than one good reason why Europe should, in the new world order that is coming into being, speak with one voice on matters of foreign and security policy.
It gives us more weight, for example when discussing with others in the world the international dimension of social responsibility and the protection of the environment, and the public have long been aware of the fact that, in worldwide competition, we must be all the better the more expensive we are.
For Europeâs future prospects and for the far too numerous young people without work, then, education, training, research and development are crucial, and that is a good enough reason to reallocate considerable sums from the European budget in that direction and thereby to earn a tribute of appreciation from our nation states.
The public will also be appreciative if the EU sets itself new goals and takes the sort of actions that make Europeansâ lives easier and keep them safer.
That is indeed possible, as has most recently and resoundingly been demonstrated by energy policy.
It must surely be plain to every rational person that all the Member States have a vital interest in the safe and affordable supply of environmentally-friendly energy and that they must work together to find the most effective way of achieving this.
The âeveryone should look after themselvesâ attitude will not hold water.
The European Commission has presented a Green Paper on energy policy, and that I very much welcome.
Where these matters are concerned, we need the right decisions, and soon.
The debates of which I have spoken and which will ensure the European Union a good future, are already underway.
Let me give a small example of this; a few weeks ago, I was in Dresden with six other European presidents.
We were continuing a dialogue initiated by the former Portuguese President Sampaio, and we talked to young people, with a hundred students from seven Member States, and we asked them what they thought about Europe, what benefits they could see accruing from it, and what expectations they had of the European Union and its Member States.
These students were not hand-picked; they had been found by a public lottery, but these young people were well prepared.
They had spent a day and a half discussing among themselves and called what had emerged from their own deliberations the âDresden Demands for European Cohesionâ.
They are thinking, for example, in terms of a single right to vote and would like to see a European House of History.
They suggest setting aside five per cent of the gross domestic product for research and development.
And they want a European army and European non-combatant service.
Further to this speech, I am presenting, for the documentary records of your honourable House, a copy of what these young people wrote down.
Granted, their group was hardly representative, and they appear idealistic in what they call for, but their idealism is impressive.
It has about it much of the enthusiasm of the people who rebuilt Europe after the war and who fought for its unity in freedom.
There it is â the typical creative ferment.
There they are â the Europeans who expect something of Europe and are ready to do something for it.
They are to be found in Europe.
By the way, some of these students had benefited from the Erasmus programme; let us be glad of this Erasmus generation and make more of them.
And while I am on that subject, trainees and apprentices too should be given more opportunities to learn from their neighbours and learn from experience the value of Europe.
It was Jacques Delors who proposed the European Training Cheque, and I urge your House to draw on it!
Let us take the enthusiasm of these young people as an example.
Let us show ourselves to be real Europeans.
Let us, rather than being disquieted by the future, be filled with creative restlessness, for Europe and for the European Union.
Let us join together in transforming all our challenges into opportunities, for the benefit of all; then Europe will still be what it is today, a good place in which to live and a force for good in this one world of ours!

Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Before continuing with the sitting, I would like to say a few words of thanks to the President for his speech.
It is true that there was a time when we had twenty-five different kinds of plug: now we have the same plug, but twenty-five different electricity networks.
As you have pointed out, the next step is to move ahead with the Europe of energy and with many other aspects which must become common.
Thank you very much for your words and your encouragement, Mr President.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now return to voting time.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment 9, to remove the reference to civil society.
The rest of the amendment will remain unchanged.
Â Â  Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
Â Â  That concludes voting time.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, MrsÂ Kauppi, on the proposal for an amendment of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding the capital of public limited liability companies.
At the same time as protecting the rights of shareholders and creditors, it was becoming urgent to simplify the means of maintaining and altering the capital of public limited liability companies in view of the large number of different situations facing economic operators.
Expanding on the lines of thought underpinning these legislative developments, I believe that there is a need to engage in a broader political debate. The aim of such a debate, particularly where natural or legal persons not resident in the European Union are concerned, will be to regulate access â both direct and indirect â to the capital of companies operating in the European internal market.
Â Â  Mr President, let me say, for the sake of clarity, that I have voted against the GrÃ¶ner report, not because I am opposed to gender equality, which is far from being the case, but because this report and the institute for gender equality to which it refers are typical of the suffocating, political correctness which is gradually tightening its grip on Europe.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights, a politically correct, left-wing policy document enforced by an equally politically correct office for fundamental rights, along with job quotas and the other measures proposed in the now deceased but ever-looming European Constitution, are framed by the same ideology.
I urge you to ignore those issues in favour of what really matters, which is that women are entitled to the same employment and must receive equal pay for equal work.
We are all agreed on this.
All the rest is mere political correctness.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wished to emphasise that I am absolutely convinced of the need to safeguard human rights, of both men and women, but I am not sure that this specific text safeguards these rights or the subsidiarity of the Member States on the issues to which it relates.
Â Â  . We voted in favour because we recognise the importance of setting up a European Institute for Gender Equality.
We also wish to stress that this Institute must not solely be involved in studies, analyses and the preparation of statistics, however important this activity may be.
Cooperation and dialogue with NGOs and bodies that specialise in the field of equal opportunities must be stepped up, at national and European level, and with third countries.
Measures to put an end to discrimination must also be supported.
It is also essential that we analyse and monitor gender mainstreaming in all policies and in the EUâs budgetary process, especially with regard to the impact of relevant national Community policies on men and women.
This was something that we proposed but that, regrettably, was not adopted.
Lastly, we hope that adequate Community funding will be forthcoming and that common sense prevails when it comes to the appointment of the management board.
Â Â  The report proposes that a new European Institute for Gender Equality be set up.
The June Listâs basic attitude is that issues of equality have very high priority.
Equal treatment of women and men is an imperative demand that all EU countries must fulfil.
This does not, however, mean that the EU should set up another bureaucracy for the purpose.
Sweden has come a long way with its work on equality, and the June List is convinced that this work is best done at national level.
An Institute for Gender Equality at European level means increased bureaucracy and less efficiency.
The fight for equality must be conducted from the bottom up in the Member States and not from the top down by appointed Eurocrats, if citizens of both genders are to be engaged in it.
Eurostat can take care of the need for comparative statistics in this area.
We have thus chosen to vote against the report in its entirety.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues are strong supporters of equality of opportunity in society.
We believe in both men and women playing their full role in the life of our own nation and elsewhere and oppose any discrimination on the ground of gender.
However, we have voted against this report today as we do not support the proliferation of new EU agencies and institutes that will add to the burden of the taxpayer and increase bureaucracy without any proven benefit to the people they are supposed to serve.
The creation of a separate institute in regard to this issue risks ghettoisation by leaving it open to single-issue pressure groups and thus easier to disregard and marginalise.
The issue of gender equality should be dealt with in the framework of the global approach to fundamental rights.
Â Â  . The Commission announced the creation of the European Institute on Gender Equality even before Parliament had delivered its report on the subject.
Procedurally speaking, that is the wrong way to go about it.
We are voting on it today, and Parliamentâs voice carries weight in this matter.
The intention is that an Institute should be created, with a budget of EURÂ 54.5 million, with the specific function of monitoring menâs and womenâs equality of opportunity by producing statistics and reports.
This House has, however, for practical and financial reasons, and as recently as last year, recommended that the Institute for Gender Equality should form part of the European Human Rights Agency.
More action and more resources are needed to address equality issues in an effective way, but no provision is as yet being made for them.
It follows that the original idea of combining the two agencies in one single Agency for Fundamental Rights deserves support.
It is for that reason that I have tabled Amendment 73.
Rejecting the creation of an independent institute on Gender Equality is not in any way to be seen as an expression of hostility to policy on womenâs issues.
The money available to us should be invested in womenâs education.
That would be the first step towards equality.
The current debate on the reduction of bureaucracy is another reason why an additional agency does not make sense and would not be something readily explicable to the public.
It is for that reason that I have not voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  . I have, for over 40 years, campaigned for womenâs rights and for gender equality.
I cannot therefore be accused of lacking any sympathy for this matter.
I do wonder, though, why a European Institute for Gender Equality is supposed to be necessary, quite simply because the idea of a Gender Institute was hatched over ten years ago, since when a lot of time has passed and we now set different priorities for spending money, which is in short supply, in a more effective way.
I can think of better ways of spending over EURÂ 50 million, and thereby promoting equality of opportunity for women and men, than by creating an Institute whose functions and powers would overlap with those of many bodies at national, European and global level.
The sight of this shopping list â which is what these 85 amendments amount to â causes me to worry about the eventual costs of what will be an oversized playground for womenâs libbers with outdated ideas.
I endorse the amendment that reminds us that this House has already resolved that such an institute should form part of the European Unionâs Agency for Fundamental Rights.
That would, at any rate, limit the damage it could do.
In view of the many things in it that make no sense, and of the absence from it of any financial perspectives, I cannot vote in favour of this report today.
Â Â  . I welcome the report, in particular the effort to create an independent body focusing specifically on gender issues.
I agree with the idea of a body dealing exclusively with gender equality matters, since it ensures that the objective of gender equality, as set out in the Treaty, will not be second to any other anti-discrimination policy at EU level.
Â Â  . The fact that opinions are practically policed and that one-track thinking has all but been established has turned serious, relevant debates addressing pressing issues into reaffirmations of faith in certain policies.
This is clearly the case when it comes to so-called âgender policyâ.
It is one thing to acknowledge the need for a better balance in society, which is characterised by a distribution of labour more in keeping with the modern world and by greater freedom of choice, yet policies that supposedly implement these ideas are all too often forced upon us.
It is as though some policy areas precluded the possibility of divergent opinion on methods and mechanisms.
This is the nub of my primary objection to the idea of an EU Institute for Gender Equality.
The fact that I support, as I said earlier, greater balance in the way in which our societies are organised does not lead me to advocate the creation of this Institute.
Making freedom bureaucratic does not strike me as the right way forward.
The end does not always justify the means.
What is more, the proliferation of âagenciesâ and 'institutesâ does not strike me as an appropriate model for the organisation of Community institutions.
Â Â  We, the Members of the European Parliament belonging to the Austrian Peopleâs Party, are in favour of gender equality and also of politics playing an active role in this area.
We therefore believe that having this matter handled by the planned European Human Rights Agency would send the right message and wish to reiterate our agreement to issues of gender equality being seen as an important task for the Agency, as stated in the European Parliament's resolution of 26 May 2006 on the Kinga Gal report.
We are, however, opposed to the establishment of additional independent institutions, the ultimate result of which will be the existence of new and expensive bureaucracies, and, since the financial issues have been left quite unresolved, reject the planned unspecified financial obligations to the tune of some EURÂ 52Â million.
Â Â  The EU has too many authorities and agencies.
In spite of that, I am voting in favour of this institute being set up.
Gender equality is a disaster, symbolised in particular by outdated rules governing parental leave, the complete lack of gender education, very poor legislation and the fact that 83% of top positions are occupied by men.
It may be worth spending a few million euros on trying to improve this situation a little with the help of an institute designed to supplement the one that already exists to combat discrimination against minorities.
It may actually make sense to have an institute to combat discrimination against the majority, who are women.
Â Â  . This is an excellent report.
We have become starkly aware of more frequent and more severe natural disasters across the EU and the world.
Upon recalling the last 15 months, for example, we have witnessed the tsunami disaster in Asia; the strong tropical cyclone in Louisiana and Mississippi; the devastating floods in Romania, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and France; the serious drought in Spain and Portugal and the fires that have destroyed nearly 180Â 000 hectares of forest in Portugal.
It is clear that natural hazards pose a global threat and warrant global responses.
I therefore welcome the proposal for a Council regulation and the European Parliament's report, specifically regarding the concept of prevention in shaping an EU response to natural disasters.
Prevention is in every way as crucial as reaction to natural disasters and I welcome the inclusion of the concept of prevention in the report.
I also agree that the legal basis is clearer under Art. 175(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and support the rapporteur.
I agree that the EUÂŽs civil protection doctrine has to be founded on a 'bottom-up' approach and that primary responsibility for civil protection activity should be with the Member States.
Â Â  . The Christian Union and SGP MEPs are unable to endorse the recommendation to the Council for the rapid response and readiness instrument for major emergencies.
In particular, we do not support the change in the legal basis, the extension of the instrumentâs scope to enable the funding of preventive measures, or the budget increase.
We specifically regret the change to the legal basis, particularly since Parliament did decide in favour of Article 308 being the only correct legal basis in previous, analogous votes.
Stretching the definition of Article 175 of the Treaty, so that this instrument can fall within its scope is not the right way forward, and can only be interpreted as a majority position in Parliament in order to extend its influence to include topics that are not considered to fall within its remit in the Treaty.
In addition, the financial consequences of the deployment of aid teams should not be ruled by a Community instrument, but are rather a question of solidarity among countries.
Â Â  .
Although there have been a lot of improvements where the response to an emergency due to a disaster is involved, I think that unfortunately there is still a lot more to be done, and thus there is the need for a collective effort so that we will be prepared as much as possible for these disasters to be avoided.
I think that we all agree that when we commit ourselves to work to prevent national-scale disasters, we would also be saving our countries and the European Union huge costs which we are facing due to our present policy.
We have to be ready to invest both money as well as human resources so that a study would be carried out to clearly indicate, or better still, evaluate, the places and regions which are most prone to disasters.
In that way we shall be ready for every eventuality which could occur and as I pointed out before, we would not only be saving many millions but we would be fulfilling our moral duty to protect the life of those more prone to these disasters.
I believe that we should give a political direction so that, through it, any country would be able to rely on help from the Union to launch projects to improve the standard of living of those who live in these regions which are, mostly prone to large-scale problems.
I believe that prevention is better than cure, and so we have to focus our energy in order to be ready for every eventuality.
Â Â  . Recent natural disasters, for example the floods, extreme drought and forest fires affecting not only EU countries, but also countries outside the EU â for example the Asian tsunami and the hurricanes in the USA â demonstrate the importance of effective civil protection mechanisms.
The Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument for major emergencies proposed by the Commission is aimed at enhancing the EUâs response capacity in the context of the civil protection mechanism and at maximising assistance in terms of preparedness and rapid response to major emergencies.
It does not, however, address the issue of prevention.
We therefore feel that this report must be adopted, given that it attaches priority to this issue, proposing that it be included in the scope of this instrument.
We also wish to highlight the proposals on integrated environmental and natural resources, including the management of forests, of areas most at risk from flooding, of wetlands and other fragile ecosystems, and risk assessments in urban areas.
Furthermore, we welcome the prominence given to remote and outlying areas, greater information and awareness-raising among the public and more and better training for those working in the sector.
Â Â  . The text put forward by the Commission contains some good proposals on European-level civil protection.
Measures and activities for which this instrument can be activated will bring major benefits in terms of preparedness and response to emergencies.
With the amendments tabled in Parliament, the prevention of these phenomena now has a part to play in the instrument.
This is a crucial factor in the drive to implement objectives as important as protecting communities, the environment and property.
In a country like Portugal, stricken year after year by forest fires and drought which have left indelible scars, this proposal will make it possible to train specialised personnel, to establish preparedness mechanisms and to share equipment and best practice with countries that are more advanced in this regard.
As such, I endorse the Papadimoulis report and the amendments to the Commissionâs text.
Â Â  There are good reasons for the Member Statesâ governments to give priority to measures that reduce the risk of natural disasters striking.
We nonetheless question whether the EU should have the prominent role that the European Parliament wants it to have in this connection.
Among other things, the European Parliament wants:
â the EU to play an active role in preventing disasters such as serious drought in Spain and Portugal or fires in southern European countries;
â the EU to become involved in disasters outside the EU through, for example, civil protection intervention;
â and the budget for a Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument to be increased by EURÂ 105 million (in excess of the figure proposed by the Commission) for the period 2007â2013.
We believe that it is primarily the task of each Member State to take action in connection with natural disasters.
Many forms of natural disaster (such as drought and fires) are recurrent and can be predicted.
It should be entirely possible for the Member States independently to make the investments that minimise the risk of this type of disaster striking.
What is more, the UN already has a system in operation for helping countries hit by disasters and serious accidents.
The Member States might do well to use this system instead of developing a parallel structure and thus risking unnecessary duplication of effort.
On the basis of this reasoning, we have chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this regulation.
I very much welcome the improvement of the European Union's civil protection mechanisms for emergencies.
This Community response instrument needs to be visible, coordinated, and very responsive, as natural disasters trigger a race against the clock.
The key to success in these activities is complete cooperation between the various parties involved.
I hoped to use the amendments to put the emphasis on the preventative aspect: whilst it is important to know how to respond to disasters, it is even more important to know how to avoid them.
Prevention is a fundamental part of risk reduction.
For example, fires are very often caused by human activities.
Therefore, a call for vigilance accompanied by information on the associated penalties is a preventative measure that we should not ignore.
However, before we draw up action plans, we need an inventory of the existing material and human resources.
This inventory should be drawn up by the European Commission in cooperation with the Member States.
Finally, the initial responsibility for civil protection rests with the Member States.
These Community mechanisms must therefore complement the policies pursued by national, regional or local authorities.
Â Â  . We naturally endorse the proposals in the report aimed at, , introducing and prioritising the dimension of prevention in the context of this instrument, as a key factor in reducing the risks of natural disasters, at stepping up the UNâs role in managing emergencies and helping communities, and at ensuring the protection of public health and cultural heritage.
Yet the debate on solidarity between different countries in the event of a disaster also serves to demonstrate â or rather, to show in stark relief â the appalling waste of resources of the arms race and the militarisation of international relations led by the main capitalist powers, and their ringleader the United States.
One wonders what could be achieved by channelling the colossal financial resources of militarisation and war into prevention, emergency help and immediate response, and the recovery of areas in the event of disasters.
How many lives, how much suffering, how much waste of economic, social and environmental resources could be avoided if there could be a policy of in international relations, peaceful resolution of conflicts, disarmament and effective, mutually advantageous cooperation between different countries and people?
Â Â  . The British Conservatives support the concept that there may be emergencies of a major nature where the Member States will wish to express European solidarity by means of a collective contribution through the EU budget to supplement the efforts of an individual Member State or States.
We are therefore voting in support of the report as a whole.
But we do not support the proposed changes in the legal base, nor the idea of extending the response to emergencies outside the EU, nor the increase in budget.
If the response were to apply worldwide, no conceivable EU budget would be enough to support it.
Parliament should not raise hopes that the EU will not want to fulfil.
Â Â  â The facts demonstrate that the poor, grass-roots classes are the first victims of what is often a criminal lack of appropriate measures to safeguard them from natural disasters.
The huge floods in New Orleans killed thousands of people, even though they knew how to and could have taken preventive measures.
By contrast, in Cuba, where there is universal government prevention and protection, there were no victims.
In this sense, preventive measures are needed to protect health and the environment for which the government alone, and not NGOs, are responsible and, of course, adequate resources needed to be provided.
The Commission proposal ignores the question of prevention, because then it would need to address the social and economic reasons which cause or exacerbate the consequences and provide the necessary resources, which are still inadequate.
However, it is curious how emergencies and the need for Community solidarity against natural, industrial or technological disasters include solidarity for terrorist actions.
Thus the most repulsive article of the 'European Constitution' about solidarity in the event of terrorist actions has come in through the back door because, as we know, the definition of terrorism is elastic and is adapted by Euro-unifying capital to circumstances and directed mainly at the mass, grass-roots movement and its fight against the anti-grass roots, repressive policy of the EU and the governments.
Â Â  . The EU has been proactive and has shown solidarity in response to Member Statesâ requests for help in the event of major emergencies.
That being said, recent major disasters, such as extreme drought and forest fires in Portugal and Spain, have demonstrated that strengthening the Communityâs civil protection mechanism should be an immediate priority before fresh emergencies occur.
The text before us clearly improves upon the Commission's proposal to extend the scope of the regulation and to increase funding for prevention, preparedness and assistance in the event of a disaster.
There is also the issue of maritime pollution.
After all, we must acknowledge that a coastal country cannot deal alone with an environmental emergency caused by a large-scale oil-spill hitting its coastline.
We are also an open Union with policies aimed at international solidarity.
We must do as much as we can when other communities are affected by major emergencies, the crucial priority in this issue being to strengthen mutual assistance between EU Member States.
To sum up, these measures will enable us to react in the most appropriate manner to requests for assistance and this is why I voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  The EU countries should develop structures for helping each other in the event of forest fires and other natural disasters.
These are typically areas in which international coordination is constructive and necessary.
Parliament is also changing the legal basis, a development that will increase civil societyâs opportunities to exercise influence.
I am therefore voting in favour of the proposal, in spite of the fact that I was in a minority in opposing the proposal to include terrorist attacks.
I believe that such attacks are of a quite different character to other disasters and that, in order to protect ourselves against them, quite different methods are required.
They should not, therefore, be covered by the fund.
A different kind of intervention is required in the case of terrorism, and only the purely civil aspects of such intervention, such as helping with reconstruction after an attack, should be covered.
Terrorism mainly affects countries with colonial foreign policies.
Instead of changing these policies, as they ought to do, these countries want, however, to export them, together with their consequences, to all the EU countries.
Now, only an exceedingly small proportion of the fund will probably be used for these purposes, however, and so the proposal is still acceptable.
Â Â  . The IMF is one of the Bretton Woods institutions, which, like the World Bank and GATT/WTO, have served to entrench unequal development between the centre and the outer edges of the capitalist world.
This has helped to liberalise trade in goods and services and has promoted the prevailing neoliberal ideology, which advocates, , the reduction of the role of the state, privatisations and a more flexible labour market, all of which form part of the so-called âLisbon Strategyâ.
The structural adjustment plans are an attempt at what they consider to be the adaptation of the economies of southern countries to the so-called market and competition economy, whereby the markets of such countries will be opened up to foreign investment and economic specialisation models that favour the centre will be ushered in.
The disastrous economic and social consequences of these plans are well known.
Even the much-vaunted stabilisation that they claim to aim for does not happen.
What is more, the international monetary system is becoming more unstable and crises are happening with greater frequency.
What we need is a different monetary system, with the UN at its core, based on mutual advantage and the promotion of development.
The IMF reform, even if it were based on greater involvement among developing countries, which is not in fact the case, does not alter its nature.
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  . I welcome this report which encourages the close coordination of Member States in negotiation inside the IMF.
It is essential that, given the absence of full recognition of any EU representative bloc, with delegatory powers agreed by Member States, individual EU Member States continue to represent themselves inside the IMF.
There are many key issues, such as development, which rely upon many voices to get a point of view across.
Â Â  I welcome close coordination of Member States in negotiation inside the IMF.
I believe that, in the absence of full recognition of any EU representative bloc, with delegatory powers agreed by Member States, individual EU members should continue to represent themselves inside the IMF.
This is in line with many other international bodies such as the UN. There are key issues including development issues which rely upon many voices at the table to get a point of view across.
Â Â  . The EPLP welcomes close coordination of Member States in negotiations inside the IMF.

Reducing the EU's voice to one may, in certain circumstances, have an explicit effect on the weight of international opinion.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to explain why I have voted against this report.
It is a report that is superfluous, unbalanced and not based on any real results, only on assumptions that are not rooted in fact.
An extension of the protection deadline from five to seven years is unacceptable and goes against the principles of free movement.
If we continue to issue further regulations, instead of removing restrictions on business and freeing up the market for labour and services, this will not help the EU economy, but on the contrary will lead to its further stagnation.
Â Â  In the main, we Swedish Social Democrats support MrÂ Hutchinsonâs report, but we take the following view of relocation.
We do not believe that EU resources should be used for moving production because, in practice, this means that unemployment is moved around and that employees in different regions are pitted against each other.
We do not, however, believe that all relocation is wrong as a matter of course.
It must be possible to relocate industries if these are to be developed.
An increased level of knowledge and skills in a region or country may give rise to a need for relocations if it is to be possible to develop the region.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the report on relocation in the context of regional development because it is crucial to reassure our fellow citizens of the fact that the European Union is the source of solutions with regard to todayâs profound economic and social changes, and not the cause of problems.
The seriousness of the economic and social issues linked to relocation requires a strong European policy aimed at reconciling the necessary changes with the objective of cohesion.
I am very pleased to emphasise the request aimed at obtaining any future, objective information on the relocation phenomenon.
This information will be crucial to us, particularly in the context of the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation on economic sectors that are very exposed to these changes, which can be very brutal.
Equally, it was becoming urgent to clarify the European aid arrangements with regard to relocation, not least by creating a link between aid and the obligation to produce on EU territory.
Finally, I welcome the request to introduce social clauses into the international treaties, and this on the basis of the International Labour Organisationâs priority agreements.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of MrÂ Hutchinson's report on relocation in the context of regional development having participated in the discussions in committee and having amended it.
This report proposes preventing the Structural Funds from promoting measures that contribute to the relocations that have such a high social cost in our regions.
It advocates establishing a European strategy to combat relocation and setting up a European Relocation Observatory to assess the real impact of European aid on relocation.
This has nothing to do with returning to an administered economy, nor of damaging free and fair competition, which is the foundation of the common market.
Nor is it a matter of controlling all businesses or of preventing the development of the new Member States.
However, it is important to bear in mind that the Structural Funds must be tools for development and social cohesion, not weapons for a war between our regions, because, even in the richest countries in the European Union, there are still poor regions where workers watch with despair as their jobs disappear, often leaving them with no possibility of retraining.
Â Â  An ever more globalised world creates new requirements.
It presents new problems to get to grips with and gives rise to new opportunities to make the most of.
Today, the European Parliament is voting on MrÂ Hutchinsonâs own-initiative report on relocation in the context of regional development.
We have chosen to vote against the report as we think that it goes the wrong way about tackling the problems of relocating companies.
We agree that there is no justification for using EU resources from, for example, the Structural Funds to fund improved conditions of competition for European companies that shortly afterwards decide to move their activities outside the EU.
However, neither the state nor EU authorities should intervene to control how companies manage their affairs and to stipulate what is required to prevent companies from taking rational decisions in order to survive.
We shall not create full employment through increased state control. We shall do so by making life easier for more companies and by facilitating new investment in the private market.
We cannot therefore vote, either, in favour of further limiting the movement of companies in the internal market, as proposed in this report.
In order to overcome the problems and manage the relocations involved in a globalised market, we need a point of departure other than this new trend based on economic patriotism.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of MrÂ Hutchinson's report on relocation, which emphasises how urgent it is for the EU to take account of the seriousness of the effects of company relocation on people and regions.
We need to shed more light on the course of this phenomenon and on its consequences, and an observatory will enable us to do so.
However, this also needs to go through a more restrictive legislative framework within the EU, and the inclusion of social and environmental clauses in international trade.
The interests of employees and protecting jobs must be at the heart of our political concerns.
This is vital if we are going to achieve the goal of full employment and the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy as recommended in 2000Â âÂ we will not be able to achieve these objectives without a European industrial policy.
Â Â  This report, which exists outside the legislative procedure, deals with an important subject.
We should, however, have liked to have formulated the problems relating to this issue differently.
We believe that the relocation of companies to third countries outside the EU is something in which we cannot interfere.
It is, as a rule, market considerations that should determine where in the world companies are finally located.
In this context, EU Member States can make efforts to compete when it comes, for example, to offering knowledge, skills and stability.
Where the relocation of companies within the EU is concerned, we must attend to the problem arising from the fact that individual Member States supplement the EUâs structural aid in the form of discriminatory tax relief and state subsidies.
This happened in 2002 when the tyre factory in Gislaved was closed down and the company concerned, Continental, instead invested in a tyre factory in northern Portugal.
That something like that can happen in the EUâs internal market is, in our view, a major problem.
In his explanatory statement, the rapporteur also states that a European Relocation Observatory could be set up within the EU.
Instead of establishing a new monitoring body, we should make it the job of the Commission to monitor closures as a result of restructuring and discriminatory tax systems.
We therefore choose to vote against the report.
We believe the matter to be important in principle, but we should have liked to have seen a resolution with a different approach to this important issue.
Â Â  . The resolution adopted by Parliament on company relocations was the only feasible resolution, because, by rejecting the amendments that we proposed, the compromise agreement between the dominant political forces, namely the social democrats and the Right, turned its back on a more far-reaching resolution.
Our proposals were as follows.
- To highlight the fact that, in most cases, the purpose of business relocations is to derive the maximum profit, secure tax breaks and financial support, and to exploit cheap labour deprived of rights;
- To highlight the fact that relocations form part of the worldwide liberalisation of trade and the deregulation of the labour market, under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation;
- To set up a regulatory legal framework which, among other aspects, addresses: the contractual definition of a minimum seven-year period, guaranteeing stable and lasting employment and regional economic development, providing for sanctions to be applied in the event of non-compliance with contractual obligations (return of aid granted and prohibition from receiving any more Community aid), and protecting the workers by keeping them informed and giving them meaningful involvement, including voting rights;
- To draw up an annual communication on relocations and the impact thereof.
We do hope, however, that what has been adopted will at least be implemented.
Â Â  . In calling for the reimbursement of European aid paid to companies that relocate their activities, MrÂ Hutchinson's report adopts one of the proposals made by the in Ãle de France during the regional elections, with regard to subsidies from the regional council.
The European institutions are starting to take notice of the economic and social consequences of their political choices: many of our businesses have been forced to relocate their operations because the destruction of borders has put them in competition with producers with very low labour costs.
In order to protect our economies from this social dumping and to protect our social model, we must pursue a different policy: rebuild our borders, and make our businesses more competitive by funding our social security from a social VAT rate instead of contributions.
For this to be possible, the national governments need to retain their sovereignty over taxation.
Those are just some of the common-sense economic and social measures that could be taken, not by the current Europe of Brussels that the people of France disowned last year, but by a Europe of free, sovereign nations.
Â Â  . The VVD delegation felt it should vote against the Hutchinson report on relocation in the context of regional development, because this report openly supports the Commission proposal to set up a globalisation fund, to which the VVD is strongly opposed, on the grounds that this form of state intervention runs counter to the internal market.
Social policy is a matter to be addressed by the Member States themselves.
What is more, there is already a European system that provides for the possibilities to retrain workers, in that the existing European structural funds give the Member States the financial leg room to (re)train their people.
The Hutchinson report also contains a number of unnecessary and interfering bureaucratic provisions that curtail the freedom of establishment and cause the internal market to lose its momentum.
Â Â  . I welcome this report on relocation in the context of regional development.
Through the principle of partnership, it is the Member Statesâ and the Commissionâs responsibility to deny any involvement in the structural funds to companies which, having received European Union aid, relocate their activity to another Member State or third country within seven years after the granting of the aid.
In this regard, it is essential that the EU establish a European strategy to combat relocation in coordination with all the Member States as well as a European Relocation Observatory to study, evaluate, follow up and make concrete proposals on the subject of long-term agreements in the field of employment and local development.
Given the rise in statistically affected regions in Scotland, it is now more important than ever that positive measures are taken to ensure that allocated funds are spent effectively and respect the length of the entire programming period.
Â Â  . Creating a single market between 25 States with very different labour, social and fiscal costs was bound to lead to the relocation of businesses to the countries with lower production costs, and that is indeed what has happened.
The ten new Member States are attracting businesses from 'old Europe' and even US businesses based in Mexico.
It is particularly shocking that these countries are providing an attractive tax climate, and then getting their sanitary, social, road network and other improvements paid for by the western countries, which, by increasing their taxes to pay for the ten new countries, are worsening their own production problems.
For relocations outside the EU, there is a basic solution.
We need to invent customs duties using new technologies with three characteristics. They must be variable according to the difference in costs between the two countries in question.
They must be reimbursable, with the customs duty paid by the exporter becoming a 'tax credit' deductible from purchases from the importer's economy.
In other words, the customs duty would give the exporter a drawing right on the importer's economy, which is a win-win situation for international trade.
Finally, they must be redeemable when the importer wants to grant a benefit to the exporter.
The customs credit would thus become a matching credit of the kind already in existence in international tax law.
Â Â  . My support for the report rests essentially on the diagnosis, whereas, to my mind, the medicine that has been prescribed follows a path that has proved largely unsuccessful.
In this context, despite these objections, I share the idea expressed in the report that we all too often look into relocations after they have taken place.
This strikes me not only as being of little use, but also indicative of a terrible inability to anticipate situations.
I therefore feel that a number of legislative measures should be put forward with the aim of preventing the misuse of the public purse and prohibiting the use of public aid, when private entities are not managed with a proper sense of responsibility.
I do not feel, however, that some forms of relocation are avoidable.
I also take the view that this debate could not be held without taking account of the entire balance sheet, including both the upsides and the downsides.
In other words, in addition to totalling the number of jobs that have been lost on account of the opening up of the markets, we must factor the jobs that have been created into the equation, not to mention the advantages to the consumer.
Yes, we must prevent the âlaw of the jungleâ from prevailing, but must not at the same time dismiss something that is necessary.
Quite the opposite, we should be trying to derive the maximum benefit from it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, IÂ have abstained from voting on the Matsakis report into the Commissionâs strategy on mercury, and I would like to explain why.
My formal background is that of a dentist, and IÂ know that the amendments concerning theÂ prompt banning of amalgam from dentistry are not feasible, especially in the new Member States, and primarily for economic reasons.
As dental fillings made from materials other than amalgam are three times more expensive, their application would impose an unreasonable burden on health insurance companies.
At the same time, the evidence concerning the harmful effects of amalgam is both unclear and incomplete.
We should certainly improve the disposal of amalgam waste in dentistry departments, but we should not ban dentists from using mercury.
I also believe that the Member States should be responsible for the relevant legislation.
This view is shared by the Slovak Chamber of Dentists, and that is why IÂ did not vote for the report to be approved.
Â Â  . While the Christian Union and SGP MEPs can endorse the draft resolution on the mercury strategy, they would like to add that exceptions to the ban on the use of mercury in measuring and control equipment should remain possible.
One of those exceptions should apply to the production of traditional mercury barometers, as indicated in the adopted text of the resolution.
The quantity used for production is minimal, and its environmental risk, since it is contained in glass, relatively small.
Various small businesses in the EU rely on the production of these for their income and would, due to a lack of sufficient suitable alternatives, have to close down if an absolute ban were introduced.
We think that the production of this European heritage should remain permitted in a controlled environment.
Â Â  . The purpose of this proposal by the Commission is to plug gaps and to propose a European strategy for the coming years as regards the production and use of mercury in Europe.
Among the important points raised in this report are an end to mercury exports, an end to the use of mercury in measuring equipment and in dental amalgam, controls on emissions, and studies into the effects of mercury in vaccines, something that could bring major benefits for public health.
The licence provided for in Amendment 2 safeguards the activities of small producers under controlled conditions, museum exhibits, traditional barometers and items with historical value.
Amendment 6 brings forward the deadline for restricting exports.
This may prove a precipitous move and may harm Europe by favouring only third-country mercury exporters.
I endorse the Commissionâs proposal and the main thrust of the Matsakis report.
Â Â  The June List supports the proposal that measures be taken to reduce and eventually phase out mercury emissions.
This is a cross-border environmental issue for which a joint and coordinated strategy is justified.
We have thus chosen to vote in favour of this report.
We nonetheless have views concerning individual points in the European Parliamentâs proposal.
We believe, for example, that the Member States are fully capable of carrying out independent information campaigns concerning the health risks entailed in exposure to mercury.
Moreover, we are of the view that it is primarily the task of the Member States, rather than of the EU, to deal with the social consequences of mercury mines being closed down.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of this text.
We must have a firm Community strategy with regard to mercury.
Having said that, being firm also means being realistic.
Merthiolate, which contains mercury, is used as a preservative in some medicines, including in vaccines.
There are around 1Â million doses of vaccine that are produced using merthiolate as a decontamination agent.
That represents 0.0000003% of the mercury used annually in Europe.
In view of the tremendously positive impact that vaccinations have on public health, including in developing countries, it would not therefore be justifiable to impose an immediate ban on the use of this product in vaccines.
For all that, it is advisable to encourage research into alternative methods so as to reduce or eliminate the future use of merthiolate.
I would also point out that, under pharmaceutical legislation, manufacturers must prove that their products do not harm the environment.
Â Â  . I welcome this report on the Community strategy for dealing with the impact of mercury on the environment and on humans.
Mercury is a highly toxic substance and it is vital that scientific evidence is used to establish where it can be used safely and where it should be banned.
I urge the Commission to bring forward the results of its investigation as a matter of urgency.
Â Â  . Labour MEPs support the strategy to control mercury proposed by the Commission.
Mercury is a highly toxic substance which must be subject to strict controls.
However, we believe that bans/restrictions must only be introduced after dialogue with interested parties and after a thorough impact assessment of the consequences, with industry being given sufficient lead time to adapt to change.
Â Â  . My grounds for voting the way I did on the Matsakis Report on a Commission strategy for dealing with mercury in the environment are that the Commission has identified the areas it wishes to investigate further before recommending further EU legislation/action.
My approach is to recognise that mercury is a highly toxic substance and to support the Commission strategy and impact assessment.
Â Â  .By adopting, on Tuesday, the report by my colleague, MrÂ Matsakis, on the Community strategy concerning mercury, the European Parliament has just sent a powerful signal to the international community: the most highly toxic chemical substances must be strictly controlled, and the Europe of 25 must set an example by swiftly banning their export.
Such is the fate that will be reserved in the future for mercury, a heavy metal that is toxic to human beings and ecosystems and of which Europe is the worldâs leading exporter.
I particularly welcome the adoption of paragraph 17, which proposes to restrict the use of mercury in dental amalgams by the end of 2007.
Parliament thus confirms its vote of 25Â January 2005 on my report relating to the European Environment and Health Action Plan, point 6 of which proposed the use of safer alternatives to the mercury used in dental amalgams.
Common sense has prevailed here.
Human exposure must be restricted to an absolute minimum.
That is why it is just as crucial that the European Union quickly find a solution to the problem of handling the 12Â 000 tonnes of mercury waste that the chlorine and soda industries will produce in the next 15 years.
Â Â  . Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to human beings, eco-systems and animals in the wild.
Mercury is classified as a priority hazardous substance under the Water Framework Directive and also retards microbiological activity in soil.
Mercury is a persistent substance and can change in the environment into methyl mercury, which has enormously adverse effects on human health.
Dental amalgam, which is discharged in the course of dental surgery and from crematoria, is a significant source of mercury emissions.
This makes it necessary for dental amalgam waste to be properly disposed of.
The use of mercury in dental amalgam is a live issue.
The approach to be endorsed is that all the potential dangers involved in the use of mercury in dental amalgam should be examined, and action taken on the basis of what emerges from that examination.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make some observations as an explanation for voting against the report on a European Information Society for Growth and Employment by MrÂ Paasilinna.
The aims of Project 2010 include innovation and investment in research.
I was surprised to discover that the report does not cover the issue of research in much detail and does not give it the attention it deserves.
Research is mentioned only in connection with support for research into individual technologies.
On the other hand, however, research gives rise in all fields of human endeavour to demand for information and communications technology.
It is precisely this aspect of feedback that seems to me to be lacking in this report, and yet it can be one of the motors for economic growth and job creation within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
The passing reference to the Seventh Framework Programme is not commensurate with the importance of this programme for growth and employment.
Work skills in digital technologies are now viewed as one of the key competencies and we must develop them within a framework of lifelong learning.
Â Â  â Mr President, here we are now, seeking new ways of making more and more things digital.
The idea is that digital libraries, digital equipment for recording journeys, biometric passports and -government will bring miracles to pass.
The fact that information and communications technology accounts for 40% of economic growth is indeed impressive.
With all this euphoria about new technologies, though, we must not lose sight of reality.
Even though there are, again, encouraging signs of growth in the digital sector, these will do more to put an end to jobs than to create new ones, for the fact is that the high-tech sector is a particularly mobile one, moving first to the eastern Member States and then, in due course, to such countries as India and China.
Yet again, the EUâs dreams of a corporate job-creation machine will not become reality, but it is good to see that small and medium-sized enterprises are tending more and more to upgrade their equipment, with the aim of becoming more productive and competitive, and of opening up new markets.
It is to these small and medium-sized businesses that we will have to give more support.
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of the report on a European Information Society for growth and employment because I believe that access to information and communication technologies is a prerequisite for economic development and social progress.
The use of these technologies affects practically all of the technical, administrative, commercial, cultural, social and health sectors, among others.
It is imperative that all the inhabitants of the European Union have equal opportunities when it comes to accessing these technologies, and this at a cost that corresponds to standard market prices.
I welcome the idea of combating the digital divide, and it is worth pointing out just how much the European Union has missed out by not applying a coherent policy with regard to the licences of the third generation of mobile telephones â the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecom System) â which were sold at auction by the Member States in appalling conditions given the possibilities that this technology offered in terms of political coherence.
This mistake cannot be repeated.
I wholeheartedly support the need to invest in research and innovation in these technologies, which are important catalysts of competitiveness, growth and employment.
Â Â  . We are disappointed that the amendments to this report tabled by our group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left, were not adopted.
Our amendments were aimed at guaranteeing free access to technology and knowledge, freedom of movement and exchange of knowledge, and at strengthening the role of intellectual property in relation to the free movement and dissemination of knowledge.
Otherwise, there is a risk that a knowledge-based society would be confined to an elite.
The report supports the continued policy of liberalisation and the use of communications for the purpose of transmitting âEuropean ideas and valuesâ, in other words that of turning Information and Communications Technology (ICT) into yet another EU propaganda tool.
Although the report refers to the role of ICT in promoting social and territorial cohesion and warns that new technology can serve to deepen social exclusion, it fails to develop the theme and does not put forward any proposals to prevent this from happening.
We abstained on account of the contradictions in the report.
