It is true that what is known as the human rights and democracy clause has been incorporated into more than 50 agreements and that this affects 120 countries, but it is also the case that the degree to which it is complied with or the degree to which we demand that it be complied with varies considerably.
After ten years of applying this system, therefore, we must take stock and take certain corrective measures, and I would therefore congratulate Mr Agnoletto on his work, on his report and on his conclusions, with which we agree, naturally.
Firstly, I would like to stress that we must remember that many agreements with developed countries and sectoral agreements, such as those relating to textile products, agriculture and fisheries, do not yet contain such a clause, and that is clearly a deficiency.
Secondly, although the clause applies both to the European Union and to the third country, full use has not yet been made of its reciprocal dimension and, as Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco has said, I believe that the European Union must begin by offering an example.
Thirdly, one of the factors that have compromised its application is the generic nature of its wording, since it does not provide for precise methods for positive or negative intervention in cooperation between the European Union and third countries, leading to the Councilâs demands and the national demands of the Member States taking precedence over more general human rights demands.
For all of these reasons, we support the drawing up of a new text for a model clause to improve the current wording of the so-called Article 2, with a view to guaranteeing a more coherent, effective and transparent approach to European human rights policy in the agreements with third countries.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are discussing the clauses on respect for human rights that the EU imposes on the countries with which it deals.
So be it, but before we go looking for the speck in our neighbour's eye, should we not remove the plank from our own?
For example, in my country, France, as in the rest of the EU, the tyranny of political correctness is becoming completely intolerable.
In theory, you can say what you like about mass immigration, but if you oppose it, you are condemned for incitement to racial hatred.
If, as happened recently, you mention the islamisation of Alsace, even as an elected representative, you become the target of disgraceful condemnations that only reflect badly on those who made them.
In theory, you can say what you like about contemporary history, but, in practice, you can only do that provided you comply with a Communist-inspired law, otherwise you risk being imprisoned.
For having contested this law during a political press conference, I myself have lost, at least temporarily, my post at the University of Lyon.
If you say you prefer natural families to homosexual partnerships, you risk being condemned once again, as a member of the French parliament from the majority party found out recently.
A mayor does not have the right to give a fellow countryman preference over a foreigner when allocating social housing, nor can an individual give this sort of preference in any field.
I could give you more examples.
Every group, every lobby, every minority and every deviancy has developed its own methods of pressurising, intimidating and persecuting the majority, with the active or passive complicity of the authorities.
In these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, before we impose on our partners a clause that you seem to interpret completely unilaterally, we would do well to start by putting our own house in order.
Â Â  â Mr President, the democratic principle in the Union's foreign relations, which we are debating today in the wake of the report by Mr Agnoletto, whom I congratulate, raises a series of crucial questions.
I shall confine myself, for reasons of time, to five of them.
First question: will the Union continue to confine itself to the more or less declaratory character of the human rights and democracy clause or will it try â and this is my proposal â to raise the democracy principle to an appropriate legal means, into a for the smooth functioning of agreements with third countries?
Second question: are the selective discounts of the democracy clause permissible?
Is the differentiated intensity in the formulation of the principle in question permissible?
The answer is obvious.
The credibility of the invocation of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms must obey the rule of uniform standards.
Third question: do the elements of electoral competition and free elections alone suffice in order to characterise a system as democratic?
Modern democratic life makes demands intertwined with the quality of democracy.
It makes the demand of participatory civil rights, of horizontal political accountability. It makes the demand of honest governance, of institutional security and of social cohesion.
Fourth question: does the Union intend â do we the democratically legitimised Chamber intend â to adopt qualitative indicators for measuring and evaluating the democratic conduct of our private economic and commercial partners and, more importantly, of third European countries which are being called on, or will be called on, to satisfy the so-called Copenhagen criteria?
Fifth and last question: in European external relations, the democratic principle and the market economy are cited along side each other or in the same breath, but in practice the market economy claims priority.
If nothing else, are we going to restore this balance?
Â Â  â Mr President, I in turn should like to start by congratulating my honourable friend Mr Agnoletto on the important report which he has presented to us.
The incorporation of a human rights clause in the agreements of the European Union, since the beginning of the 1990s, has been a politically and institutionally cutting edge.
However, in taking stock today, we must be honest and say that the results are not particularly positive. This is due mainly to the lack of political will on the part of the Member States, as the Commissioner so honestly and boldly said, to selective sensitivity to the application of the clause, to the prevalence of double standards and, finally, to the supremacy of national interests and expediencies over the common and decisive stand of the European Union.
Î€here are numerous examples and this situation is creating a serious problem of credibility of the European institutions among European citizens.
On the one hand, the European Union can freeze relations and agreements â Mr Ford spoke and gave examples â and, on the other hand, it does nothing about infringements of human rights in Tunisia, Egypt, Israel or Turkey.
Strategic interests take precedence in relations with Russia, China and the United States over respect for human rights and minority rights.
The provision of unanimity for the taking of measures and the suspension of an agreement will continue to cancel in practice any serious effort.
The European Union will not be able to engage in a dynamic foreign policy with the unanimity procedure.
This dimension needs to be retabled in the debate on the future of Europe.
I agree with all the proposals made by my honourable friend, Mr Agnoletto.
However, we must understand that the serious deficit in foreign policy and in human rights policy is due to and connected with the transnational character and unanimity provision, behind which hide national interests and various political expediencies and priorities.
Otherwise, however strong the clauses are, they will, unfortunately, remain inactive.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, Commissioner Frattini, I too would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for this report.
It is evident from the responses to it that it enjoys very widespread approval.
We have already heard from various quarters how much easier we find it to criticise small states such as Myanmar and impose sanctions on them to do the same with large ones, where economic interests come into play.
This is where we have a problem, a dilemma, and it is one that we should address frankly instead of beating about the bush.
The European Union has a credibility problem, a problem with double standards, and this is something we have to consider in the present situation with these caricatures and what is claimed to be a clash of civilisations.
We very much agree with many of the points made in this report.
I would like to point out, though, that we will be addressing a similar issue â that of the Fundamental Rights Agency â in a forthcoming debate in this House.
That Agency will deal with many of the issues with which we are concerning ourselves today.
I would like to raise Membersâ awareness of the fact that we will be able to use this Fundamental Rights Agency not only to improve the protection of human rights within the European Unionâs Member States, but also as a sort of early warning system to inform us what is going on in the states around us and how things stand as regards human rights in them.
This presents us with a unique opportunity to improve Europeâs policy on human rights.
This House will be taking a decision on this very soon, and I ask you all to support this.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to make three observations with regard to the human rights clause.
First of all, it has to be noted that this clause is very rarely invoked: only 12 times since 1995.
If we compare this with the number of non-democratic states with which the European Union concludes treaties, the clause must, in most cases, be regarded as redundant for all practical purposes.
My second remark concerns the Member Statesâ immigration and asylum policies, which the rapporteur wishes to bracket together with the human rights clause.
That strikes me as not very realistic and in any case not very desirable, certainly when developing countries would be invited to criticise the reception of their own nationals who apply for asylum in Europe.
We should, in fact, make a point of encouraging such states to take back those of their nationals who do not qualify for political asylum over here.
Often, though, experience has shown that the exact opposite is true.
Finally, it is undesirable to involve non-governmental organisations in the assessment of the application of the human rights clause with regard to third countries.
Such organisations have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever, and should not be given political responsibility of this kind.
If anything, Europe should be able to give more account of what happens with taxpayersâ money.
Â Â  MrÂ President, proper respect for the human rights clauses depends, above all, on the political will of the Member States.
Sadly, their efforts to further their own interests often prevent the Union from taking effective action.
The task before us today is to ensure that human rights clauses are introduced in a way that will make it possible for us to exert effective pressure on third countries.
It is no longer enough to simply make a statement of principles and requirements.
They need to be implemented, and that calls for a great deal of courage and determination.
I have been saddened to note that the behaviour of the Unionâs leaders tends to be governed by fear and opportunism.
All too often economic and political interests outweigh the need for a swift response to notorious cases where individuals are humiliated and their freedom restricted.
The principle of solidarity must not be treated as if it were a ballast to be jettisoned at any time.
It needs to become a crucial instrument of the European Unionâs policy.
The human rights clauses must therefore be equipped with appropriate means of persuasion and of exerting political pressure.
That, in turn, requires a change in the approach to the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
A permanent feature of this policy should be an ongoing struggle to defend the principles of freedom and democracy.
We urgently need European institutions modelled on American government-funded foundations and which are able to effectively support human rights defenders the world over.
No such institutions exist at present, but the planned EU Fundamental Rights Agency should help to fill this gap.
Indeed, the Human Rights Agency would be a more appropriate title for this body.
In its annual report, the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch concluded that during 2005 the European Unionâs main interests had been in the fields of business, politics and energy.
Mere verbal criticism of totalitarian and dictatorial regimes is no longer enough.
The European Union must demonstrate the will to implement fundamental rights the world over.
Is there anyone in the European Union currently dealing with the restrictions on freedom of expression and the activities of non-governmental organisations in Russia?
Is anyone prepared to sacrifice trade contracts with China in exchange for the release of Tibetan monks imprisoned for alleged subversive activities?
Will we eventually be able to bring ourselves to stand up to the Cuban regime?
In conclusion, I should like to express my support for the protest action against the search engine.
I do not intend to use it today. has set up a special version of its search engine for Chinese pages, controlled by the Chinese Government.
This is a way of censoring material that runs counter to the official Chinese line.
Â Â  MrÂ President, human rights and democracy are the foundations on which the European Union was built.
The human rights policy of the European Community and indeed of the wider international community played an important part in the fall of the undemocratic regimes in Southern Europe in the 1970s and in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989.
At present, human rights and democracy form the axis around which the European Unionâs external and security policy is being constructed.
The Unionâs foreign policy is aimed at creating a global world order based on peace, democracy, human rights, the rule of law, sustainable development and stable growth.
The human rights and democracy clause should now be applied more widely and included in all agreements entered into by the European Union with third countries, regardless of whether they are industrialised or developing countries.
The aforementioned clause should also feature in sectoral agreements, trade exchanges, and technical and financial aid.
Pursuant to this clause, the relevant European Union institutions, including the European Parliament, should have the authority to effectively monitor respect for human rights and democratic principles by parties to agreements with the European Union.
In this respect, it is important to bear in mind the relationship between respect for human rights, democracy and development.
General principles encompassing the protection of human rights, the rule of law and respect for democratic values are a for the eradication of poverty.
A good way of dealing with this issue would be to include in such agreements a recommendation that the EU and the country party to the agreement should exchange reports on human rights on an annual basis.
It would also be desirable to set up a mechanism for consultation with non-governmental organisations.
Election monitoring missions play a vital part in protecting and supporting human rights and democracy beyond the Unionâs borders, as does the aid the Union should provide to civil society in third countries.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Agnoletto, that Parliament must not only give an opinion but must also have a role in human rights, democracy and respect for diversity in agreements with external countries.
Economic development, social peace and a growing economy are clearly related to democracy and human rights.
Cooperation for development can only be assured in the context of democratic societies.
If we analyse the efficacy of our cooperation for development, we will confirm that in those countries where democracy and respect for human rights are improved, everything works better.
In cases of dictatorships, non-transparent regimes or corrupted governments, our work can be completely distorted.
I wish to point out that we must fully understand democracy and human rights.
Democracy means respect for diversity; human rights are not complete without respect for diversity, plurality and cultural differences.
We have seen how minorities in countries close to joining the European Union rely on us in order to achieve this respect for their rights.
A chance for plurality and respect for cultural and national rights can come from the European institutions, irrespective of the fact that many European countries do not respect it.
We have to enhance the role of our Parliament, because it is the house of our European representatives.
Â Â  I would like to thank the rapporteur for his determination to lend more transparency and consistency to the expansion and consolidation of human rights.
In the report it seems as if a magnifying glass is being held over the principle of clarity and transparency.
Various interpretations of the concept of âhuman rightsâ prevent the European Union from taking appropriate actions when there are gross violations.
When the Council is debating the human rights situation in a state where there is cause for concern, usually one EU country or another insists on acting in its own national interest and vetoes the decision.
The unanimity principle ought to be made more flexible.
When debating the possibility of sanctions, inevitably the political and economic power of the target country, along with its size and the likelihood of retaliation, is considered.
Such a state of affairs should be avoided where possible and certain states, which blatantly violate human rights, should not feel more equal than others.
The sanctions instrument, directed against one regime or another or a government, which has behaved inappropriately, must be employed with extreme precision.
The stick of sanctions should not hit people, who often live in particularly harsh conditions and do not have the opportunity to oppose the regime.
In a few months the EU will begin negotiations with a state, which still has difficulty applying policies of gender equality and women's rights; a state, which has yet to rid itself of the shackles of ethnic discrimination.
Human rights will form an important part of these negotiations, so the procedure for defining this negotiation process should also be more transparent.
Â Â  () Ladies and gentlemen, the development and strengthening of democracy and the rule of law, along with the upholding of human rights and freedoms, has become an integral part of the running of the European Union and of foreign policy.
The human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements constitutes one of the instruments of this policy.
The clause, as has already been stated, has so far been incorporated into more than 50 agreements and applies to more than 120 countries.
Despite the frequent positive experiences, however, I feel it is necessary to consider how we might improve or perfect the clause.
In this context, the Agnoletto report provides many important and interesting suggestions.
It points out, for example, that the concept of human and civil rights and freedoms also includes economic, social and cultural rights.
It also emphasises that the EU, in its support for human rights, should focus on implementing policies in the area of gender equality and womenâs rights and should oppose any form of discrimination on the grounds, for example, of sexual orientation, or of the rights of disabled people.
I should like to lend my support to the idea that the European Parliament should play a greater role in the preparation process for implementing and assessing the democracy clause, and I should like to add that both civil society and the international network of non-governmental organisations involved in human rights should play a much greater role in this process.
Â Â  â I am amazed at how, in this Parliament, we often detect small shortcomings in Europe, when everybody knows that this continent is actually a standard-bearer trying to export these fundamental and noble rights to other parts of the world.
It should be pointed out that there has always been a discussion as to whether human rights can be administered internally by the State or government or whether they are universal.
It is clear beyond doubt that human rights are universal rights and that no dictator or State is entitled to deny human beings the smallest aspect of their fundamental rights.
The problem is that of how Europe is to make use of its resources to try to export these noble aims.
In this area, we sometimes criticise Europe for not employing its rights and its power, including economic power, and, at the same time, we criticise the administration or the institutions for closing their eyes to certain shortcomings.
There is a decision to be made.
We have to decide whether it is by using persuasion or economic power that Europe can best export its aims.
I would conclude by saying that we have to give our institutions all the resources to ensure that our values are made sufficiently coherent to be exported by the Community.
Thank you.
Â Â  â I support all of the recommendations made by Mr Agnoletto in this report.
I especially welcome the inclusion of a reciprocity clause in all agreements with third countries.
It is regrettable that the implementation of the human rights clause has until now been contingent on geo-political and geo-economic considerations which have nothing to do with the Union as a whole, but which often depend on the narrow strategies of some Member States and some Commission services.
The most glaring example of the lack of substantive implementation of this clause is Ethiopia, despite the fact that Parliament has repeatedly asked the Commission and the Council to open consultations, under the terms of Article 96, following the massacres and serious violations of human rights that took place in the wake of the elections.
I am appalled by the Councilâs silence and inaction on this matter.
Only the Commission and one Member State â the United Kingdom â have suspended direct aid to the budget of the Ethiopian Government, the minimum they could do in the circumstances.
Given, however, that they did not clarify the terms and conditions, this had no impact whatsoever on the Ethiopian Government, and sent out a disastrous message not only to the Ethiopian people as a whole, but also to all Africans â the headquarters of the Organisation for African Unity is in the Ethiopian capital â as well as to the EU Member States and to all countries with which the EU maintains relations.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there can be no doubt that promoting respect for human rights and democracy in third countries is one of the main aims of the European Unionâs foreign policy.
This aim will not be achieved, however, if international agreements continue to focus exclusively on economic and political issues.
The inclusion of clauses on human rights and democracy in trade agreements and technical and financial aid would also be a vital step in the right direction.
The European Union will be able to act more quickly and effectively to defend human rights if it has the option of suspending economic cooperation in the event of serious infringements of fundamental rights in third countries.
In parallel with this process, the European Parliament should become more involved in consultations concerning the content of agreements and clauses as well as their implementation and enforcement.
Once we have an effective system of monitoring fundamental freedoms in place, backed up by the option of imposing economic sanctions, we shall at last progress from words to deeds.
To date, it has frequently been the case that fine words of European Parliament resolutions on the defence of human rights have simply remained on paper.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this ambitious work, and I thank him for it.
The protection of democracy, human rights and the rule of law and good governance are fundamental elements of the European Union; they must also be an integral part of the EUâs external policy.
I would like to lay special emphasis on the promotion of equal opportunities and on the fight against discrimination based on sexual orientation.
These questions are still serious problems in every country today.
Womenâs and childrenâs rights, and the rights of those with different sexual orientations, are being violated every day.
In order to improve implementation of these aims, the European Union must prepare new procedures and new criteria for applying human rights and democracy clauses.
I agree that, in order to ensure a more coherent, effective and transparent approach to European human rights policy, a revision of the current text is indispensable.
I support the establishment of human rights subcommittees under EU third country agreements, to be responsible for reviewing compliance with the clause, monitoring its application and implementation, and proposing actions to address democracy and human rights problems.
Â Â  . Mr President, this has been a very valuable discussion on the human rights clause and on human rights and democracy in general.
Let us not forget that human rights issues are already being raised systematically with partners in political dialogues.
We have established dedicated human rights dialogue and consultations with certain countries, and human rights subcommittees have also been established.
In other cases, human rights may be raised at association councils and at association committee meetings.
The purpose of the human rights clause is not simply to make it possible to impose sanctions, but also to create a basis for human rights dialogue and for the setting-up of institutions concerned with it, because we need to give such institutions a chance and encourage them to develop.
Institution building is as important as the clause, and the existence of the human rights clause in the association agreement, or in partnership and cooperation agreements, creates the basis for this.
Therefore there is no need to replicate this in sectoral agreements.
I also want to recall that our agreements have a wide range of policy goals.
We want to contribute to stability and to the increase of welfare for all the populations concerned.
It is not a lack of courage if we do not always have the same human rights clause or if we do not apply sanctions.
We also have to contribute to the development of a population â look at the African, and some Asian, populations, as some of you mentioned.
There is also freedom from want and freedom from fear, which are closely related to human rights and to the human security concept.
That means we cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater.
There are many other clauses to defend, such as the clause against terrorism, the clause against weapons of mass destruction and the clause for democracy.
It is all interlinked and we cannot focus only on human rights; we have to see the whole picture, which includes poverty eradication.
This is the difficult balance that we have to strike sometimes.
It is not easy to harmonise this clause, because we are negotiating with every partner and we have to find solutions in the end.
Not every partner accepts exactly the same wording.
However, it is not so much about wording but about application and the way we can encourage the partners to come up with their own solutions, because, as we have always made clear, we do not want to impose everything on the others: we want to encourage their societies to build and to change.
As I have already said, institution building is just as important, as are legal, judicial and police reform, because that is where human rights are applied.
Finally, I should like to say that, with all due respect, in many individual cases we have been able to get people out of prison and to talk about them.
We speak about the death penalty with each and every partner, we speak against torture, and slowly these things come through.
Maybe sometimes the issue is speed â not everything is being done at the same time.
But let us be realistic: we cannot change the world in a day.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0406/2005) by MrÂ MihaelÂ Brejc, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the Schengen Convention and the Common Consular Instructions [COM(2005)0056 C6-0049/2005 2005/0006(COD)].
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for the very good work done on this proposal.
I am very pleased to note that once again the three institutions â the Council, the Commission and Parliament â have been able to work together very effectively and very quickly within the framework of the codecision procedure.
A very good precedent for interinstitutional cooperation was set last year by the agreement reached on the Schengen border code, to which this regulation represents the necessary complement.
We can therefore say that with the adoption of this regulation the legislative component of our integrated border management strategy is fully completed; and, if I may say so, I very much hope that we will continue to work together effectively in the future, for instance on the decision-making process and on other very sensitive issues such as the legal basis for the VIS and SIS.
The adoption of this proposal will be a very important and balanced step forward, as it will provide the necessary flexibility at our external borders to facilitate crossings by bone fide people residing in a border area without, however, creating any security loopholes.
This is particularly important for the new Member States, especially in view of their forthcoming integration into the Schengen area, where they will become responsible for the control of the Schengen external borders and will thus carry out checks on behalf of all Schengen states.
In this context I wish to recall that the adoption of Community rules on local border traffic is included in the much broader European neighbourhood strategy.
It is thus one of the measures aimed at strengthening cross-border cooperation with the EU neighbours and people-to-people contact.
Finally I conclude by stressing again that the text that is under examination today is a very balanced and important proposal.
Â Â  . The purpose of this regulation is to lay down common rules on the criteria and conditions for establishing a local border traffic regime on the external land borders of the Member States.
Given that the original material â the Commissionâs proposal â placed serious demands on the people who live along the European Unionâs external borders, in this report I have highlighted the following:
We need to make crossing the border easier for local residents who have good reasons for making frequent crossings of a Member Stateâs external border, and we need to prevent illegal migration and the potential security threat posed by criminal activities.
The proposed regulation seeks to regulate the issue of local border traffic, which involves frequent, sometimes daily, crossing of the border for the reasons of attending school, work, or family ties, and we therefore need to take into account that these daily migrants return each day to their homes.
Owing in part to historical, geographical and social circumstances, the external borders differ, and life along the border should not be allowed to deteriorate.
We need to consider the actual circumstances on the external borders and enable Member States to the greatest possible extent to maintain the good practices that they have established to date through bilateral agreements.
The essence of the amendments which I propose and which are in the text:
Instead of the special âL visaâ, local border residents will be issued a so-called , which will incorporate all the security standards, and most importantly, will not be stamped upon every crossing of the border.
A differentiation between the various external land borders will not be necessary, since in the coming years Member States will sooner or later enter into the Schengen area.
The local border area â this definition has triggered considerable debate.
We have agreed that it should not exceed 30 km, and possibly 50 km in exceptional cases.
Indeed by increasing the border area, we could find that it would no longer be possible to meet security standards.
In no way, however, is it possible to equate local border areas with ethnic boundaries.
A local border resident is a citizen of a third country who has resided for at least one year in the border area, while in the debate we have harmonised the proposal containing a whole range of exceptions involving marriage, inheritance and so forth.
In bilateral agreements Member States lay down the longest permitted period of residence, which may not exceed three months in total.
In other words, this is a decision whereby an individual from a third country may reside in that border zone for three months in total.
Where special circumstances are involved, certain privileges need to be permitted with regard to crossing the border outside established border crossings.
There are, for instance, farmers that have half of the property they own in their own country and half in another country, and of course they cannot take their implements with them every time they cross the border.
The adoption of this regulation will show that the European Union is not closing its borders, and is not setting up inhuman conditions along its external borders.
The European Union wishes to ensure adherence to the relevant security standards, but in no way to make life harder along the border.
The coexistence of people on both sides of the border and their cooperation are important elements of stability and security along the external borders.
For this reason another extremely important achievement of this regulation is that through bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries, in other words third countries, Member States will create the conditions for the development of border areas, which are for the most part less well developed.
This regulation provides a basis for the strengthening of economic, cultural and other ties on both sides of the border, so it is important for the border countries as well as for the European Union as a whole.
May I also point out that we had several rounds of harmonisation with the Commission and the Council.
Although this took some time, the negotiations were successful, such that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted this regulation in its debate and in voting.
Permit me, Mr President, to close by thanking all those that cooperated in this process, in other words the Commission, the Council, and particularly Mr Cashman and Mr Lax, who made especially active contributions to this report.

Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by opening up the borders between the European Communitiesâ Member States and by establishing the four freedoms of the European Union, we, in Europe, have brought into being one of the freest societies in the world, but freedom without security is nothing, and that is why especial significance attaches to the security of the external borders that are thus created to the East, to the Balkans, and across the Mediterranean, the latter with its own uniquely serious problems.
These borders must be as secure as possible, and that will require the use of the most modern technologies.
At the same time, they must also be as flexible as possible, in order not to impose needless restrictions on businesses in the border regions and on the people who live there.
For that to happen, two things are required.
One is integrated administration of the border, an administration shared by the customs authorities and the border police, something that cannot, unfortunately, always be guaranteed, but this integrated administration must also be shared with the neighbouring countries.
The fact is that a border is truly secure and flexible only when those on both sides of it work as closely as possible together, and it is certainly one of the tasks of our new neighbourhood policy to get this aspect of bilateral security addressed by both sides jointly.
The other thing we need to do is to create a âfrontier workerâs cardâ â âlocal border traffic permitâ is a splendid term, but a very long and bureaucratic-sounding one â for those people who live on the border and have to cross it frequently.
Only if we do both these things will we prevent the people living in the new border regions sustaining any unnecessary disadvantages.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, what is termed local border traffic is a single stone in the big mosaic picture of the protection of the external borders.
On the one hand, we are securing the external borders against illegal crossings and the phenomena often occurring at them, such as the smuggling of drugs, the trafficking of human beings, prostitution and other forms of organised crime.
We can also, on the other hand, make daily life easier for those who live on opposite sides of the external borders, but do so nonetheless as good neighbours.
It is only reasonable to secure our borders against the entry of unwelcome persons in so far as possible, but it is equally reasonable to want to make it easier for the people at the borders to live together, for â as many Members have already said â we do not want Europe to be a fortress, but rather a community that coexists amicably with its neighbours.
It is for that reason that I believe the rapporteur is right to suggest that the Commission proposal be amended so as not to introduce new arrangements for existing borders within Europe.
We are, after all, working on the assumption that the Member States will by then have transposed the Schengen , that SIS II will be successfully up and running, and so Europe will no longer need additional internal rules of this kind.
This report by Mr Brejc is a good example of successful cooperation between Members of this House across party boundaries, and a model to follow as regards successful cooperation with the Council under our codecision arrangements.
All of us, together, have managed to put together well thought-out and practical solutions for the day-to-day coexistence of our fellow citizens and their neighbours, and for that I would like most warmly to thank the rapporteur and his shadow opposite numbers as well.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Vice-President Frattini for his comments.
As the rapporteur on the Schengen border code, I believe that we did set the precedent for close and effective cooperation.
We all know the substance of this report.
It is about making peopleâs lives easier and improving the daily lives of our citizens.
Arguably, that is what we should focus on more and more.
It reinforces the Schengen border code.
We know that, once we have secure external borders, freedom of movement within the EU will be much simpler and more easily controlled.
Equally, we must remember that we need to be sensible.
Like Mr Brejc, Mr Lax, and others, I myself have adopted that approach.
If what comes from the Commission is sensible, we only need to amend it to improve, simplify or clarify.
That must be our approach.
We will then bring forward effective and well-understood regulation that is easy to implement at our borders.
As the shadow rapporteur on the Visa Information System, that is also the approach I want to take.
I know the rapporteur for the Schengen Information System is here today and I believe that, by cooperating in order to secure our borders and make sure that the information we have is used effectively, we will enhance the single biggest benefit of being a member of the EU, which is freedom of movement.
Congratulations to all concerned.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive work.
The regulation on local border traffic that we now have before us has proved to be very important to the EUâs external border regions, especially in the east.
Traditionally, such border districts are often viewed as peripheral and as being marked by slow development.
Believing that to be the case can easily bring that very situation about.
It is therefore a question of giving clear signals to the border area populations to the effect that they must be allowed to have contacts in all directions and that their horizons are not to be bounded by their countriesâ borders.
Being able to move smoothly across borders is the basis for contacts, friendship, trade and creative innovation.
There are no doubt many people living on, for example, the Russian-Estonian border or the Slovenian-Croatian border who will be grateful for the very flexible solution now being proposed.
When it comes to promoting contacts between people, consistency is required.
It is not consistent to begin, as now, by taking positive steps regarding local border traffic and similarly positive steps in the form of the bilateral visa agreement with Russia reached in October of last year, and then almost to double the visa charge from EURÂ 35 to EURÂ 65, something that the Council of Ministers is in actual fact in a quandary about taking a decision on next week in response to a proposal by France.
If that decision is taken, it will not of course be long before the Russian side too increases the charge to approximately the same amount.
It goes without saying that this would deal a heavy blow to tourism on the borders.
For example, anyone in Eastern Finland wanting to cross by boat to the Russian side of the Saima Canal would be forced to pay more in visa charges than for the crossing itself.
Doubling the charge would be wholly contrary to our objective where visa policy is concerned.
There is no more effective way of putting a stop to natural contacts between people than by implementing such a shock increase in the cost of a visa.
The fact is that the trend should be in the opposite direction.
I therefore call on all my fellow Members to put this period to good use and, at the eleventh hour, to contact their governments in order to forestall this decision.
The right hand needs to know what the left hand is doing.
We must live up to our values.
As MrsÂ Klamt too emphasised recently, we must not give sustenance to the idea that the EU is constructing walls around itself.
Â Â  . â () Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the previous speaker that if we adopt this text we will have to do all we can to prevent governments from torpedoing it.
In 1957, when the six Member States of the European Community accepted the Treaties of Rome, it seemed that the achievement of the so-called four freedoms, which is to say the free movement of goods, capital, services and persons, was only a distant prospect.
After the introduction of the so-called Schengen system, the removal of customs barriers between the Member States of the EU and the implementation of a series of measures to regulate relations between states in the area in question, the realisation of this goal came a lot closer.
The issue today is not whether it will be possible in the near future to secure the free movement of persons between the Member States of the EU, but rather to determine a realistic and rapid timetable for the implementation of this freedom.
In the interim, it would be appropriate to come to an arrangement at least over what is referred to as local border traffic.
Such an arrangement would in the meantime improve the outlook for bilateral relations between states that are not in the Schengen system but which do belong to the EU or to the European Economic Area.
The authors of the measures under discussion are aware that the EU covers only one half of Europeâs geographical area.
It is in our own interests to ensure that we are as open as possible towards our neighbours.
These measures create the possibility for setting up local border traffic with non-Member States.
Let us not forget that, from 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007, this will entail land borders with Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldavia, Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, Croatia and Turkey, and that such measures will be taken as a positive signal by neighbouring states.
They will open the door to mutual cooperation in the border regions, provided of course that we reject the measures to which Mr Lax alluded.
The introduction of special kinds of visa and other conditions contained in the measures will make it possible, on the basis of assessments, to make use of this special regime to strengthen cooperation with all of our neighbouring states.
This would also be very valuable for the future development of relations especially with larger partners such as Russia, Turkey and Ukraine.
In my view, there are a number of proposed amendments aimed at improving the chances of these measures working, with only a minority seeking to amend the rules to make them less workable.
I should therefore like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to draw a careful distinction between these two categories when voting on the proposed amendments.
Do not forget that the Directive represents a model of neighbourly relations and thereby gives a signal of whether or not the EU wants to be an open society or to erect barriers against neighbouring states along its borders.
Â Â  Mr President, there are many people living on our borders for whom the eastward enlargement changed little, since the people in many border regions had stolen a march on the politicians and local border traffic had long been part of daily life.
That makes it all the more important that we, while agreeing on common rules for local border traffic, should, as is provided for, allow the Member States to conclude bilateral agreements relating to their implementation.
The loss of the internal borders does, of course, make it all the more important that the external border of the Schengen zone be monitored.
Exchange of information across borders, with joint coordination and controls, have made it possible to reduce criminal activity in some frontier regions.
While we must of course make matters simpler and easier for cross-border residents, the option of imposing strict sanctions must be in place to ensure that the concessions made are not abused.
There must also be guarantees that these persons constitute no danger to public safety and order, and it is for these reasons that I endorse, in particular, the Committeeâs proposal for thorough and recurrent checks to be carried out at irregular intervals.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to commend Mr Brejc on his outstanding report.
This is a well-balanced proposal which will not only facilitate traditional population movements at border crossings, but will also guarantee appropriate security levels at the EUâs external borders.
Illegal immigration and potential threats to security posed by criminal activities must be thwarted.
There is also a need to facilitate local border traffic, that is, to facilitate crossing for border residents with legitimate reasons to cross the border frequently.
Our efforts to increase security at our external borders, not least by means of the adoption of the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS), sends out a positive political message.
Borders must not act as a barrier to commercial, social and cultural interaction or to regional cooperation.
People living in border regions should be able to sustain traditional contact without having to face excessive administrative obstacles.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I welcome the fact that simplification of local border traffic has taken the form of a regulation.
This means that the provisions in question will not have to be transposed into national law. Instead, they will be applied directly by all Member States across the entire Union.
This is a very important regulation for the Union as a whole, but especially for the countries responsible for security at its external borders.
My country, Poland, has the longest external land border of the Union, which is why we welcome the simplification the regulation implies.
Clearly, the way people living in a countryâs heartland and central areas perceive border issues differs from how they are perceived by people living in border regions.
For the latter, the border is part of their daily lives.
They have constant practical experience of it, and are obliged to live with the consequences of its existence.
That is why I do not want there to be any difficulties or administrative hold-ups, because borders must not be an impediment to cultural and social exchange or to regional cooperation.
What do the contents of the regulation mean for us?
This regulation ensures equality within the Union, and solidarity with its closest neighbours.
It also generates a sense of unity and does away with artificial divisions.
In addition, it will stimulate cooperation between regions.
On a practical level, however, I am convinced it will bring an end to queues at consulates in countries that issued visas.
Consequently, it will also mean an end to the corruption associated with granting documents of that nature.
To conclude, I should like to say that if this regulation is adopted, we shall be sending out a signal that the European Union is not an inaccessible stronghold, and that there is no such thing as Fortress Europe.
The Union will be seen to be lifting internal borders whilst also opening up to the outside world.
To end on a poetic note, our closest neighbours will be able to enter the Union, albeit for a short time, with their heads held high, instead of on their knees as has been the case to date.
Â Â  The new Member States would like to join the Schengen area as soon as possible.
However, the positive expectations are mixed with a fair amount of anxiety and worry.
New Member States fear that a new Iron Curtain may fall into place, this time not on the Western, but on the Eastern borders.
They fear that joining the Schengen area may create difficulties in keeping in touch with relatives, that it may prevent the maintenance or development of relationships in the areas of economy, education and culture.
A great merit of the report and of the cooperation created between the Commission and Parliament is that they give a reassuring answer to the anxieties.
This report and this text is now more favourable in every respect than the original proposal of the Commission.
It addresses three important issues.
Firstly, it establishes the border area at 30 kilometres, but it allows the possibility of extending it to 50 kilometres.
Secondly, at least one year of residency is required, but it allows the possibility of extending this to several years by bilateral agreement; this addresses the worries of mass relocations to border areas, which may interfere with the ethnic balance of these regions.
Thirdly: it extends the duration of stay in neighbouring countries from the originally proposed seven days to three months.
These provisions make it possible to conduct freely all the activities related to cross-border cooperation.
Therefore this is a very good proposal.
However, it is worthless on its own, as it proposes the introduction of local border traffic permits.
However, this requires the amendment of the Council Regulation concerning Schengen, and the introduction of such a local border traffic permit must be made possible.
Mr Frattiniâs words are very positive; I hope that the Council will have the same constructive attitude as the Commission, and they will amend the Schengen Agreement and the Regulation as soon as possible, to enable this excellent text to finally come into force.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, the simplification of procedures for local border traffic at external borders is a step in the right direction.
A great deal will depend on how the Member States themselves implement the provisions of this regulation, however.
Other factors to take into account will be the size of the target group of beneficiaries of these movements, and whether the reasons for which the new regime is introduced reflect those highlighted in the proposal for a regulation.
I refer to social, family and cultural cohesion and to economic cooperation.
Neighbouring countries will also be challenged to ensure full reciprocity of the effective implementation of readmission agreements.
During the introduction of the local border traffic regime, it will be incumbent on the Member States to act very responsibly so as to ensure that the new BIS system does not benefit cross-border crime, smuggling or the organisation of illegal immigration.
Clearly, therefore, the document we are debating is simply paving the way for the regulation of local border traffic across our external borders.
Its implementation in the field must be constantly monitored.
It will be necessary to establish whether it is actually worthwhile in terms of real benefits for communities living in border areas, whilst also complying with security requirements.
The outcome of this assessment may vary in the various Member States located on the Unionâs external borders.
In conclusion, if we really want to engage in a serious discussion on integrated solutions to make our external borders more user-friendly to travellers who are third country nationals, whilst retaining essential security requirements, we ought to ensure that all the institutions and Member States are working together to ensure full implementation of the Schengen by the 10Â new Member States as soon as possible.
The latterâs visa policy towards their neighbours should become much more transparent once they are able to issue short-term Schengen visas.
In addition, there should be joint discussion of the possibility of wider use of national multiple entry long-term visas in cases where the implementation of the proposed local border movement provisions is not viable or attractive to the border community.
I have in mind cases in which the community is seeking access to the entire territory of the neighbouring country, not just to a small, clearly defined area.
Â Â  I welcome the draft regulation to be accepted today, and congratulate the rapporteur for contributing to the preparation of a better text that really serves the purpose for which it has been created.
This regulation is particularly important to us, Hungarians, as it ensures a further form of contact for Hungarians living in the border areas in neighbouring countries, and it makes their everyday life easier.
The draft takes into account the particularities and differences of border regions, and it is capable of having a positive effect on border regions without violating any guarantees.
We hope that it will not affect the current, traditional particularities of border regions.
It is now the responsibility and opportunity of the governments to use the conditions provided by the Regulation when they conclude their bilateral agreements.
We feel that this will ensure contact between those on the two sides of the border, and at the same time, it will filter out any abuse.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like again to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and all the speakers.
Thanks to the contribution of each institution, the balance between facilitation on the one hand and security on the other has been maintained and this regulation, as was rightly said, will also be very helpful in strengthening the local development of important European regions near to the external borders.
The introduction of a specific local border traffic permit for border residents will help in identifying those people who have the right to benefit from the facilitated border crossing regime.
Member States will have the right to scrutinise carefully people requesting this permit.
However, I think that is fully justified by the advantages deriving from such a permit.
First of all, holders of the permit will no longer need to be in possession of a visa, and a visa exemption for the holders of a local border traffic permit will be included very soon in the forthcoming Commission proposal revising the relevant visa regulation which I will put forward by the end of March.
Later in the spring I will also present the new document on the common consular instruction for issuing a visa.
On the basis of this regulation, Member States will be able to provide some practical facilitation such as specific border crossing points reserved for border residents and give them the possibility in very exceptional cases to cross the border outside authorised border crossing points.
To counterbalance that, Member States will have to ensure regular surveillance of border areas in order to avoid the misuse of the local border traffic regime and provide for specific sanctions.
Finally, the Commission will report on the implementation of the local border traffic regime two years after the entry into force of the regulation, proposing modifications if necessary.
I would like to conclude my remarks by stressing that I very much hope Parliament will confirm with its vote its support for the proposal made by the rapporteur, and I will encourage the Council to do the same as soon as possible.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0020/2006) by MrsÂ MechtildÂ Rothe on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on heating and cooling from renewable sources of energy [2005/2122(INI)].
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Piebalgs, we â and you, Commissioner â can take it as read that this House will, today, and by a large majority, call upon the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal for heating and cooling using renewable energies.
As our means to this end, we opted deliberately for a legislative own-initiative report, which is very seldom used and requires a qualified majority, and we did so in order that our initiative might carry a good deal more weight.
The fact that our report was adopted in Committee unanimously but for a few abstentions shows that a wide range of Members from all the political families will call on the Commission to at last do something about this, and I use the words âat lastâ in view of the fact that the Commission ought to have stirred itself into action as long ago as May 2004, when its communication on the share of renewable energy in the EU was presented.
That communication made it quite clear that the predicted failure to achieve the goal of doubling the share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption by 2010 was, in essence, attributable to poor market penetration by renewable heating and cooling technologies.
At present, some 10% of heat is derived from renewable sources of energy such as solar thermal and geothermal energy and biomass â far less than half than what is potentially feasible in the medium or long term.
Experts work on the assumption that it will, by 2020, be possible to derive at least 25% of the heat and cooling that we need from renewable energy resources, but those sources will be usable only if framework conditions change.
The fact that the subsidies accorded by at least some Member States are dependent on their own budgets has, however, meant that development has not been really continuous but has been on a stop-start basis.
What is needed is for broad market penetration to be brought about by a European framework directive.
It is not reasonable to prescribe a European support system, and nor have we done so.
What shape support is to take is for the Member States to decide; what matters is that they should actually give some and that all barriers that hinder progress should be removed.
That means that administrative obstacles must be done away with, that transparent rules on competence must apply and that procedures relating to applications for authorisation must be unambiguous and streamlined.
With this report, we urge the Commission to present a proposal for a directive obliging the Member States to legislate in favour of heating and cooling from renewable energy sources and also to draw up action plans for future development.
The intention is that action should be taken on the basis of effective national goals and result in at least a twofold increase across the EU by 2020.
Many people in the European Union, Commissioner, are waiting for the Commission to take action.
They worry about the environment and our climate; among them are many small and medium-sized businesses with great potential for employment, who particularly want to make their contribution to the production of heat from the sun, the earth, and from biomass.
We were delighted to note that the biomass action plan included the announcement of the eventual production of a directive.
I have since seen a preliminary draft of the Energy Green Paper, which has been floating around the corridors of Brussels, and was shocked to see that nowhere in it is there any reference to the need for new things to be done about heating.
In this draft Green Paper, incredibly, there is scant reference to renewable energy sources at all.
I hope that you, Commissioner Piebalgs, will be able to allay my concerns following the reading of this draft Green Paper, and also that you will again display the commitment to efficiency and renewable energies for which we know you.
I hope that you announce that the Commission will, this year, produce a proposal for a directive on heating and cooling from renewable sources of energy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for her work and her very strong commitment to renewable energy.
My services have already started to prepare an impact assessment on an action in favour of heating and cooling from renewable energy sources.
There is no doubt that the very complete and balanced report presented by Mrs Rothe will be very useful to the Commission when preparing action in this new field.
The international energy situation, our strong dependency on imports and the fight against climate change remind us of the urgent need to address the issues related to renewable energies.
As you know, the Commission intends to adopt a Green Paper on a secure, sustainable and competitive energy policy on 8Â March.
Whatever you have seen to date, it is not the Green Paper.
The Green Paper will be adopted on 8Â March by the whole college, and there will be no backtracking from energy efficiency and from renewable energies.
It will also show that all these measures are necessary to build security of supply, to fight climate change and to achieve environmental objectives, as well as to increase competitiveness.
We will strive to achieve a balanced approach, but that does not mean backtracking; that is clearly not the way we would like to present it.
However, there is still some time before the Commission completes its work on this Green Paper.
Since 1997, the European Union has been working towards the objective of 12% of renewable energy balance by 2010 but, to date, we have achieved only half of that goal.
While we now have legislation on the promotion of electricity generation from renewable energy and on the promotion of biofuels, the production of heating and cooling from renewable energy â the third pillar of the renewable energy portfolio â lacks a specific strategy.
Without a vigorous development of renewable energy in the sector of heating and cooling, the overall objective of 12% renewable energy by 2010 will not be achieved.
Promoting heating and cooling from renewable energy will contribute to a number of important objectives: it will reduce our external energy dependency, it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and it will create a European industry and promote local employment.
It will therefore help us make progress towards the goals of the Lisbon strategy.
I would like to react to some of the issues raised by Mrs Rotheâs report.
I agree that we should take practical steps to promote heating and cooling from renewable energy more vigorously.
I can promise you that we will work hard to table a legislative proposal as quickly as possible and certainly before the end of this year, since that is already in the 2006 work programme.
However, there is a need to take a different approach from earlier directives, because the key problems lie in market confidence and attitudes rather than costs.
Subsidiarity is another key issue.
By nature, all these energies are decentralised and will, therefore, have to be implemented at local level.
We have to tailor our legislation to take account of this.
Beyond a legislative instrument, it might be interesting to evaluate what progress could be made through standardisation.
I am convinced that we should set the scene for industry to develop a market for this type of equipment.
Mrs Rotheâs report contributes to the objectives of the European energy policy, and I very much welcome it.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner Piebalgs, whilst we know that heating and cooling account for nearly half of the energy consumption in the European Union, nothing has been done about a more efficient use of energy.
This directive is, in actual fact, the keystone of European energy policy.
Mrs Rotheâs report, which is one of Parliamentâs initiatives, is therefore very timely.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the European Parliament have decided in favour of doubling the present share of renewable energy sources in energy consumption for heating and cooling by 2020.
In many cases, this energy can be generated locally, and the technology needed to do so â not least that using sun, wind, water, bio-mass and soil heat â has improved substantially.
Whilst Europe is ahead in terms of technological expertise, we are lagging behind where its practical application is concerned.
Europe must become the front runner in product innovation and commercialisation.
If this rate of development in the sector is set to continue, many jobs will also be created.
We only have to look at the German example, where between 1998 and 2002, employment in the energy sector doubled to approximately 125Â 000 jobs as a consequence.
In order to implement this policy, the Member States must put forward viable national objectives and provide for an energy mix within the constraints of their own possibilities.
The PPE-DE Group is opposed to overregulation and binding objectives at the present time.
This may be ambitious, but it is mainly realistic, and that is why we have decided in favour of effective national objectives combined with viable targets.
Finally, I should like to ask Commissioner Piebalgs to make better use of the scope for financial support from the Structural Funds in the period 2007-2013.
The guidelines provide for opportunities, but it is up to the Member States to decide whether or not to seize them.
In this incentives policy too, we must ensure that these priorities are in place with the Unionâs and Member Statesâ existing funds.
This is a cry from the heart which I would like you to take home.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to Mechtild Rothe.
We support the approach she has chosen and, obviously, her idea for a framework directive.
The last few months have shown in no uncertain way how important it is to develop alternative energy sources and make energy savings.
It is vitally important to reduce Europeâs dependence on imports of fossil fuels and energy once and for all.
How will we be able to cope with a dependence rate of 70% in the year 2030?
Our future will be in outside hands, therefore, if we do not change the situation.
There needs to be support in the European Union for new technology and innovations which make use of alternative forms of energy for heating and cooling.
These innovations could substantially extend our range of energy sources.
The use of biomass and new technologies will create jobs and business opportunities, and so they are a good thing from this point of view as well.
I am happy that the Commission has just approved the work programme which will begin the implementation of the Intelligent Energy Europe programme.
I believe that Parliament will give this measure its support.
Under this programme, a series of SWOT analyses were undertaken on the Unionâs initiative.
These aim specifically to promote heating and cooling though the use of renewable energy sources and heat pumps.
This new technique has now already proved to be a way of significantly reducing electrical consumption in heating and cooling â by up to a third, in fact.
By using equipment such as this, which can be assembled and installed easily anywhere in a building, we can achieve enormous savings in energy.
I believe that it is better to cut down consumption, which is also a good guiding principle in life generally.
This was brief, but I wanted to say it.
I believe that our Commissioner has now heard what we wanted to say.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to begin by echoing this own-initiative report and calling on the Commission not to delay in presenting draft legislation concerning the proportion of renewable energy within the heating and cooling sector.
There is broad support here in Parliament for what such a directive should contain.
In accordance with the ambition stated in the Commissionâs 1997 White Paper for a Community Strategy and Action Plan, âEnergy for the future: renewable sources of energyâ, we are eager to supplement the two directives on the promotion of renewable energy sources in relation to, respectively, electricity and transport with a third directive, this time in relation to heating.
Of Europeâs total energy consumption, almost half goes on heating.
Given todayâs warning signals concerning climate change and in view of the fact that we are so dependent on imports of traditional energy sources with consequent high carbon dioxide emissions, it is extremely important for us to exploit the huge potential for renewable energy sources in Europe, together with our existing resources in terms of such renewables.
There are great benefits to be gained from increasing the proportion of these within the heating and cooling sector.
Allow me to mention a few of them.
We should reduce carbon dioxide emissions; we should reduce our dependency on imports and increase the degree to which we are self-sufficient in Europe; we should not be as easily affected by energy crises in other parts of the world; and, by promoting renewable energy sources, we should provide incentives for innovation and technical development within this area which, in turn, would lead to further cleaner and more efficient energy consumption.
The fact that the choice of renewable energy source would be made in the light of each Member Stateâs requirements would mean that we should be contributing to regional development.
Moreover, we should be creating a lot of jobs, as this is one of the few spheres in which we are, in fact, clearly creating new jobs in Europe and are rightly heading in the direction of increased growth.
These are the needs and the benefits, but how do we meet these needs and obtain these benefits?
I believe that nationally binding targets for the proportion of renewable energy is a first step, but it is not enough.
I hope that the Commission will also create the basic conditions required if companies are to dare to make long-term investments in technology that will permit the increased use of renewable energy sources, and I call on it to do so.
I also hope that the Commission will provide crucial research with the resources required for discovering and developing new technology and, again, I call on it to do so.
Finally, I would draw attention to the technical solutions that already exist whereby we might obtain more efficient use of the energy we exploit to heat houses, namely district heating.
Technical solutions and choices of energy source go hand in hand.
Modern, technically advanced district heating is part of the solution, and it may also be combined with what is known as trigeneration electricity production.
This own-initiative report shows clearly and unambiguously what Parliament wants to see in terms of future draft legislation.
I hope that the Commission will quickly follow up this initiative so that we lose no time in obtaining the incentives needed for changing over to using an ever higher proportion of renewable energy sources for heating Europe or cooling it down.
As Einstein once said, a whole new way of thinking is required for solving the problems we have created through our old way of thinking.
Parliament has made important efforts in this direction.
We now hope that the Commission will complete the work.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have only a minute, so I will be brief.
Many thanks, Mrs Rothe, you tireless campaigner, for this good piece of work.
I would like to give an example of the potential involved here; in Upper Austria, 1Â 500 new houses are built every year.
Ten years ago, 1Â 200 of them were fitted with oil heating.
In Upper Austria this year, only seven were so equipped; all the others used biomass, networks or pellets instead for heating.
That created jobs in the forestry sector, in agriculture, and for local installing engineers, so that today, indeed, oil merchants have gone over to selling pellets.
That is the way we must go, or, to put it another way, we have to take the good practice that is to be found at the local and regional levels, and put it to work across Europe.
I might add that Denmark, too, has done exemplary work in this respect, an example that we in this House will, this afternoon, vote to follow.
It will then be for you to put the work in.
Just another thing on the subject of the Green Paper, Commissioner: if we are to win Europeans over, there needs to be a chapter in it with the title ââ That is what the people of Europe expect of us, and you should not fall short of that standard.
Â Â  . () MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to state that I regard the report as a well-executed piece of work.
It provides an accurate outline of the current situation regarding the use of renewable sources of energy for heating and cooling.
On the other hand, the European Parliament has repeatedly declared the need for greater use of renewables, and adopted the correct decisions and recommendations, only for little to change.
Politicians talk more about the need to use renewables than those who take the real decisions in this area, that is to say the general public.
One reason for this may be that the Member States have not been able to create the right conditions for the greater use of renewables and have not convinced people of the case for them.
Consequently, as the report states, northern Denmark uses more solar energy than southern Italy, for example.
The recommendations therefore attach great importance to informing and persuading people.
They will only really take this on board, however, when renewables become more advantageous for them.
The price of these types of energy is therefore important and this is part and parcel of creating the right conditions for the use of renewables.
A current example of this from the Czech Republic does not directly involve renewables, but is all the more instructive for that.
When the call was raised for the use of natural gas as a more environmentally-friendly form of heating, it brought a quick response, not only from individuals, but also from local and municipal authorities, who compared it with other fuels and, supported by various instruments, switched to gas.
Now, however, after several major increases in gas prices they are returning in large numbers to types of fuel that are very bad for the environment, such as cheap and low-grade forms of coal, along with the inefficient burning not only of wood but even of plastics and tyres in local heating plants.
They can, in short, no longer afford gas.
It is therefore just as important to create the right conditions as it is to take sensible decisions, to make use of all the elements in the energy mix and to support energy saving measures.
Otherwise, we may find ourselves following the example of the moth which, in its longing to draw closer to light and heat, often finds only death.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank MrsÂ Rothe for the report before us.
Heating, cooling and the use of renewable energy are part of the broader issue of security of the European Unionâs energy supply.
There is more to saving energy than protecting the environment.
It also has a significant bearing on the economy and is linked to the development of renewable energy sources.
The importance of this problem has been highlighted by recent cases of energy terrorism.
I refer to increasing the cost of fuel, with negative implications for the financial health of businesses and the citizensâ standard of living.
I should like to mention three concerns.
Firstly, setting 2020 as the time period within which to implement programmes on energy saving suggests a static approach to the challenge.
It fails to take account of activities on the global market, and amounts to inertia.
Secondly, tax concessions and lower VAT rates should apply to all activities involving the use, exploitation and creation of new sources of renewable energy.
Thirdly, the use of currently unexploited agricultural land for the production of biomass and sustainable fuels should be speeded up.
The regulation of agricultural production in the European Union comes into play here, together with the lack of appropriate subsidies for the production of vegetables and fruit, notably soft fruit.
The area of unexploited land is set to increase, leading to an increase in poverty and unemployment in rural areas.
If the production of the biomass and fuels I mentioned is developed quickly, it will create employment and improve the security of energy supply for our countries.
Â Â  () Mr President, Commissioner, heating and cooling accounts for 49% of the energy consumed on our continent.
I assume that a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions will form part of any responsible energy plan.
I firmly believe that, along with the nuclear plants that serve mainly for generating electricity, it is chiefly through the use of renewables for heating and cooling that we will manage to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the future.
The less we use fossil fuels for these purposes the better, not only from the standpoint of global climate change, but also from the standpoint of reducing dependence on imports from outside Europe.
The use of renewables also has a largely positive influence on the rural economy, which is where the new energy plants will be located, with the creation of new jobs.
This report, which the rapporteur has drawn up on the basis of detailed investigations and discussions, presents a whole raft of strategic measures that must be implemented if we are to overcome the obstacles to greater use of renewables.
Speaking as an MEP from the Czech Republic, however, I must state that the position of renewables on the market weakened after accession to the EU because the mandatory bracketing of, for example, briquettes and pellets made from biomass into higher VAT bands led to a sharp decline in a market that had been showing promising signs of development.
All of the new Member States are in the same situation.
It is paradoxical that the neighbouring states of Germany and Austria have exceptions allowing these products to be bracketed in a lower VAT band.
This has brought about a situation where the Czech Republicâs entire output of briquettes and pellets made from biomass is exported to these countries.
At the same time, our domestic market is seeing an increase in energy costs and, rather than switching to renewables, people are instead opting for cheaper energy sources, which in our case often means low-grade brown coal.
I therefore strongly endorse the call from the Commission and the Council for a revision of the Sixth Council Directive, allowing the implementation of lower VAT rates for renewables.
We can and must do this at European level.
I support the report and I would like to thank the rapporteur for doing a good job.
I should also like to say that this offers a promising way forward for the Commission and the individual Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to emphasise that Mechtild Rotheâs report should be greatly commended, above all for the establishment of binding obligations on Member States in the use of renewable energy.
As we know, the present energy market in the European Union is severely distorted.
Among other things, this is due to uneven subsidisation and the fact that subsidies for fossil fuels (coal, brown coal, oil shale) and nuclear energy are considerably greater than those for renewable energy.
In several Member States, this situation has been brought about by the monopolistic position of those power plants that use fossil fuels.
This situation has also been the primary obstacle to the formation of a common energy policy in the European Union.
At the moment, given that our external supply reliability is inadequate as well, one can only hope that the lesson Russia taught Europe at the beginning of the year will offer an additional stimulus to the development of renewable energy in the European Union, and that improving cooperation between the Member States will indeed lead us to a common European energy policy.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak in place of my colleague, Fiona Hall, who cannot be here this morning because of a pressing engagement with Commissioner Mandelson.
I should like to thank both Mrs Hall for the valuable work she has done on this resolution, along with the other shadow rapporteurs, and the rapporteur herself, whose skilful mediation and collation work has led to a text that enjoys broad support in this Parliament.
The objective that the European Parliament is setting itself with this resolution is an ambitious one in my view.
First of all, it is ambitious in its methods, because Parliament is taking a proactive role under the Rule 39 procedure and is calling on the Commission to put forward a legislative act that is needed to fill a gap, to put that missing piece in place in the structure of the legislative and legal framework.
That will enable us to make significant progress towards the use of renewable energies, in particular for the heating and cooling sector.
I think everyone is surprised to learn that 50% of Europeâs energy requirements are used for heating.
That reveals the obvious need for a legislative provision, without which the sector cannot grow â something that was also acknowledged by the Commission in its report on energy efficiency.
The sector also needs to be given some certainty.
Without the certainty of possible growth there will be no investment and no research; in short, there will not be that kind of concentration of resources and energies that will enable the sector to make a qualitative leap.
Secondly, Parliamentâs objective is also important and ambitious in that it sets a deadline of 2020.
Some may perhaps consider that deadline to be rather timid and limited, but I believe we should see it as a target to beat.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about a share of over 20%, we are hoping to achieve a significant percentage, more than double the current share for renewable sources of energy.
To conclude, I believe that there is a clear commitment in Parliament and from certain Members â I see Vittorio Prodi is here for the subject of biomass.
We also call on the Commission â and, subsequently, the Member States when implementing the directive â to work particularly hard to reduce our energy dependence, which might have a serious effect on our future growth and development.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, security of energy supply has, over past weeks and months, been the big issue, and there are numerous things that we need if we are to address it.
I do believe, though, that we must make a big issue of heating with renewable energies too.
Why?
Their potential is particularly great.
The association for that industry in my own country, Germany â the one I know best â talks in terms of our being able, in the space of ten years, to increase the proportion of newly-installed plant running on renewable energies from 8 to 80%, that is to say ten-fold.
That involves a tenfold multiplication of the new installations rather than the share in energy use across the board.
It is not Greenpeace that is saying this, but an industrial association.
The use of renewable energies for heating purposes is also good value in comparison to other sources of energy, such as solar radiation or photovoltaic cells; prices can often differ by a ratio of 1 to 45.
We have, then given the least support where there was the greatest potential, and so something has to change in this respect.
I also believe that this is not just a national issue, but also a European one, for the reason why heating and cooling with renewable energies is not yet the order of the day has nothing to do with the generally complex technology.
What is needed instead is for the equipment to be produced in larger quantities in order to achieve a critical mass at which the equipment becomes better value for the end user.
It will of course be easier to reach this critical mass at European level than it would be if every country were to work for itself.
I do not think that endorsement of Mrs Rotheâs report in any way contradicts my support, and my partyâs, for nuclear power.
I believe that both renewable energy and atomic energy are needed.
The false antithesis must be done away with; it must be removed from the Green Paper, too, and it is for that reason that I also endorse what has been said about that document.
What is needed, and as soon as possible, is a concrete proposal from the Commission, and I am obliged to Commissioner Piebalgs for announcing that one will be forthcoming in 2006; that means that umpteen billions spent by European consumers on imported energy can be saved and the money invested in something more constructive.
Â Â  I would like to express my thanks to Mrs Rothe for her excellent report.
There are only aÂ few regions in Europe that have formulated and implemented successful strategies for energy generation from renewable sources.
Differences in development are not based on differences in opportunities but on political agendas.
The only way forward is to set major targets jointly, I reiterate the word jointly, and to monitor their attainment.
IÂ would like to emphasise that it is essential to offer incentives to investors who go down the road of renewable energy sources.
One of the proposed incentives, also mentioned by my colleague, Mr BÅezina, would be to offer aÂ lower VAT rate.
It is a good incentive, but on the other hand it will not motivate countries with a flat-rate tax.
I believe that the future of Europe will not move in the direction of the flat-rate tax.
However, we need to take account of the fact that countries that have already implemented the flat-rate tax will not be willing to give it up.
In conclusion, allow me to provide an example.
The city where I have held the office of mayor for the past seven years is generating 15% of its energy from renewable sources.
Thanks in part to the Structural Funds, that proportion will reach 50% in two yearsâ time, something for which IÂ would like express my gratitude.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the recent cuts in natural gas supply in Ukraine have brought us face to face with a problem to which we had perhaps not attached the importance it deserved.
Furthermore, over recent weeks, the price of a barrel of crude has oscillated between 60 and 65 dollars, a price that would have seemed unthinkable a few years ago.
If we add to all of this the unstable situation in the Middle East, the conclusion is clear: the European Union must act urgently.
We cannot carry on taking a complacent view of our dependence on external sources of energy.
We must act intelligently and decisively, because there is no time to lose.
I do not doubt that the initiatives announced by the Commissioner will have significant benefits for the Unionâs future, but we cannot forget the legislation that has already entered into force and that has not been transposed into national legislation by certain Member States with sufficient rigour.
There is no question that current oil prices provide a reference for the thresholds of viability for replacement technologies: there is a great opportunity here for renewable energy sources to reach competitive prices with public aid, in line with the legislation on State aid.
As the Commissioner has correctly diagnosed, compliance with the directive on renewable energy sources is turning out to be difficult.
Biomass must play a fundamental role, since its potential is under-exploited.
The directive on energy efficiency in buildings already contains certain provisions, on the use of biomass in heating, which need to be enhanced.
We believe that a new directive on heating and refrigeration that takes account of the excellent report by Mrs Rothe, and hence of renewable energy sources, must include objectives that are both ambitious and realistic: clear guidelines on funding mechanisms and an exemplary role for the public sector.
We are sure that the Commission will respond once again to these expectations.
Â Â  â I would like to congratulate rapporteur Mechtild Rothe and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
This initiative will encourage EU states to embrace the use of renewable energy sources for heating and cooling and to create economic incentives for this.
When discussing standards of energy efficiency in buildings, it is worth underlining a problem common to Lithuania, all of the Baltic countries and some of the other new EU Member States.
A large proportion of the urban population there live in poor quality apartment blocks, built 20-40 years ago, if not earlier.
These buildings have little heat insulation, heat use is regulated from a central boiler, and residents are unable to select the desired temperature.
Both national governments and the European Commission should devote more attention to this problem.
Money from the Union and Structural Funds should be allocated for the renovation of such buildings, in order to guarantee that homes are heated efficiently.
The Commission could collate the best examples of similar house reconstructions, in order to help national governments decide whether to renovate or demolish such buildings.
Â Â  Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very clear report, particularly the explanatory statement, which uses illustrations.
This is marvellous and I wish it happened with other reports.
I speak as the President of the Forum for Construction in the European Parliament.
I cannot overemphasise the need for proper building insulation and, as my colleague just said, the need to stop the waste of energy in these enormous slab blocks in the Eastern European countries that are now in the European Union.
Some action is desperately needed in that area.
I apologise, on behalf of the United Kingdom, that it has not been up to speed with other countries in these renewable energy, heating and cooling measures.
I am sure we will go up the league tables in the next few years.
I fully support the rapporteurâs point that there should be national support schemes.
She highlights the fact that the Member States can use these as a matter of principle, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
She points out that any support should be limited in time and gradually reduced.
I could not agree more.
She then goes on to say that there should be incentive mechanisms to achieve a high degree of market penetration and, finally, that associated heating and cooling networks should be encouraged.
This report is to be welcomed by the industry and the European Parliament and will ensure that we have safe and secure energy supplies in the future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating MrsÂ Rothe on her excellent own-initiative report, which clearly calls upon the European Commission to draw up a legislative proposal on increasing the share of renewable energy in heating and cooling by July 2006.
Heat and cooling networks and biomass, particularly woody biomass, are important outlets for the timber industry, fit in perfectly with a sustainable European forestry strategy and can support European efforts towards sustainable development, particularly the aim of 12% of all energy consumed being from renewable sources by 2010.
However, there is currently no legislation governing the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling, and this gap must be filled following the publication of the European Commission's biomass action plan on 7Â December last year.
I would like to emphasise three points that I see as important.
First of all, on 28Â January, the Ecofin Council concluded a political agreement to extend the experimental reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services until 2010.
The important new aspect for the subject we are now discussing is the inclusion of district heating in the option provided for in ArticleÂ 12(3)(b) of the sixth VAT Directive, under the same heading as the supply of natural gas and electricity.
The Member States can therefore now put an end to this disparity in the tax treatment of sales of heating energy and subscriptions to heat and cooling networks using renewable energy, and the supply of natural gas and electricity.
I fully support the rapporteur's recommendation regarding the use of the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Funds and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
Â Â  Promoting the use of renewable energy sources signifies a direct implementation of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy.
Indeed it brings to the fore concern for the environment, the encouragement of innovation and the infrastructure that must facilitate competitiveness and independent growth in Europe.
Renewable energy sources are the natural wealth of the European Union, reducing our dependence on imports and improving our environment.
At the same time their use increases the diversity of energy sources, and improves the reliability of energy supply.
We must exploit them not simply to produce electricity, but also for heating and cooling buildings, since that alone accounts for more than 40% of the use of all energy in Europe.
A recent Eurobarometer survey showed that people support a common European energy policy.
For this reason in Europe we must also formulate clear guidelines and incentives in the area of cooling and heating.
We must set ourselves a common goal, but leave it to the Member States to formulate their own national goals, which should be rational and binding.
Goals must be set relative to the natural features of individual countries, since they do not all enjoy the same conditions, for instance in the exploitation of solar energy or biomass.
In fact it is precisely with biomass that we should exercise particular caution over how to encourage its use.
It is also a raw material for the wood processing industry, and serves to create numerous jobs and high added value.
By using wood as a natural material, less energy is used in making the final product, while at the same time this reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and the wood retains the carbon dioxide, that has built up in the tree over a number of years.
May I close by pointing out that for energy purposes it is prudent to use only wood waste that is unsuitable for recycling, while the rest can be processed into useful raw materials.
The European energy policy must also be formulated to accommodate this.
Â Â  Europe is the largest energy importer in the world.
However, the price of imported energy is rising, and energy is imported from politically and economically unstable regions.
These facts are forcing us to reduce, and if possible, eliminate our dependency on imported energy and our vulnerability.
To this end, apart from rationalising our energy consumption and making it more efficient, we must also increase the use of renewable energy sources situated in Europe.
The steps taken in this respect by the European Union in the last decade have proved to be successful: in respect of wind energy, the EU reached the target set for 2010 as early as the end of last year, biomass power plants are spreading dynamically, and biofuels are gaining ground spectacularly.
What is the secret of this success?
I am convinced that it is mainly the EU regulations and mandatory standards accepted here, in Parliament.
I am against overregulation, but it would be difficult to deny that the legal constraints imposed by the European Union and the targets that we have jointly set are efficient means in urging Member States forward.
Cooling and heating in the household sector constitute 40% of our current energy consumption.
On average, renewable energy is used in 10% of European homes, but this figure is only due to the outstanding performance of a few countries, such as Austria, Germany, Greece, etc.
Other countries, including my own, are hardly using any renewable energy at all, they are not supporting investments in this area and have no government programmes â on the contrary, they are creating administrative obstacles.
This area must be regulated at European Union level, to enable us to reduce efficiently and at a relatively low cost the utilisation of fossil energy in households, the emission of greenhouse gases and our energy-dependency.
This is why I support the creation of a directive that addresses this issue.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Rothe for her wholehearted commitment to renewable energy, and also Mr Turmes for warmly commending the Austrian province from which I come for the exemplary work for renewable energy that it is doing, and doing it, moreover, right across the economy, since what matters to us, quite simply, is that energy production be cheap, safe and clean.
These three considerations must always be seen in context.
The slogan âthink globally and act locallyâ also applies here.
We must be constantly aware of the global situation, while also focusing on how measures can be put into practice.
When issuing building permits or permission to develop land, the authorities should give priority to installations using renewable energy and hence helping to achieve the Kyoto goal.
I regard the proposal that a decision should be required two months following submission of the application as being an absolute priority, for time is catching up with us, and we should also provide for the burden of proof to be reversed in this regard if the authorities turn down a plan.
It is also necessary that projects should yield a return on investment in them, and here a wide range of options are available to us.
I see energy services as presenting, in future, a tremendous opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Some of those Members who have already spoken have â in view of the services directive that we will be agreeing to adopt this week â highlighted the wholly new challenges that cross-border energy supply presents to each and every Member State and the need for simplified procedures in this area.
One particular priority is that bureaucracy should cease to put obstacles in the way.
What matters in the final analysis is that domestic resources be used and small circuits promoted.
That is what we aim to do, and we want to achieve it together with the Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, there have been very frequent debates in this House about the demands made on us by energy issues; we have debated the time it takes for resources to burn out, the natural demand for them â which is limited â and also the additional demand that arises from large countries with expanding industries.
We have, since January, been debating our dependence on individual suppliers, and we have become aware of the need for action in this area.
It is right, then, that we should also be asking ourselves how we can develop new and additional capacities for heating and cooling.
That is both right and vital, and I am grateful, too, for the many amendments that have been accepted and incorporated.
My concern is that we may well be setting ourselves the right goal â of cutting back on consumption and accessing new and renewable energy sources â but that this may be giving us tunnel vision and causing us to believe that this way alone is the right one, that it alone is rationally justifiable and the way of salvation.
I am wary of approaches that give people the idea that there is but one thing that needs to be done and then all our problems will be solved â what Mr Turmes had to say just now tended in that direction.
I am firmly convinced, on the other hand â and I agree with those Members who say this â that, while this is an additional option, and one that we must avail ourselves of, it will not spare us the need to answer other questions, for example, to questions like, âHow do we handle nuclear power?â or âHow do we go about using the fossil fuels that we already have in a cleaner way?â
I also have my doubts when it comes to the method we should adopt or the means whereby we arrive at the new regulations for the future, for the question arises, and it is a pressing one, of whether we are on the right track if we believe that the only way to come up with solutions to political problems is by way of devising new regulations or by this House adopting them, after which we relax and tell ourselves that everything has now been sorted out.
Directives making new impositions on the Member States are not the answer.
This morning, we were told by the Commissioner that 42 directives have been adopted in the energy field alone, with 22 of them dealing with energy efficiency, and even so, we are not satisfied and claim that we are not moving forward fast enough.
To cut a long story short, the way ahead must be to promote new technologies and benchmarks and develop standards and indicators, so that those who ultimately have to take the decision as to whether to take a new tack are enabled to make comparisons and see where the opportunities and their own advantages lie.
Dreams will not be enough; what will be are ambitious but realistic objectives differing from nation to nation and dependent on different natural environments and different individual markets.
It is for that reason that âone size fits allâ answers are no use.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank you for the very interesting debate, and I also again thank the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, and all the shadow rapporteurs, for their work.
I know that you all feel passionately about this subject, and this is definitely not the only answer that we should be looking for in the energy sector.
I am also passionate about this report.
The vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the debate today have demonstrated very impressive support for the ideas expressed in the report.
I believe the Commission has already taken strong steps in this direction.
In the Biomass Action Plan in December 2005 the Commission announced that it would work towards an initiative on heating and cooling from renewable energy sources.
But at the same time, as some Members have indicated, we care about better legislation and delivering legislation that can be implemented properly and respect the principle of subsidiarity.
That is why I have asked my services to deliver an impact assessment in this area, because it will also be very important later on in the debate to steer the proposal on the basis of a proper impact assessment.
On the basis of this impact assessment, I will take a further decision on how to take this important subject further.
However, at the same time I can tell you that the Commission will meet your expectations, as Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca mentioned, and we are working not only in this direction but also for the implementation of legislation.
Today I am pleased to inform the Committee on Industry of exactly what we are doing in this respect.
We have adopted the Biomass Action Plan that I have already mentioned, and recently we adopted the communication on biofuels. That shows that the Commission is very serious about achieving better penetration of renewable energies in a European energy mix.
I thank you for your huge interest in this debate and I hope that by the end of this year I will be able to present a legislative proposal to this House.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, while you are probably the best Vice-President we have in this Parliament, you have already made two mistakes today!
And at a recent voting session with Mr Mauro in the chair, he said that one amendment was rejected, when in fact it was adopted by 584 votes to 41.
How much longer are we going to put up with this ridiculous system?
Â Â  The problem is that when it is not a roll-call vote, people tend not to put their hands up.
I try to encourage them, but I cannot force them.
That is why we have so many checks.
As the first part has been rejected, I suspect the second and third parts should fall.
Can you help us on that, Mr HÃ¶kmark?
Â Â  Mr President, I tend to agree with you that parts two and three do not make sense following the rejection of part one.
It is not one of my amendments, but I would say that the vote we already had is enough.
Â Â  You are the rapporteur.
The next two parts fall.
Â Â  . I would like to move the following oral amendment, which has been agreed with the shadow rapporteur of the PSE Group: âwhereas state aid which does not distort competition is a permissible means of promoting economic development and can thus be one means of promoting the Lisbon Agenda for economic growth and jobs, alongside other tools, including Community funding, such as the structural fundsâ.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the amendment is already in the Minutes, but I shall read it out again anyway.
âPoints out that, in its relations with third countries and in the context of promoting democratic principles and human rights through the âdemocracy clauseâ, the European Union is called upon to pay special attention to implementing policies for gender equality and womenâs rights, whilst satisfying itself that the third-country authorities uphold the fundamental rights not to be arbitrarily arrested, tortured or executed and that their citizens have access to an impartial court of law as a priority;â
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to speak briefly on my report on access restrictions to fisheries under the common fisheries policy.
I call on colleagues to give their full support to this report on access restrictions to the CFP, which cover the Shetland Box and the Plaice Box.
This report is good news for sustainable EU fisheries policy as it recognises the need to make sensitive use of access restrictions.
I should like to thank the PSE Group for its invaluable backing.
The restrictions covered by this report are of obvious importance, and I call on all colleagues to vote for paragraph 8 and for the resolution as a whole.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . The text of Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1786/2003 contains a number of errors, which should be corrected without delay.
Accordingly, following the amendment to the Combined Nomenclature, CN codes 1214Â 90Â 91 and 1214Â 90Â 99 should be replaced by CN code 1214Â 90Â 90.
The guaranteed maximum quantity of dried fodder of 4Â 855Â 900 tonnes should be replaced by 4Â 960Â 723 tonnes, which corresponds to the sum of current national quantities.
Furthermore, the method of calculating the reduction in support in the event of this quantity being exceeded needs to be amended.
The Commissionâs proposal meets the need to correct Council Regulation NoÂ 1786/2003.
The proposed amendment is appropriate and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Developmentâs favourable opinion should be supported by Parliament.
Â Â  . The partnership agreement between the EC and the Solomon Islands is based on the mandate conferred on the Commission by the Council in June 2001 to negotiate bilateral tuna fishery agreements with ACP countries of the Central West Pacific, with a view to setting up a network of tuna agreements for the Community fleet operating in the Pacific region.
I wholeheartedly support the rapporteurâs position in this document, but wish to highlight the importance of Amendment 5, which states that, when the first meeting of the Joint Committee is held, the Commission must inform the Solomon Islands authorities of the attendance of shipownersâ representatives at subsequent meetings of the Joint Committee.
I therefore back the adoption of this report.
Â Â  . This report in essence exports the EU's disastrous common fisheries policy to the Solomon Islands, and has little to recommend it; therefore I voted against, and am saddened that the House has chosen to endorse it.
The common fisheries policy is an unmitigated disaster which should be swept away, not perpetuated and exported to third countries.
Â Â  The report discusses an issue in connection with which the value of the internal market has to be weighed up against national self-determination.
A relevant case (C-156/04) is under way in the European Court of Justice at this very time.
We do not believe that discussion of the matter would be in any way advanced by means of a statement here and now by the European Parliament.
We have therefore chosen to vote against this report, but we wish to emphasise that we are not adopting a substantial position in the continuing debate.
The European Court of Justice must first adopt a position and give a judgment.
Subsequently, the Greek authorities and the national parliament will have to discuss how they are to deal with the European Court of Justiceâs decision.
Â Â  MrÂ President, with regard to the report by my colleague MrÂ Åry, I am torn between three feelings: satisfaction, regret and a wish.
My satisfaction is at the completion of the efforts initiated in 1994 to take a concerted approach to the risks faced by workers.
The attitude of our societies towards life's risks is a key element in the European social model that differentiates it from many others.
My regret is that the European Commission, under pressure from the Council, was not willing to negotiate with Parliament regarding the most reasonable solution, namely invoking the subsidiarity principle.
That would have relieved our fear that the states would be obliged to transpose the rules on solar radiation because they are referred to in the framework directive.
The Council turning its nose up at the subsidiarity principle in collusion with the CommissionÂ âÂ that really is a paradox!
My wish is that in future we will be able to deal with the issue of solar radiation flexibly, without pointless legislation or bureaucracy.
For example, the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work, based in Bilbao, could launch a major information campaign aimed at European workers, warning them of the risks presented by exposure to the sun.
Â Â  . We abstained from the vote because the Commission and the Council gave way to pressure from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the liberals and excluded solar radiation from the scope of this directive.
This position is all the more appalling given that optical radiation is known to fall under the category of electromagnetic radiation, which mainly comprises direct light, infrared and ultraviolet rays, and laser rays.
Solar radiation is composed of ultraviolet and infrared rays, and direct light.
The effects of such radiation on peopleâs health are known to bring about changes to the immune system, and to cause skin diseases, eye diseases, cancers and psychological conditions.
The quality of life of many millions of people in the EU working in farming, fishing and building, in open air salt works, quarries and mines, as well as in leisure activities, is adversely affected due to exposure to solar radiation in the course of their work.
Accordingly, whilst we did not vote against this directive â containing, as it does, a number of significant improvements as regards artificial radiation â its scope is limited due to its omission of solar radiation.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this conciliation outcome.
The fact that the title and scope of the directive have been amended to cover optical radiations from artificial sources only is to be welcomed.
I hope the Commission will learn from this, having originally brought ridicule upon the EU by proposing to ban sunshine - giving a public relations gift to eurosceptics and their ever-supportive media.
That unnecessary row could have been avoided, but I welcome this belated acceptance of the European Parliament's commonsense decision.
Now we will have a directive which legitimately seeks to protect workers who work with lasers and electrical welding equipment, those in the steel and glass industries and those in artificial tanning businesses.
The accepted guidelines are designed to prevent the acute and long-term effects to the eyes and skin that can occur with high levels of exposure.
Â Â  . I welcome this report on the protection of workers against risks arising from optical and artificial sources of radiation.
I believe it is sensible for Parliament to establish exposure limit values, as this provides workers with a safeguard against artificial sources such as lasers, cathode tubes and welding instruments.
Â Â  . I naturally voted in favour of the directive intended to protect workers from the risks arising from exposure to optical radiation.
This text is a continuation of three previous directives that also aimed to protect workers from the dangers of various 'physical agents' such as exposure to noise, vibrations and electromagnetic fields.
This directive primarily relates to radiation sources such as lasers and infrared lamps.
It refers in particular to adapting working methods in order to reduce the risks of radiation and the duration and level of exposure.
It also calls on the European Commission to draw up a practical guide for employers, in particular SMEs.
This latter measure is worth emphasising, because I feel that the EU needs to do more to help SMEs, which are a real spearhead of innovation and job creation in the Europe of 25.
This applicable legislation combines flexibility for employers and safety for employees.
It is therefore a specific example proving that, contrary to the ideas propagated by the specialist and non-specialist new Eurosceptics, the European Union takes care of both salaried and non-salaried workers, in the East and in the West, and often advocates standardising the social legislation of the Member States at the highest level.
Â Â  I voted against this proposal at first reading, but the governments of the Member States have now improved it.
This directive does not involve extensive new legislation but merely applies already current laws to areas in which the EU has already assumed competence.
The bizarre proposal to include solar radiation has been removed.
Moreover, the rules are based on international conventions and, where there are no such conventions, national legislation is accepted.
Health surveillance and subsequent checks are to be carried out in accordance with national practices.
This is, therefore, a decently balanced and acceptable proposal.
The advantages in terms of protecting workers outweigh the problem of having further legislation, because this directive does not in practice lead to any new EU powers.
Â Â  . This is a classic example of the often painfully slow nature of the European decision-making process.
The proposal on which we voted today has been on the table since 1992, even though it addresses an issue as crucial as the protection of workersâ health.
It has taken 13 long years for Parliamentâs approach to prevail.
The text that has just been adopted addresses the exposure of workers to artificial radiation and excludes natural source radiation from the scope of the directive.
It was decided that, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, the latter is an issue that should be addressed at national level, depending on national conditions and needs.
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that it is unworkable for the EU to oblige employers in the 25 Member States to assess the health and safety risks to workers exposed to sunlight.
I feel that assessments of this nature should be carried out at national level, commensurate with the situation in each country.
Under this directive, employers must implement measures relating to choice of equipment, workplace design and length of time of exposure with a view to preventing or reducing their employeesâ risk of being exposed to artificial radiation.
Â Â  . This directive now more clearly applies to artificial radiation, and I welcome it back to Parliament and was pleased to vote for it.
It is unfortunate that the initial drafts of the legislation gave rise to so many silly stories about the EU attempting to regulate sunlight when the aims of the legislation - to protect European workers from harmful radiation - are so worthy.
I am glad that Parliament was able to make this legislation sensible by doing our job, and I am pleased to vote for it today.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to give an explanation of vote to clarify why we in the CDA Party have voted against the report.
We have done so because, whilst we are in favour of animal welfare, certainly in the poultry sector, it is unacceptable that we should not prescribe the same requirements for imports.
A second reason is that this report leads to more bureaucracy, while we in Europe need less of it.
We want less red tape, also because the impact of the introduction of this directive is only assessed after the event and not before.
That strikes us as cheap politics on the back of European poultry farmers, which is not what we want.
What we do want is improved welfare, provided this is established on the basis of a fair distribution of the burden between consumers and producers.
I would like Mrs McGuinness to be given another opportunity to speak on this subject.
Â Â  Mr President, I share the concerns of my colleague, Mr Maat.
I think this directive will force a race to the bottom.
It will force broiler production out of the European Union, outside our borders and we will not be in control of what is happening.
People will be none the wiser, because we do not have labelling.
Â Â  Mr President, I am in complete agreement with the previous two speakers.
It is true that whilst the extent of civilisation of a society is partly defined by the way in which people in that society treat animals, I am also convinced that farmers, in this case the chicken farmers in our countries, should certainly not be accused of cruelty or insensitivity towards those animals.
I would, above all, though, draw your attention to the fact that our European companies have to face unreasonable competition from meat imports from non-European countries, such as Brazil and Thailand, where totally different standards apply to such things as stocking densities, food safety, retracing, the use of animal meal and antibiotics.
The European broiler chicken farmers certainly do not want to return to an era where âanything goesâ, and are prepared to breed in an animal- and environmentally-friendly manner, provided that all the imported meat complies with the same standards, which, at present, is unfortunately not the case.
It is sad to say, but we are actually leaving our own European breeders high and dry.
Â Â  . Today in the votes on the report on 'Rules for the protection of chickens kept for meat production', I voted to maximise the protection of our poultry industry against the threats of cheap imports, which already has robbed Northern Ireland of a poultry factory in recent weeks.
It is understandable to be concerned about poultry welfare, but there is no sense in so hyping welfare requirements in the EU that we drive producers out of business and become dependent on imports from Far Eastern and South American countries where no enforceable welfare restraints apply to production.
That serves only to increase the number of poultry reared in appalling conditions.
Thus, we need to balance animal welfare requirements in the EU with ensuring a viable industry survives.
I therefore today in the votes in the Parliament opposed any further reduction in stocking density as such will inevitably severely affect the economics of broiler chicken production within Europe.
Â Â  . I registered an abstention on the final vote on the Berman report.
As a vegetarian, I have strong reservations about the whole meat production business.
If the business of rearing livestock for meat continues, and I accept that it will, then I very much believe it should be organic and natural.
Failing that, standards must be as high as possible.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this report.
Although we do not endorse all of its recommendations, we are broadly in favour of the thrust of its aims.
We believe it is necessary to strike a balance between the improvements that must be made to animal welfare, the rights and interests of small and medium-sized farmers and consumersâ rights.
We know that it is necessary to implement a system for assessing the welfare of all flocks in the slaughterhouse, but we also know that there are costs to be taken into account and that small operations do not usually have the conditions in place to carry out these assessments.
We therefore advocate an extended deadline to allow for a trial period and subsequent adaptation to a system that does not exist in Portugal.
We also feel that, as things stand, some of the proposals that have arisen in plenary have been excessive, and do not support them given the detrimental consequences that they may have for small producers, if there is no trial period.
Â Â  . This report is very timely, coinciding as it does with the first ever action plan on animal protection.
Again the EU is taking a lead in improving animal welfare standards.
The proposal addresses public concern that the current welfare standards for chickens kept for meat are too low.
The result is that broiler chickens suffer from leg disorders and lameness, enlargement of the heart, sudden death syndrome and ammonia burns.
The report calls for reduction in stocking density, minimum depth of litter, improved ventilation and a nesting period of at least six hours of uninterrupted darkness.
It also looks at the cruelty of beak trimming and only allows it when other measures to prevent cannibalism are exhausted.
I welcome the report, even if some of the above proposals fell.
I wanted it to go further but what is here is good for chickens and consumers.
Healthier birds produce a better quality product.
We are not exporting poor animal welfare provisions, rather raising standards for both poultry and people.
Â Â  We have, to the best of our ability, voted in favour of better animal husbandry.
A number of amendments to be voted on were, however, rather too detailed for elected political representatives to adopt positions on.
Detailed issues relating to periods of darkness, foot pad lesions and first-week mortality in connection with chickens kept for meat production are difficult for a layperson to decide about.
We should have welcomed being able, instead, to take decisions on general principles, with experts subsequently designing the more precise regulations.
What we have here is a consultation procedure for the European Parliament and not a codecision procedure, which might have enabled us to make a more principled statement on the matter.
We also wish to emphasise how important it is to make further progress in negotiations within the World Trade Organisation in order to achieve an across-the board consensus in favour of more stringent production requirements where food safety and animal protection are concerned.
Â Â  . I supported amendments, tabled by my own Group and others, which would have strengthened the proposal, in particular those which sought lower stocking densities, and highlighted the food safety implications of poor welfare conditions.
Although most of the stronger amendments failed, I voted for the report in the hope that the Commission proposal will lead to some progress in addressing significant welfare problems in the chicken meat sector.
Â Â  . I welcome this report and believe it is very timely due to the recently adopted results of the first ever Action Plan on Animal Protection.
The report shows that once again the EU is taking a leading role in actively improving animal welfare standards.
The proposal addresses a difficult issue of public concern as the current welfare standards for chickens kept for meat production are very low, leading to painful leg disorders and lameness, ascites (enlargement of the heart), sudden death syndrome and ammonium burns.
I welcome the Agriculture Committee's proposals but I believe the proposals did not go far enough.
It is for this reason that I supported the JÃžrgensen amendments and I am disappointed that they were not adopted by Parliament.
Â Â  . Is improving the welfare of chickens really a topic worthy of parliamentary debate?
Does it have a European dimension that justifies devoting 50 minutes of debate to poultry intended for meat production?
These are two questions that begin to answer themselves!
True, this is not the first time that the European Parliament has expressed its opinion on subjects unrelated to the concerns of the citizens.
Even so, I do not think there is any benefit for the European Parliament in adopting the slogan 'a meddling Europe'; on the contrary, I am convinced that there is every benefit in calling a halt to the regulatory frenzy.
This is particularly true in cases, like MrÂ Berman's report, when the pernickety rules proposed are utterly absurd: battery-reared chickens will have two health inspections a day, access to dry litter, and an ambient temperature no more than three degrees higher than that experienced by their alter egos living in the great outdoors!
Those are just a few examples among many equally grotesque proposals.
In conclusion, Europe has nothing to gain from this kind of legislation.
In fact, it runs the risk of getting its feathers torn out!
Â Â  I voted in favour of this very weak report because, in spite of everything, it entails improvements in most countries and is concerned with minimal legislation, which means that we are allowed to have more stringent rules.
Our amendments concerning reduced stocking density were extremely sensible compromises which received almost unanimous support in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
It is tragic that these were not adopted.
Parliament is supporting short-term interests instead of humane animal husbandry that consumers can rely on, and by acting in this way it is not doing the industry any favours.
I voted in favour of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Developmentâs proposal for a stocking density not exceeding 34Â kg by 2013 for the sole reason that it is better than the original proposal.
With quite a few of the countries represented on the Council wishing to exceed 38Â kg, it will be possible to invoke this proposal against the Council.
The European Parliament does, in any case, indicate a different direction that might be taken.
Chickens will continue to suffer more than any other animals.
How we treat our animals says a lot about how developed our civilisation is.
On this matter, we are shown to be barbarians.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report on the welfare of broiler chickens is long overdue.
It is time the EU took action to improve the wellbeing of broiler hens across the EU, many of which live in apalling circumstances during their short lives.
It is unfortunate that a number of my group's amendments to this report did not pass, though the report itself goes some way to raising standards and I was glad to support it.
Â Â  . It is well known that State aid is an important economic policy instrument that helps to revitalise economic, social, environmental and regional development.
The principle objective is to enable countries to take action to implement their strategic policies, to guarantee funding for public services and to compensate undertakings that promote so-called âservices of general interestâ.
With this report, which has a decidedly neoliberal slant, the majority in Parliament is seeking to restrict State aid to a âlast resortâ, on the basis of an ideologically biased drive to reduce the role of State intervention in the economy, in the name of the holy cow of the benevolent âmarket economyâ, and to prevent so-called âunfair competitionâ.
This is why we voted against.
The rapporteur supports the Commissionâs proposals for reform, which are aimed at giving greater prominence to competition over State aid, at providing incentives for reducing State aid and at restricting it to horizontal policies related to the Lisbon Strategy, such as issues concerning innovation and research and development.
Â Â  . For decades, State aid has been authorised or forbidden by the Commission purely according to the needs of the god of competition.
Although it is regrettable that it has taken until 2006 to consider taking account of common-sense criteria such as employment, innovation, growth, economic and social cohesion and so on, we must not reject this reorientation of the policy, because we cannot prevent its existence.
However, I am concerned about the fate reserved for services of general interest, in particular about the fact that they are not really protected from Brussels' ability to make a nuisance of itself.
The consequences of the liberalisation of network activities (postal services, rail transport, electricity and such like), which privatises the profits and nationalises the losses, should be a lesson to those who call on the Commission to legislate in this field.
I am also worried about the way in which respect for competition is given priority over all other criteria, which is characteristic of a policy that continues to favour its dogmas over the interests of Europeans.
Finally, I would like to emphasise that many activities, even emerging ones, would not need subsidies or aid if they had the benefit of a favourable, international fiscal and regulatory environmentÂ âÂ an environment that Brussels' policies are largely helping to destroy.
Â Â  Any analysis of State aid must be based on a clear idea of differences between income and costs relating, on the one hand, to private finances and, on the other, to public finances, that is to say an idea of the existence of external effects.
This report bypasses fundamental analysis and thus ends up with general conclusions that cannot be substantiated.
What is more, there are no serious attempts in the debate to assess external effects.
In spite of this, we have voted in favour of the report because, in general, it counsels against State aid.
Experience in general shows that State aid is too widely used for protectionist reasons.
Â Â  . The purpose of this report on reducing the overall level of State aid granted by the Member States is to channel the granting of aid towards the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
The rules governing state aid established by the EU and the attitude of the Member States need to undergo radical change if we are to meet this challenge.
The Commissionâs rules on regional aid are also being amended in line with the âless and better targeted state aidâ principle.
From my point of view, as a rapporteur, I wish to express my broad support for this EU initiative.
I was pleased to note that the Commission has incorporated into the reform of the new guidelines on national regional aid that the outermost regions will continue to be given least favoured region status, irrespective of their GNI.
As such, they may be compatible with the common market of aid earmarked for promoting the economic development of regions in which the standard of living is unusually low, and may also continue to enjoy operating aid.
Â Â  . State aid is presented as a means of rectifying market shortcomings, yet, as the rapporteur rightly points out, often leads to injustice and inefficiency.
Accordingly, we share the Commissionâs concern in this area, in line with the rapporteurâs position.
It would be both unrealistic and wrong to seek to put an immediate end to all State aid.
Yet the fact that this aid has been dwindling in recent years â and this has been very much according to the will of the EU â is a positive sign for those who believe that an economy that fully respects the rules on the smooth running of the market is one that offers the greatest benefits for consumers, producers and workers.
In other words, State aid is a model that ought gradually to be replaced by fairer and more efficient ways of fostering a genuine market.
Â Â  The Swedish Conservatives have today voted in favour of the report on the effects of globalisation on the internal market.
We agree with the assumption underlying the report that, as a result of globalisation, economic reforms will be required in order to maintain European competitiveness.
We are not, however, in favour of setting up a globalisation fund, because the consequences of globalisation are best dealt with by means of a dynamic market economy.
Â Â  .
To err is human; to persist, diabolical. That could apply to any of the many reports that Parliament dedicates to globalisation and its impact, bemoaning its negative effects but offering no definitive solution except giving Brussels, and Europe, more powers.
It has never questioned globalisation itself, or the way in which it has been imposed on us by Brussels.
That, though, is the real problem.
The European Union is sacrificing our jobs, our industries, our agriculture and our social protection systems on the altar of global free trade and the dogma of international competition; it does not protect our economies from unfair competition or social or monetary dumping, or from piracy and counterfeiting; it does not support our businesses when they are faced with multiple tariff and non-tariff barriers in the competing countries where they want to trade, or when they are faced with increased competition at home, because our economies are some of the most open in the world; it piles on the disabling standards and regulations.
The inescapable conclusion: Europe is the fall guy in the farce of globalisation, and the citizens of Europe are its main victims.
It is time for their interests to take precedence over the utopian pursuit of ultraliberal dogmas.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate MrsÂ Herczog on her important report on the effects of globalisation on the internal market, which has my full backing.
I especially welcome the reference to the need to create a healthy and supportive environment for small and medium-sized enterprises, and to strengthen their position and access to innovation and financing tools.
I also feel that the creation of an internal market in services is essential in order to increase the EUâs competitiveness.
Â Â  . I welcome this timely report on the challenges posed by globalisation to the internal market of the European Union.
This is an issue whose importance was emphasised on 27 October 2005 by the Heads of State and Government of the European Union at the UK Presidency's informal summit at Hampton Court.
As a member of the International Trade Committee I have been pressing for social and environmental concerns to be taken into account in an era of globalisation and against the background of the rise of China, India and Brazil.
This is not simple protectionism: my concerns arise from the need to ensure that liberalisation of the world economy, particularly through the multilateral trading system, should not lead to a lowering of employment and social standards or a race to the bottom.
Whilst I therefore supported amendments to increase preferential access to the EU market for those third countries which have ratified and appropriately applied core international labour and environmental standards as an added incentive, I believe that the Commission should work more closely with the ILO to investigate and inform itself of the observance and enforcement of these core standards in practice, so as to safeguard against future abuses of the new GSP+ system.
Â Â  . Globalisation offers fresh opportunities in terms of access to the worldâs markets, and yet many European citizens take a dim view of it, given the far-reaching effects on the European textiles industry of the restructuring and relocations currently taking place.
The EU must meet these challenges head on, without abandoning its historical and social values, which are reflected in the core characteristics of existing social protection systems.
At the same time, the EU must offer incentives to increase the competitiveness of European industry by developing a whole range of instruments, as referred to in the Lisbon Strategy.
With 1% or 2% increases, there is no room for manoeuvre.
Consequently, in order to complete the internal market, reforms of the economic side, especially those aspects relating to the market liberalisation, are all the more pressing.
Lastly, in terms of external policy, the EU must impress upon the future major world powers, such as China, India and Brazil, that the various development processes must take place on the basis of a balance between social and economic policy.
Â Â  . This report was an opportunity to take a view of what sort of impact globalisation has had on the internal market, but sadly this report has missed that opportunity.
My group was therefore unable to support it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I said this morning how shocking it was that we were trying to give the world lessons on human rights when the European Union cheerfully violates them, particularly when it comes to freedom of expression, on its own territory.
However, there are other reasons to oppose MrÂ Agnoletto's report.
It makes reference to ArticleÂ 60 of the Vienna Convention, in particular the non-execution clause that allows us to ignore the requirements of a treaty on the basis that the other party has not fulfilled its obligations.
The only problem with that is that the European Union is the sole arbiter of this circumstance, which seems to me to be a totally abusive interpretation.
We should at least have an arbitration system, otherwise this condition is, in reality, a potestative clause that enables us to escape from our obligations as we please or, conversely, to stick to them when it comes to powerful states from which there may be reprisals.
That is not acceptable.
Â Â  Mr President, the EU may well have made a great thing of respect for human rights and democracy â indeed, admission to the European Union is dependent upon them â but it has certainly failed in that respect where Turkey is concerned.
Not only is that country nowhere near finally acknowledging that the Armenian genocide actually happened, but it also threatens punitive sanctions against those journalists who voice any sort of criticism of it, and it also has to be said that there have been markedly retrograde developments on the freedom of opinion and of the press front since negotiations began.
The fact that, in 2004, 11% of applications for asylum by Turks were accepted, and that Turkey, in 2005, was the member state of the Council of Europe most frequently condemned by the European Court for Human Rights have to be seen in this light.
It follows that its record on observance of human rights cannot be a particularly good one.
Over and above that, the recent murder of a Catholic priest in Turkey â a crime motivated by politics and religion â shows that Turkey is either unable or unwilling to protect the minorities within it.
It will take more than the EURÂ 500 million pre-accession aid paid out this year to make Turkey top of the class on human rights.
Â Â  The report discusses the issue of the human rights clause included in agreements concluded by the European Union.
An example of such an agreement is the Cotonou Agreement, which the EU concluded with the countries in the ACP community.
The clause has existed for ten years, which is why the rapporteur now thinks it appropriate to evaluate it.
In the present situation, the European Parliament is not allowed to open talks if it believes that a country has breached the clause.
Among the proposals put forward by MrÂ Agnoletto is one to the effect that Parliament should be given the opportunity to begin talks of this type.
What is more, the rapporteur also wishes to see the European Parliament allowed to participate in the whole procedure where the clause is concerned.
It may be seen from the above that there is a desire to give Parliament increased powers, something to which we are opposed in principle.
We have therefore voted against the Agnoletto report in todayâs vote.
Â Â  .
Demanding that our economic and political partners respect human rights is an excellent sentiment, but the European institutions need to start by putting their own house in order, particularly given that Turkey is their next-door neighbour.

The discrimination suffered by the Christian minority, the suppression of information on the Armenian genocide, the occupation by the Turkish army of a third of the island of CyprusÂ âÂ none of these flagrant violations of the law have prevented European leaders, notably Messrs Chirac and Villepin in France, from opening Europe's doors to this Asiatic country.
Is the prospect of accession encouraging the Turkish authorities to share the values of our civilisation?
We doubt it.
The rise to power of the Islamist party, the AKP, in 2002 is threatening, in particular, the few rights previously granted to women.
Two facts illustrate this phenomenon: the violence used to suppress a peaceful demonstration by women last year, and the return of polygamy.
At a time when, even in our countries, Islamist organisations are challenging the freedom of the press, the European Union, in welcoming Turkey, would be reneging on the values on which it claims to base its foreign policy.
Â Â  After the partnership agreement between the ACP countries and the European Union, which was signed in Cotonou and amended in Luxembourg, the issue of having a human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements seemed to have been resolved.
Indeed, accepting the principle of protecting human rights was a great step forwards.
However, there still seem to be some gaps in the implementation of this principle.
It is not a simple issue.
It is complicated by the fact that, if we wanted to suspend a signed agreement because of violation of the human rights clause, we would have to avoid hurting the population of the offending country.
Alongside the human rights clauses, there are also analogous requirements regarding compliance with basic democratic standards and respect for minority rights.
I can mention the particular case of the negotiations with Croatia, during which I have never had the feeling that the European Union has been at all interested in or has protected the rights of the Italian minority or those of the Giulian-Dalmatian exiles, and it has even justified its attitude by saying that those are bilateral issues.
I must point out to the Commission, however, that protection for minority rights must be assured by more than just bilateral relations.
It is a fundamental right, especially as we are not dealing with a trade agreement here but an actual accession treaty.
This problem has not been solved even by this report.
Â Â  . The interest and concern displayed by the rapporteur on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements are worthy of commendation.
Ten years after it was first drafted, the time has now come to evaluate how it has been implemented and how it can be improved, and there is one aspect, to my mind, that our evaluation should make clear: the impact of this provision needs to be assessed.
I welcome the fact that the EU includes this clause and deems it one of the guiding principles of external and cooperation policy.
That being said, if this simply becomes a mantra repeated in all our agreements, and fails to make a genuine difference, especially when its terms are violated, it will of course be worthless.
The idle repetition of good intentions is a cause of mistakes and failures in international policy.
Â Â  . The rapid liberalisation of world trade, characterised by lax rules on work and the environment, poses a considerable challenge for the competitiveness of the European economy.
The EU cannot, and must not, compete with economies which are based on export subsidies, which fail to comply with basic environmental and social rules, and which violate human rights.
European integration is based on solidarity, respect for human rights, compliance with environmental and social rules, and sustainable development.
The values of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms lie at the heart of the European project.
The EU has succeeded in incorporating a âhuman rights and democracy clauseâ in international agreements with third countries.
I am deeply disappointed, however, that a clause as fundamental as this one remains absent from the agreements on textiles.
China is known to have systematically flouted the rules of the game since it joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001.
In this particular case, the EU would be well within its rights to impose minimum social and environmental rules in its forthcoming agreements with this partner.
If there is to be competition, it must be on a level playing field.
Â Â  . The report before us does not raise any objection to the Commissionâs proposal.
Rather, it accepts and supports all of the ideas put forward.
The move to maintain the Shetland Box and the Plaice Box is a timely and balanced response to the review of the functioning and effectiveness of these boxes and to the consultation carried out into this area.
The recommendations in this report will make it possible to defend the fundamental principles of the new common fisheries policy, namely to manage the exploitation of marine living resources in a sustainable manner whilst guaranteeing sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions.
I therefore support the adoption of this report.
Â Â  The June List is opposed to the EUâs common fisheries policy and wishes to see this policy area phased out in the long run.
We thus believe that the EU should not decide about whether the Shetland Box and the Plaice Box should be retained.
This issue can better be resolved by existing international bodies.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report, which had been substantially strengthened at committee stage through the adoption of all nine amendments I had tabled.
The overwhelming decision of the European Parliament to support an area of protected waters around the north of Scotland is very welcome indeed.
MEPs from around Europe have recognised the importance of these waters to Scotland's northern communities.
The Commission must now recognise that the principle of unrestricted access to waters is unsustainable.
Fishing rights must be allocated to the communities who depend on them.
That is now the political will of the European Parliament and no amount of lobbying by those who demand equal access to waters and resources should be allowed to undermine that.
Parliament's vote is a rare example of good news coming from Europe for Scotland's fishermen and I call upon the Council of Ministers, who will make the final decision, to follow our lead.
Â Â  . I welcome the report on the Shetland and Plaice Boxes.
I am delighted that the Commission decided to retain the Shetland Box and the Plaice Box and I welcome the fact that Parliament has backed this proposal; the three-year extension is good for conservation and good for Scottish fishing interests.
Â Â  . Mr President, I personally welcome our rapporteur on this important issue back to Strasbourg.
I was pleased to support the report, as the measures in it are important in ameliorating the disastrous effects of the common fisheries policy.
The CFP should be swept away; it has been a disaster for fishing communities, the fishing industry and indeed the fish themselves.
It does Europe no favours, as it clearly diminishes the EU in the eyes of our citizens to have such an unworkable policy.
Â Â  . One of the greatest challenges facing the countries of Europe is their energy policy and their ability to use renewable energy to reduce their dependence on petroleum and gas supplies and on the fluctuating price of these resources.
These renewable energy sources should take on a dominant role in the field of heating and cooling, which currently represents almost 70% of energy consumption in Europe.
We therefore support measures that could encourage the use of renewable energy: informing users, removing administrative barriers, providing implementation aid, encouraging research and so on.
However, we will be particularly vigilant in ensuring that the sovereignty of the Member States is respected with regard to energy supply, and on the taxation aspects of any proposals put forward.
We have not yet seen all the consequences of the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets on national energy balances.
And there is no question of giving the Commission, through fiscal proposals, additional powers over energy policy that it was not given by the treaties, but that it has already been able to appropriate by indirect means.
Â Â  . Mr President, this important report highlights an important potential for Europe.
My own country, Scotland, is potentially a world leader in renewable energy advantages, but because of domestic inaction we have not yet capitalised on this.
This report shows how the EU can help encourage growth in this vital future technology and I am pleased to support it, even though a few of the key recommendations were not passed by the house.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0409/2005) by Evelyne Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on services in the internal market (COM(2004)0002 C5-0069/2004 2004/0001(COD))
Parliament is fully aware of the importance of this debate.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Mr Bartenstein, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, today, we come to the final round of what is â next to the Constitution for Europe â the European Unionâs most important legislative project, and we have made no haste about getting here.
I could quite easily describe the efforts of the last few months, and the mountains of paper we have had to surmount, but the only thing is that it would take me hours to do so.
I will therefore limit myself to a few basic observations, which will not be to everyoneâs liking, but I have to say, Mr President, that they matter to me.
Services must be as freely mobile in Europa as goods and money, and so the Commissionâs production â after a long wait â of the draft services directive is an event to be welcomed.
It is however, regrettable that the impression has been given that this draft is intended to set the interest of the 15 âoldâ Member States against those of the ten ânewâ ones that joined us in May 2004.
The reason for my putting âoldâ and ânewâ in quotation marks is that all members of our community of states have the same rights and responsibilities irrespective of the length of time that they have belonged to it.
The European Union exists to promote the well-being of its 470 million citizens on a basis of equality; it does not exist to serve shareholder value or the interests of sabre-toothed liberalisers and their market mechanisms.
I see it as being of the utmost importance that what we do politically and in legislation should put people first and foremost.
Our primary concern must be with workers and their families rather than with big business and its markets, and we must also spare a thought for small businesses and artisans, who must not be allowed to be trampled underfoot.
It was for these reasons that this House needed to give the Commissionâs draft a thorough makeover, and we have made considerable progress despite the ideological dividing lines between us.
I am confident that the plenary vote will see us being able to take the final, crucial steps.
The end product must be a directive unencumbered by massive bureaucracy, one that benefits the workers on whom Europeâs ability to compete depends.
Such a directive must respect the idiosyncrasies of the Member States and obviate the danger of a downward spiral in working conditions and wages, in quality, and in the protection of consumers and the environment.
First of all, then, we must abandon the country-of-origin principle with all its devastating effects.
I have proposed a simple solution, according to which a business legally providing services in any one Member State would be allowed to offer those services in any other Member State as well, provided, that is, that the rules and laws of the country of destination would apply to the performance of the contract.
The simplicity of this reflects our experience of real life; for example, a German driving licence entitles me to drive in England, but I am not allowed to drive on the right there.
It is thus that the free movement of services is provided for and fair competition ensured.
My second proposal was that this freedom of movement be accorded only to marketable commercial services, with all other excluded from the scope of the directive.
In no way, for example, should Europe be obliged to accord freedom of movement to the modern version of slavery engaged in by temporary employment agencies.
