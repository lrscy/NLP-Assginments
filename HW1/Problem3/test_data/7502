The black box will change the culture of shipping.
It will not just be a tool whereby we can learn lessons from disasters and apply them in the future.
A ship with a black box is a safe ship.
Our common aim tonight is to make sure the Erika and disasters like it never occur again.
I do not believe that we will achieve that simply by adopting these reports tomorrow but we will have gone a long way to securing our goal to protect lives at sea and to protect the marine environment.
But we must remain vigilant.
Our duty now must be to make sure that the laws we pass tomorrow are implemented by everyone - the Commission, Member States and port state control authorities.
That is our duty and responsibility.
I hope we can live up to that.
Mr President, Commissioner, after the sinking of the oil tanker Erika on 12 December 1999, this Parliament and the Council requested a significant strengthening of the Community rules on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution.
The Commission responded quickly to these demands by presenting the three proposals known as the Erika I package, which we are still debating two years after that disaster, although we have finally reached agreements on each of them in Council, which are definitive in the case of the first two.
In the case of the modification of the Directive on the common rules and standards for organisations which classify, inspect and examine ships on behalf of the maritime administration, from the outset, the parliamentary amendments to Commission' s original proposal focussed, above all, on the practical aspects of the application of the classification system, on improving the transparency of the information relating to the quality of inspections, on the periodic auditing of those organisations and the withdrawal of their Community recognition in the event of serious accidents, as well as the financial liability of those organisations for damages and accidents where is has been proved that that there has been negligence in inspections.
After the Council' s adoption of its common position, we moved on to second parliamentary reading, where we insisted on issues relating to resolving the conflicts of interest which may arise between classification societies or organisations and the owners and/or charterers of ships, as well as on financial liability in cases of negligence or omission in judgements.
When the Council communicated that it could not accept all Parliament' s amendments, we moved on to the stage of conciliation between the representatives of the two Community institutions.
The discussion focussed firstly on the issue of the conflict of interests, where the Council finally accepted that a classification organisation must not be controlled by owners or builders of ships or by other persons or entities which are commercially involved in the construction, equipping, repair or operation of ships.
It also focussed on the idea that, at the point of requesting recognition, the classification society and its inspectors should commit themselves in writing, on an individual basis, to not accepting regulatory duties where there is a risk of a conflict of interests and, in particular, where those societies are the owners of the ship which is to be inspected, or have commercial, personal or family connections with those owners.
For its part, the parliamentary delegation, while considering that much of the work of the inspectors should be done by the maritime administration and that the latter should have subsidiary responsibility, accepted that it should not be obligatory for the Member States to establish a maximum limit for the financial liability of classification societies in the event of damages due to slight negligence in inspections, although in the event that those Member States wish to establish that maximum limit, that limit should not be less that EUR 2 million and EUR 4 million respectively, depending on whether the damage only affects material objects or also people.
However, the delegations of the two institutions considered that this issue should be examined within the framework of the evaluation report, which the Commission will present within three years, on the economic impact of the liability regime and, in particular, its consequences for the financial equilibrium of recognised organisations.
If necessary, the Commission will present, in the light of the said evaluation, a proposal for a modification of this directive which deals specifically with the principle of liability and the maximum limit for the financial contribution.
In conclusion, I believe that the European Parliament should be satisfied with the final result of the conciliation, since the majority of our amendments have been incorporated, either fully, in a revised form or in spirit, into the joint text, and we therefore propose that this latter text be approved by the House at third reading.
Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the relevant legal authorities to the fact that certain people harmed by the Erika accident are yet to receive any compensation for the damage suffered, despite the fact that two years have passed since this tragic event took place.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President and dear fellow-believers - I can call you that, because all of those sitting here are those who have moved this project forward over the years and who are committed to making ships safe.
Speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, I would like to observe - it being two years since the Erika disaster - that we may be a little late with the adoption of this legislative package, but we have not done at all badly in terms of keeping to the timetable if you consider the difficulties that have been involved.
Even then, two areas of the legislation have involved us having to go through a second reading and the conciliation procedure.
Today, we can see that, on the basis of the Commission's initial proposals submitted two years ago now after the tanker crashed, our joint efforts have brought progress, and I again wish to thank you, Commissioner de Palacio, for the committed support you and your colleagues gave us in the conciliation process.
By means both of these two results from the conciliation process and the common position, we have significantly increased not only the safety of ships, but also that of their crews, the environment and of people who live in coastal regions.
I believe that enhanced port state control, more stringent regulations for classification societies and the progressive introduction of double hull tankers mean that we really have moved ahead in preventing accidents like that of the Erika, or at least alleviating their consequences.
Commissioner, I would like to say this about port state control. I believe it was a good thing that, in the conciliation process, we - and especially Mark Watts - insisted on sorting out the 'black box' issue now.
You will see that the 'Erika II' package does not quite go that far.
I hope it soon will do, but you will be aware that it is still causing a few difficulties.
That being so, we were right to insist on the requirement for a 'black box' being incorporated into the 'Erika I' package.
My colleagues are aware that I am less happy about the result of the ship classification issue.
We may well not have an upper limit, but we do have an appeal clause.
I trust that the Commission will, after three years, produce a report submitting new proposals to us on how damage can be compensated for.
This affects shipping companies, shipping agents, and classification societies - how about a fair compromise on who should shoulder the damage?
We were, I think, very wise when it came to the common position on double hull tankers.
We should let the whole world know that.
We are always being accused of drafting European norms and disregarding worldwide conventions.
No!
We have accepted that the IMO sets the ground rules and have only made minor changes affecting implementation and time limits.
What we have insisted on as regards implementation looks quite harmless in comparison with what the Americans forced through!
I hope we will be able to adopt the second package next year.
So, Commissioner, bring some pressure to bear on the Council!
As far as the 'cope fund' compensation rule is concerned, we do not want to be kept waiting for the next five years.
I am relying on you to push for this.
rapporteur.
(EL) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, this report on the accelerated phasing-out of single hull tankers seemed at first to be an extremely complicated matter and we have been down a long hard road in order to reach today's result.
Nonetheless, I think that we have finally done so in a most satisfactory manner, which has gone beyond all our expectations.
On the one hand, we have managed to find an effective response to the concerns of the citizens of Europe, especially in France following the shipwreck of the Erika, as regards environmental protection.
At the same time, we have taken fundamental measures in maritime safety because, as all sides agree, double-hull tankers may not be a panacea but they are at least proven to be safer than single-hull tankers.
However, we also achieved another objective: the objective of protecting the competitiveness of the shipping industry.
We must not forget that this is a vital sector of our economy, a sector which employs tens of thousands of workers throughout Europe and one of our priorities must be to protect it.
We also achieved something else which I think I should highlight: we managed to find an international solution to a problem which goes beyond national borders.
We have before us a solution which has now been adopted by all the countries in the International Maritime Organisation.
I think that credit for this has to go to the European Commission, the Member States and the European Parliament because, thanks to our initiative, thanks to our - how shall I put it? - our threat that we would proceed unilaterally if the International Maritime Organisation failed to act, the International Maritime Organisation which, we must admit, has not always acted quite as fast as we would all like it to act, has pushed ahead and adopted a number of measures which mirror the initial proposals submitted by the Commission and the Member States.
So clear, efficient measures are being taken for all the classes of tanker which have concerned us and I am happy to say that today we have achieved something which did in fact appear to be beyond reach just a short time ago.
On the one hand, I think that people in France are relatively satisfied with the measures we are adopting and that every European with an environmental conscience is satisfied with the significant progress made while, on the other hand, industrial factors, people engaged in shipping, seamen and shipowners, feel that we have not gone too far and undermined the interests of this important sector of the economy.
So I should like to thank all the honourable members with whom we cooperated so efficiently that we now have this text before us and, of course, to thank and congratulate the Vice-President of the European Commission, Mrs de Palacio, for the way in which she has handled this issue and for her decisiveness and excellent disposition towards the European Parliament.
Mr President, I would like to join those who have spoken before me in expressing thanks to you, to the Commissioner, to your colleagues and also to our rapporteurs, for I do think it was a good thing that we, as Parliament and Commission, worked together so closely on this issue.
That today is, of all days, the anniversary of the sinking of the Erika, is not something that should fill us entirely with pride, for two years have passed before today's debate and tomorrow's vote.
Then it will take a bit longer for it all to be implemented.
It should be done more quickly next time!
The results are actually quite respectable.
We are getting the safe double hull tankers more quickly.
The old single hull tankers will be phased out with effect from 2003, and port state control will at last live up to its name.
Stricter controls mean for me that blacklists will be used rigorously and, in consequence, black sheep, or black ships, will no longer be welcome in European ports.
Classification societies for ship types will be subject to stricter conditions.
Although we know that the majority of these societies do sound work, they must no longer be permitted to be slipshod in what they do.
The Member States now have 18 months in which to transpose all this.
The legal framework is in place.
Yet laws that only exist on paper are, in the final analysis, ridiculous.
What use is port state control without controllers?
I therefore believe - and here we are putting our trust in you, Commissioner - that you will have to check very punctiliously how the Member States transpose the things we have just brought into being.
It will cost the Member States money, but safety at sea must be worth the expense.
So here are two more points.
One is something I have already mentioned.
Erika II must not be allowed to last as long as Erika I did. Accidents involving oil are one thing, but damage to people, nature, fisheries and tourism are something else, and result not only from accidents involving oil, but also from those involving chemicals and other hazardous substances.
So we should implement more quickly the proposals Parliament has made.
My final point is that enlargement of the EU is almost upon us, involving as it does two candidate states, Malta and Cyprus, which have cropped up in discussions again and again.
So I would again implore the Commissioner to apply the so-called acquis communautaire very stringently to these states too in the event of their becoming members of the EU, so that there may be no black sheep, only white ones.
I have said already that we have a saying to the effect that one is in the hand of God at sea and in court!
As far as the sea is concerned, we can give the Almighty a bit of a helping hand, so that everything will be safer, and that is what we should be doing with the Erika package.
Mr President, my colleagues, on behalf of my group I thank the rapporteurs for the preparation of their fine reports, and also for the good outcomes in conciliation.
These statutory proposals belonging to the "Erika I" package contain essential measures for the increasing of marine safety.
These matters have also made reasonably rapid progress, and in conciliation the essential changes to the texts demanded by Parliament have been incorporated.
In the case of the classification societies, the Community's authority needs to be increased with regard to the approval and control of these societies.
As the rapporteur stated, the classification society must not be under the authority of the owners or builders of the vessels, or of others engaged in commercial activity in the sector.
Inspections of vessels must also be increased.
Extended inspections must be directed specifically at vessels which represent a risk.
In the case of vessels on the "black list" which are associated with a high risk, the criteria for entry of the vessel to a port must be stricter.
In order that accidents can be prevented in advance as effectively as possible, we need an advance notification obligation for vessels and mandatory inspections of high-risk vessels.
The port control directive will improve the uniformity and effectiveness of the inspection procedure of port States.
It is appropriate that vessels be furnished with Voyage Data Recorders in future, and that access to EU ports can be denied to vessels which are clearly in a poor condition.
An accelerated phasing-in of double hull vessels must be managed in such a way as to avoid generating insurmountable problems with the scrapping of ships and the building of new ones.
At the same time, the flexibility of oil transportations must be safeguarded.
The safety of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution may be promoted by the flag States enforcing the currently valid conventions so as to make them obligatory.
Along with the further tightening of regulations, care must be taken that the decisions to be made are realistic and feasible.
One of the points of emphasis of the EU's White Paper on transport is the favouring of water traffic in transportation.
Because of its environmental friendliness, water traffic is indeed very suitable for heavy goods transportation.
In the event of accidents, however, water routes are highly vulnerable, and environmental damage recognises no borders.
For this reason, decisions made only within the Union are not sufficient; instead, questions of responsibility for marine safety must be dealt with on a worldwide basis.
We need international agreements which also involve (for example) Russia, whose vessels will in future be sailing more and more in the world's seas via the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should at any rate like to thank everyone, including the team behind the Commissioner, for example, for the quality and volume of work they have all done.
However, I regularly suffer nightmares.
When I wake up, I just hope and pray that another oil tanker has not run aground. I hope that will not be the case in the next three years either, for - everyone has already said it - it has been long enough, it is actually taking too long before we can lay down legislation, and we are only halfway.
Speeding up processes of this kind can do no harm at all.
A disaster such as the one involving the Erika is simply a real disaster, not only environmentally, but also economically and socially, and it can be entirely traced back to 80 000 ships, some ten percent of which, 8 000 ships, are absolutely sub-standard.
This is to a certain extent where the problem lies, or in large part at any rate.
Despite the fact that classification bureaux were involved and despite what has happened with, and is suggested about, double hulls, I should briefly like to focus on the port state control, for in the final analysis, what matters is that inspections should become effective.
Mr Piecyk, but also others, have already drawn attention to this.
Actually, we want 25% of inspections by way of a yardstick.
But what mainly matters is that these inspections are carried out by well-trained people, and that they are carried out in the first place.
We should, for example, call the French Transport Minister to account for the fact that his country scores exceptionally low in the percentage of inspections that are carried out.
Although we now have a perfect and itemised list, enforcement still appears to be a problem.
This is often the case when we draft legislation, but particularly so now.
I therefore intend to monitor annual surveys of the Paris memorandum of understanding and other matters in the next few months with the help of others, and check whether inspection of this kind is, in fact, on the increase.
I would also ask the Commissioner to ensure that we receive an annual overview, so that we can be active and pro-active to ensure that what we want to achieve actually happens.
Secondly, I would mainly call for a prompt completion of the Erika II, and for accelerating the process in the light of the tiresome pace on the part of industry with regard to separate funding and such like.
I would like to finish off with one point. Malta and Cyprus have been mentioned in connection with enlargement.
There are still two that, let us say, are on the waiting list, including Romania.
Romania is another country with an exceptionally bad track record on this black list, and I would call for extra attention to be paid to it.
Mr President, it is by sheer coincidence that today we are sadly commemorating the second anniversary of the sinking of the Erika oil tanker.
On the stormy night of 12 December 1999, this oil tanker, which was flying a Maltese flag, certified by an Italian classification society, manned by an Indian crew, insured by a company registered in the Bermudas, financed by a Scottish bank, chartered by a Shell company that sub-chartered it to a foreign subsidiary of the Total Group, which was transporting extremely polluting hydrocarbon belonging to another subsidiary of Total, sank off the French coast, thus polluting 400 kilometres of coastline and causing considerable damage estimated to cost more than FFR 5 billion.
So, what progress has been made, two years after this tragedy?
Hardly any of the victims have received compensation.
The IOPC Fund will only cover FFR 1.2 billion out of the FFR 5.5 billion of damages caused, and procedures are turning out to be lengthy, complicated and inefficient.
The remainder will be borne by the victims, the local authorities and the French Government, pursuant to the application, not of the polluter pays principle, but of the perverse principle dictating that the victim pays.
The various measures that we are currently debating in the three reports by Mr Watts, Mr Ortuondo Larrea and Mr Hatzidakis have taken too long.
Yes, we must strengthen State port controls, Mr Watts; yes, we must ensure the work of classification societies is more efficient, more reliable and more transparent, Mr Ortuondo Larrea; yes, Mr Hatzidakis, we must take concerted action at international level to phase out single hull oil tankers, whilst bearing in mind that double hull tankers cannot guarantee that ships will not sink or run aground.
But why will we have had to wait more than two years after the disaster for such basic measures to be taken in these three areas?
And, more importantly, there are two fundamental questions that remain unanswered, and it has also not yet been established whether it is appropriate to take these decisions at European level.
The first question relates to compensation.
All the victims must be fully compensated.
Today, however, there are considerable differences of opinion at European level.
Some people are in favour of setting up a specific European fund, whilst others prefer to increase the IOPC Fund.
The differences of opinion persist and we cannot move ahead with this issue, whereas the United States, on the other hand, has unilaterally set up a very efficient and comprehensive compensation system, which is effectively funded by consumers of oil products, which is perfectly logical and legitimate.
In Europe, Member States have different ideas about the risks of maritime pollution and it would therefore be perfectly legitimate for the countries that are at the forefront of this risk to take the necessary measures themselves.
I urge them to do so.
The second fundamental question that is yet to be resolved relates to the issue of responsibility.
We cannot allow events, such as that involving the Erika, to ever happen again, where the front company was based in a tax haven, the flag of convenience was sub-chartered, the sub-contractor was an off-shore subsidiary and no less than 11 different companies had an interest in the ship and its cargo, thus creating a real labyrinth, in which the real decision-makers and those bearing the actual responsibility could hide.
This situation is particularly hazardous.
The Member States that are most concerned must ensure, as a matter of urgency, that there is clarification and transparency in the area of responsibility. This must also be done at a global level, as, Mr President, only the threat of very heavy and very severe penalties will be enough to deter the potential polluters of the future.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am optimistic.
We are going down the right track as regards the safety of ships.
We have already clearly defined the first measures that may lead to substantial improvements in safety at sea. One considerable contribution to this is the introduction of the black box, with which we are familiar from aircraft, as well as of the double hull tanker.
Parliament has emphasised certain features - where necessary in the Conciliation Committee, as Mr Ortuondo Larrea mentioned.
Does this, though, also apply to the settlement of liabilities?
You are all familiar with the regular technical examination of private cars.
It is a similar position that the classification societies take with regard to safety at sea.
The extent of liability in the event of accidents at sea is based on inspectors' evaluations of the condition ships are in.
This brings us at once to the core of the discussion, for the issue of the classification societies' standard upper limits for liability, particularly in cases of minor negligence, needs to be resolved finally and coherently.
The decartelisation of the interests of the classification societies, the shipowners and the other actors means that we are now already achieving a high degree of transparency and independence for the inspectors.
Decartelisation of interests must not, though, be allowed to go so far that the actors are played off against each other and end up eventually outdoing each other.
The liability issue becomes of fundamental importance at this point.
It is in the final analysis the classification societies that occupy the most vulnerable position in the liability chain.
Their assessment is admittedly decisive in determining the extent of liability, but, for example, they have no police powers, so that they could not, for example, confine a ship to port if that were to prove necessary.
In the end, responsibility for the condition of the ship and for its handling remains with the owners.
The classification societies and the shipping companies must act jointly with the other parties involved in this, and we must create the conditions for this to happen.
There are at present different upper limits for liability in each Member State, but it would be fair to limit liability to one standard across the board.
In three years' time we will be re-examining this regulation on a varying upper limit.
The knowledge and experience we will have gained by then will influence our further action and leave their mark on it.
I see this as our task for the immediate future.
We want to end up with a balanced chain of liability and responsibility.
We need this binding regulation in order to enhance competition and limit risks, both indispensable to a functioning market and safety at sea.
It is true that we are subjecting the classification societies to tighter control, but, at the same time, we should make it possible for them to calculate their risks.
I consider this regulation to be a fair one, which takes all sides into account in an appropriate way.
Having chosen our road ahead, we must now go down it and pursue it to the end.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Conciliation Committee, I am delighted that we have achieved a positive result and can now press on and apply effective measures to protect our seas and our shipping industry.
We have taken a moderate line and brokered a series of realistic measures, seeing shipping not as an 'enemy' but as a friend who could do better, given that, may I remind you, shipping is only responsible for 12% of total maritime pollution.
So, ships which seriously endanger our seas will be denied entry to Community ports and voyage data recorders will be fitted to all ships, so that their course can be checked following an accident, God forbid.
Compulsory double hulls will be phased in and the rules governing ship survey and control organisations will be improved.
Clearly, the catalyst behind this successful outcome, or at least one part of it, was the International Maritime Organisation, which took the right stand thanks to the initiative taken by the Member States of the Union.
So now we need to concentrate on fast implementation, and here we are putting our faith in fast reaction on the part of the Commission, not forgetting that five Member States which, I may add, do not include Greece, have been charged by the Commission with not applying a previous, more lenient directive.
May I also remind you and highlight the fact that Greece, whose economy, as you know, is far more dependent on shipping than that of any of our partners, is leading the way and is at the vanguard in the fight for maritime safety and efforts to protect human life and the environment.
We must also give special thanks to everyone who helped to bring this endeavour to a successful conclusion, especially the Commissioner, and I trust that we shall not forget that the seas of Europe are not a separate entity from the other seas on our planet.
Mr President, Commissioner, today being the anniversary of the sinking of the Erika on 12 December 1999, my group and I are pleased to see that conciliation on three sets of proposals has been successful.
Concerning the Watts report, we are particularly pleased that the European Parliament' s delegation succeeded in making black boxes compulsory, which was not the easiest thing to do.
This means that, from now on, a ship will be detained if it is not fitted with a functioning VDR system.
With regard to Mr Ortuondo Larrea' s report, the question of the conflict of interests has been resolved in such a way that classification societies can no longer have any links with shipbuilders, shipowners, operators or charterers.
Likewise, there is the question of the limits of the financial liability of these companies with regard to the financial balance of recognised organisations.
There is also the problem that Mr Souchet mentioned of providing compensation payments from the IOPC Fund or from a European fund in a more efficient manner.
It is also a matter of urgency, as Mr Hatzidakis said, to settle, at third reading, the problem of single hull ships, mainly in view of the 2015 deadline, as maritime safety issues cannot wait any longer - it is already two years to the day since the sinking of the Erika.
Intermittent spills and substandard 'dustbin ships' , such as the one that recently sunk off the coast of Brest, are still all too topical and it is a test of the EU' s credibility to resolve this situation once and for all.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, following the Erika accident, the profound, and totally legitimate, concern of the European citizens and the urgent need to consolidate the Community legislation in the field of maritime safety became clear.
This concern led to the Commission' s proposals and I would therefore now like to congratulate the Commission and its Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, since we have all witnessed the tenacity with which she has personally dealt with these issues.
I also congratulate the rapporteurs on the wonderful work they have done, completing this package of measures.
Ladies and gentlemen, during my intervention in the May part-session, I said that we could be relatively satisfied with the way we have responded to the expectations of our citizens, in trying to approve these initiatives as quickly as possible - in inverted commas - by Community standards.
The Erika I package and future approval of the Erika II package will make it possible to create a genuine European area of maritime safety and must guarantee an optimum level of protection for the maritime environment and the European coastal regions.
Today I simply wish to repeat part of what I said then, since the circumstances have not changed.
This Parliament has shown its great interest throughout the negotiation process.
We must now continue to work in this direction and promote the measures which are yet to be approved.
We must not rest on our laurels and we must call on the Council so that progress can be made on the Erika II package and, in this respect, Commissioner, your role and your tenacity will be very important if we are to try to convince the Council once again, so that we may have the Erika II package more quickly.
Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate all of my fellow Members, who, in my view, have done some excellent work.
The European Parliament will have had a great influence on these documents.
I would also like to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Loyola de Palacio who, I believe, has worked as quickly as possible within the procedures laid down.
Mr Souchet thought that the progress made was slow.
I think that he is right.
On the other hand, we had reached the end of a parliamentary procedure, which is very difficult to cut down when we embark on conciliation.
I therefore believe that we have worked as quickly as possible and yet, it will take a total of three and a half years to draw up a text on Erika I after the law has been transposed by the national governments. All this leads me to make some comments on governance.
We discuss this elsewhere, outside the context of transport, and I think that these subjects require the codification of urgent parliamentary procedures that will allow us to proceed legally.
I think that this is a proposal which is expected from bodies such as ourselves or which could be drawn up by them.
We see that we have the same problem with the tunnels and the revision of the Seveso Directives.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think that we must spend time considering the urgent procedures which will be included in the Treaties.
I also think that we must ensure that these directives are transposed into national law.
We now have a body of texts and of maritime law without equal at European level, and also the Erika II package which is currently under discussion.
The Member States will no longer be able to play hide and seek with the European Commission, as they could at the beginning of the Erika I crisis. Furthermore, we have no guarantee - as President Prodi recently said - that the directives are being transposed into national law within the time allowed.
And, at the end of the day, if we can be satisfied that we have produced some good European legislation today, we still do not know whether all these measures will be implemented, and within what time scale. The victims of the oil spills and accidents have been waiting for these measures for a long time.
Lastly, I think that the controls do not give enough reassurance, and this is true of all the operating provisions.
These usually involve self-regulation at national level, and I think that, in terms of governance as well, and if we truly wish to move forward, we must ask ourselves the question of how we are to monitor the monitoring systems.
Mr President, the running aground of the oil tanker Erika triggered a large number of activities on the part of the Commission, which were truly welcome.
However, I stand by my earlier reflection that it is better to act before an accident occurs than to react after it.
Both the rapporteur and the Conciliation Committee have done an excellent job with regard to the Commission' s proposal to further improve various measures, and Parliament has improved the proposal even further.
We have now pushed through our view with regard to conflicts of interest.
We have, moreover, succeeded in getting the lower limit for classification societies' liability for damages to the level at which we always wanted it.
This must be seen as clear progress.
The report on port State control also looks significantly better now.
In conciliation, Parliament managed to push through the requirement for black boxes, which I believe is a particularly positive move.
The solution regarding the third issue of introducing double hulls or such like for single-hull oil tankers has also been considerably more positive than it long appeared would be the case.
In this case too, Parliament has had almost all its amendments included in the Council' s common position.
In summary, I would like to say that, on these issues, Parliament has clearly shown its capacity to act.
Each of the proposals alone would not have sufficed, but together they constitute a significant step in the right direction.
In a tangible way, we have taken developments in the right direction towards safer and better seafaring and a better marine environment.
Hopefully, this will ensure that accidents such as those involving the Erika or the Levoli Sun will not occur in the future.
Mr President, two days ago, we Finns received tragic news - the beautiful beaches around Runsala near Turku had been affected by an oil slick from an unknown source.
Unfortunately, the proposals being debated today will not help in this type of case.
This is a classic example of a discharge from an unknown source, and despite the restructuring of port and pilotage fees which we have adopted at EU level, these small discharges have increased in the Baltic Sea.
The risk of being prosecuted is also very small.
At the same time, we are now, unfortunately, seeing the opening of the port in Primorsk.
This port has severely icy conditions, and we know that the package which we are approving today may not perhaps lead to vessels having double hulls until 2017.
However, double hulls are no help now, as the ice has already formed in Primorsk port.
Only through compulsory pilotage, effective strengthening of the hull against ice, efficient traffic monitoring and good teamwork between the rescue services can we do anything for this port and this unique part of the world.
I would ask you, Commissioner, in your continued contacts with Russia, to focus attention on the safety of traffic to Primorsk.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sinking of the Erika reminded the world of the general risks involved in the sea transport of certain types of pollutants, especially oil and oil-based products.
It also highlighted the inadequacy of safety controls and the lack of transparency in sea transport practices, as well as the profound discontent of the populations affected, owing to the slowness of compensation.
As the rapporteur, Mr Ortuondo, has quite rightly pointed out, the victims of this accident have yet to receive their money.
It was also a test of the European Union' s capacity to react quickly and to offer its citizens a suitable response to their concerns.
I must say that, despite the fact that all has not gone perfectly, that perhaps we could have adopted it on first reading - as I would have liked -, that perhaps both Parliament and the Council could have shown greater flexibility, the reality is that, despite everything, within one and a half years of the Commission presenting its initiative, today, two years after the accident, we are finally approving the Erika I package.
In this respect, we must remember that there was a serious disaster off the same coast ten years ago and initiatives were presented by the Commission, but they did not overcome the hurdle of the Council.
I would therefore like to point out that the considerable success of approving this Erika I package today would certainly not have been achieved had it not been for the insistence and firmness of this Parliament, which has maintained systematic pressure on the Council throughout the negotiation process.
I would like to expressly thank Mr Watts, Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Ortuondo Larrea for their work and tenacity over these two years.
Their determination, which I welcome, has allowed us to persuade the Council to approve texts which initially enjoyed only a very small majority yet have been able, at the end of the day, to overcome any reservations.
We have considerably strengthened the European Union' s legislative arsenal.
Furthermore, the texts approved will have significant specific consequences, whose effects will be immediately noticeable.
The Member States must recruit a large number of inspectors in order to deal with greater obligations in controlling ships in ports.
Furthermore, shipowners, charterers, flag States and classification societies who are complacent or negligent in their operation or monitoring of ships will henceforth be liable to severe penalties such as the prohibition of ships not meeting minimum requirements from entering European ports, the publication of the names of negligent charterers or the withdrawal of the authorisation of classification societies in the event of poor performance.
Finally, I believe it is important to highlight another point of fundamental importance: Europe has once and for all made its mark as an indispensable partner in the international arena in the field of safety and all aspects relating to the maritime sector.
In this regard, on the delicate issue of double hull ships, the States of the Union have not only reached an agreement so that, from 2015, no single hull oil tanker will be able to stop in any Community port, but also, and above all, the Union has persuaded the International Maritime Organisation to approve these requirements for all the oil tankers in the world.
I believe it is also important to point out that the Erika II package which completes the whole initiative has made considerable progress recently.
Last Friday the Transport Council approved a common position, pending final and formal approval next week, with regard to the Community system for monitoring traffic and the European Maritime Safety Agency.
With regard to the proposed regulation on the Community fund for compensating damages resulting from accidental pollution, it is true that we are once again waiting for things to move ahead within the International Maritime Organisation.
But I would like to say that it is already a great success that the Community initiative has led the current international debate - specifically within the IMO - towards the creation of an international fund which takes up the principles of the Commission' s proposal.
Of course, we must ensure that the final result in the IMO conforms to our demands and ambitions.
We are working on this and, just as we have ensured that things move ahead in the Union - thanks to Mr Watts' insistence - in relation to black boxes, we also hope that the same will happen on this issue within the IMO.
I would like to clarify certain matters.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say publicly that Malta and Cyprus are making a considerable effort to update their ship' s registers and to exclude and expel those that do not conform to the requirements of the Union.
I would like to end my speech by thanking Parliament and the three rapporteurs, who have worked brilliantly, for their support to the Commission.
I would also like to ask them to cooperate with the other parliamentarians so that the Erika II package may pass through this House as soon as possible and that it may enter into force without delay.
I would also like to publicly thank the services of the Commission, whose efforts have been wonderful.
For your information, I am going to give you a piece of information on the subject of governance: the services relating to the maritime sector in the Directorate-General for Transport - including secretaries - comprise no more than 40 people, and they are the human team behind all these initiatives, as well as a series of other tasks and functions relating to the maritime, port and other sectors.
This may give you an idea of the workload and the efforts made throughout this time.
This time the European Union has demonstrated that we have taken the fight against marine pollution seriously.
I would like to end by saying that, two years after the Erika tragedy, the satisfaction and success represented by the approval of the Erika I package today really must be a homage to all the citizens whose lives have been affected as a result of the sinking of the Erika two years ago. It must be a homage to all Europeans, who, over recent years, have seen the systematic repetition of huge disasters involving pollutants without any suitable or tangible measures, with sufficient rigour and sufficient demands, being taken, and also those of us who are genuine lovers of the sea and of the environment, who are thinking not just of today but of future generations.
Thank you very much to all of you for your cooperation.
Thank you so much, Commissioner, for your important statement.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Cross-border provision of occupational pensions
The next item is the report (A5-0388/2001) by Mrs van den Burg, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on the elimination of tax obstacles to the cross-border provision of occupational pensions (COM(2001) 214 - C5-0533/2001 - 2001/2212(COS)).
It is a pleasure for me to present here today a virtually unanimous draft opinion of the European Parliament on two often very controversial topics: tax policy and pensions.
This illustrates the urgency of this dossier.
Two aspects that are very topical at the moment in the European Union are the ageing population and labour mobility. It also illustrates that the report is broad-based.
I was appointed rapporteur for this topic more than a year ago.
The Commission notification had not been published at the time.
We were waiting for a directive proposal and were initially very critical because you, Commissioner Bolkestein, presented nothing but a notification.
Moreover, it took a very long time, until April of this year, before it was published.
As it happens, we as Parliament are now late ourselves with the plenary discussion of my report, also late in the day, but that is purely for reasons of scheduling.
Meanwhile, the report has already had its effect in part.
The ECOFIN Council of 16 October decided to take a pro-active approach based on my recommendations. This has culminated in the automatic exchange of data and support in the collection thereof.
The first success has therefore been achieved.
It is, in fact, rather apt for the report not to feature on the agenda until now.
Indeed, it can enjoy the benefits of being discussed immediately prior to the Laeken Summit, to take place next Friday and Saturday.
For this Summit also has the topic of pensions on the agenda.
A joint report is scheduled for this Summit which has recently been adopted in the Social Council and the ECOFIN Council by order of the European Councils of Stockholm and Gothenburg and which concerns the social quality, the modernisation and financial sustainability of pensions.
The Ministers have committed to starting a process of open coordination; Member States will be presenting reports before September of next year, and at the spring summit in 2003, more detailed policy on this subject matter will be outlined in the European Union.
As you can see, in my report on the fiscal treatment of pensions, I too have called for the introduction of open coordination process of this kind.
The fiscal policy of Member States is closely intertwined with Member State policy on the content and qualitative aspects of pension schemes.
Indeed, the fiscal incentive to accumulating a pension and fiscal levies on pension payments are conditioned by requirements based on the view of Member States of what a sound pension scheme is, and the conclusion in my report is not by any means that we should simply put these requirements to one side to make way for opening the pensions market within the European Union, as some may be inclined to do.
No, I would clearly draw a distinction between two different situations. The first situation concerns migrant workers who are allowed to take their pension schemes with them to another Member State on the basis of earlier directives.
The Member State is to give these schemes the same fiscal treatment unconditionally, and the Commission is to be active in bringing matters before the European Court, and that receives my full support.
The alternative situation is that all workers, including those who simply remain in their own countries to live and work, should be eligible for tax deductions in respect of contributions to a foreign pension scheme.
This should not be unlimited in my view.
In this case, the national requirements and conditions still apply for now.
However, precisely in order to grow towards an integrated pensions market, I would call for this process of open coordination.
Since the criteria for fiscal incentives have everything to do with these quality requirements in terms of content, it seems right to link this process with what is about to be launched in Laeken.
I would therefore like to give this thought to Mr Bolkestein and the Belgian Presidency to take with them to this Summit in Laeken.
As far as I am concerned, you can also plug into the time schedule that was chosen there and take the 2003 spring summit as a point of reference instead of that of Barcelona, because the topic will not feature on the agenda there.
Finally, I think I can make a brief reference to the recommendations of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment and the Committee on Petitions.
I would also like to thank the rapporteurs in these committees for their contributions, and I hope that this report can help stem the flow of complaints and petitions, to which the Committee on Petitions, in fact, makes explicit reference, for that is, after all, the reason why we do all this, of course, namely the EU citizens who look forward to a truly border-free and obstacle-free Europe in terms of the movement of capital and labour, and in terms of encouraging the effective accumulation of pensions and fair taxation at retirement age.
I should like to thank the rapporteur warmly, not only in general, but also because she has indeed adopted significant sections of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Member States apply different fiscal systems to occupational pensions in terms of taxation or tax exemption from contributions, investment income and capital gains of the pension institution and from pension payments.
Eleven Member States use the EET system, three Member States an ETT system and two Member States a TEE system.
If you read these abbreviations out in Dutch, it seems as if eleven Member States are constantly eating, two Member States are drinking tea non-stop, while three Member States are served a strange kind of intermediate course, and I have to say that, in my view, this strange intermediate course is sometimes rather underrated in the discussion.
In my opinion, this is actually the most negative of the systems we have in Europe, because the tax office eats into it during the accumulation of a pension. This is, in fact, a true form of eating, and is possibly underestimated.
People are too fixated on the differences between the two other systems.
These differences in fiscal treatment may well lead to problems in labour mobility and mobility for the retired.
Indeed, these differences could lead to the double taxation of migrant workers.
Conversely, these differences could also lead to no taxation at all.
Let it be clear that this contravenes the philosophy of the internal market.
In addition, this situation adversely affects the flexibility of the labour market and undermines an important condition for the success of the monetary union.
Something will therefore be done about this situation, and that is why we are also pleased with the communication.
The rapporteur is right in noting that, due to unanimity requirements for decisions where taxation is concerned, we wait forever before anything changes.
I would therefore urge the Commission to do something via the Court of Justice, so that Member States are forced to adapt to the realities of the internal market in one way or another and will no longer discriminate against those entitled to pensions.
Mr President, I really regret that the representatives of the presidency are not present as we discuss this very important issue.
Our ageing European society calls for clear strategies to ensure the adequacy of pension systems.
Several measures, such as increasing the retirement age of an ever healthier population and thus increasing the size of the active workforce, are a crucial step in improving the ratio between the active working population and retired persons.
But it is evident that other measures have to be implemented as well.
The importance of occupational pensions schemes will rise in many Member States.
The European citizen would benefit from single market occupational pension schemes.
The variety of occupational pension schemes and providers would be improved.
The citizen and his employer could thus choose the most successful and best suited scheme, bringing the best interest rates, while offering full security of investment.
More and more Europeans work for relatively short periods of time in another Member State.
They are still disadvantaged when it comes to their occupational pension schemes.
Tax obstacles stand in the way of a fully functioning single market.
The Commission communication sets a strategy to resolve these obstacles that are a clear disincentive to individuals who wish to contribute to pension schemes outside their home Member States, as well as pension institutions that wish to provide pensions across borders.
I welcome the Commission communication as a first step towards a solution of this issue.
Like Mr Pronk, I wholeheartedly support the so-called EET model, as outlined in the Commission communication and in our committee's report.
The EET model means that pension inputs are exempted from taxation. The pension scheme as well would be exempt and only the output would be taxed.
This system serves to defer taxation to the moment the pension becomes payable, thus avoiding double taxation without the need to harmonise the level of taxation and without thus interfering in the Member States' taxation practice.
Tax issues are in the hands of the Member States.
Like our rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, who has done an excellent job with this report, I also wholeheartedly support the method of open coordination.
It is the only way we can achieve the results which our fellow European citizens need.
I strongly urge the Member States to work quickly to achieve the necessary results for the benefit of our ageing population.
Although we in the European Parliament may for the time being unfortunately not have the legislative means to decide on these issues, I can assure you that we follow them very closely and will do our best to achieve a common market for occupational pension schemes.
Mr President, I am speaking this evening as much in my capacity as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions as in my capacity as a Finn with Swedish as my mother tongue and a representative of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
I am grateful that the rapporteur referred to the opinion of the Committee on Petitions and the fact that we have taken the problems of citizens seriously.
I would like to point to the statistics published in the opinion, from which it may be noted that over 500 petitions in the past decade related to this issue, almost 100 during this term of office, and that 14 of these relate to the situation between Finland and Sweden.
The large proportion of petitions on precisely this issue of the situation between Finland and Sweden is a natural expression of the fact that a free labour market has existed among the Nordic countries since the 1950s and that the Finns who moved to Sweden at that time are now considering moving back.
According to one set of figures, several thousand of these people are living in the town of Haparanda, on the border with Finland, as they cannot afford to return to Finland.
This situation shows the problems we shall face.
The problem is so topical that it was highlighted by Professor Edward Andersson in a message in one of a collection of papers in honour of the sixtieth birthday of the Finnish Judge of the Court of Justice of the EC, Leif SevÃ³n, as well as in the communication from the Commission.
One of the problems on which still further light could be shed is that we in Europe apply such different variants of double taxation agreements within the framework of the OECD.
The different variants of agreements in this area are a problem which I believe should also be covered by the open method of coordination.
It is fascinating that this issue has been taken up by the Commission.
I congratulate you.
When a similar enquiry was conducted in the Nordic countries, former Minister for Nordic Cooperation Ole Norrback stated that the authorities did not believe that there was a problem in this area, although citizens thought that there was.
He also found that he had learned more during the enquiry than he had in his eight years as a minister.
I therefore hope that quite a few of the measures proposed by the rapporteur will be implemented, for example access to better information on the rules which actually apply.
I offer my wholehearted support for any courageous action on the part of the Commission, i.e. also taking cases to court when interpretation is at issue, in order to establish correct interpretations with regard both to taxation and to other similar charges with which we have problems.
I also believe two of the problems to be the crediting of tax allowances and the level of tax deducted at source.
It is particularly important that we work together to ensure that citizens have good access to information in this area.
The 'Swiss Life' sentiment, where pensions are concerned, awakens a feeling of unease in me, typified by the call for a wrong kind of solidarity and a lack of cooperation between the Member States.
The fact that there are Member States where workers accumulate pensions for themselves during their working lives requires full respect for acquired rights, and Member States where the citizens do not accumulate their own pension schemes, should therefore provide for adequate legislation in the short term in order to be able to face the anticipated problems caused by an ageing population.
The call for solidarity between generations with regard to pensions should in the first instance be accommodated in the Member States themselves.
International labour mobility should not be hampered by the different ways in which pension schemes are taxed fiscally.
It is the task of the Member States to remove the existing fiscal obstructions in the short term based on proper consultation, and to better attune the different pension schemes.
And cooperation among these Member States does not benefit from serving self-interest but from putting the interest of the citizen first.
If the European Union wants to create an internal market for its citizens in a credible manner, cooperation among Member States will need to lead to the harmonisation of fiscal measures with regard to pensions.
The EET scheme, in which premium contributions are not taxed but in which the payments are taxed, can then offer a direction for the mutual harmonisation of the fiscal rules concerning pensions.
We therefore endorse the line adopted by the Commission and the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, to reach an internal market in which the structure, management and payments of cross-border occupational pensions are no longer hampered by fiscal measures.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen and our rapporteurs, I would just like to start by warmly thanking our rapporteurs, above all Mrs van den Burg, but also Mrs Kauppi, for their cooperation on this report and also for the help they gave me with the report on cross-border provision of occupational pensions.
Today's report on taxation expands and continues the report for which the codecision procedure was negotiated as long ago as July this year.
All of us take the view that occupational pensions - among other areas - will require greater fiscal coordination.
We propose the EET system of deferred taxation, on the grounds that it is already a reality in the great majority of Member States.
If we do not achieve this fiscal coordination, we will have distortions of competition within the financial internal market through differing tax systems, which we do not want to have within a single market of which we want to make the best possible use, including in connection with the introduction of euro notes and coins.
Amendment No 1, proposed by Mrs Kauppi, expressly demands that the Council should make speedy progress towards a proposal for a directive on the activities of institutions providing occupational pensions, which would ensure mutual recognition of occupational pension systems and make a significant contribution to efforts towards effective tax coordination.
It is regrettable that this amendment should be needed at all, as the ECOFIN council, like the European Council meetings at Lisbon, Feira, Stockholm and wherever else, determines priorities and, despite that, has managed nothing more that the sending-out of a questionnaire.
I wish therefore to ask the Council why it stresses the urgency of this, whilst its actions do not reflect that urgency.
What are the Council's problems with last October's proposal from the Commission?
What does the Council have to say in response to the van den Burg report and to Parliament's resolution of July?
With which individual demands is the Council having difficulty?
We want answers. We want them because we want to carry on negotiating in order to be able at last to achieve the aims of the action plan on financial services and implement Parliament's requirements - for the benefit of citizens and of enterprises and in the spirit of the common objectives that are so often invoked.
Mr President, I should first of all like to take the opportunity, on behalf of the European Commission, of responding to what Mrs van den Burg and her fellow MEPs have put forward here this evening.
Allow me to start by thanking Parliament for the unanimous support it has given via the van den Burg report to the Commission communication on the fiscal treatment of pensions.
I have used the word 'unanimous support' , as was also borne out this evening, not only from the words by the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, but also from the words by Mrs Thors, Mrs Kauppi, Mr Blokland, Mr Pronk and others.
This is especially gratifying since this is a very important topic.
There are three points which I should like to elucidate further, and these points are firstly, the subject of the open coordination, secondly, the pan-European funds and thirdly, the developments in the legal field.
The resolution is asking us to develop a process of open coordination, and I would like to say that, in principle, the Commission is in favour of more coordination in tax matters.
An example of this is the working party which is being chaired by the British Minister, Mrs Primarollo. This working party is looking into the harmful tax competition, with very active involvement by the Commission.
However, I should like to say to Mrs van den Burg that there is a subtle, yet important, difference between open coordination and coordination.
In principle, open coordination is applied to areas of policy which fall within the national scope.
However, the resolution mentions the need, inter alia, for tackling double taxation and double non-taxation, and this means, by definition, that there is a cross-border element that, by definition, is one of the aspects of the internal market.
There is, therefore, probably little scope for a formal process of open coordination which, as already mentioned, relates to topics which fall within the decision-making remit of the national states.
And this is not the case here.
Having said this, the ECOFIN Council of 16 October expressly approved the Commission proposal to take measures in order to tackle double taxation and double non-taxation.
There is therefore very much a certain degree of coordination whereby the Commission retains the right, of course, to present further initiatives.
The second point concerned the pan-European pension funds, also mentioned by Mrs van den Burg and by Mr Pronk, I believe.
In this field, the ECOFIN Council of 16 October did not subscribe to the proposal for pan-European funds.
This does not mean in any way that the proposal has lost the Commission' s sympathy.
On the other hand, I am perhaps slightly less enthusiastic about the suggestion made in the report and mentioned a moment ago by Mrs van den Burg, namely that the Commission would prepare a proposal for a statute of international pension funds.
As I said just now, the ECOFIN Council was unable to endorse the proposal for pan-European funds, although these could function without new European legislation.
Under these circumstances, I have strong doubts at to the proposal' s political chances of introducing pan-European funds by means of legislation.
Thirdly and finally, I should like to say a few words about the legal aspects.
Last week, 6 December, the Court of Justice heard the Danner case, and this concerns, as I believe the Members are aware, a German citizen who emigrated to Finland and who wanted to continue with his German pension scheme, but unfortunately, the Finnish tax authorities refuse to grant him tax deductions on the contributions already made to the German scheme.
During the hearing, the Commission supported Mr Danner and made reference to its communication on pensions.
The verdict in this case can be expected next year.
Last month, a second case came to light. A Swedish court referred a case concerning the deductibility of contributions paid to a foreign pension insurance company by a permanent resident of Sweden to the Court of Justice, and this means that the correctness of the Commission' s legal analysis will be tested twice in the near future.
Mr Pronk also emphasised that the Commission should keep its promise that it will take action against Member States that infringe the Treaty freedoms, and I should like to assure Mr Pronk, as well as other Members who have mentioned this, that the Commission is in active dialogue with the Member States.
The Commission has formally asked the Member States for information about their national rules, and is currently looking into the responses it has received, and I can assure the Members of this Parliament that the Commission will start proceedings against Member States, where necessary.
As the Commission has indicated in its communication on tax policy of May of this year, a pro-active strategy for infringement procedures forms an important component of its approach aimed at making headway in the field of taxation.
In a nutshell, with the help of this Parliament and also of the Council, a certain dynamic seems to have come about in the field of tax exemption for pensions.
I should like to say by way of conclusion: let us try to hold on to this cooperation, and in that framework, I gladly accept Mrs van den Burg' s offer of further consultation.
Once again, I should like to extend warm thanks to Members for their excellent work and for the support for the Commission, and finally, I could perhaps say to Mr Karas that the Commission too is saddened by the fact that so little progress has been made on the work on the directive proposed by the Commission on pension funds.
Precious little has happened in this area over the past six months under the presidency that is about to come to an end.
A circular letter, a questionnaire, has been distributed to the Member States.
These questions have been received. Of course, work has been done on them, but that is all, really.
I gather that the Spanish Presidency certainly intends to work on this with greater drive.
Mr Karas, and the Members too, I believe, will agree with the Commission that such progress is extremely crucial and urgent on account of the demographic time bomb on which we are sitting, and I do not need to go into this topic any further.
Everyone is familiar with it.
Mr President, in this matter of the fiscal treatment of pensions, I should once again like to thank your Parliament and all the speakers for their support they have given the Commission proposal, and I hope that we will be able to continue in the manner indicated as soon as possible.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Financial collateral arrangements
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0417/2001) by Mr PÃ©rez Royo, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on financial collateral arrangements (COM(2001) 168 - C5-0131/2001 - 2001/0086(COD)).
Mr President, the Commission' s proposal on financial collateral arrangements establishes the European legislative framework for this type of arrangement and is an essential proposal in terms of the functioning of the financial market on a European level.
This proposal is an essential element of the package of legislative proposals intended for this purpose.
The main objectives of the proposal, in a very summarised form, are to guarantee the existence of efficient and reasonably simple systems for the creation of collateral under either title transfer (including repo) or pledge structures.
To this end, it is necessary to introduce certain modifications into the legislations of various Member States, especially in the field of the regulation of pledges and also in the field of insolvency law and tendering procedures.
In summary, it is a question of creating a sound and efficient regime for limiting credit risk and thereby ensuring a reduction in its cost and, at the same time, improving the functioning and stability of the European financial markets.
From the European Parliament' s point of view, the main problem raised by the proposal was that of the subjective scope of application of the Directive.
The initial proposal consisted basically of reducing the scope of the Directive to financial institutions and to very large companies other than financial companies, that is, large commercial, industrial or service companies, whose capital base exceeds EUR 100 million or whose gross assets exceed EUR 1000 million.
The European Parliament, or at least the rapporteur, considered that this proposal raised two problems.
Firstly, the removal from the scope of the Directive, and consequently from its benefits, of the majority of companies which are not strictly financial; not only small and medium ones, but also large companies which do not reach those very high quantitative thresholds which I have mentioned.
Secondly, the setting of quantitative thresholds raises the problem of their revision and updating.
The proposed directive resolved this problem by means of the technique of delegating this updating within the Commission, assisted by the Securities Committee, the so-called 'Lamfalussy Committee' .
This is a legislative delegation, a delegation of powers which is unacceptable to Parliament, or at least to part of it, as is well known, since this is not the first time we have dealt with the Lamfalussy Committee, in this field and in others, with Commissioner Bolkestein himself.
The amendment which Parliament intends to introduce in this field consists, essentially, of the following: removing the reference to quantitative limits and, instead, establishing the requirement that, in these cases of agreements with commercial or industrial companies, the other party to the agreement, normally the taker of the collateral of the creditor, should be a financial entity.
This solution has the advantage of resolving, at the same time, the two problems I mentioned, that is, the problem of the exclusion of not very large companies and the problem of the delegation of powers - or of the Lamfalussy Committee, shall we say.
Apart from this amendment, which in turn takes the form of several amendments, there are others relating to the formalisation of agreements and evidence of the provision of collateral, the regulation of the right of use for pledge collateral and to other issues which I will not expand on.
Mr President, I must end by pointing out - and this is very important - that, from the outset, I have tried to work in close contact with the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency, whose help, in both cases, I am very grateful for at this time.
The purpose was to achieve a consensus which would make it possible to approve the proposed directive on first reading or at least to reduce the second reading to a mere formality.
We based our approach on this intention, since most of the actors, both the Member States and the actors within industry, agreed on its importance and on a basic consensus, except on certain points, in relation to this proposal.
It appeared that this objective had been achieved, since it appeared that the Council' s working group had reached an agreement which also satisfied Parliament' s essential intentions.
At the last moment the initial agreement in the Council' s working group has been broken and tomorrow, possibly, in Ecofin a different agreement will be approved, which includes other points which Parliament has not been able to consider in detail.
I therefore fear that the aim I referred to earlier of dispensing with the second reading, or at least reducing it to a mere formality, will not be possible, and we will have to continue working on this directive from next month.
In this event, for tomorrow' s vote, I would ask you to vote for the amendments which were approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with slight modifications and to vote against an amendment which has been introduced in Parliament at the last moment, since the lack of consensus in the Council, that is to say, between the Member States, has also led to a rupture in the consensus which had been expressed in this Parliament' s Committee on Economic Affairs.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please permit me to start by making an observation. We have here another example of how lawmaking in this House is normally dealt with just before midnight, whilst we have during the day been largely occupied with more or less pointless resolutions on one summit or another, which are generally fruitless.
I see it as desirable that we should in future deal with important legislative matters at a more appropriate time in the course of the part-session.
Apart from that, I would also like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee for his very balanced report, which one can also call a proposal by the Commission and a consequence of the directive on settlement finality that was adopted in 1998.
At that time, I was on the Legal Affairs Committee - which then had principal responsibility for the report - and was rapporteur for this directive. I can only say that the problems we faced, and which this report goes a long way towards solving, were the same as those we are dealing with today.
We must simply take care that there is a reasonable balance between the interest in having such credit security systems and keeping them stable, and the other interests that of course exist - those, perhaps, of creditors in insolvency cases - to which consideration must also be given, and that these interests are reconciled fairly.
For there can be no doubt that what is at issue here is not just the protection of these financial systems; there must also be guarantees that others affected by this regulation should not be put at an undue disadvantage.
I think that we have found a just reconciliation of the two, and it is this point that is decisive.
The rapporteur has also mentioned a second angle of significance to us in the Legal Affairs Committee, namely the fact that the boundaries as regards preferential creditors have - I would say - been drawn relatively generously.
We took the view that this category should either in fact be extended to include medium-sized enterprises, or, on the other hand, actually be restricted to banks and direct participants in financial markets.
I believe that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has achieved a good result, and, in view of the lateness of the hour, I would also like to come to a conclusion.
I can say on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee that we are in agreement with what the rapporteur has presented, and we will also, for our part, support it.
Mr President, this is all going more quickly than any of us thought.
I would like to start by apologising on behalf of Mrs Villiers, who has just, at the end of a vote in our Group's Conservative delegation, been appointed deputy leader of the delegation, on which I warmly congratulate her.
As a lot has already been said, I would like to enlarge on just a few things.
Firstly, the speakers on this item and its predecessor have set themselves a great goal.
We want to do our utmost to ensure that the action plan for financial services - of which this directive is a part - is of high quality and can be adopted and implemented swiftly and in accordance with the timetable.
We hope that, unlike on other occasions, the Council will not delay in producing its own position in response to the preparatory work done at least on this issue by Parliament and the Commission.
Mr Lehne, who spoke before me, has already pointed out that it was the 1998 directive on settlement finality that set up the first milestone for Europe-wide financial policy.
This has to date been the only piece of European legislation governing cross-frontier securities in connection with financial transactions.
We need standardised regulation in this area in order to make the internal market efficient.
We need to do away with the uncertainty as regards the law applicable to transactions across borders in negotiable securities.
We need to do away with the increased administrative costs that stand in the way of an integrated EU market which is more attractive in terms of cost.
We need to do away with the legal uncertainty that comes with 15 different legal systems, because these differing legal systems lead to risks when securities are utilised abroad.
We also need to do away with the differing legislation on insolvency.
There is, then, a need for a standard minimum regulation.
This directive is the only means by which these objectives can be achieved, and so we welcome it and support the rapporteur's report and that produced by Mr Lehne of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Many thanks! We hope that it will be possible swiftly to implement this report by Parliament, together with the Commission's proposals, and thus turn them into a reality.
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking very much your rapporteur, Mr PÃ©rez Royo, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the excellent work and very constructive approach on the collateral proposal.
This proposal, as was emphasised by Mr Karas just now, is a priority dossier in the Financial Services Action Plan and it is a crucial element for the timely delivery of the FSAP by 2003 for an integrated European Union securities market, and the year 2005 for the FSAP overall.
Given that the value of outstanding contracts on the European REPO market alone exceeds EUR 1.8 billion, the expected benefits are extremely large.
These contracts will, when the directive is implemented in the Member States, be governed by one legal regime, instead of 15 different ones.
Such a uniform pan-EU legal framework for the use of collateral will contribute to the greater integration and cost-efficiency of European financial markets, by encouraging cross-border business and creating a more competitive European financial market.
Now I come to the tabled amendments.
The Commission generally supports all the amendments except for Amendment Nos 16 and 21 which deal with extended protection of top-up collateral and the restriction of the scope respectively.
We fully support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 18 and19 as they stand.
In addition, and subject to some rewording, which we do not expect will cause any difficulties for Parliament, we can also accept in principle Amendment Nos 3 to 15, 17 and 20.
But we may need some flexibility in finding a final agreement.
By supporting Amendment No 1, we are not abolishing protection of credit-related top-up collateral.
But the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 16 which protects credit risk top-up collateral under the directive, and nor, we believe, can the Council.
Nonetheless, as provided by Amendment No 1, it would be possible under national law to protect that kind of collateral.
To be more precise, Amendment No 16 is not acceptable to the Commission because it could strongly conflict with insolvency law policy which generally discourages improvement of a creditor' s position as a result of an insolvency-related event or at least in a context of deteriorating credit-worthiness.
Amendment No 21 is not acceptable to the Commission because the Commission would like to see as many non-financial companies as possible benefiting from this directive.
Those companies are already using these techniques in the market.
In conclusion, I should like once again to thank Members of Parliament for their sterling cooperation.
I have also been apprised of what has occurred today in Coreper, as the rapporteur, Mr PÃ©rez Royo, mentioned.
Tomorrow, as he said, there will be an Ecofin meeting at which I myself will be present.
I do not know what the discussion will lead to tomorrow.
I regret the need for a second reading for obvious reasons, but I cannot help that.
The Commission is in the hands of Council on the one hand and Parliament on the other.
Lastly, I should like to say to Mr Lehne that I quite agree with him on the timing of this debate.
It is an extremely important debate and yet it takes place at almost 11 p.m. and the public interest is very small.
I assure you, Mr President, that if this debate could have taken place earlier today I would have been very happy.
I am sure Members present would also have been very happy.
Despite the time and the fact that Parliament is not so well represented, the debate has been of high quality and I, as President for the sitting, am very glad to have been able to take part at this hour and in this final nocturnal Strasbourg debate of 2001.
We thank you on behalf of Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m.)
Award of Sakharov Prize 2001
Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan, Mr Izzat Ghazzawi, Archbishop Zacarias Kamwenho, it is with great pleasure that the European Parliament welcomes you today in this Chamber, in order to award you the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought.
Please allow me to offer a warm welcome not only to yourselves but also to the persons accompanying you, and especially to those of your relatives who are able to be present.
Since 1988, the Sakharov Prize has been awarded every year by the European Parliament in recognition of individuals or organisations who have left their mark on the struggle for human rights and freedom in their home countries.
At the centre of their actions has lain a deep-rooted conviction: the right to live in an environment of respect for the dignity of all human beings, whatever their ethnic origins, gender or beliefs.
This year it has been decided, for the first time, that the Sakharov prize is to be shared between three recipients.
This is an exceptional decision in response to exceptional circumstances.
Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan, you are an Israeli who has been through profound and personal suffering.
You once wrote: 'If war is to be ended, it is necessary to realise that blood is the same colour for everyone and that when a single child dies the whole world dies with it' .
When your thirteen-year-old daughter Smadar lost her life in a Palestinian suicide bombing, you did not allow the horror to turn your mind towards hatred. Instead, you chose to denounce - and I quote your words - 'a short-sighted policy which refuses to recognise the rights of the other and stirs up hatred and conflicts' .
How many of us can be sure that we too would maintain the same courage and dignity in the face of the worst injustice of all, the loss of a child?
All of us must feel affected in the depths of our soul by the strength and lucidity which have made you the symbol of all those Israelis who are campaigning for a peace which will take into account the aspirations of two peoples, the people of Israel and the people of Palestine.
In awarding you the Sakharov Prize, our aim is to show our deep attachment to supporting all those who, through their daily actions, in spite of such difficult historical circumstances and in spite of the pressure of events, are working tirelessly to improve relations between peoples.
Mr Izzat Ghazzawi, you are a Palestinian whose suffering has also been great.
In one of your letters from prison, you addressed an Israeli friend and poet, Ya' ir Horowitz, who had recently died. In your letter, you tried to re-establish a dialogue that had been interrupted by death, outlining the dream of peace that you shared and drawing on the resources of hope to fight the despair which threatened to overwhelm you because the dream of peace was fading with time.
You have tirelessly promoted the cause of peace and encouraged dialogue between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.
Your ardour has never slackened, despite imprisonment and censorship and, more importantly, the irreplaceable loss of your sixteen-year-old son Rami, killed by the Israeli army while trying to help a school friend who had been wounded in the school playground.
You have resolutely pursued that same dialogue, through your writings, your lecturing at Birzeit University, your leading role as chairman of the Association of Palestinian Writers, your contacts with Israeli writers and your joint publications.
You have endeavoured to make mutual understanding and tolerance prevail among the cultures, religions and peoples of the entire region.
Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan and Mr Izzat Ghazzawi, by honouring you both together, the European Parliament hopes to make a contribution to the advance of the cause of peace over war, to the expression of tolerance and understanding and to the preservation of hope.
Archbishop Kamwenho, your country has been at war for 25 years.
Two generations of Angolans have grown up without knowing the meaning of the word 'peace' . The death toll of this interminable war makes frightening reading: one million dead, almost four million displaced individuals, hundreds of thousands of war orphans and war wounded, a starving population, meaning one child in five dies before the age of five, life expectancy is less than 45 years, millions of anti-personnel mines scattered throughout Angola, and extreme poverty despite the existence of natural resources which have, unfortunately, largely been used only for purposes of warfare.
The European Parliament has always been committed to the promotion of a political solution to the conflict in Angola, and we have repeatedly stressed the urgent need for all parties to embark on a global dialogue with a view to a lasting peace based on the promotion and protection of human rights.
Our Parliament has repeatedly expressed its support for the efforts made in this direction by the churches and the organisations of civil society.
As Archbishop of Lubango, as President of the Catholic Episcopal Conference of Angola and SÃ£o TomÃ© and of the Ecumenical Committee for Peace in Angola, you have been an apostle in the service of fundamental rights and peace and a symbol of the hopes of the Angolan people, of its desire for peace, liberty and justice.
We salute your life' s journey as an individual and pay tribute to your ecumenical spirit, your determination and your eloquence.
We also salute you as a spokesman for the aspirations of all those in Angolan civil society who are working for dialogue and reconciliation.
Today and for all these reasons, Archbishop Kamwenho, we award you the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought.
I shall conclude by expressing our wish to honour the memory of the victims of these conflicts, of all those, children, women and men, who have fallen in Israel, in Palestine and in Angola.
We declare our support for the three winners of the Sakharov Prize for 2001, and we are profoundly moved by their tragic fate, and affirm a common stand against violence in whatever form.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Luisa, my family, Mrs Sartaoui, I wanted to dedicate this speech to the memory of my father and his Palestinian friend, Dr Issam Sartaoui, who both dreamt of peace thirty years ago.
I am, I feel, obliged, however, to dedicate this speech to the children who were killed yesterday by the Israeli army, simply because they were born Palestinians.
It is a great honour to be here today with you, as winner of the Sakharov Prize.
I am well aware that, on such occasions, one should speak of hope and of the human qualities that can lead us to the triumph of compassion and fraternity between people.
Forgive me, therefore, for not speaking of this today.
In Jerusalem, where I am from, hope and humanity are fading away.
Israel is becoming a graveyard for children, which is growing bigger day by day. It is like an underground kingdom, extending beneath our feet and destroying everything in its wake.
It is the kingdom where my daughter lives, with her Palestinian murderer, whose blood, mixed with hers, flows through Jerusalem, which became hardened to the sight of blood a long time ago.
They are there with many, many more children, and they have all been let down.
The murderer of my daughter has been let down, because his act of murder and of suicide achieved nothing.
It did not put an end to the cruel Israeli occupation, it did not lead him to paradise, and those who promised him that his action would have meaning and value go on as if he had never existed.
My young daughter was let down because she believed, just as thousands of her new brothers and sisters believed, that she lived in safety, that her parents protected her from evil and that nothing could happen to sweet little girls who cross the road to go to their dancing lesson.
And all the children who are there with them have been let down, because the world goes on, as if their blood had never been spilled.
In Jerusalem, where I am from, the men who call themselves our leaders have allowed death to hold sway.
It appears, however, that these gentlemen know how to live in peace when they have to.
On Friday 1 December, the editorial of a local newspaper in a Jerusalem in mourning told us that there had been peace in Jericho for two months.
There are no Israeli soldiers there, no Palestinian policemen, no gun shots.
Do not believe that the Americans have succeeded in convincing Ariel Sharon to stop sending young eighteen-year-old Israelis to kill innocent Palestinians, nor that they have succeeded in convincing the Palestinians to stop blowing themselves up along with their innocent Israeli victims.
Far from it.
Jericho is at peace because the Israeli and Palestinian leaders have together decided to reopen the casino ...
When I read this article, I could not stop myself from thinking that my daughter' s life is not even worth a single roulette chip.
Almost 200 children have been killed since the beginning of the Intifada, of this incessant massacre, and they are worth nothing more than roulette chips.
And yet, I was not very surprised, since I always knew that our war was not that of the Israeli people against the Palestinian people, but that of people who destroy lives who call themselves our Heads of State against the people from both sides.
These cunning politicians use God, the wealth of the nation, freedom and democracy, and even our periods of mourning as political tools, and they use our children as if they were figurines in their games of chance. For instance, you knock over ten of mine, and I shall knock over 300 of yours, and we will be quits until the next time.
None of this is new in the history of mankind.
Leaders have always used God and other sacred values, such as honour and courage, to justify their self-indulgent ambition.
And the only voice, throughout history, that spoke out to expose them and to oppose this was always the voice of mothers; the voice of those who produced the Jewish people, who disobeyed the Pharaoh' s orders to kill little boys at birth; the voice of Rachel, our biblical mother, weeping for her children and refusing to be consoled; the voice of the women of Troy; the mothers of Argentina, the mothers of Ireland, Israel and Palestine.
It is the voice of those who give life and who are committed to preserving it.
It is the only voice that remains after the violence has subsided, and which truly understands the meaning of the end of everything.
Mothers are the only ones who know that the death of a child, any child, whether from Serbia or Albania, Iraq or Afghanistan, whether Jewish or Palestinian, is the death of the whole world, of its past and its future.
When Luisa told me that I had been awarded the Sakharov Prize, I told her that I did not deserve it, since I had never saved a child, not even my own.
But then I thought that the prize had not been awarded to me as a person, but to this voice that I took on through death and which transcends nationalities, religions, and even time.
This voice that politicians and generals have tried to silence since man first walked this earth and since men have been waging war.
I have often been asked whether or not I feel the need to exact revenge for the murder of my daughter, who was only killed because she was born an Israeli, by a young man, who had so little hope that he was willing to kill himself and who only killed himself because he was Palestinian.
I always quote the verse of the great Hebrew poet Bialik. 'Satan has not yet created those who would exact revenge for the death of a small child' .
And this is not because Satan does not have the means, but because after a child has died, there is no longer vengeance, death, or life.
The only feeling that remains, the only desire, the only need, that can never be satisfied, is that of protecting the child.
The mothers who have lost their children will tell you that their arms hurt due to the constant need to hold the child and keep it from harm.
No mother would ever think of seeking consolation by killing one child for another.
If we do not wish our entire planet to become a kingdom of dead children, we must raise our voices as mothers in order to silence all the other voices.
We must once again listen to the voice of God who said 'Do not harm children' . Otherwise, there will soon be nothing left to say, nothing left to hear, other than this incessant cry of mourning.
Ladies and gentlemen, I beg you to listen to the voices that are coming from the underground kingdom of children who have been killed.
That is where justice resides today, that is where true multiculturalism holds sway, that is where we know that there is no difference between blood, between skin, between identity cards or flags.
Listen to the cries of the dead children and help their mothers to save the children who are still alive.
(Loud and sustained applause)
Madam President, distinguished Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends: It is with great emotion and excitement I receive this recognition today.
This prize is an act of faith in the ability of the world to promote a sustained dialogue of tolerance and understanding.
It only made my commitment towards a nobler future for the conflict in our region stronger and more persistent than ever.
There are so many events that I would like to tell you about here, but the time I am given is limited.
From my prison, for almost three years I wrote a book called 'Letters Underway' where I asked myself during the bleakest moment the following question: could it be possible for me to address in my book an Israeli figure who is an artist, a father, a real human soul, a man or a woman who would abolish the image of a soldier guarding my solitary cell?
When the answer was yes, I proceeded with my writing.
As soon as I was out of prison, I took part in a writers' meeting in Oslo where a few intellectuals from both sides met to discuss how they could contribute to peace.
During ten days of ebbs and flows, the Israelis talked much about the historic distress that befell the Jewish nation and people.
The Palestinians talked about their daily suffering under occupation.
But finally, after ten days, we were able to understand each other's needs.
I could not forget one comment by an Israeli writer.
During this meeting, on the tenth day, he said, 'I always thought that man is evil... now I am not sure'.
In that same year, 1993, my son fell dead to the bullets of the soldiers in his school.
The event changed the taste of everything in my life, but I knew that a good human being is a living one.
Suffering, if we so decide, can be used as a power to heal rather than a blind struggle for revenge and hatred.
The principle of an eye for an eye, makes the whole world blind.
I knew how to use understatement as a means of compromise in my literature.
It is true, however, that the conflict of man with his heart is the noblest sort of struggle.
It is a pity that the conflict of today is between nations and cultures.
Left to the generals of war and enmity, they will make it a bloody history of terror.
Left to them, we will accept it for a fact that our world is either bad or mad.
But those who have read history in a tolerant way, understand that what is needed is a mutual moral commitment towards the facts of existence and the human obligation towards life as the only valuable gift.
Abnormalities of all kinds do not have a race, or a religion, or a certain home.
Only civilisation has its own religion and faith and home.
That is because there has been no unique civilisation as a creation of its own: all through history civilisations borrowed from each other and excelled most when they were able to share their merits and values.
However, the recent fear of a clash between cultures is not groundless.
There is an amazing imbalance between the rich and the poor, and there are a great deal of injustices that threaten the very principle of tolerance in our globe.
Yet, our insistence on dialogue between cultures is at its highest now, because we have to search into the roots of terror.
As a writer living in an exceptionally troubled area, I must look at this issue of intercultural discourse as a story of attraction and excitement.
Whatever happens in our region is doomed to affect the whole world.
That is not because we are the centre of the world.
It is only because the spiritual roots sprang from here to transmit their force among every and each one of us.
Both attraction and excitement arise from this tremendous past.
It is high time now to see that tremendous spiritual past as a part of a human culture.
It is important to see it as a part of a human culture and not a divine call for a holy land that eats up its children.
Man is holy.
Nothing else is holy if man is humiliated and deprived of his rights to live in dignity.
There will be no reason for a detailed map with the human heart being broken in our area at the edge of hope and despair.
We are fed up with the illusion of victory.
No nation can be defeated if it insists on the meaning of life as a value in itself.
Our isolation and anxiety is beyond any proportion, but our faith in the future is also great.
We will always need your support for a sustained peace process, and a support for the peace camps that lit the candles for all those who lost their lives in the ignorant battle.
Once more, with deep gratitude, I thank you for awarding me, together with my partners, this prestigious prize, but it is also with all the anxiety I have in my heart for the future of Palestine and Israel, and the admiration I express for all the men and women who are there now and who have the dream and the vision.
(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, I should like to point out, with respect to yesterday's minutes, that Dr Ganzert, the lawyer detained in Nicaragua, has now been allowed to leave, and to thank you for everything you did to bring this about.
Thank you, Mr RÃŒbig.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
Order of business
At yesterday' s meeting of the Conference of Presidents, it was decided that the sitting of Monday 17 December in Brussels will be extended by one hour.
The part-session will therefore begin at 3 p.m. and end at 7.30 p.m.
Madam President, as the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we are against the extension of the Monday sitting, which will serve only to get the anti-terrorism package approved.
This package was presented in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs this morning, but we could not proceed to the discussion because of the very tight deadlines, and no report was drawn up.
I think it is worrying that Parliament should express an opinion without first having drawn up a report on such an important subject.
We are therefore against this shortening of deadlines, because it simply does not allow us to present a reasoned report on such an important subject.
Thank you, Mr Di Lello Finuoli.
It will therefore be recorded in the Minutes that you are not in favour of the decision taken by the Conference of Presidents.
Decision on urgent procedure
I shall now give the floor to Mr Watson, the chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
Watson (ELDR), chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
Madam President, last night two requests were referred to my committee under Rule 112.
These relate to re-consultation on two framework decisions from the Council, one on combating terrorism, the other on a proposal for a European arrest warrant.
We were asked to treat these as a matter of urgency.
My committee met this morning and agreed to propose to the plenary that we agree to urgency for these texts as submitted without report.
Thank you, Mr Watson.
We shall therefore act in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, as usual.
Does any Member wish to speak against the request?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the six years that I have been an MEP, Parliament has constantly asked the European institutions to show it some respect.
Today, once again, Parliament is being asked not even to respect itself and we have heard the two larger groups, in the 'Citizens' Freedoms' Committee, decide with the Liberals that Parliament must not act with self-respect.
This is, however, incredible since we are going to vote on the European arrest warrant, which will enter into force in 2004, namely in two years' time, and today they are telling us that there will be a Laeken European Council.
This European Council will decide on a text on Sunday night. This text will be reviewed by lawyers on Monday morning.
No one will have seen the text before arriving in Brussels on Monday afternoon.
And Parliament is going to vote on it, and cannot wait until January.
Can you explain to me why we cannot take a vote in January on a text that will come into force in 2004?
It is absurd, it is ridiculous and it shows that Parliament does not take itself seriously, and I urge my fellow Members not to support the leaders of their groups, but to show some dignity and to reject this request, to have a report, to vote in January and show that this Parliament respects parliamentary rules and that we are not at anyone' s beck and call.
Thank you.
We shall now hear a Member who is in favour of this request.
Madam President, much less vehemently but, I believe, just as justifiably, I would like to ask this Parliament to vote in favour of this urgent motion.
We in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have been working on this issue for a year.
On 5 September we voted in favour of Mr Watson' s report in which we asked for concrete Commission proposals in favour of harmonising penalties in the field of terrorism and establishing mutual recognition of sentences, which is known, inappropriately in my view, as the European arrest warrant.
There have been passionate and interesting debates in our committee, and it is a shame that Mr Cohn-Bendit has not been able to follow them.
Work has been done in this Parliament in relation to the texts which the European Commission has been working on for over a year.
I believe that we are all responsible adults and Members of Parliament, we know the background to the texts, we understand their political importance and we can make an effort to accept the inconveniences of doing a little work over these days, so that on Monday, before the Laeken Summit, in a perfectly correct manner in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Parliament may give its opinion for the second time.
(Applause)
We heard the chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, one speaker in favour and one speaker against.
We shall now vote on the request for urgent procedure.
(Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure)
Vote
Madam President, first of all, I must mention that this is the last time we vote for a budget under your presidency.
And in stating this fact, I must acknowledge the efficient way in which you have always conducted this rather complex type of voting, and I would like to say that, with you in charge, even voting for the budget can be a pleasant activity.
So thank you very much.
Secondly, at the end of a budgetary procedure, which, as everybody knows, is a long and complex process, I feel I must once again express my thanks.
Firstly to my colleagues of the Committee on Budgets, with particular regard to the way in which the work was coordinated by the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn.
The coordinators of the different political groups also deserve a mention: in addition to their activity in the committee, they serve as the link between it and the political groups and therefore make it possible for all the Members to be involved in this procedure.
A special mention for Mrs Buitenweg, with whom I had the pleasure of working during this procedure, since she was the rapporteur dealing with the other institutions, and also for the draftsmen of the opinions who contributed to the involvement of each of the committees in the procedure.
I feel that all this work has been very thorough.
Here, thanks are also due to the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, which went far beyond the call of duty in this operation.
Great dedication was shown.
(Applause) Lastly, I would like to stress the constructive way in which the Commission and the Council carried out their activity throughout this budgetary procedure.
Now, as is natural in such a long and complex procedure, I have a few technical observations to make, a few aspects which need to be improved upon.
If you agree, Madam President, I will now mention these last minute changes so that the voting can take place more rapidly afterwards.
Firstly, at first reading, Parliament adopted Amendment No 885 regarding line B5-502 , Amendment No 886 regarding line B7-665 and Amendment No 177 regarding line B7-42.
These amendments should be considered as being incorporated in the voting list you have in front of you.
The first two amendments were published in a corrigenda to the minutes of 25 October 2001.
Unfortunately, these amendments were not recorded as having been adopted in the word processed version and consequently do not appear in documents 10 and 12.
Therefore, Parliament must confirm its first reading with regard to these amendments, despite the fact that they do not appear in the document relating to the voting list which is before you on the table.
As for Amendment No 177, it so happens that, by accident, it appears in document 11 (Amendments rejected by the Committee on Budgets) and not in document 12 (Amendments adopted by the Committee on Budgets).
Secondly, in Amendment No 328, regarding line A-1100, the final numbers should be EUR 989 119 000, both for authorisations and for payments, and with regard to line A-950N, EUR 3.5 million should appear for authorisations and for payments.
I also wish to point out that Parliament' s services must ensure that the text of the resolution is consistent with the budgetary amendments we are going to adopt.
Once again, thank you all very much.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Costa Neves.
After the vote on the amendments
Mr President, I am advised that the figures that we have just voted on do not make sense unless we vote on the Wynn report which is about the financial perspective.
We need to vote on that to make sure that we have the figures before we accept that the vote we have just had is complete.
In other words, Mr Wynn, you would like to vote on your report now and then vote on the report by Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg.
If that is what you mean, I do not see any problem in doing this.
Report (A5-0447/2001) by Mr Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument (COM(2001) 625 - C5-0557/2001 - 2001/2227(ACI))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0400/2001) by Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002 as modified by the Council (all sections) (14341/2001 - C5-0600/2001 - 2324/2000(BUD)) and Letter of amendment No 2/2001 (14340/2001 - C5-0615/2001) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002
Section I - European Parliament
Section II - Council
Section III - Commission
Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors
Section VI - Economic and Social Committee
Section VII - Committee of the Regions
Section VIII (A) - European Ombudsman
Section VIII (B) - European Data Protection Supervisor
On Amendment No 1
Madam President, a brief parenthesis to remove the spanner from the works: we reached an agreement which, from Parliament's point of view, was perfect as far as development policy output targets are concerned.
But we do not to spell it out again in the resolution in question, so we are withdrawing Amendment No 1.
We believe that Parliament has made excellent progress within the budget on this point and Amendment No 1 is therefore no longer necessary.
Thank you, we shall take note of this.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you have concluded the second reading of the draft budget.
I have seen the agreement reached between our two institutions at our consultative meeting on 21 November assume concrete form in your vote today.
I take note of the fact that there remains some difference of opinion on the division of expenditure.
On that point the Council reserves all rights.
Nevertheless the Council is able to agree to the proposed maximum percentage increase that emerged from your second reading.
Thank you, Mr Vande Lanotte.
Does the Commission wish to take the floor?
(Having invited the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vande Lanotte, the Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, and the rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg to join her, the President signed the budget)
Mr Sturdy, I can assure you that the President of the European Parliament will take careful note of your request.
Report (A5-0427/2001) by Mr Colom i Naval, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: financial programming 2002-2006: financial perspective headings 3 and 4 (SEC(2001)1013 - C5-0410/2001 - 2001/2162(COS))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Simplified procedure
Proposal for a Council decision, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on an exchange of letters between the European Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) concerning additional funding in 2001 under the current EC-UNRWA Convention (COM(01)741 - C5-0663/01 - 2001/0288(CNS))
(Parliament adopted the proposal by the Committee on Budgets)
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0453/2001), by Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in euros (14562/1/2001 - C5-0639/2001 - 2001/0174(COD))
(The President declared the common position approved)President.
I would like to stress that the excellent cooperation between our institutions enabled this regulation to be adopted quickly.
The legislative co-decision procedure was used in an exemplary manner and I would like to give my very warm congratulations to all those who helped to achieve this outcome.
Simplified procedure
Draft Council regulation, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, concerning the adoption of specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism (COM(01)569 - C5-0665/01 - 2001/0228(CNS))
(Parliament adopted the Commission proposal thus amended)
Draft recommendation (B5-0747/2001) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the crisis in the Middle East and the role of the European Union in the region
Before the vote on Paragraph 3
Madam President, I suggest - and I hope the House will back me up here - that we add the following at the end of this sentence:
'demanding the Palestinian Authority dismantle the terrorist networks including the arrest and prosecution of all suspects'.
(Parliament agreed to take into consideration the oral amendment) - Before the vote on Amendment No 7
We have become aware since drafting this report that the last phrase in our paragraph 4 is contrary to the provisions that we cite in recital A, referring to Protocol 6 of the ECHR.
Therefore, I would like to propose that we replace the last phrase of paragraph 4 with the phrase 'extradition cannot take place where the defendant could be sentenced to capital punishment'.
If we use those words, we are in conformity with Protocol 6 which we cite at the beginning.
(Parliament agreed to take into consideration the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

Report (A5-0418/2001) by Mr Gahler, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on EU relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran (COM(2001) 71 - C5-0338/2001 - 2001/2138(COS))
Before the vote on Paragraph 5
Madam President, rather than urging Iran to adopt a constructive attitude, I propose that we revise the text so that it reads as follows:
Urges all coastal countries to adopt a constructive attitude as regards the delimitation...'.
We have assured neutral experts that no one party to this border conflict or in this region can be specifically accused of obstruction and that they should all be urged to adopt a constructive attitude as regards the delimitation of boundaries in the Caspian.

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, I am certainly not acquainted with the vital reasons that have led to the choice of today' s timetable.
I do not, however, understand how we can end the vote at 11 a.m. and debate a very important report on social and economic problems after 5 p.m., when there may not be many Members present in the House.
If it is more important in this Parliament to talk about Mr Berlusconi than the social policies of the European Union, then please say so and in that way we will know that our work is completely useless.
Thank you, Mrs Muscardini.
As you know, the draft agenda has been adopted by this House.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Costa Neves and Buitenweg report (A5-0400/2001)
Madam President, the Costa Neves/Buitenweg report deals with the general budget of the European Union.
You can see, Madam President, that right now at least half of the members of the public who are watching Members leave the House when Mr Fatuzzo starts his explanations of vote are elderly and pensioners - but that is just a coincidence.
Well, I have looked at the European budget and tried to pick out the entries for initiatives that are specifically concerned with, and of interest to, the elderly and pensioners.
I had to get the magnifying glass which, as you know, on the computer lets you magnify the words written in the various documents, and I looked and looked and looked but could not find any.
That, then, Madam President, is why I had to vote against this European Parliament budget.
I hope next year, at the end of 2002, I may instead have the satisfaction of voting for it because at last there will be some substantial, major, visible entries favouring pensioners.
- (DA) We have voted against Amendment No 7 to the report on the EU' s draft general budget for 2002, tabled by Jens-Peter Bonde on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities.
As it stands, the draft is of no use at all in securing a better arrangement for MEPs' travel expenses.
It is also our view that MEPs' travel expenses are a subject to be dealt with in connection with a reform of the Statute for Members.
As we reach the end of the budgetary procedure for the financial year 2002, I think that it is important to make a number of comments about agriculture, the Community's border regions and the European Union's external actions, to confine myself to the essential points.
With regard to agriculture, the fact that several billion euros of the 2001 budget have not been used will mean that significant sums will be returned to the Member States, whilst a strong dollar with regard to the euro will have at least had the effect of automatically creating a favourable situation on the markets.
Nevertheless, if necessary, the Commission should not hesitate to extend the special purchase scheme for beef - a programme which was set up in the aftermath of the BSE crisis and which expires at the end of the year - by six months, either through an SAB or a transfer of appropriations, even though it is proposed in the Letter of Amendment No 2 to cancel the billion euros initially earmarked for any additional needs related to BSE.
The border regions, which were generously provided for in the Berlin agreements, will, for their part, benefit from EUR 16 billion over seven years. The Nice and Gothenburg summits confirmed this policy, entrusting the Commission with the task of setting up an additional programme worth some EUR 191 million.
The Committee on Budgets has deemed it appropriate for its part to add a further 50 million under Interreg.
This is in spite of the fact that in many cases there is clearly no proof that these 22 border regions (from Finland to Greece via Bavaria) are in need of this new money, and that they already receive significant financial support and will be the first to benefit from enlargement.
In comparison, given the amounts at stake, we cannot but be taken aback by the lack of aid which was available following the devastation wreaked on French forests by the storms, the effects of the floods in Picardy and the immediate damage caused by the Erika.
Given the urgent nature of the situation, appropriations ought even to have been re-deployed.
(Intervention shortened pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
. During the budget discussions with the Commission on Category 4, broad agreement has been reached as regards the importance of improving the reporting system on development assistance, as well as the need to develop targets and indicators for measuring impact.
Moreover, agreement has also been reached to have a benchmark that 35% of spending should be allocated in support of social infrastructure.
It was my intention, as rapporteur for the Development Cooperation Budget, to suggest an oral amendment to the original amendment, submitted by me, emphasising "... to the social sectors in a given country, reflects the wishes of the beneficiaries and that a degree... the norm.
Progress towards meeting the benchmark will be monitored through the Common RELEX Information System".
Because of procedural rules and lack of time, however, this oral amendment proved impossible to submit.
The intention, however, was to emphasise that the benchmark should be seen in the context, not only of total donor spending, but also taking into account recipient country wishes.
Wynn report (A5-0447/2001)
. (ES) The Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999, for which I was rapporteur, created the Flexibility Instrument, a 'light' revision of the Financial Perspectives of less inconvenience to the Council.
In the two previous budgetary years, we rather forced the interpretation of that mechanism, since it was applied by us in order to meet the needs of Kosovo and Serbia, with regard to the fact that the Council refused to keep its word and agree to the revision of the Financial Perspectives which it promised in its Declaration of 6 May 1999.
This year, the European Commission presented a proposal to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument which, for the first time, respected the letter and the spirit of the Agreement.
But once again it has not been possible and the responsibility for that falls to Parliament.
It was a question of providing EUR 197 million of the EUR 281 million it will cost to convert the fleet which previously fished in Moroccan waters, a fleet and an industry which provides employment in the least-favoured regions of the current EU: Galicia, Andalusia and the Algarve.
All of these are Objective 1 regions.
On the afternoon of the conciliation of 21 November, the Council and the Commission sounded out formulae which did not represent a reduction for anybody, but it seems it was not enough for some people to obtain resources which were difficult to justify, but that it had to be at the expense of everybody else.
The result is that the Objective 1 regions of Spain and Portugal will have to pay for 40% of the conversion of their fleet by means of the reprogramming of the FIFG.
My colleague Barbara DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop will continue with the explanation of vote.
. (ES) I will continue the explanation of vote started by my colleague Mr Colom i Naval.
There were people, however, such as Mr Stoiber, in such a prosperous region as Bavaria, who considered that it was in their electoral interest to name a price which might appear in a newspaper headline: a programme - with no legal basis, by the way - for cross-border cooperation with the candidate countries, funded with some of the money intended for fishing conversion.
Demagoguery is contagious and others followed his example and the conversion programme was taken hostage, despite the fact that there were already appropriations for cross-border cooperation, at least in B5-3003, B5-0510, B2-0141, B3-1010, B3-1021 or B3-0306.
I would like to stress that we are in favour of the intention to prepare these regions and that they have always had our support.
What we are not satisfied with is the fact that it is done to the detriment of the regions affected by an unexpected conversion.
And, although the resolution states that in 1999 it was not envisaged that enlargement could have consequences for the bordering Community regions, this is not the case.
In Germany, for example, the border States will have Community aid of more than EUR 10.5 billion.
We have rarely seen such a miserly and nationalistic spectacle in this House!
This would be typical of the Council.
We voted in favour, but without enthusiasm.
We did so because we do not want to sacrifice those poor regions of the Iberian coast, but also out of solidarity with these regions and also with those bordering the candidate countries, a solidarity which has been sadly lacking in this negotiation.
Peijs report (A5-0453/2001)
At this, the last plenary part-session of the European Parliament of 2001, which is also the last before the introduction of the euro notes and coins, we have to note that the European Parliament has not organised a formal sitting or even a debate of any kind to mark an event which is in principle, for all of the federalists here, who are in the majority, the greatest ever project of European 'integration'.
Why this silence, which has moreover lasted for several part-sessions and which has been broken only by sovereigntist voices?
The answer is simple: the final phase of introducing the single currency - which is to say the physical changeover of notes and coins as of 1 January 2002 - is based on two enormous deceptions.
First of all, the single currency is totally useless from a technical point of view and serves only to satisfy the extremist desires of certain federalists who absolutely must have uniform monetary signs throughout Europe.
In fact, we could quite easily have kept the current arrangement: the euro for international purposes, superposed on national currencies.
We are therefore going to turn people's lives upside down, make their lives more difficult in the coming months, and doubtless further reduce the trust which they have in their national institutions, and all of this for no useful purpose except to pander to federalist passions.
The second deception is that public opinion has never been properly enlightened and has even been manipulated.
Neither at Maastricht nor in the ensuing years did the public fully understand the impact of the Treaty, that is to say, that it would bring about the end of the franc.
Subsequently, every possible effort was made to give the impression that the public supported the project, which was not true.
Today the harsh reality has dawned: 52% of French people think that the single currency offers more disadvantages than advantages while 33% think the opposite (Le Figaro, 11 December) and 62% would like to continue using the franc compared with 32% who are of the opposite opinion (Wall Street Journal, 11 December).
Similar percentages are replicated at European level.
The deception is so huge that next year, when people's eyes are opened, we will not only have to rethink the euro, but also consider thoroughgoing reforms of the European institutions to prevent public opinion from being manipulated in this way again.
Motion for a resolution (B5-0747/2001)
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy unanimously approved my Amendment No 22 regarding a new Paragraph 9 of the resolution with the following wording: 'Calls on the partners to ensure that the State has a monopoly on the use of force and that no parallel military structures can continue their activities' .
If it is - ever - to be possible for peace to be achieved between Israelis and Palestinians, or between the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, it is crucial that the power of the State should have a monopoly on the use of force and that Islamic terrorist paramilitary groups - such as Islamic Jihad, Hamas and Hizbollah - should not be allowed to be armed and to carry out terrorist attacks against civilians as they at present do with great regularity.
My amendment was unfortunately rejected by Parliament.
However, the line of reasoning I put forward has been included in paragraph 3.3 of the resolution in the compromise demand 'for the Palestinian Authority to dismantle terrorist networks, including by arresting and prosecuting all suspects' .
I regard this request as progress in itself and as being very clearly worded in the same spirit and along the same lines as my original amendment.
The voting session that we have just completed is yet another perfect illustration of the frequently hemiplegic behaviour of the European Parliament.
How is it possible for this House to adopt, by a broad majority, a motion for a resolution in which it declares its 'solid commitment to the common fight against terrorism' alongside the United States whilst refusing, by a broad majority, to ask the Palestinian Authority to condemn terrorism?
I am stunned that nearly 320 Members voted against Amendment No 6 which proposed something that seems perfectly obvious, in other words, that the support we are giving to the Palestinian Authority and its institutions must be coupled with a firm condemnation of the violence inflicted by the same Authority and the implementation of effective measures that will put an end to the terrorist attacks.
What do we gain by using such disingenuous language?
By moving away from a balanced policy, we are putting our diplomatic credibility at risk and we make ourselves appear to be biased.
Do we want the next European mission to be turned away from Israel, just as the mission headed by the Belgian Presidency was?
Why send such an ambiguous message to the terrorists, as if there were good and bad terrorists?
Our condemnation of terrorism must be global and there should be no exception.
This will merely enable us to be in a better position to state our desire to see the Palestinian people in a fully-fledged, sovereign State.
All people aspire to a genuine State, which is the expression of their sovereignty, and the Palestinian people have the same right to this as everyone else.
However, we shall not assist the leaders of the Palestinian Authority to act with the responsibility of State authorities whilst being complacent towards terrorism.
Watts report (A5-0440/2001)
Madam President, the Conciliation Committee has spoken to us about the living and working conditions on board the ships that arrive in Community ports.
I voted for the motion, Madam President, because I remember life on board very well, since at a young age I sailed on board passenger liners between New York and the Bahamas.
There are some seamen who live a good life on board once their shift is finished: for instance, the pursers and deck officers dine in the restaurant with the passengers, drink whisky in the passengers' bar, dance in the ballroom with the female passengers if they are men or male passengers if they are women.
In contrast, though, there are the cooks, cabin-boys and helmsmen, who unfortunately live in tiny cabins four metres square and enjoy living conditions that are not quite so pleasant.
I really hope that my vote in favour will be useful so that we can take a real interest in living conditions on board ship, but for all seamen and not just some.
- Madam President, I warmly welcome this report by my Socialist colleague Mark Watts, which will enable EU Member States to enforce international standards for ship safety, pollution, prevention and onboard living and working conditions.
This report has the potential positively to affect a broad number of issues: it could enhance the lives of people working on board ships and, moreover, it is in line with the EU's attempts to take a pioneering role in protecting the environment.
The calls for "black boxes" which carry voyage data recorders, are a vital and concrete way to ensure that those ships calling at EU ports all adhere to common standards.
Ortuondo Larrea report (A5-0441/2001)
Madam President, the Ortuondo Larrea report marked the agreement of the Conciliation Committee to inspections and surveys of ships when they enter European Community ports.
I voted for it, but I would hope, Madam President, that the on-board inspections will be performed by European Union inspectors, and not inspectors from the Member States.
We know all too well, in fact, that the Member States do not want inspections in the way the European directives are implemented, so much so that, in a conciliation to have inspections on the implementation of environmental directives, all 15 Member States of the Union opposed them.
. (NL) I am pleased that agreement has finally been reached at arbitration on the three major measures contained in the Erika 1 package.
We have debated and negotiated at length, and it is now time for the implementation and enforcement of the legislation.
As regards the report on the classification bureaux, the most important subject for the Liberals too was liability.
In the first and second readings we argued for a ceiling on the liability of classification bureaux, since the latter organisations are only one element in the chain of liability.
Unlimited liability is in our view only justified where there is gross negligence.
In addition, a ceiling ensures that eventually the fairly closed markets for classification and statutory tasks will become more open and a more level playing field will be created.
At present, new classification bureaux can scarcely compete with the existing (national) organisation under a regime of unlimited liability.
In order to avoid undermining the Erika 1 package and to retain the gain for Parliament brought by the Watts report (voyage data recorders on ships), at third reading, the Liberals accepted with reservations the proposal that Member States should be free in their negotiations with classification bureaux to agree higher, unlimited liability.
The result of this, however, will have to be evaluated by the European Commission.
The Liberals are pleased that extra guarantees have been built into the Regulation to prevent any entanglement of interests between a classification bureau and the owner of a vessel being monitored.
The bureau must now be completely independent, which stands to reason.
Hatzidakis report (A5-0344/2001)
We are still on the subject of ships, Madam President, in the report by Mr Hatzidakis on the results of the Conciliation Committee regarding double hulls for oil tankers.
I voted for it because it is important to have achieved this agreement.
Double-hulled tankers sail the seas of the whole world providing a better safeguard against pollution.
I should be pleased, however, if there were also better safeguards for the crews, who do not have an easy life on board oil tankers, and I should be pleased, above all, if the electronic and navigational appliances were improved.
Basically, we should try to prevent any disasters at sea by every possible means, either before doubling ships' hulls or, at least, as well as doubling their hulls.
Surely, in the end, improvements to the electronic steering and control apparatus cost less than doubling the hull.
PÃ©rez Royo report (A5-0417/2001)
The report by my colleague, Fernando PÃ©rez Royo, on financial collateral arrangements is an important step towards standardising the legal regime governing financial instruments in Europe.
Like my colleague, I attach great importance to the harmonisation of these markets, within a reasonable period of time.
This is what Mr PÃ©rez Royo's work seeks to achieve.
Although, overall, the report is based on the same model of future European financial markets I myself have in mind, the French socialists have not supported the rapporteur on three points.
Article 2(4) broadens the scope of application of the directive to all market participants and thus modifies the order of preferential creditors in the event of bankruptcy. This compromises companies' chances of recovery by transferring ownership of their assets to creditor banks, bypassing preferential creditors (employees, tax and social security bodies).
Article 6 provides for the use by the collateral taker of the financial instruments' collateral held under the security financial collateral arrangement; these provisions give rise to difficulties related to ownership rights and traceability of securities and thus threaten the transparency of European financial markets.
Finally, Article 10(2), as amended by Amendment No 17, deletes the precise localisation criteria, thus making any credible attempt to increase the transparency of our financial markets doomed to failure and pre-empting the conclusions of the Hague Conference on International Private Law.
Since the vote in the plenary confirmed the rapporteur's choice to broaden the scope of the directive, the French socialists voted against the text as a whole.
Motion for a resolution (B5-0821/2001)
The large groups in this House have just tabled and passed a resolution deploring the Commission's failure to submit its legislative programme for 2002, which they criticise for being insufficiently detailed, in good time, a surprising move coming from them.
Of course, we could not but endorse this initiative, but neither can we avoid asking ourselves what has prompted this almost universal attitude of spite towards Romano Prodi.
At every turn a majority of this Parliament seems to be trying to disassociate themselves from him.
Why?
Has he in the end become disliked because his statements are sometimes insufficiently federalist?
Is he being reproached for not providing sufficiently vigorous opposition to the Council, which lately has appeared to be even more exasperated than usual by the Commission's customary 'integrationism' and by its defence of a 'Community method' which has been torn to shreds by Europe's evolution, and in particular by enlargement?
We should also mention an alternative explanation, which might give us rather more cause for concern: the transitional arrangements for bringing the euro notes and coins into circulation on 1 January 2002 are not going too well, and it seems that there is a danger that the public will not enjoy the experience.
It may well be that the federalist politicians in this House are starting to distance themselves from an institution which they are readying themselves to accuse in the future of not doing enough to prepare for the changeover.
The Commission would be a perfect scapegoat - and moreover with some justification - for these politicians' sins.
In the conclusions of the Commission communication, it is claimed that while the Commission 'is carrying out a radical reform of its working methods at the political, financial and administrative levels... in the meantime there are growing fears that Europe may lose touch with the immediate concerns of its citizens' .
I believe these are not just fears.
The fact that the citizens are not really interested in this radical reform of the Commission' s working methods seems to me to be healthy.
It would be worrying if they showed much interest in such matters, which do not arouse enthusiasm even among us Members, seeing that we have not really noticed all this revisionist radical behaviour that is being pointed out to us now.
Instead, we, like the citizens, notice that Europe is getting more and more out of touch with people' s concerns and seems more and more distant.
Perhaps the introduction of the euro, once the initial difficulties of understanding its value in terms of the old currencies have been overcome, may help more people to see Europe as a common reality, although the feeling is likely to remain, especially among the older generations, that they have been tricked out of their old currency, which will have vanished without anyone having asked them for their views.
The feeling that Europe is distant is a real feeling and one that is becoming more and more widespread among the citizens.
At crucial moments in the life of society it does not show itself as such, but emerges as the opinion of this or that government.
The opinions are legitimate, but they do not convey the idea that we all belong to a common entity whereas, in the past, this idea had always been symbolically expressed by the Commission.
It was the Commission that called the tune with statements and practical proposals.
Now, though, partly because it is not the Commission that represents foreign policy, when faced with questions of international politics Europe seems not to exist, and it is not evident in the figure of Mr CFSP.
Enlargement itself, the subject of so much praise and emphasis, is, on the contrary, seen by the citizens as a weakening rather than a strengthening of Europe.
If I do not share the enthusiasm about the 'working methods' expressed in the communication, it is not because I consider that the topics dealt with or the declared commitments are not going in the right direction, or because there are not enough legislative initiatives.
As everyone knows, quality does not depend on numbers.
It should be understood, rather, that over-regulating gives a distorted image of Europe and makes people identify it with that bureaucratic Moloch that is so feared by industry and the citizens.
No.
The intended work programme must be a political document and not an administrative list.
It must state the reasons for certain delays and the real obstacles that have prevented certain objectives from being achieved; it must identify some priority goals through which the unification process can be pushed forward.
Europe fully developing 'an effective role in the management and solution of international crises' will also depend on the Commission' s political will and not just on the possibility of developing on a global scale its function as a proposer of legislation.
Rather than in the cultivation of regulation peas, the identity of Europe will express itself in foreign policy and the security and defence policy.
The Commission should aim essentially at this if it does not want to be reduced even more in 2002 to a purely bureaucratic and administrative body.
Motion for a resolution (B5-0813/2001)
. I agree in general (while having some reservations about some of the language) with the resolution as posed.
I believe the European Union should co-operate on an international level in combating terrorism, organised crime and individual criminals, all of whom use the differences in legal systems to avoid standing trial.
However, my main reservation with regard to this resolution is the absence of any reference to the International Criminal Court, initiated by the Rome Convention.
This court when established will enable the trial of any and every individual suspected of crime, including war crimes.
This court, which is being opposed by the USA Government would guarantee a fair trial and would apply even-handedly to everyone.
In current circumstances this court is needed more than ever.
Lagendijk report (A5-0394/2001)
How wonderful it would be, Madam President, if we could find a solution to prevent conflicts!
I voted for this document, Madam President, but I am convinced that we will be able to avoid these conflicts - 99% of which just happen to involve poor, or rather very poor, countries in the world - if we can make these countries a little less poor.
I therefore think it is appropriate that the European Union should continue its actions of supporting the economies of Third World countries and poor countries, because I am convinced that only by improving the living standards of the citizens of our world who live in poverty - or rather in extreme poverty, not just in poverty, but in the most wretched poverty there could be - will we succeed in preventing conflicts of any kind.
Gahler report (A5-0418/2001)
The report by Mr Gahler, Madam President, concerns the relations between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran.
I have had the luck to have a town councillor for the Pensioners' Party who was born in Tehran and lived in Iran for thirty years and who had dual Iranian and Italian citizenship.
He explained the situation in Iran to me very clearly, and so I am very pleased that people there are trying to go back to the democracy that the Shah had installed into the country, even though he was the emperor.
I shall therefore ask that these talks should continue and that we should have an exchange of members of Parliament between Iran and the European Union, and most of all I propose that you, Madam President, should invite President Khatami to address this House here in Strasbourg.
I welcome moves to improve relations with Iran.
But we must always take account of the fact that human rights in Iran are, if anything, getting worse and not better.
Iran is continuing to fund terrorist groups such as Hizbollah who are active in the Middle East.
In particular, Iran funds terrorist groups that are still holding hostage a number of Israeli soldiers who are officially posted as missing in action.
If Iran is serious about developing better relationships with the West, it ought to put pressure on those groups to release those soldiers.
In particular, I would draw Parliament's attention to the case of Ron Arad, an Israeli air force officer who, in 1986, was captured by a Shi'ite militia group in Lebanon.
He was then in 1987 sold to another group which was funded and run by Iran.
He has not been seen since 1987; his daughter was an infant when he was taken hostage.
Would it not be an appropriate message for this season of goodwill if she could at long last see her father who disappeared 15 years ago?
Please would Iran help these soldiers be released if it is serious about developing peace with the rest of the world.
Van den Burg report (A5-0388/2001)
Madam President, the van den Burg report deals with the Commission report on the regulation of taxation of second-pillar pensions, that is, occupational pensions.
We know that there is the EET system and so on, that is, tax is paid either on the contributions or on the interest on the invested capital, on what is received for the occupational pension, or tax is paid on the pensions themselves.
Speaking on behalf of the Pensioners' Party, I propose the EEE system, in other words: exemption from paying tax when the pension contributions are paid; exemption from paying tax when the capital so received is invested; and exemption from paying tax when the occupational pension is redeemed.
If we really want to improve and enhance the possibility of saving through pensions - occupational, company and voluntary - the Member States should give up levying tax on them.
When we are young and think about our future, we should think that one day we shall be old and nobody will think about us, except we ourselves with our pensions.
Occupational pensions will play an increasingly important role in ensuring that pensions provide secure, lasting and effective social protection as well as a decent standard of living for retired people.
There is an urgent need to create a genuine single market in pension funds, and this means providing for a tax system which will, regardless of the country of residence of the member or retired person, avoid contributions and benefits being taxed twice and discourage pensioners from going into tax exile to avoid taxes.
I voted against the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission communication on the elimination of tax obstacles to the cross-border provision of occupational pensions because the methods recommended in it run counter to the objective sought.
This is because the proposals contained in the report submitted to us will generate costly bureaucracy, because of Member States' having to exchange information and work together to collect taxes, and do not in any way constitute a practical and efficient approach towards removing the tax obstacles to the cross-border provision of occupational pensions.
Instead of starting a process of consultation to identify which of the tax models currently in force in the Member States avoids double taxation of contributions and benefits with the greatest efficiency and the least bureaucracy, the report already comes down in favour of the EET regime, when it is obvious that the TEE tax system - which consists of taxing contributions to the plan and exempting pensions drawn from it - would guarantee uniform fiscal treatment, regardless of the country of residence of the member or retired person, that it would allow the country granting tax concessions for setting up occupational pension plans to safeguard its tax base, and that it would make the issue of sharing tax yields superfluous.
(Intervention shortened pursuant to Article 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
Rights of homosexuals in EU institutions
The next item is the oral question (B5-0533/01), presented by 33 Members to the Commission, on the rights of homosexuals in EU Institutions.
Mr President, you promised when you were appointed, Commissioner Kinnock, that the Commission would become the world' s best administration.
I have confidence that you are the right person to tackle that task successfully.
The issue of giving employees equal rights, irrespective of their sexual orientation, is a crucial step on the way.
In the last twelve years, there has been a very positive trend towards enabling homosexuals to be granted the same rights as heterosexuals.
In 1989, my own country, Denmark, was the first country in the world to introduce legislation on registered partnerships for homosexuals, corresponding to marriage, and a number of other countries followed suit.
I would mention the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Finland.
Other EU countries have implemented legislation which approximates to marriage to rather more limited degrees.
Within the framework of the EU too, the trend is now in the right direction.
Allow me to mention four very important points.
Non-discrimination against minorities is now written into the objectives of European cooperation.
On the legal basis of Article 13 of the Treaty, discrimination in the labour market on the grounds of sexual orientation has now been tackled in practical terms.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights expressly states that there must be no discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.
Finally, Parliament has recommended on several occasions that same-sex couples be guaranteed the same rights as heterosexual couples and that the Member States recognise registered partnerships.
There have been very positive developments in recent years.
Now is the time for the EU' s own institutions to comply with the same standards.
I would therefore very much welcome your proposal.
You have the key to nudging things in the right direction, Commissioner Kinnock.
This proposal would enable homosexuals to be accorded full rights if there were partnership legislation in their own countries.
I have a couple of questions in that connection.
Since it is to varying degrees that the Member States' partnership legislation approximates to the marriage laws, I would ask you to explain which countries' citizens will be given full rights.
Where will the Commission draw the line?
Moreover, the Commission is paving the way for cohabiting heterosexuals to be given certain rights, for example the right to health insurance covering their partners.
That is progress, but I should like to ask whether the arrangement also covers cohabiting homosexuals in all the Member States.
For example, are cohabiting homosexuals from Britain and Italy entitled to these limited rights?
Finally, a question on the timetable: when do you anticipate its being possible for these new staff rules to come into force in the institutions of the EU?
Over the years, many Commissioners have promised the earth in this area, and nothing has happened.
They have, however, set things in motion.
They deserve full recognition for having done so, and I hope you can give a positive answer to the question we have put to you in this House today.
One of the proposals the Commission is making for modernising reform will extend access to certain family and social benefits to European Union officials who are currently denied such access because they cannot or do not want to enter into conventional legal marriage under the laws of the Member States.
I am very grateful to Mr Lund and 32 other Members for initiating this plenary debate which enables me to report to Parliament on the issue of the Commission's intentions and proposals.
Under the current Staff Regulations, social and family rights are provided only for couples who are married.
Whilst that most obviously refers to matrimony between two heterosexual people, it also relates to homosexuals if homosexual marriage is legally recognised in a Member State.
The House will know that the Kingdom of the Netherlands is at present the only European Union Member State where marriage between two people of the same gender is legally provided for.
In the Commission's view, it is sensible to use the opportunity of current comprehensive reforms to revise the Staff Regulations in order to reflect the wide-ranging social change that has occurred in the time since the regulations were established in their present form in 1968.
The Commission therefore proposes to ensure that staff who do not have access to marriage under the current national legislation are not discriminated against and to provide improved treatment for people who, for personal reasons, choose not to be legally married.
To achieve this, the Commission seeks to provide full statutory recognition and commensurate benefits for all EU staff who are in partnerships that are shown to be stable in nature.
I would ask the House to note that whilst we recognise that not all Member States' legal schemes for such recognition accord equivalent rights and status, the Commission accords equal recognition to all existing national regimes which make provision for stable partnerships.
So far as we are concerned, the stable partnerships to be recognised will include homosexual partnerships which will be regarded in the same way as heterosexual partnerships and subject to the following conditions: firstly, the couple must provide a legal document of an EU Member State which acknowledges their status as non-marital partners.
Secondly, neither partner may be married or in another non-marital partnership.
Thirdly, there must no blood relationship in the first or second line between partners.
Fourthly, that the couple must not have access to legal marriage in a Member State.
People in recognised stable relationships that meet these requirements will be entitled to the family-related benefits that, under present Staff Regulations, are available only to heterosexual married couples and to officials who are homosexuals and of Dutch nationality.
Those entitlements will include household allowance, health insurance coverage, survivor's pension and annual travel allowance.
It will be clear to the House that unlike homosexual couples in all Member States other than the Netherlands, cohabiting heterosexual partners who are not married to other people could, if they so wish, get married.
The Commission does not, however, ignore the reality that many people in modern societies wish to sustain stable partnerships but do not wish to enter into matrimony.
We consequently recognise that many partners who have not married have family obligations.
