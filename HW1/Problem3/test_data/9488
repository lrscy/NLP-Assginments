Clearly we all agree on the need to reform our employment strategy, with a considerable degree of stability, and we all also agree on the importance of the three objectives â full employment, improved labour quality and productivity and strengthening of social cohesion â and we will agree on both the common recommendations and the specific recommendations.
I should like to stress the importance of certain principles which must underpin the application of employment strategies, in addition, of course, to a principle already often repeated here â the need to coordinate economic policies and social policy â and I should like to emphasise the need to horizontalise policies such as equality, health and safety in the workplace and integration, which seem to me to be essential objectives in the construction of Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice.

I should also like to emphasise, Madam President, the need for improved productivity in the face of relocation â which has already been highlighted by Mrs Bastos â which has disastrous effects on territorial cohesion and the necessary polycentrism of the European Union.
I believe that increased productivity and labour quality are the best remedies for slowing down relocation.
Nowadays this makes many European citizens sceptical about the European Union.
It also seems to me that the link between the structural funds, territorial restructuring impact policies and employment policy is vital for the achievement of territorial cohesion, a tool for genuine polycentrism in the European Union.
The need for concerted action on the part of the European Union, the Member States, the regions and local authorities and, of course, social dialogue, are other important tools in the application of these directives.
Â Â  â Madam President, as this is the final debate on the broad economic policy guidelines of this Parliament, perhaps we could carry out a more general survey.
Of course, the term 'European economic policy' which we use is somewhat misleading.
The Union does not have primary responsibility on this matter nor, unfortunately, does it acquire it under the new draft Constitution.
Primary responsibility lies with the Member States.
The Union simply intervenes in a coordinating capacity.
Where the Union has responsibility, in monetary policy, we have indisputably seen immense success with the introduction and stabilisation of the single currency.
Unfortunately, we cannot also say the same of the management of the real economy.
Growth rates have remained low and unemployment has remained at correspondingly high levels.
The recession in the real economy has led to a crisis in public finances, with huge deficits appearing in major economies, resulting in collapse due to failure to apply the Stability Pact.
25 November 2003 should have released us from the Stability Pact.
Instead, however, we returned to the same tired debates about how to revive it, instead of finding ways to get out of the stagnation of the European economy.
There are, of course, two ways.
One is a common, truly European policy, within the framework of a mixed economy.
We must stop worshiping the market, which has failed miserably because, if you take the 30 years after the Second World War, the mixed economy achieved full employment and high rates of growth.
If you take the next 30 years, during which the doctrine of the free economy has triumphed, full employment has collapsed and the European economy has stagnated and weakened.
It is time we returned to more logical principles, to a mixed economy like that which served us so well in the post-war years.
They tell us that unemployment is structural and that, in order to cure it, we need to take structural measures.
This simply means measures against the workers.
I would reply to this that the lack of investment is structural and that we should act against speculation on the money markets, which has paralysed the investment mechanism.
If we could find a new alliance of social forces, then we could really bring the European economy back to its old levels.
If we cannot find this alliance, then the European economy is condemned to stagnation and, ultimately, to becoming a satellite of the US economy.
It is time we realised this.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we need a public debate on our economic and employment policy objectives and the reform measures they call for, and one that is much more in-depth than that currently going on in the Member States and at European level.
For an example of how to debate economic and employment policies, we should take the debate about the Stability and Growth Pact, a subject about which there was far more public debate than there has been about the economic and employment guidelines.
I also want to put the case for a greater role for the Commission in economic and employment policy, and I urge it to make more use of its right of initiative, rather than hiding behind the unanimity required of votes in the Council.
Thirdly, I would like to see an end to unanimity in all economic and employment matters affecting the internal market, which would make it possible for Parliament to exercise its power of codecision and unleash new dynamism.
Let me also draw your attention â and particularly that of the left wing in this House â to the whole catalogue of economic and employment policy principles in the new Constitution.
In it, rather than setting social policy at odds with the market, we affirm our belief in the social market economy, in sustainability and in full employment; we do not play the various areas off against each other, for they are all mutually dependent and mutually complementary.
The competitiveness of enterprises is dependent on the skills of employer and employee, as well as on the stability of the currency and on the low level of inflation associated with it.
It is on competitive businesses that growth depends, and without growth there are no jobs, and employment is the precondition for social cohesion.
If we communicate this, in these terms, to the public and know ourselves bound by these basic principles and by this interaction, this reciprocity, then we will be able to implement the guidelines all the more efficiently.
The fact is that we have to get stuck in to the job with greater earnest and greater determination.
We cannot, we must not, have a situation in which internal market directives are not transposed.
We cannot, we must not, have a situation in which the Commission has over a thousand infringement proceedings pending against Member States.
We cannot, we must not, allow Member States to justify breaching the Stability and Growth Pact by saying that, by so doing, they wanted to do something for growth and employment.
If that were the case, then Germany would have the highest proportion of people in work; instead, it has the highest proportion of people out of it.
In bringing this speech to a close, let me ask what our weaknesses are.
They lie in our structure, in our lack of dynamism, in rigidity and over-regulation, and in population change.
Where do our opportunities lie?
We have them in enlargement, in the concept of the internal market, in small and medium-sized businesses, in the skills of our workers, in the Lisbon strategy, in the euro and in the social dialogue.
Let us take these objectives and make them into action plans and timetables!
Let us apply more seriousness and determination to the task of doing away with our weaknesses and seizing our many chances, which are still, like treasure, buried and waiting to be brought to the surface.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have truly followed the debate with great interest and, of course, I cannot but agree absolutely with what Mr Karas said earlier about employment being necessary for social cohesion.
I do not think that anyone will disagree with this conclusion.
I should like to formulate a few more conclusions.
Within the framework of the gradual strengthening of economic activity and the increase in employment in the European Union, we need to make decisive progress, as Mr Hughes and other speakers emphasised earlier, in applying our medium-term strategy for economic policy and employment policy, as laid down in the broad economic policy guidelines and the strategy on employment.
This strategy continues to apply, both to the old and to the new Member States, as Mrs Kratsa said and, of course, it must be understood in the best possible way, as Mr Moraes pointed out.
We therefore need to safeguard the continuation of both packages of guidelines in accordance with the principle of streamlining.
Instead of reforming the guidelines, we need to focus, even though Mr Bouwman said earlier that conditions are changing.
Of course, but there must be important changes, as I said in my first speech.
Therefore, instead of reforming the guidelines, we need to focus on closing the gap between expectations and results.
Careful monitoring of these procedures on your part, in close contact with your counterparts in the national parliaments, is the to success, especially within the framework of the interim review of the Lisbon strategy.
This review will be carried out next year and will naturally focus on ways in which we can achieve in practice the main objectives of our economic policy and our employment policy, including productivity, as Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez emphasised.
The report by Mrs Randzio-Plath presents a series of amendments to the European Commission's recommendations relating to the 2004 update of the broad economic policy guidelines.
The report by MrsÂ Hermange and her relevant amendments are designed to change the recitals of the guidelines for employment policies for 2004.
I should like once again to thank the rapporteurs and the Members of the European Parliament for the constructive way in which they expressed their concerns.
I am delighted that the amendments are in line with the strategy which we have agreed on in order to strengthen the economy and employment in the European Union.
As regards the amendments to the recitals of the employment guidelines, I should like to assure you that the European Commission will support in spirit those aspects designed to improve the recitals during further negotiations with the Council.
Finally, I think that the reference to older workers introduced by Mr Bushill-Matthews complements the reference by Mrs Hermange to the young unemployed and our position is therefore positive.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank all the French Members of this House most warmly and congratulate them on the French Government's action in deporting from France the Imam of Venissieux on the grounds of his misogynistic utterances.
For a woman in politics, such as I am, having spent decades contending for women's rights, it is immensely reassuring to know that it will no longer be possible, in this European Union of ours, to call for human rights â for that is what women's rights are â to be disregarded.
Right now, I would rather like to sing the 'Marseillaise', but perhaps it will be sufficient for me to say, ''
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two things I want to say.
We spent a great deal of time yesterday considering the Boogerd-Quaak report on the media, which has been a matter of some controversy.
I would like to say that we regard the refusal by the President of Parliament to permit the amendments as lacking any legal justification and we are therefore contesting his decision.
We will also be considering legal action to test whether the rights of Members of this House can be set aside by sweeping aside all the amendments, as was done in this instance.
It is because we regard this as a very serious course of action that our group will not be taking part in todayâs vote on the Boogerd-Quaak report on the media, thereby recording our protest and our inability to accept this decision.
There is a second matter that I would like to address, and it has to do with what Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said in the plenary yesterday.
The first question that has to be dealt with has to do with the background to Mr BarÃ³n Crespoâs assertion that documents had disappeared from the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for, if that is indeed the case, then it follows that it could affect all the procedural issues connected with the Boogerd-Quaak report.
I would, however, ask Mr BarÃ³n Crespo to withdraw the allegations he made in the plenary yesterday, which are, unfortunately, not recorded in the Minutes.
Yesterday, I heard the remarks that Mr BarÃ³n Crespo addressed to Mr Tajani, and they are recorded on the Houseâs official tapes, but not in the Minutes.
Yesterday, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said to Mr Tajani, for whom we all have high regard: â, which, when translated, means âshut up, you wretch!â
I think it unworthy for one Member of this House to describe another in these terms, and I ask Mr BarÃ³n Crespo to withdraw this remark.
Something else was said, and I regret that.
I had never thought I would have to say something like this in this House.
There is, though, something that binds us together no matter what disputes we may have with each other, and that is our mutual respect.
That is something that our group, at any rate, stands for, and such language should not be used to anyone.
I will add that Mr BarÃ³n Crespo also said something that I will read out, which was taken down for me from the tape.
I am reading it in Spanish, a language that I, unfortunately, do not speak, and so I apologise if I am not getting it quite right: ââ Translated, that means: âI would ask the wild boar running loose in this Chamber to calm themselves!â
Such, ladies and gentlemen, is not the language that should be used here in the European Parliament, and I ask Mr BarÃ³n Crespo to put right the remarks he made yesterday.
Â Â  Mr Poettering, we had a full debate on this issue yesterday.
I do not intend to allow another wide-ranging discussion.
In terms of the substance of your remark, I would remind you that the President put an alternative proposal to the House that would have allowed amendments to be voted on, and that was defeated by the House.
Consequently I am in a position today where we have a ruling from the President and a vote by this House on how we are going to conduct the voting on the Boogerd-Quaak report.
I do not intend to vary from that, so no matter how many points of order are made, we will stick to that position.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall be pleased to answer the request put to me.
Firstly, in relation to the issue raised concerning the disappearance of documents, I have written to President Cox, as he requested yesterday, and I have sent a copy to all my colleagues, the Group Presidents, explaining that certain documents did indeed disappear, but thanks to the efforts of the assistants and the officials of the Groups and the committee, they were replaced before the start of the meeting.
On this point, moreover, I hope that Vice-President PodestÃ  will give explanations to the House concerning the serious accusations he has made in writing in the ,which he has not mentioned at all until now, and this is a grave insult to Parliament.
As regards my statements, I see that Mr Poettering has noted what I said, but not what was said to me.
That is, I would ask that everything be recorded.
I shall give explanations about what I have said.
I told Mr Tajani that he was like a basilisk â this is not an insult, it is a word whose meaning can be looked up in the dictionary â ' [be quiet, wretch]'. '' â I refer you to the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy of Language â describes someone who has no grace, and as far as I am concerned, he clearly is such a person.
As regards 'wild boar', there is a problem, which I accept is to do with Spanish parliamentary culture.
ââ has been a traditional expression in Spanish parliamentary affairs since the Second Spanish Republic.
PÃ©rez Madrigal was well known for acting as MrÂ Pannella is acting now â shouting to right and left.
In Spanish, âacting the wild boarâ means doing what many of his colleagues were doing.
I am sure, Mr Poettering, that since yesterday you have received no complaints from the European Association of Wild Boars concerning such a comparison.
Â Â  Thank you for your clarification, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, but I am not sure that it was as useful as I would have liked it to have been!
We have over 600 votes to get through this morning.
We could have a lot of fun; we could spend the next 30 or 40 minutes playing games on this, or we can get on with the vote.
I will give the floor to Mr PodestÃ  because he was named and therefore has the right to make a personal statement, but I will not take a series of points of order.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe that I can say to you and to my fellow Members that the explanations that MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo has just given are the most pathetic that I have heard in ten years of parliamentary life here.
I would also like to take the liberty of noting that, in his letter to MrÂ Cox, MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo, when quoting what was published yesterday in the in my name, completely misinterpreted it and changed the wording.
This is serious, MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo, because I wrote that the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has breached some of the Rules of Procedure, which is why I sent MrÂ Cox a letter, to which he sent a reply, which I answered.
The difference between saying âbreached some of the Rulesâ and saying âsystematic breachesâ is merely one of intellectual integrity, or otherwise.
It means saying âblackâ or âwhiteâ: it is one thing to raise some points; it is another thing to say that our Rules of Procedure have systematically not been respected.
I will take the liberty â in conclusion, MrÂ President â of making one remark.
You said that yesterday the House voted on something that is, in any case, the sole responsibility of the President, but since we chose â or rather, since he chose â Rule 130(3) without considering that paragraph 1, which is binding, says that first of all amendments are put to the vote and then the text, we â or perhaps not we, but someone here whose responsibility it was â betrayed this Parliamentâs sense of democracy.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am indeed aware of the letter which Mr BarÃ³n Crespo sent to the President's office concerning his unfortunate and malicious statements of yesterday, and confirming them in exactly the same terms as in his speech.
On the other hand, Mr President, and according to the explanations given by the secretariat of my committee, and of which the Presidency is directly aware from the note which was sent to it, it is absolutely clear that all, absolutely all, the documents were available in the Committee on Freedoms at the start of the day on the 20th.
Documents which, moreover, are public and which, besides being available in the documentation department, are also available on the Internet.
Therefore, Mr President, I would emphasise that no political group â including the Group of the Party of European Socialists â nor any member of the Committee on Freedoms made any comment or statement on the matter, neither during the course of voting on the amendments nor at the start of the same.
Furthermore, Mr President, at the end of the sitting I was congratulated by all the political groups for the way in which the work had been carried out.
In conclusion, Mr President, and in Spanish, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo has lied, manipulated the truth and insulted us, in addition to casting doubt on the good name of the Members of this House, of the officials and also the assistants of the political groups.
Â Â  The President has not responded to the request of the chairman of my group to have the verbatim Minutes of yesterday's sitting revised.
As he himself has just admitted, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo spoke to a fellow Member yesterday, saying, ' [be quiet, wretch]'.
Mr President, this is not only an arrogant expression, it also shows contempt for an opponent which is incompatible with the democratic spirit.
Â Â  Mr Galeote Quecedo, you were as helpful as a wet Friday in November.
Because of your contribution, which was not on the subject you said it would be on, I now have no choice but to give the floor to everyone else who asked to speak on this subject!
Â Â  MrÂ President, I take the floor to state that, after the blow that has been dealt, yesterday in this House, and today in the Bureau, to the freedom of MEPs and their right to carry out their mandate, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group will not take part in the vote on the report in question.
We also challenge the fact that this Chamber is used for strictly exploitative ends, choosing who can and who cannot speak.
This system has been going on for a long time.
Democracy must be respected, above all else, in this Chamber, and not by making statements in newspapers and by giving out insults.
Â Â  Here is a very pragmatic suggestion, MrÂ President.
Since the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group are relinquishing their participation in the vote on the great report, I would suggest that you have a block vote, which will save time.
Â Â  We shall look at that when we come to the vote on the report.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, this is just a reminder that yesterday, as announced, I submitted a motion to refer the report back to committee.
I hope to be able to table it before the vote on the report and I also hope that the House can vote on it.
This is the last opportunity for this House to bring itself into line with the proper rules.
Â Â  If you wish, you may request a referral back to committee, but please wait until we vote on the item in question.
Â Â  This would be an appropriate time â since they are used to robust exchanges of views â to welcome the Australian delegation to this House.
They are here for the 27th EP-Australia Interparliamentary meeting in Strasbourg in June.
The European Parliament and the Australian Parliament have had direct political contact since 1981 and we look forward to continuing our interesting and successful dialogue.
Â Â  MrÂ President, quite simply, extremely objectively and in order to get out of this row between old accomplices â which is more like a mafia row than a parliamentary one â I would, with respect, like to hope that, faced with this situation and this debate, the President of Parliament might wish to honour us with his Presidency in this House.
I believe that this does not in any way detract from your well-known, excellent ability to preside, MrÂ Martin, but I think that President Cox could come himself, with his authority â and I would also say with his clarity â and preside over this sitting.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to intervene briefly in accordance with Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure.
Indeed, a motion requesting referral back to committee has been proposed and as you know, in this case, there can be one speaker in favour and one against.
Â Â  Mr Gollnisch, the request has not yet been formally made.
I will take that formal request when we get to the vote on the report.
To respond to Mr Pannella's point, I should like to point out that the President is present.
I am happy to resume my own responsibilities, but if the President wishes to speak, he is welcome.
Â Â  . I should just like to respond very briefly to Mr Pannella.
The Vice-President, Mr Martin, enjoys the full confidence of the House and of the President to conduct our affairs this morning.
In all calmness I can say that I have had a week where I have received an enormous amount of advice â mostly unsolicited â from many friends in this House.
I have understood, more fully than most in this House, the passions that have fed into our debate.
Yesterday I sought advice from the House after a lengthy exchange of views and then, not following a vote but under the prerogatives of the Presidency, I made a ruling.
I accept that there are many colleagues in this House who are not satisfied with that.
Solomon does not chair the European Parliament â lucky for Solomon.
So there it is.
The House was divided from the very first day as to whether there should be a debate on this question.
That division has manifested itself at every stage of this report from its inception until now with the final vote.
In my view the essential elements under discussion have always had a considerable underlying and latent political dynamic.
That being so, the divisions have been inevitable.
But now the report is before the House and the House must now exercise its mandate however it sees fit.
I would commend to you, Mr President, that you should â as you remarked â stand by the ruling.
Mr Ribeiro e Castro will propose â as is his right â referral back.
The House, in its wisdom, can then decide.
Finally, can I say that over the past 24 hours I have asked the services of the House to conduct, on my behalf, their own investigation into this question of documentation at a committee meeting earlier this week.
I am entirely satisfied that everything was done as it should have been.
If there was a temporary problem with some documents, that fell more into the category of 'cock-up' than 'conspiracy'.
I would commend to the House that we put an end to this matter and recognise and salute the integrity of Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, his committee and his services.
Â Â  The only piece of advice I would have welcomed this week would have been not to be in the Chair on Thursday morning!
Â Â  . Mr President, I am glad that we can now get on with what we are meant to be doing rather than continuing to waste valuable time.
For ten years now, I have been the rapporteur on the problems of beekeeping in the European Union, and today sees me presenting my seventh report to you.
As before, it improves another half-hearted Commission proposal for a regulation on actions in the field of beekeeping.
Neither the Commission nor the Council have made much of a response to the many good proposals we have made since 1984 on saving beekeeping in Europe.
Since 1997, admittedly, there has been a regulation on the 50% cofinancing of national programmes to improve the production and marketing of honey, for which different amounts are made available to the 15 Member States every year; in one year EURÂ 10 million, in another EURÂ 15 million, in yet another EURÂ 16 million.
That is next to nothing in terms of the overall budget of the European Union; it is peanuts.
As, yet again, the new regulation proposed by the Commission is far too half-hearted, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted my suggested improvements by an overwhelming majority, with the particular intention of securing additional co-finance for measures under national programmes to support the restoration and development of the Community's bee population, in support of honey analysis laboratories, and for the analysis of honey.
My hope and expectation is that you will give this report your unanimous support, not as a farewell present to mark the end of a legislative period, but, as before, out of conviction.
Â Â  Mr President, I wanted to thank the Commission and the Council for making it possible for this document to be adopted today, within four months of its submission, and at first reading.
I would also like to extend warm greetings to the delegations from the Austrian National Council and Federal Council, who are in the visitors' gallery.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr RÃŒbig, it was indeed a remarkable achievement to get this through in four months.
Â Â  Mr President, as I stated earlier, I have a very short oral amendment to Amendment 5 that is acceptable not only to the rapporteur but also certainly to the PSE, ELDR and Green Groups.
After the phrase 'facilitating the access of unemployed young people to their first job', we would like to add 'and also the employment/continuance in employment of older people'.
Â Â  Mr President, I just wish out point out, so that Members are not in any way confused, that it is Amendment 1 â the first vote on this report â which ascertains whether or not Parliament is in favour of the theory of setting up a health scheme for former Members.
Those who are in favour will vote 'yes'; those who wish to abandon their former colleagues will vote 'no'.
Â Â  That was very neutrally put!
(1)
Â Â  MrÂ President, pursuant to Rule 130(3), I would like to point out that, every time we vote, we are prepared to systematically breach the Rules of Procedure of this House.
Indeed, paragraph 3 states that âthe President may put the original text to the vote first, or put to the vote before the amendment that departs furthest from the original text an amendment that is closer to the original textâ.
On the basis of the decision taken yesterday by this Parliament, which annulled a good 350 amendments with an arbitrary act, I would like to ask you what we will vote on if a paragraph in the text had to be deleted, since there is no amendment left.
We will have a text that is like a lump of Gruyere, that is full of holes, which can only be closer to the truth given the content of this report.
This is, however, an extremely serious further breach of the EP Rules of Procedure that we are being forced to commit â or rather those who will vote will be forced to commit â on the basis of the bad decision, taken yesterday by President Cox, not to give a ruling and to make this Parliament decide to put to the vote the original text, understood as the consolidated text that was put forward by the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
That means to say a single voice, that of the left, incorporated its amendments into the original text.
This itself is a distortion, to which is added a further one, which I pointed out pursuant to the Rules of Procedure.
I would say to my fellow Members â who do not know the ins and outs of this case â that they have one last chance to prevent a serious injustice, a precedent that could become dangerous for the future, by voting to refer this report back to committee or by rejecting it.
Â Â  We will not reopen the debate.
I will give the floor to Mr Ribeiro e Castro who will formally move the request to refer the matter back to committee.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is an extremely serious precedent for the future, full of substantive, procedural and formal irregularities.
Democracy cannot be invoked, only then to be violated.
Neither can the rule of law be invoked, only then to be violated.
This is the case with the motion for a resolution that has been tabled.
It violates the provisions and the guarantees of the Treaties and, even if the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Constitution were already in force in the terms spoken of by some people, it would make a complete nonsense of these two texts too.
As a European institution, we have only the powers that are accorded us.
Now, can we judge the decisions of the constitutional courts of the Member States, particularly of Germany and Italy?
No.
Can we judge the legality of this or that fact within the framework of the national laws of the Member States, particularly Italy?
No.
Can we declare, like a peopleâs court, that certain facts have been established â particularly for Italy or Poland â for which no evidence has been produced or presented?
No.
Can we determine the national legislative process of the German Bundesrat?
No.
Some say that the subject of the report is covered by ArticleÂ 7 of the Treaty.
In that case, however, we should have acted accordingly, which we have not done.
Others say that the report has its basis in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Even if, however, this were already in force and being applied, note should be taken of Article 51 â retained, moreover, in the draft Constitution â according to which the Charter is applicable to the European institutions and the Member States alone.
I would ask Mr BarÃ³n Crespo to restore order among his little wild boars so I can finish.
Â Â  This is a very sensitive issue.
I was trying to be generous, but the Rules of Procedure are clear.
You have one minute to speak in favour and one minute to speak against.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would just like to say that the President was practically forced to issue this ruling â for that is what it is â because an element of this Parliament sought to prevent the majority from giving its opinion.
This is a situation forced on us by the stonewalling that they imposed, in the sense that this is an exceptional measure, in line with the powers given to the President of Parliament.
This is the situation that we have today, a situation without precedent and one which I hope the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â which is a large group in this Parliament â will want to give due consideration to, so that we are not forced into such a situation again.
Â Â  Mr President, the Rules of Procedure allow for the interventions of the person tabling the motion, of one speaker in favour and of one against.
I informed you at the start of the meeting that I wished to register in favour, as well as passing you a written document.
I thank you, therefore, for giving me the floor.
I will be brief.
I am in full agreement with this motion for referral back to committee, but I would like to add an essential reason, which is that the text of the proposed report particularly targets Italy, as is shown in the heading.
There are, however, countries in our European Union where freedom of expression is much more seriously threatened.
I am thinking of Belgium and France in particular: Belgium where, yesterday, a decision of the Ghent Court of Appeal, pronounced in accordance with some truly Stalinist legislation, condemned a perfectly legal and peaceable party, the Vlaams Blok. It is completely understandable that its growth worries its political rivals who, in this situation, practise the revolutionary logic of 'no freedom for the enemies of freedom', which is completely inadmissible.
Before telling Italy what to do, the parties involved in this villainy should set their own house in order.
Â Â  Mr Gollnisch, in my view, Mr Santini moved the request and Mr Ribeiro e Castro spoke on it.
We will now move on to the vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I suggested just now that we have a block vote, since the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group had decided not to participate in this vote.
In the meantime, however, several fellow Members of other groups have informed me that they wished to be able to vote on certain paragraphs.
Not wanting us, therefore, to be in disagreement on this point, I suggest that we vote normally.
Â Â  Mr President, as Chairman-in-Office of the College of Quaestors, I wish to point out for the purposes of the Rules that my Group is present but not taking part in the vote.
Â Â  I have noted your very important point, Mr Balfe.
You are always looking after Members' interests!
Â Â  MrÂ President, I feared that, after having denied us the right to table amendments, you were also denying us the right to speak.
Fortunately that is not the case.
I would like to ask you, MrÂ President, to point out what is written in the voting list concerning paragraph 44.
Here there are two words that have been deemed inadmissible: the words âseriousâ and âpersistentâ.
I ask you to highlight this since you have put this paragraph to the vote without this being stressed.
Â Â  You are absolutely right, we did indeed vote on the paragraph without those two words.
The two words have been removed.
You should have been informed of that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am against voting on blocks of amendments together when part of this House is against it.
I would, however, inform my fellow Members that, in adopting paragraphÂ 62 they have condemned the Italian governments of the last few decades, including the DâAlema Government.
I hope that they inform their voters, both on the centre-left and all the others.
Â Â  We will continue to vote on the paragraphs individually.
I could hear my good friend Mr Pannella shouting, but I did not know what he was trying to tell me.
As you have now clearly asked for the amendments to be voted individually, we will do that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, you said we were to vote collectively, not on the amendments but on the paragraphs.
We are, therefore, not respecting the Rules of Procedure, which provide for amendments, and not sections of the text, to be put to the vote collectively.
Â Â  I am sorry, you are wrong.
I could have taken everything in one single vote if I so wished.
Â Â  I apologise, MrÂ President, to you and my fellow Members, but as shadow rapporteur it is my duty to keep an eye on the little standard procedure that remains in this vote.
If I am not mistaken, you made us vote on paragraphs 1 to 14, but paragraph 12 has been declared inadmissible, in so far as it contains the two petitions that no Committee on Petitions has ever presented to our committee.
Paragraph 12, therefore, must absolutely not be included in the text.
I would also like to wish the services of the sitting the best of luck in the task they will have in putting right some paragraphs: paragraphs 59 and 69, for example.
If you remove MrÂ Berlusconiâs name then they will be without a subject, sentences which do not make sense: there is a verb, a few adjectives but there is no subject.
It would have been more responsible to delete the entire paragraph.
I do not want to be cruel to you, MrÂ President, by asking you to read to me, out of curiosity, how paragraph 59 could end up if amended.
It is not possible because there is a subject missing: who does what is written here?
Who feels the consequences of what is indicated here?
This is a difficult situation, Mr President; it really is a real mess.
Â Â  Again, Mr Santini, in relation to citation 12, you are correct.
The modification you mention has already been taken care of by the services.
You should have been informed of this before the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, as the House knows, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy was deeply divided over whether or not to ratify the third generation agreement with Pakistan.
However we are not divided on our concern for human rights and democracy, and the resolution before the House was supported unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
It is vitally important that there be a strong vote for this particular resolution.
The reason I recommend this is that when this House agreed to ratify the third generation agreement, it gave a commitment to review progress on human rights and democracy after one year.
The position the Committee on Foreign Affairs puts forward in this resolution under my name is the appropriate benchmark for judging how much progress has been made.
I welcome the amendments tabled by Mr Ford and Mr Swoboda, which strengthen the resolution.
I respect the fact that there were sincerely-held views on both sides in the debate over Pakistan.
I would therefore like to thank Members for all their individual contributions during the time I had the honour to be rapporteur.
This is my last speech in the House, so I wish to thank all my colleagues for their friendship â and indeed the battles over the years, even if I lost one today â and also to thank the staff for the courtesy they have extended to me.
I wish my colleagues who are standing again well â I hope they are successful.
To those, like me, who are retiring, I wish fulfilment.
Mr President, I very much welcome the fact that President Cox paid you such an outstanding tribute today when your authority in the Chair was challenged, since you have been an outstanding chairman of these proceedings.
You have always chaired with efficiency, courtesy and, most important of all, humour.
I wish you well.
You are an asset to this House and I hope you return.
Â Â  I have had the privilege of being a Vice-President of this House for 15 years and a Member of the House for 20 years.
I will not be a Vice-President in the next Parliament.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank colleagues for their support and for giving me the privilege of chairing this House.
More importantly, in some ways, I should like to thank the services, who do an incredible amount of work behind the scenes and do not get the credit that they deserve.
Â Â  Mr President, even though Mr Cushnahan and I did not always agree, I would like, first of all, to thank him for his dedication.
He really did do a fine job, and achieved a great deal.
I would like to add an oral amendment to AmendmentÂ No 6, to which many of us would be able to agree if something were to be added to it, that being the words, âprovided that the United Nations shall not have assumed political responsibilityâ.
The fact is that unilateral withdrawal of troops from Iraq at the present time, without the assumption of responsibilities by the United Nations, would certainly be highly problematic and could well plunge the country into chaos.
If that were agreed to, we could support the amendment as a whole.
That is my question to the proposer of the motion.
Â Â  Mr President, here too we find a similar lack of logic, and so I ask that, by analogy with paragraph 13, the following words, which I shall now read out, should be deleted: âincluding the completion of the transatlantic marketâ.
I also ask that the following be deleted: âaimed at achieving the free movement of goods, capital, service and personsâ.
In this instance, too, I ask for Mr Brok's agreement to this.
Â Â  Mr President, let me put to you another suggestion, one that will, I think, represent an even better solution to this.
In Mr Elles' Amendment NoÂ 22, there is a paragraph 27a, which deals with the same point and incorporates what Mrs Mann is talking about.
I put it to you that we should get rid of the whole of paragraph 15 and insert Mr Elles' paragraph 27a in its place.
We will then have resolved the whole problem and could have the support of a broad majority for it.
Â Â  I see that you are in agreement, Mrs Mann.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as confirmed yesterday by the Irish Presidency during the debate on the De Keyser report, the Union is following the current repression of the mountain people of Vietnam with a great deal of concern.
With the agreement of the rapporteur, I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, concerning Item 4 regarding the defence of the interests of indigenous populations and of minorities, to add these few words reflecting a situation that again came visibly to the fore just a week ago.
The text would read thus: âthe defence of the interests of indigenous populations and of minorities such as the mountain people of Vietnam, victims of systematic repression.
It is with the agreement of the rapporteur that I would like to submit this to you.
(2)
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to correct a small error that has slipped through into the text that we voted on in committee.
Chapter 1, paragraph 3, line 4 states: âagrees with the Commission's position that the general guidelines 2003-2005 remain valid...â.
In Parliament we are, however, as legislators, not obliged to say that we are in agreement with the Commission, but obliged to say what we ourselves want, as a Parliament.
With the agreement of all the political groups, I propose the following oral amendment: âthe general guidelines 2003-2005 remain valid but must be focused even more on boosting economic growth resulting in job creation and productivity growthâ.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, it appears that being prudent in this House is penalised.
I wanted to speak after the vote on the Boogerd-Quaak report, and not before, to avoid joining the general free-for-all, for one reason: to place myself at the disposal of the Presidency.
I was on the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and saw the people looking for the documents when they disappeared.
MrÂ HernÃ¡ndez Mollar is right in saying that he knew nothing and that no group got up.
On this committee all the groups and the chairman worked very reasonably together until, after our work, this row blew up.
Mr BarÃ³n is completely right, and he is not lying when he says that this is what happened.
I am at your disposal to clarify any point concerning this issue and, of course, it is untrue to say that Mr BarÃ³n lied.
I myself told him about the matter.
Â Â  . â The programme of support for the production and marketing of honey is known to be very important for the survival of beekeeping.
According to Portuguese beekeepers, one aspect of this programme has proved essential: the part relating to varroasis control.
The beekeepers believe, however, that varroasis control should be carried out through a specific programme, as happens with other diseases in other animal species.
In relation to the Parliamentary report, there is general agreement underlining the need to retain the programme of support for the production and marketing of honey.
Lastly, it is considered important that other measures should be applied, namely:
- support for the restoration and development of the bee population, given the growing problems in this sector;
- restructuring of the agro-environmental measures so that this measure may be regarded as effective support, as happens in other sectors of agriculture.
It is also essential, however, to take account of the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union and to provide for an increase in the budget allocated to the beekeeping sector.
Â Â  . â We voted against the report not because we disagree with it, but because everything it rightly points out is cancelled out by the first amendment, which promotes the coexistence of genetically modified, conventional and organic crops, allowing beekeepers to manufacture honey which contains GMOs.
We consider that this is extremely dangerous and destructive to beekeeping, precisely because honey is primarily a quality agricultural product.
The existence of genetically modified crops, in conjunction with a 0.9% limit on GMOs in honey, presupposes that bees can choose between genetically modified and non-genetically modified plants.
We condemn the 'zeal' of the European Parliament in speeding up the coexistence of genetically modified crops with conventional and organic crops â despite the warning bell being sounded by numerous valid scientific studies â and would point out that no legislative measure can prevent or combat the immense potential dangers.
The argument that the cultivation and movement of GMOs is now a foregone conclusion and all that remains is its 'satisfactory' legal regulation, is hypocritical, given that what is presented as a would not exist if the ÎU had not bowed to pressure from the USA.
We are categorically against the cultivation and movement of GMOs and we shall continue to fight for a total ban on them, because we do not consider anything to be a foregone conclusion.
The European Parliament should take the same stand; however, it appears to have been converted by interests and pressure a long time ago.
Â Â  . â I voted for the proposal for a regulation, because I believe that the enlargement of the European Union must not fail to take account of the changes that will necessarily affect the beekeeping sector, and that an increase in the budget allocated to it is justified.
Similarly, I believe we must think carefully about what the best methods and practices are to address the problems facing this activity, namely diseases, high bee mortality rates, poisoning by insecticides, climate change, marketing problems (especially in the outermost countries and regions) and unfair competition from low-priced, poor-quality products from third countries.
I agree that the lines of the previous programme should be maintained and I support the proposals added by the rapporteur, i.e. measures in support of honey analysis laboratories and other measures apt to improve the production and marketing of honey and apiculture products.
Â Â  The draft Commission regulation finally recognises the need to genuinely help the disaster-stricken European beekeeping sector, whilst carefully refraining from naming the main cause: the devastating effect of the new generations of neurotoxic insecticides.
The Commission is, however, absurdly stopping aid programmes, in the form of measures in support of the honey analysis laboratories.
Our rapporteur proposes to reinstate them, and she is right.
There was a need, however, to go much further and, since they are obviously of common interest, make the perfecting of the indispensable new protocols, designed for testing whether the new molecules used in the new plant health products are harmless to bees and to human health, eligible for Community funding.
Â Â  . â This is a matter of confirming the decision to reject the proposal to establish a Visa Information System (VIS) in the context of the communitisation of Justice and Home Affairs, which removes central competences from the Member States.
I support the view rejecting this Commission initiative, partly because this proposal is remiss in defining the system and how it will operate, âincluding the categories of data to be entered into the system, the purposes for which they are to be entered and the criteria for their entry, the rules concerning the content of VIS records, the rights of access for authorities to enter, update and consult the data and rules on the protection of personal data and its control.â
Hence my vote.
Â Â  . â I fully support the reasons given by Carlos Coelho for rejecting the Commission proposal, which is pointless and actually lacks any content.
I voted for rejection of the proposal.
Â Â  We support the outcome of the conciliation for the second railway package, firstly because it would make for quicker and easier international rail freight services, to the benefit of the environment and of the transfer of freight from road to rail, and secondly because it would emphatically not entail the deregulation of rail passenger services.
We believe that the consequences of deregulation in Sweden must first be investigated, something that the Swedish Government too is at present doing, before we possibly proceed with further deregulation.
Â Â  The thinking behind the radical reform of the railways is commendable.
The initial intention was, in fact, to rebalance rail and road and to favour recourse to a mode of transport that is respectful of the environment.
On the pretext of drawing power, we have initiated an excessive and poorly controlled liberalisation.
Let us not be fooled; the real objective of this liberalisation is to entrust the division of particularly lucrative markets to a few large private groups.
What will happen to life in the more remote and less profitable geographical areas, which will provide little interest for the private operators in search of profits?
Let us not forget the specificity of rail transport, particularly in France, which, as a public service, contributes to social cohesion and harmonious national and regional development.
Furthermore, liberalisation seems to be incompatible with safety, since some countries have had to renationalise following repeated accidents.
Finally, as the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, admitted, the market-opening of rail freight services will lead to increased competition, which may mean a reduction in the number of jobs.
For all these reasons, the Hunting Fishing Nature Traditions (CPNT) Party Members will vote against a common rail market created on the basis of social dumping and with no prior study of its impact on the main interested parties: rail users and employees.
Â Â  . â It is deeply regrettable that a majority in Parliament has voted in favour of the liberalisation of international rail transport from 1Â January 2006 and of national rail transport from 1Â January 2007, the year 2010 having been set as a standing objective for all operators to prepare in an appropriate manner for the liberalisation of passenger transport services, in advance of current Commission initiatives to accelerate the opening-up of this sector to competition.
This is the corollary of the initiative that the Commission submitted on 24Â January 2002, with the aim of accelerating the liberalisation of rail transport without first taking account of experience already gained, particularly in Great Britain.
Public services and rail safety have deteriorated there, because private companies only try to ensure maximum profits for themselves without fulfilling their obligations to maintain rail infrastructure and equipment.
Â Â  . The results of the conciliations on this second railway package are, quite simply, unacceptable, as they are contrary to the interests of rail users, railwaymen and safety.
The creation of a European Railway Agency and the interoperability measures unfortunately do not reverse the liberal tendency.
The amendment of Directive 91/440 increases even more the liberalisation of rail transport.
International freight services will be handed over to the market on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2006, and national freight services on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
In addition, the date of 2010 has been clearly announced for the liberalisation of passenger transport services, âobjectives allowing all operators to prepare in an appropriate mannerâ.
We cannot approve such relentlessness and we express our most vehement concerns regarding the future third railway package.
How many disasters and problems do there need to be before we finally abandon this frantic race towards liberalisation?
As far as we are concerned, this sector is common property and must continue to be owned by the community.
Rail transport must remain a public service, extended to the European continent, modernised and placed under the democratic control of the people.
In rejecting these results, this is the perspective that we mean to stand up for, together with our citizens, the railwaymen and their trade unions.
Â Â  ,. â The Conciliation Committee has reached an agreement on the directive on the development of the Communityâs railways.
The main points of the compromise can be summarised as follows.
Licensed railway undertakings will be granted access rights to international rail freight services from 1 January 2006 at the latest, and to national rail freight services from 1 January 2007.
It was also agreed that the Commission would submit, by 1 January 2006 at the latest, a report on the implementation of the directive as well as on developments in the area of traffic, safety, working conditions and the situation of operators.
At the end of the negotiations, Parliament accepted the Councilâs refusal to include the liberalisation of rail passenger services in this directive.
The Council, however, accepted a recital whereby, with regard to opening up the international passenger services market, the date of 2010 must be considered as âan objective allowing all operators to prepare themselves as necessaryâ.
What, though, of the transposal of the first railway package?
While it has not been transposed in the various Member States and a real assessment of its impact has not been carried out, âŠ
Â Â  .Yesterday evening, I gave Mr Caudron the opportunity to make his final speech after 15 years as a Member of the European Parliament as he is due to retire shortly.
He presented our group's final position on the railway package, making it clear that this liberalisation proposal is suitable for a Europe quite different from the one the Confederal Group of the European United Left would like to see.
In 2000, the European Commission tried to force the Member States to privatise the whole of public transport.
Since this Parliament excluded significant portions of urban and regional transport from this attempt on 14Â November 2001, the Commission has turned its attention to the railways.
It wants to liberalise not only international freight services but also domestic passenger services.
In the meantime, we have gained bad experiences of this in the Netherlands.
The move to sell shares in the state-run rail company Nederlandse Spoorwegen on the stock market appeared to lead to neglect of rolling stock and rail infrastructure, delays and industrial unrest and so has been stopped.
This was done not as a political choice but because staff, passengers and eventually politicians too learned the lessons.
The provision of train services by a competing company, since bought up by the international transport giant Connex-Vivendi, has also been terminated.
Similar plans for Europe are now being held up by the Council, but are still not off the agenda.
Â Â  . â Rail transport has not developed to the same extent as other forms of transport.
Indeed, it has suffered significant cutbacks, especially as regards freight, to the advantage of competing sectors.
We had a first package to revitalise the railways back in 2001.
Now this is the second package, and the Commission is continuing down the road to liberalisation.
The rapporteur invited us to approve the joint text after the Conciliation Committee had achieved consensus by weighing up the divergent positions of the Commission and of Parliament, through the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the timetable for the opening-up of the market to freight services, the main point of disagreement.
The only aspect to which I might have objected was the suppression of the safety provisions, but this area is specifically targeted by another proposal for a directive.
The measures proposed will make it possible to revitalise rail transport.
Since that is my conviction, and since I have long advocated the revitalisation of both the passenger and particularly the freight sector as being essential for European development, I support this whole package of measures.
Besides, we are witnessing a serious crisis, as at , which wants to close its factories in Europe.
What is really justified, then, is heavy investment in the whole railway industry.
Â Â  . â This initiative is part of the package liberalising rail transport.
I must stress that the first article in this directive points out that the objective is the opening-up of the rail network to competition, with the intention of harmonising safety rules across the European Union.
While improving rules and ensuring safety are fundamental issues, which of course deserve our full support, I cannot comprehend how they can be subordinated to the âmarketâ, subordinating the introduction of higher safety standards to the non-distortion of competition.
The Commissionâs power of control in this area is also strengthened: it is specifically given the power to suspend the application of a national safety rule for a maximum period of six months.
I therefore voted against the initiative.
Â Â  . â In this other proposal for a directive in the framework of the second railway package, the objective of which is to revitalise the sector, the Commission is concerned with safety issues, an area that has always been central to European Union policies.
In view of the significant differences that exist between Member States, the path that has been chosen is the harmonisation of safety rules, which will greatly help to improve and develop safety levels in the railway industry.
I must highlight the suggestion by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to introduce a safety certificate for railway undertakings and infrastructure managers.
The Member States have agreed to an extension of the Commissionâs powers in this area so as to facilitate the enforcement of the Community rules without, however, ruling out the enforcement of tougher national legislation.
The importance of the role of staff training measures in the development of rail transport has also been enhanced.
I realise that this is an important step on the way to creating a European railway system which must, above all, be safe.
I agree with this report and voted for it.
Â Â  . â We have here an integral part of the so-called second railway package drawn up by the Commission, which seeks to revitalise this particular transport sector.
Important proposals are presented, such as those that aim at improving investment by the various Member States, ensuring the application of technical specifications for the interoperability of both high-speed trains and conventional networks through greater financial support, and equipping trains with a recording device.
The proposal also provides for a new institutional approach, through the idea of setting up a European Railway Agency as a regulatory body for the system and a joint supervisory authority that can manage and ensure safety in the sector.
If the aim of the directive is achieved, it should lead to the specification of a high level of technical harmonisation, as shown in the agreement that has been reached.
The result of the conciliation process may be considered highly satisfactory for the European Parliament, and I am delighted with the approval of this joint text at third reading, with a view to speeding up the application of interoperability in the various aspects of the railway sector.
Â Â  . We believe that the EUâs forthcoming budget should give priority to sustainable growth, in line with the Lisbon strategy, and support for the new Member States so that the historically important enlargement is a success.
The budgetâs priorities must be changed so that less money is invested in agricultural aid.
We are, at the same time, anxious about budget discipline and critical of the Commissionâs proposed increases in expenditure.
In this situation, we do not wish to express an opinion on the precise levels to be achieved by the new budget, partly because the costs are difficult to predict and the priorities not established and partly because we do not wish to tie the new Parliament to precise figures.
Â Â  .We voted in favour of this report, thereby endorsing the wishes of the unions, although it even denies the right to vote to union representatives who sit on executive boards, something which should be a minimum requirement.
That being said, and given that this report is part of a package aimed at the âliberalisationâ of the railway system, we must reiterate our absolute opposition to any form of privatisation of the railways, which should be a public service throughout Europe.
Â Â  . â This report supports the draft regulation establishing a European Railway Agency, which is a further fundamental step towards the Commissionâs objective of revitalising the whole European railway industry at both freight and passenger transport levels.
The purpose of this agency is essentially to ensure the constant harmonisation and coordination of railway employees and to issue recommendations and opinions for the Commission.
Its duties will not include any kind of legislative competence and it will not have powers of regulation or independent control â it will merely play a consultative role, submit proposals and oversee safety.
The agreement in question is a further pillar in the second railway package.
In view of the fact that I also agreed with the other texts in this package and as I have always advocated that the future of Europe requires major development in this sector, principally because it is an excellent alternative to our already saturated road sector, I voted in favour of it.
The revitalisation of our railways has to be a top priority for the European Union.
Â Â  . â I support the extension of Regulation (EC) No 975/1999 â which underpins the European Unionâs human rights activities in the framework of development cooperation â so as to take account of the financial perspective, which runs until 2006, and at the same time to adapt it technically to the new Financial Regulation.
In particular, I greatly welcome the proposal for the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to create specific institutional mechanisms to allow for greater involvement of civil society and non-governmental organisations, with the principal aim of promoting democracy and human rights.
On the other hand, I am concerned at certain details that indicate the great difficulties faced by small and medium-sized organisations in civil society to have their applications for funding granted â despite the micro-projects facility â because of complicated administrative mechanisms.
The European Union is, as we all know, the largest source of development aid in the world; it gets visible results and raises genuine expectations in many who courageously and persistently fight and hope for the consolidation in their countries of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Â Â  . Having praised MrÂ Rocard for his excellent report, I would like to take this opportunity to mention the importance of that annual European scheme which puts a European city in the spotlight in the name of culture.
It remains necessary for Europe certainly and, above all, the nominated city, to provide themselves with the human and financial resources for the scheme.
Lille in 2004 gives us a perfect and remarkable illustration of this being done.
Â Â  . Culture is an area that falls into the much-vaunted but little-practised category of subsidiarity, where Europe should take a hands-off approach as far as possible.
European cultural policy should really be no more than encouragement in the form of subsidies, for example when a town is nominated as a capital of culture.
The rapporteur has raised a number of practical problems in the system of designating capitals of culture.
We will all agree that we need to find a fairer way of ensuring that all Member States have an equal opportunity to promote their culture, particularly following the enlargement which is due to take place in a few weeks.
The idea of having two capitals of culture would appear to be a reasonable option.
At the European summit last week in Brussels my country was not considered on the issue of appointing a director to the ECB.
The large Member States share out the posts among themselves.
There is no real respect for the smaller Member States, merely lip-service.
I hope that the symbolism of the European capitals will not go the same way.
That is just a wish that I wanted to express here.
Â Â  .â I congratulate Michel Rocard on his excellent report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision amending Decision 1419/1999/EC establishing a Community action for the âEuropean Capital of Cultureâ event for the years 2005 to 2019, to which I give my full support, especially as regards designating two European Capitals of Culture every year from 2009.
The intention is thus to impart a new impetus and dynamism to the process of selecting the European Capitals of Culture, promoting competition at a European level through encouraging the nomination of several candidate cities every year.
The aim of doing this is to ensure the success of the initiative.
Â Â  . â The Commission proposal aims only at supporting the nomination of one city from a new Member State in addition to the one from a current Member State from 2009 to 2018 and does not regulate the procedure for any other enlargement candidates.
I believe, however, that the âtwin-headed capitals of cultureâ proposal may prove inappropriate in that it will tend to reduce public interest in these events.
I share the opinion of the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport that, in the current situation, there is a serious danger that interest in this procedure may fall off quickly and may jeopardise its future.
I believe, therefore, that success depends on not diluting attention by multiplying events and on giving new impetus and dynamism to this process by reintroducing competition at European level and encouraging the nomination of candidate cities each year.
The selection panel, whose role is both to encourage nominations and to judge them, should set requirements and give advice to encourage the nominated citiesâ projects to include a real European dimension.
I therefore believe that the amendments made by the rapporteur to the Commission proposal are fully justified, as can be seen from the unanimous approval that the report received in committee.
I voted in favour of it.
Â Â  . â The purpose of the Europass is not to serve the workers, but to make it easier for employers to compare job applicants and select those who, with the lowest demands, will 'yield' fastest, whatever their country of origin.
In conjunction with the 'freedom' of movement of workers, who will have to wander about like nomads from country to country looking for work, this measure helps to depress wages and demands, using workers from poorer countries as a pressure lever.
At the same time, the Europass makes big business responsible for evaluating the educational and professional qualifications of the workers, taking this role away from the education system, and helps to decouple qualifications from the right to work.
Various forms of training and informal types of learning are taking precedence over qualifications acquired through systematic education.
In this way, the Europass is being converted to yet another tool which results in the replacement of substantive, integrated education with 'flexible' sporadic training and fragmented skills in order to meet the demands of the market.
It is certain that soon information will also be demanded on the so-called 'social' skills of the workers, such as their conduct at work and degree of compliance with every type of demand made by employers.
For these reasons, we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
Â Â  . â Taking this action aimed at ensuring the transparency of diplomas and qualifications by means of appropriate instruments falls within the same process, designed to promote mobility, as the ECTS system, certificate supplements, the European CV and the Erasmus and Erasmus Mundus programmes.
The Europass, allocated rational resources and adequate information networks at European level, and with which the social partners will be associated, will be an effective tool for helping people communicate their qualifications and competences.
The two objectives of this decision, âto rationalise and to coordinateâ, will only be achieved if all the Member States increase their efforts to implement these âEuropassâ-labelled documents quickly and effectively.
The Europass will make it possible to give European citizens the means for their mobility and should become the essential and ubiquitous document for all young Europeans.
In the light of the ambitions at stake, the meagre budget allocated to this project by the Commission may be cause for surprise.
Without impairing other programmes, we must nevertheless allocate ourselves the resources to match our ambition to âmake Europeâs education and training systems a world quality reference by 2010â.
Â Â  . â This proposal has the objective of drawing together into a single framework, to be known as a âEuropassâ, various initiatives aimed at âhelpingâ workers to set out their competences and experience in a way that employers and education/training providers in other Member States may be able to understand.
The âEuropean CVâ, to be known as a âEuropassâ, may include other documents, such as:
- a âMobiliPassâ: designed to record a specific European learning pathway in a common European format, and awarded to students/trainees who have undertaken periods of learning in another Member State;
- a âDiploma Supplementâ: attached to a higher education diploma to help third parties to understand the meaning of that diploma;
- a âCertificate Supplementâ: attached to a vocational qualification to help third parties to understand its meaning;
- a âEuropean Language Portfolioâ: a record of linguistic and cultural skills.
Each of these documents already exists, as a result of cooperation with the Council of Europe and/or UNESCO.
The only document to which the Commission proposes substantive changes is the MobiliPass, which would cover all kinds of learning and not just vocational training.
The question that arises is what basic motive lies behind the development of these instruments: is it to add value to a countryâs human resources, or is it to enable economically more developed countries to exploit the workers and their mobility?
Â Â  . I am very pleased with MrÂ Zissenerâs report, which will allow everyone to have their qualifications and competences recognised within an enlarged Union.
I am all the more delighted since on several occasions, by means of amendments, I have emphasised lifelong learning and training, and have proposed that we map out and identify a genuine European pathway of learning enabling young people to optimise their training in several countries of the Union, so acquiring a greater diversity of skills and adding a European dimension to their career path, which will be a âplusâ on their CV and in the performance of their work.
While this report is a very good example of what we can put in place for training young people and stimulating employment in the Union, I would, however, like to draw attention to the fact that standardisation âat any costâ is a mistake. Applying this policy to the curriculum vitae would once again illustrate the Commissionâs regrettable tendency to want to interfere in even the smallest details of our daily lives to the detriment of individual peculiarities and originality that are sources of mutual enrichment.
Â Â  . â This is a very important proposal for the mobility of workers.
Its aim is to establish a Community framework to achieve transparency in qualifications and competences by creating a portfolio of interlinked personal documents, to be known as a Europass, which citizens may use on a voluntary basis to communicate and set out their qualifications and competences better throughout Europe.
The Commission proposes to provide Europass National Agencies with financial support for 2005 and 2006 (corresponding to a development phase) through annual co-financed grants (of up to 50% of the total cost), after which Europass activity should be treated as a horizontal action in the new generation of Community programmes for education and training.
Like the rapporteur, I welcome the extension of the Europass-Training to cover all aspects of education and training.
I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  . â Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) account for about 99.8% of the enterprises in the European Union and about two-thirds of the employment.
These companies, covering a broad spectrum of business areas, are thus vitally important for job creation and local/regional development, but they encounter certain difficulties, such as access to finance, which require an urgent solution.
A policy of suitable support mechanisms directed at this broad sector is therefore needed.
The Growth and Employment Initiative (1998-2000), despite its shortage of funds and much publicity, had the objective of promoting job creation through support for SMEs.
It was replaced with the Programme for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship (2001-2005), which introduced mechanisms providing guarantees and access to risk capital, such as the Joint European Venture (JEV), which is now being wound up, thereby jeopardising the EUR 42 million of unused funds.
The programmes aimed at SMEs need an injection of funds but also a change in objectives: they must promote job creation; support the formation of associations; support research and training; provide guarantees for all the critical phases in the life of a start-up company; improve the geographical spread of support (broadly concentrated in the countries in the centre of the European Union); and support not just high-technology companies but also traditional and craft enterprises.
Â Â  . â This Commission proposal suggesting amendments to the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, is very important.
One of the proposed amendments, which the rapporteur supports, is the winding-up of the Joint European Venture programme (JEV), designed to support traditional joint ventures.
This measure is justified by the impossibility of using the remainder of the budget for projects involving accession and candidate countries, and by the fact that simplifying, as opposed to deactivating, the project would entail losing the unused budget commitments of approximately EUR 42 million.
The Commission also insists on improving the coverage of research activities under the ETF Start-up Facility, so as to increase the availability of risk capital to new and innovative SMEs.
The rapporteur suggests that, in addition to support for the start-up and initial development phase, as the Commission proposes, there should also be better coverage of other phases in the life of a new company, and he also underlines the importance of improving the geographical spread in the take-up of the remaining facilities.
The proposal is enhanced by these contributions by the rapporteur, and I therefore voted in favour of it.
Â Â  . â The aim of this proposal is to continue the Content programme on digital content.
The aim of the new Content programme is to make digital content in the European Union more accessible, useable and exploitable, in order to facilitate the creation and diffusion of information and knowledge in areas of public interest at Community level.
The programme will have EUR 163 million available for the period 2005-2008, and a specific aspect of the programme will be to improve the quality of digital content.
I have no objection to the promotion of tools, processes and services associated with the design, development, access and distribution of digital content or to the emphasis on the multilingual aspects of cultural, educational and scientific content.
I do have reservations, however, when it comes to exploitation, particularly at the level of the reuse of public-sector information or the promotion of cross-border services â a pan-European market for digital content, which must not take place to the detriment of universal access to public information or limit the benefits of development in the sector, either to consumers or to the main operators.
It must ensure that dynamism and innovation in the digital content sector are maintained.
Despite this, the programme deserves our support, principally for its objective of promoting linguistic and cultural diversity.
Parliamentâs amendments neither improve nor help to clarify the Commissionâs proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, I wanted to speak on the Brok report to explain why I believe this Cooperation Agreement to be vital for the promotion of cultural, economic and investment links between the EU and Pakistan.
I warmly welcome the agreement because trade is a means of opening up dialogue on those areas in which there are still major concerns about democracy and human rights.
We know Pakistan suffers from acute poverty and I hope that the approval of this agreement will help the government and people of Pakistan to deal with the poverty issues within their country.
Constructive engagement between the EU and Pakistan is urgently needed.
That is why I voted in favour of this agreement.
I appreciate there are still many concerns over human rights and democracy in Pakistan, but these are highlighted in the resolution.
This report and resolution clearly convey the importance that Parliament attaches to upholding human rights and democracy.
However, Pakistan has made considerable progress in this area, and the most effective way of ensuring that this continues and is strengthened is through enhanced dialogue and cooperation rather than isolation.
Â Â  . As the former rapporteur for this report and former chief observer to Pakistan, I have opposed the ratification of the third-generation agreement.
Ratification would confer legitimacy on a quasi-military regime, responsible for human rights abuses, a 'flawed' general election and nuclear proliferation.
Before the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I contacted Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Christian Solidarity Worldwide to request that they lobby MEPs to oppose ratification.
Christian Solidarity Worldwide promptly circulated a briefing to MEPs.
Human Rights Watch did not respond.
Amnesty International said that it was 'not able to provide more help âŠ due to the short notice given'.
Ratification was approved by only one vote in the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Before plenary, I contacted both Amnesty and Human Rights Watch again.
Neither responded.
In 2003 both issued reports condemning Pakistan.
In 2003, Amnesty described the 'systematic human rights violations'.
Human Rights Watch in 2003 called on Musharraf to 'transfer power to a legitimate government'.
Given the recent comments by Lotte Leicht in the European Voice that the EU has been weak in implementing human rights and democracy clauses, the lack of response is appalling.
It betrays those in Pakistan who risk their lives to defend human rights and democracy.
Â Â  . The Agreement with Pakistan includes measures concerning a quota increase of 15% for textiles and clothing products and, under the Generalised Preference System (GPS), there will be a zero duty on EU imports of clothing between 2002 and 2004.
In a previous question to the Commission concerning the existence of studies on the impact of this Agreement on the textile and clothing sector in the EU, in Portugal for example, the Commissioner said â so as to avoid having to say that there were no such studies â that it was âunlikely to have a significant impactâ.
Analysis of EU exports to Pakistan and exports from Pakistan to the EU shows that the textiles and clothing sector â in which Portugal is a producer â is one of the bargaining chips that allows Pakistan to import chemical products, transport machinery and equipment, and electrical goods from the most industrialised countries in the EU.
I must also express my opposition to the fact that, among other elements, the Agreement requires a commitment from Pakistan to conclude readmission agreements concerning Pakistani nationals living illegally in the EU.
This measure seeks to control illegal immigration by repressive means, such as repatriation.
Â Â  . Parliamentary democracy in Pakistan has never had a real chance thanks to the involvement of the army.
Whenever voters elect a decent government to power, it is eventually overthrown by the military.
Former Prime Minister Bhutto was even killed after being deposed, and his daughter, popular so long as she was regarded as his political heir, was also later thrown out of power.
This military intervention against progressive governments has created a breeding-ground for Islamic fundamentalism and for groups that want to set individual sections of the population against each other.
These groups have been able to continue their activities legally under the military regime.
Current President Musharraf was until a few years ago regarded as a dangerous general who had seized power in a coup, who wanted to make his country a nuclear power, was creating space for a very conservative interpretation of Islam and cooperated with the Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan.
Once he helped the American military intervention in Afghanistan he suddenly came to be seen as an American ally.
This proposal gives him the same status in Europe.
Once again, commercial and military interests take precedence over human rights.
It is astonishing that this Parliament should first approve an agreement with Pakistan and then later in the meeting adopt a resolution regretting the lack of human rights.
Â Â  . With the events of 11Â September 2001 still fresh in our minds, we must not forget the active role played by Pakistan in the fight against terrorism.
Pakistan has since shown itself to be a strong ally of the international community, notably in the fight against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
In view of Pakistanâs excellent contribution, the European Union resumed political dialogue in November 2001.
The areas of cooperation between Pakistan and the EU contained in this Agreement are extremely varied.
I should like to highlight those commitments aimed at combating discrimination and violence, developing democracy, strengthening trade and fostering economic cooperation.
It should be emphasised, however, that although human rights are considered to be a universal objective, observance of these rights must not be a prerequisite or a condition for relations between States.
In any event, this is the rapporteurâs opinion when he calls for this Agreement to be concluded.
Consequently, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . The title of the explanatory statement of this report, âEmployment: a European Ambitionâ, sounds like a sad joke when we know that there are 16 million unemployed in the European Union, and 5 million more if we take account of the new Member States.
Europe is, however, one of the richest regions on the planet.
The fact that old industrial nations such as Great Britain, Germany or France, which have further enriched themselves by pillaging the whole planet, are incapable of providing regular work and an adequate income for each member of society is a sign of ailing social organisation.
What the European Parliament proposes administering to the patient are the same snake-oil remedies, couched in mainly empty words, as are applied by the national States, ranging from the promise of training to proposed subsidies for certain sectors.
In this economic system, production and employment are the monopolies of a minority of capital holders who would have to be compelled to create jobs, but neither the Member States nor the European institutions are considering any such compulsion, any more than they are doing so where public services are concerned.
We voted against these so-called âemployment policiesâ, which are at best indecisive declarations and really just an excuse to give employers additional subsidies.
Â Â  . Whilst it is said that employment is one of Europeâs ambitions, the primacy of monetary policies, and in particular the Stability Pact, prevents us, regrettably, from prioritising jobs.
In fact, the opposite is true; all we have are statements of intent to please the public.
Where, indeed, are the practical measures to achieve full employment, to improve job quality and productivity and to enhance social cohesion and integration?
Unemployment continues to rise in the European Union â by 1.5 million between 2002 and 2003.
The number of multinational company relocations continues to rise, a phenomenon, which, in Portugal, has already led to thousands of job losses.
Poverty and social exclusion continue to rise.
Social inequality continues to rise, caused by liberalisation and privatisation, which have speeded up following the adoption of the Lisbon Strategy, especially in Portugal.
Against this backdrop, we could not vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  . â The Lisbon guidelines, the decisions by the Spring Summit and the guidelines in the Commission communication constitute the framework for a violent attack on the workers.
In the name of competitiveness and productivity, the aim is to reduce labour costs or non-wage costs, for which read step up exploitation and overturn social security rights.
Strict prudence, freezing/reducing wages/pensions and new privileges for businesses are being imposed, for the sake of the profits of big business.
ÎU employment policy aims to replace full/stable work with partial and temporary employment and, at the same time, overturn basic employment, wage and social security rights under the misleading title coined in Lisbon of 'sustainable development and full employment'.
The 8-hour day and collective agreements are under attack and the renting out of workers, a slave trade, unacceptably low pay and increased profits for the plutocracy are being imposed.
The millions of unemployed are now being joined by millions of underemployed.
These policies have not solved and cannot solve the unemployment problem, nor do they establish rights to safeguard the right to full/stable employment, because the real causes lie in the laws by which capitalism itself moves and operates.
We support the workers' fight to overturn these policies and claim a different, grass-roots orientated policy with enhanced social rights and higher pay in keeping with modern requirements.
Â Â  . The recent Commission report presented to the Brussels European Council, concerning the state of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, reveals alarming delays and gaps, both in terms of the transposition of the in question, and of raising awareness among Member States of the need to meet the ambitious targets that have been set, especially on the theme of âmore and better jobsâ.
The increase in unemployment in Europe is certainly disappointing.
The citizens of Europe as a whole, and those in Portugal in particular, demand more rigorous action from the European Union and the credibility of the process depends on reforms being stepped up at Member State level.
It is essential that we improve the monitoring of national performance (...).
It is, therefore, an increasingly âurgentâ priority, as the Commission has, indeed, acknowledged, to make the entire European project more credible, and to act with greater determination.
Priority must be given to helping young people enter the labour market and get their first job; to penalising fraud arising from the phenomenon of relocation; to preparing for technological and economic change, by exploiting new areas of work in the field of information technology; to taking practical steps to promote and encourage vocational training courses â including lifelong learning, by simplifying the procedures for access to funding; and to improving ways of disseminating best practice.
Â Â  Mr President, when I arrived in this Parliament, 18 years ago, in a situation very different from the one that is allowing me to speak now, and even before financial perspectives were discussed, there were already arguments about own resources and the Spanish Socialists were already fighting for idea of a citizens' graduated tax system.
Therefore, in the vote on the report by Mr Wynn, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, I voted with the French Socialists and with the Spanish Socialists in favour of the idea that, before enlargement, the Committee on Budgets â and this Parliament also â should have promoted the idea that to finance this Union, this Community, the easiest thing is to do it on the basis that everyone must pay, under a tax system which the citizen understands and which is not based on the tax-paying capacity of the States, but on the incomes of each of our fellow citizens.
Â Â  . We believe that the EUâs forthcoming budget should give priority to sustainable growth, in line with the Lisbon strategy, and support for the new Member States so that the historically important enlargement is a success.
The budgetâs priorities must be changed so that less money is invested in agricultural aid.
We are, at the same time, anxious about budget discipline and critical of the Commissionâs proposed increases in expenditure.
In this situation, we do not wish to express an opinion on the precise levels to be achieved by the new budget, partly because the priorities have not been established at this early stage and partly because we do not wish to tie the new Parliament to precise figures.
Where military action is concerned, we believe that this must be decided at national level.
Peacemaking efforts must take place within UN mandates.
Â Â  . The members of the Venstre, or Liberal, group present in the European Parliament voted against Amendments NosÂ 17 and 18.
Basically, we think that the Commissionâs proposal is too expensive.
It is too early, however, to tie ourselves to a percentage limit at a time when we do not know more about the political content of the future financial perspectives.
Â Â  . I voted against this report for the following reasons:
Firstly, I believe that the Commissionâs proposal for a financial framework for 2007 to 2013 is patently inadequate in terms of ensuring social and economic cohesion in an enlarged EU and of meeting our commitments to the least developed countries of the world.
Secondly, I am opposed to the political objectives of the established framework, which are already in line with the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ, and which reinforce the federalism, the neo-liberalism, the militarism and the excessively security-conscious face of the enlarged EU.
Thirdly, this report is ambiguous and implicitly accepts the Commissionâs proposal.
Lastly, I am opposed to extending the British correction mechanism to the remaining net contributors, and to replacing current national budget contributions with some kind of European tax.
I am, therefore, sorry that the amendments we tabled were rejected.
I welcome the fact, however, that Parliament rejected Amendments NosÂ 16, 17 and 18, which were intended to restrict the average annual Community budget to a maximum of 1% of Community GNP â in line with the wishes of the signatories of the âLetter of the Sixâ â and to renationalise, or, to put it more accurately, to do away with the Community regional policy.
Â Â  . The Netherlands is a significant net contributor to the European Union.
Unfortunately the reason for this is rarely discussed.
To start with, much of the European Union's imports arrive through the port of Rotterdam.
The relevant import duties are levied by Dutch customs and then transferred to Brussels; in fact, none of this is Dutch money.
A second reason lies in the agreements reached in Berlin by Mr Kok and Mr Zalm in 1999.
The outcome of these agreements is that Dutch agriculture now receives much less from the Brussels coffers than before.
Dutch farmers account for 7% of European agricultural production.
In 1999 the Netherlands still received 3.5% of the European agriculture budget, but by 2004 this had fallen to 2.1%.
In addition, the Netherlands receives only 1.2% of rural development funds because the then Dutch Government set a low priority on this issue during the negotiations.
The best way of improving the Netherlands' position as a net contributor is to ensure that in future the Netherlands receives a greater share of European Union agricultural and rural funds.
In the end it is not The Hague but the Dutch countryside that pays the European bill.
Correcting the flaws in the Berlin Agreement is the best way of restoring the Netherlands to its rightful position in the European Union.
That is far better than now restricting expenditure to just 1% of European GNP.
Â Â  . Enlargement is an historic event for which we Liberals have been working for a long time.
We are aware of the fact that there is a cost to enlargement and that this must be funded jointly.
Naturally, we must show solidarity with our new Member States.
Before we increase the budget, we must, however, review what can be cut down on, since the present budget is anything but watertight.
The holes must be filled before we demand further funds.
Where tax money is concerned, it does not matter what level of society we are talking about.
We need to nurture peopleâs confidence.
That is why the EU must set a good example by making better and more efficient use of already existing resources.
Â Â  . We voted against the Commission proposal and the report on the budgetary means of the enlarged Union for 2007-2013 because we disagree with core approaches to resources and objectives which they are called on to serve.
These objectives express basic choices of big business: the promotion of the anti-labour forecasts and arrangements of the Lisbon process, on the pretext of combating unemployment, support for and massive enlargement of a supranational and uncontrolled mechanism for prosecuting grass-roots movements, on the pretext of security, and the strengthening and militarisation of the ÎU, on the pretext of combating terrorism.
We condemn the endeavour to reduce the resources available for social and regional cohesion, however fake these objectives may have proven to be, and to increase resources to serve plans to wage war on and persecute the peoples of the ÎU and third countries.
We are against reflecting in future Community resources the principle of dealing at national level with the consequences of policies decided at Community level and we are against calling on the peoples to foot the bill twice.
The solution to the problems of the peoples of the Member States of the ÎU does not lie in a few pennies more or less; it lies in the fight by the workers for radical change to the policies exercised by their governments and the ÎU, in the fight for the sovereignty of grass-roots choices against those of big business.
Â Â  . I voted in favour.
A financial framework for a multiannual period (from 2007 until 2013, or a minimum period of five years), arising from the adoption of the financial perspectives, has undeniably lent financial and political stability to the European Unionâs actions.
Against this backdrop, the expectations of administrative operators, Member States and the public have resulted in efficiency gains and have led to more ambitious and significant projects.
The European Commission is proposing to meet three strategically crucial aims of the forthcoming financial perspective: to improve competitiveness, growth potential and territorial cohesion, to establish an area of security, freedom and justice and to develop external relations.
These aims will hopefully not be thwarted by the proposed top-down approach set out in the âLetter of the Sixâ, which seeks, primarily, to set an upper limit, as distinct from the bottom-up approach â which identifies political priorities and assesses needs and amounts required â as proposed by the Commission.
I warmly welcome the rapporteurâs work and would like to quote a most apt question that she poses: âis it fair to pretend that the amounts proposed allow matching resources to needs, especially the goals of Lisbon for growth and employment in an enlarged Union?â
I should like to mention at this juncture that the Bradbourn proposal for an amendment was resoundingly rejected â more than two-thirds voted against â and...
Â Â  . A question mark may be placed over how useful the cohesion policy will prove to be in an enlarged Union.
Even though the cohesion policy has been beneficial for certain countries such as Portugal, Spain or even Greece or Ireland in a Europe of 15 Member States, it can only arouse our concern in a Europe of 27 Member States.
With a population increasing from 68 to 116 million people, socio-economic disparities will double and the average GDP of the Union will fall by 12.5%.
What, moreover, can be said about employment in the current difficult context?
This enlargement can therefore only be accompanied by a general reduction in financing, in particular for the existing Member States.
Furthermore, the Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Traditions (CPNT) members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities believe that the disappearance of the Community initiative known as Leader + is particularly regrettable since the cohesion policy will now focus on cities to the detriment of rural areas.
The increasing desertification of these areas therefore appears, unfortunately, to be inevitable.
For all these reasons, we shall vote against this report.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report.
Solidarity between the peoples of the European Union, economic and social progress and the strengthening of cohesion feature among the European Unionâs general objectives.
For many, the main fear elicited by enlargement is that of seeing the regional funds currently available in the fifteen Member States disappear to the sole benefit of the ten new members.
Although this solidarity is at the core of the European contract, under no circumstances could partnership be abandoned.
The European Union must continue its support in the regions of the Fifteen affected in particular by natural geographic handicaps.
I am thinking in particular of mountain regions.
The Council, the Commission and Parliament cannot remain idle on this issue.
For a long time, the mountains have been comprehensively ignored by European programmes.
These areas have many resources. They require special attention in the agricultural sector (aid for the countryside and for young farmers) and within the framework of sustainable tourism development, as well as requiring specific support for SMEs (to avoid desertification and protect employment) and support for maintaining services.
The success of these guidelines hinges upon the European budget, which must match the ambitions we have set ourselves.
Â Â  . â The report again finds that EU regional policy has failed.
There are still huge inequalities in the development of several areas, while the prospects for the poorer Member States are unpropitious.
With enlargement, due to the purely statistical approach, numerous areas in the existing Member States risk being excluded from funding.
In Greece, for example, four areas will not be funded under the fourth CSF, while another three are on the borderline.
These areas account for 75% of the country's population and to date most of them were eligible Objective 1 areas, with acute and increasing social and economic problems which the proposed transitional 'temporary support' will only extend.
Greece is a typical example for another reason: the promotion and concentration of resources in certain areas, such as Attica, which exacerbates the wider regional problem of the over-concentration of the population in the towns.
At the same time, while there is a great deal of talk about supporting remote areas, the ÎU continues without justification â and despite our repeated proposals â to exempt the Aegean islands from special treatment for remote areas, despite the very serious problems they face.
'Cohesion' and 'increasing levels of development' clash in practice with the policies which preach them, in that these policies serve big business.
In practice, only divergence, marginalisation, unemployment and underdevelopment can be created.
Â Â  . I agree with the overall thrust of Mr Hatzidakisâs report.
I must, however, register my disappointment at the treatment of the outermost regions, and in particular Madeira and the Canary Islands.
A common approach to the outermost regions, as provided for in Article 299(2) of the Treaty, is conspicuous by its absence from the Commissionâs proposals.
I feel that it is inadequate merely to allude to a specific programme being established to offset the particular difficulties faced by the outermost regions, or to implement a ['wider European neighbourhood'] action aimed at facilitating cooperation with their neighbouring countries.
These instruments strike me as inadequate, given that when it comes to the crucial issue, it does not make sense, for example, for any future phasing out applied to Madeira and the Canaries to be exactly the same as that applied to continental European regions.
Where, then, is the special access to structural funds, as provided for in Article 299(2) of the Treaty?
We are aware of the permanent handicaps affecting the outermost regions.
We know how those handicaps seriously hamper their development.
We know that the outermost regions are, accordingly, the parts of Europe that have the greatest difficulty in making the most of opportunities arising from the great internal market and from the impending enlargement.
For these reasons I should like to ask the Commission to think again about...
Â Â  . The European Parliament appears to be edging towards agreement as to the funding of future regional policy.
A majority wants more money for the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund.
That will allow payments to the richest Member States to be held in check, not depriving the currently poorest Member States, and giving priority to the new Member States as they will for the time being have the lowest standard of living.
The thinking behind this is that the European Union will be more popular if everybody gets more.
It is expected that a Union that is generous to everyone will be looked on favourably by public opinion, the broadest section of society and local authorities.
So we still see placards wherever a project is being co-funded by the European Union publicising the fact.
The question of whether the money in question actually becomes available is not raised. Far less the question of whether these projects, many of which are undoubtedly beneficial, are most usefully conducted via the intervention of European officials and with European money.
EU funds can be better targeted at development aid to help those lagging behind.
Less money and less bureaucracy can produce better results.
All other projects should revert to the Member States.
Â Â  . Past experience has shown clearly that the policy of economic and social cohesion can make a significant contribution towards developing a region, provided that the provision of resources is reflected in high-quality projects.
Such projects can have a major impact in an area, and this has, fortunately, been the case in Portugal.
The unanimous support given to this report in the relevant committee also reflects the wide consensus among European citizens in favour of genuine European social cohesion throughout the European Union.
More specifically, I welcome the confirmation of principles such as, for example, the need to retain temporary phasing-in support, which will vary between 85% and 60%, for regions that no longer belong to Objective 1, because they are victims of what is known as the statistical effect of the limit of 75% of GDP being reduced due to enlargement.
I am also pleased that the Cohesion Fund is to be maintained as a support mechanism for major projects in the sectors of transport and the environment in Member States whose GNP is below 90% of the Community average.
I applaud the particular emphasis given to the needs of the outermost regions and of regions with the greatest structural problems.
Lastly, I welcome the move to encourage the various procedures to be simplified effectively and efficiently, as far as possible, since these often represent major obstacles to the implementation of programmes and projects.
Naturally, I voted in favour.
Â Â  Mr President, in 18 years I have also heard Mr Balfe speak on very many occasions and almost always I have held opinions on the subjects he has spoken about.
Today I have the opportunity to speak on an amendment to the Kuckelkorn report which he has presented, in which MrÂ Balfe once more asks that he be treated as a European official.
But he is not telling the whole truth.
He forgot to mention that European officials â a body from which I am proud to come â only have one social security system.
The honourable Members â amongst whom I now find myself â also only have one.
He is asking for another one, so if he wants to go on asking for privileges in addition to those provided by the laws and regulations of his own country, let him do so.
But since â as I hope and believe â he will not come back as an MEP in the next session, I urge Mr Balfe to prepare himself for an examination to become a European official and thereby obtain everything he has repeatedly been asking for.
Â Â  Your timing is impeccable, but I am a bit worried that you will try to become another Mr Fatuzzo.
Â Â  . The main function of the European Investment Bank (EIB) is, in conjunction with the European Investment Fund, to support capital investment that promotes sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.
It provides financing for small businesses (45% of the overall total of loans), for research, for environmental protection and for basic infrastructure.
Of course, these projects go hand in hand with the Community regional policy, but the EIB also supports the implementation of the Lisbon neo-liberal agenda.
For the first time, the EIB is to present to Parliament its Supervisory Committeeâs report, which complements its annual report, and this is something that we welcome.
We must, however, look carefully at the doubts raised as to the competence of the bankâs management and at accusations of a lack of transparency at the EIB.
Parliamentary control must be strengthened.
We therefore welcome the decision to hold a public hearing in Autumn 2004 into the EIBâs activities and political guidelines.
I am unhappy that the information published by the EIB on its website is presented in only three Community languages.
Given the range of the EIBâs work, information on it should be available in all of the Communityâs official languages.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to give an explanation of vote to explain my extreme concern over the Eurostat scandal and the European Commission's failure to take responsibility.
Five years ago, almost to the day, the Santer Commission was forced to resign because it was 'difficult to find anyone with the slightest sense of responsibility'.
That caused the collapse of the previous Commission.
Nothing has changed, because no one has been prepared to take responsibility for Eurostat.
Despite the fact that EUR 5 million has gone missing; despite the fact that money has been channelled into bogus research by bogus companies, some of which it appears are owned by senior members of Eurostat; despite the fact that taxpayers' money appears to have been channelled into staff perks â such as a riding school and a volleyball team â we have seen no resignations from the Commission over this issue and no acceptance of responsibility.
Mr Solbes Mira's response seems to be just that he did not know what was happening.
This seems to be a charter for Commissioners just to tell their civil servants not to inform them of the dubious activities going on in their departments, so that, on the basis of the Commission's analysis, the Commissioner will get off scot-free.
We know that Mr Solbes Mira has resigned from the Commission but not over this issue, so there is still a complete failure on the part of the European Commission to take responsibility for this waste of taxpayers' money.
That is a matter of extreme concern to me and my British Conservative colleagues.
I hope that before our vote on the motion of censure in May the Commission will accept its responsibility and do something serious to take responsibility for Eurostat and to clean up the EU and stop the unacceptable waste and abuse of taxpayers' money.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this resolution, because asking the European Commission for explanations regarding the management of Eurostat, in the same way as regarding all other activities or decisions, is the least we can do.
We are in favour of all institutions operating with total transparency and of the whole population being able to monitor not only the decisions taken, but also the reasons for which they are taken.
Â Â  . There are aspects of the Eurostat affair â nepotism, conflicts of interest, secret accounts â that are redolent of the situation that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.
Fraud and irregularities exceeded EURÂ 6Â million, which in some cases is probably only the tip of the iceberg.
This affair has also shed light on serious problems and irregularities in working methods and internal monitoring, on the part of both the Commission and OLAF, such as the lack of effective enforcement of existing rules.
The Commissioners directly involved must not be allowed to get away scot-free.
It is appalling that the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat has not accepted political responsibility and that the Commission President has not asked him to resign.
This fresh case shows, among other things, how the outsourcing of services by the Commission readily lends itself to such situations.
The very least we can hope for, once again, is that the Commission learns its lessons and tells us how it proposes to avoid a repeat of this type of problem in the future.
Â Â  . I voted against the âEurostat resolutionâ to protest against the way Parliament acted in this affair.
At the root of the âscandalâ are accusations by certain newspapers regarding âmisappropriation of fundsâ, âpersonal enrichmentâ and ânepotismâ on the part of Eurostat managers.
Certain fellow Members in need of publicity demanded the heads of four Commissioners.
Even though the final report on the enquiry conducted by OLAF, promised for June 2003, is still not available, the resolution indicates that the âscandalâ is limited to breaches of procedures.
Procedures are important.
Our Union, however, is in the process of multiplying procedures to the point where there will soon be more inspectors than people being inspected.
Meanwhile, and on dubious grounds, the reputations and careers of many Eurostat officials have been destroyed.
More than 400 people have lost their jobs.
Parliament is content with an innocuous and useless resolution.
Â Â  . In July 2003 the European Commission suspended the activities of the managers of the statistical office Eurostat as frauds which had been brought to light some time ago were still continuing.
At that point I immediately demanded transparent action.
Investigations by bodies dependent on the Commission are pointless as they have to keep their findings secret.
Fraud, embezzlement and nepotism will only be prevented in the future if public opinion is properly informed and able to form a view.
This could be done by a parliamentary inquiry.
At the end of September 2003 a secret report was submitted to members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and still the European Commission acts as if it bore no responsibility in the matter.
The person first appointed to handle the matter, Commissioner Solbes, is now a Minister in the new Spanish Government.
All efforts are being made to prevent discussion of a motion of censure against the European Commission signed by me and others.
Malicious delay in placing this issue on the agenda means that this motion cannot be put to a vote this week.
After 1 May the number of signatories will fall to below 10% as a result of enlargement of this Parliament.
The chairman of the Green Group has called on his members to sink this initiative by withdrawing their signatures.
The problems of 1999 persist, but the Prodi Commission is now ignoring them.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of the report, despite our not agreeing with the extremely watered down way in which it describes the stranglehold of big business upon the means of expression, everywhere making little more than a nonsense of the term âfreedom of expressionâ.
MrÂ Berlusconi, who is both Prime Minister and one of the largest Italian press magnates, is, in himself, almost a caricature of this stranglehold exercised by big business over the media.
Â Â  . The British Labour Members voted against paragraph 53.
We do not accept the criticisms and overall content of this paragraph.
Nonetheless, we voted in favour of the resolution with our reservation, due to the importance of this timely report.
Â Â  . The media holdings of Silvio Berlusconi are far from ideal and could cause a conflict of interest.
However, this report is far from balanced.
The title alone must suggest that freedom of expression and information are in question in Italy under the Berlusconi government.
That is stretching a point to say the least.
Practically all strands of political opinion in Italy are represented by their own newspapers.
RAI, the State broadcaster, gives a voice both to the majority and the opposition.
Indeed, even Berlusconi's own vehicles express criticism of the government.
We in Belgium, where as in many other Member States, the media is concentrated in a small number of hands, can only dream of this.
A certain trend in left-wing opinion is very unhappy at the idea that they cannot entirely monopolise the media.
The existence of a right-wing, or apparently right-wing, counter-force in the media is seen by them as unacceptable provocation.
That is the spirit emanating from this report.
Â Â  . We are concerned at the growing concentration of media ownership among an ever-decreasing number of companies.
As has been highlighted, the highest concentration of the audiovisual market anywhere in Europe is in Italy, where the market is dominated by two players, RAI and Mediaset.
Criticism of the situation in Italy must not, however, be used to deflect attention from what is happening in other countries.
In Portugal, more than one hundred of the main national media organisations are in the hands of half a dozen large companies, which, at the very least, is an alarming state of affairs.
Freedom of expression, access to information and freedom of employment are all in danger; this is the logic of business taken to extremes.
This reality is reflected in the concerted assault by neo-liberal policies, of which media domination is one weapon.
The media is, indeed, one of the areas in which the battle over ideology and class domination is most obviously being fought.
Everything must be done, through legislation and other means, to reverse the situation, to reduce the excesses and abuses taking place, and staunchly to defend public radio and television worthy of the name.
Â Â  . Ownership of or control over newspapers, television and websites is becoming increasingly important in managing information and propaganda.
If all media become concentrated in the same hands then we will be going back to the days in the past when the media had less reach and often a monopoly was created involving the authorities, a powerful party, the Church or a regional publisher.
People only heard one opinion as to what was good or bad, and how society should develop.
Government and big business are still trying to achieve that.
In Spain recently the previous government tried to shift the blame for three major bomb attacks onto a separatist movement rather than an international movement because that would be better for them in the elections.
In Italy, the Prime Minister controls the commercial company MEDIASET as its owner and the State-run company RAI thanks to his role in government.
The Christian Democrat group shies away from criticising this situation and have attempted to keep this topic off the agenda by ignoring the problems, holding endless procedural debates and submitting enormous numbers of amendments.
They are abusing democracy in order to abolish democracy.
I support the rapporteur in her attempts to deal with cable monopolies as well and to push for statutory measures aimed at protecting freedom and diversity of opinion in the media.
Â Â  . We would fully welcome â and indeed we would have done so a long time ago â a serious and fitting condemnation of illegality and lack of democracy â not just concerning correct and acceptable information.
On the specific point of information, our complaint about the current situation in Italy would have been, and indeed is, much more radical, but this is due to the fact that MrÂ Berlusconi, who put himself forward as an alternative to the Italian situation of contempt for the law and even for democracy in Italy, has today become the last in a long line of those who, for a second time, risk bringing a type of Italian disease to Europe.
Those who have today accused MrÂ Berlusconi are the very ones who for decades created, practised and imposed what is at the root of what still happens today and what is clearly getting worse in Italy.
This is why, together with other radical Members, I voted against the Boogerd-Quaak report.
Â Â  . Regretting that the motion was rejected, I would like to finish presenting the arguments interrupted when the motion was presented in plenary.
Some say that the subject of the report is covered by Article 7 of the Treaty.
In that case, however, we should have acted accordingly, which we have not done.
Others say that the report has its basis in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Even if, however, this were already in force, note should be taken of Article 51 â retained, moreover, in the draft Constitution â according to which the Charter is applicable to the European institutions and the Member States only in the case of national actions implementing Community law.
In fact, that is not the case here.
Finally, this report is not there to settle an Italian issue.
It is clear to everyone that this is an Italian dispute, but we must specifically refrain from interfering in national conflicts, whether they break out in Italy or in any other Member State.
This resolution tries dangerously to usurp powers that do not belong to us.
It is detrimental to us all.
It represents an injustice and a threat.
We must, moreover, be very aware that an injustice caused to one Member State â in this case, Italy and other Member States mentioned â is always a threat hanging over the heads of us all.
It is a threat to democracy.
It is a threat to the rule of law.
Â Â  . This report is worthy of our full attention and represents a serious breach of the law, as I made clear at the end of the vote in the parliamentary committee and in plenary when I tabled motions of inadmissibility and for the matter to be referred back to the committee.
Because I was shocked by the flagrant violation of European law, imposed by the left-wing âdictatorship of the majorityâ, I did not take part in the vote, in line with the outcome of discussions between the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
This situation has had a genuinely tortuous history, which began last summer.
Since last summer, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, claims to have used the procedure laid down in Article 7(1) of the Treaty as a means of demonstrating supposed violations of freedom of expression and of information in Italy.
They did no such thing, however, and, in any event, such an attitude is disgraceful.
What this amounts to is a purely political attack on the Italian Government and, as such, it is appalling that Parliament has been hijacked for this purpose.
Furthermore, the subsidiarity principle has clearly been violated.
We cannot allow Parliament to be used to mount purely political attacks or to impose its will on the sovereignty of States.
Â Â  . This matter includes a number of important points concerning the need for media pluralism, the value of protecting consumers through transparency in advertising, and the right of reply.
Moreover, criticism was directed against the ownership structure and the concentration of power within the Swedish media.
The basic problem, however, is that, through a dubious issue of procedure, Parliament was not given the opportunity to vote on the amendments that had been tabled and that were aimed at improving the report.
No less than 338 amendments had been submitted to plenary, and not a single one of them was debated.
Most of these amendments came from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and, as a result of the proposals never having been put to the vote, the PPE-DE Group chose not to take part in the vote.
I agree with the PPE-DE Groupâs criticism to the effect that the amendments should have been debated in plenary, but I nonetheless think that it is the duty of each elected Member to take part in the vote.
I therefore chose to participate by consistently abstaining in all the votes, including the final vote.
Â Â  . I would like to underline the legitimacy of this report.
One of the roles of the European Parliament is to use its legitimacy as a representative voice of the citizens of the Union constantly to promote and defend fundamental rights.
Freedom of expression and information necessarily implies pluralism of the media, especially the audio-visual media.
We therefore find ourselves faced with a real European problem, since this pluralism of the media, which is absolutely essential both for cultural diversity and for democracy, is still not guaranteed.
The Italian example, characterised by almost exclusive control by the same person, in his capacity both as Prime Minister and as a private owner, is unfortunately only the most flagrant and grotesque example of what is in danger of happening to us all if measures are not taken quickly.
In this regard, we can only wonder about this Commission and this Council, which do not hesitate to take heavy-handed action, for example in dismantling the public rail service â as we see again today â in the name of the fight against monopolies in the single market and of supposed benefits for users, but which seem paralysed when it comes to preventing private monopolies in television.
Â Â  Mr President, many of us today have voted for the trade agreement with Pakistan in the belief that this is a sensible and essential step forward to progress the issue of human rights and further democratisation of Pakistan.
It may at first seem a little peculiar to see who is voting on the one hand for the trade agreement while at the same time supporting the resolution on the issue of human rights in Pakistan.
I do not believe there is a contradiction.
The votes today are quite sensible and straightforward.
We have pushed forward the issue of developing economic and trade links with Pakistan.
We have pushed forward the issue of developing Pakistan's economy which, I believe, was an important step in ensuring that we will see further democratisation in Pakistan, further work towards the development of human rights, and fulfilment of the demands made in our second resolution which I was happy to support.
It is a good day for Pakistan, for Kashmir, and for the Indian subcontinent and I am very pleased to have been here today.
Â Â  . The resolution on which we voted today concerning the state of human rights and democracy in Pakistan, should be viewed in the context of the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on partnership and development.
Voting in favour thus entails, first and foremost, being perfectly aware of the serious breaches of human rights and democracy that occur in Pakistan and, consequently, exerting on Pakistan all the pressure that we can and must exert in order to reverse that trend.
Additionally, the resolution has enabled those people who fight for human rights and democracy to vote in favour of signing the Agreement.
Given that human rights and democracy are two of the main aims of the European Union â and ones to which I subscribe completely â they must be seen as such: as aims and not as conditions for relations between countries.
The pragmatic context of international relations would justify such prerequisites, but the countries involved would become isolated, and therefore unable to persuade other countries to meet these aims.
This explains why I voted as I did.
Â Â  . I have chosen to vote against entering into this cooperation agreement with Pakistan because of the absence of human rights in the country, for example in the area of religious freedom, with the Christian minority living under difficult conditions.
The Pakistani regime chooses to continue to give the military major influence over the country, and this at the expense of more democratic development.
The development of events is worrying, especially in the light of the fact that the Senate has passed new constitutional laws that extend the militaryâs influence and make it a permanent feature.
Moreover, the regime has chosen to imprison opponents.
Given that the European Union has a major responsibility for promoting human rights in the world and the fact that these values are to form the basis of cooperation agreements with third countries, I find it illogical that the European Parliament has now, for all that, recommended this agreement.
Â Â  . The resolution before us reflects the contradictions of current relations between the various countries of the EU and the USA.
By failing to point out the seriousness of the international situation â of which the most glaring examples are the unacceptable military occupation of Iraq and the impossible situation in Palestine â and by making only mild criticism of the USA, the resolution reaffirms the desire to reach an understanding with the USA to join forces to dominate the world.
Once again, the need is stressed for a âwell-balanced partnershipâ, the âdivision of tasksâ, âburden sharingâ, creating a âcommunity of actionâ with common priorities (, the UN, the Middle East, terrorism, the proliferation of WMD, China, Russia and the International Criminal Court), completing the âTransatlantic Marketâ by 2015â, strengthening NATO and militarising the EU as its âEuropean pillarâ, developing Transatlantic defence companies and markets, and so forth.
It is significant that, at a time when the Spanish Government has taken the decision to withdraw its troops from Iraq, the majority of Parliament chooses not to adopt a position.
This is understandable.
At a time when the major powers are seeking to overcome their differences by legitimising the occupation of Iraq with a UN resolution, the resistance of the Iraqi people to the occupying forces and the clearly expressed will of the Spanish people are obstacles to overcoming those differences.
Â Â  . The European Parliamentary Labour Party reiterates that if we want to pursue our policies of multilateralism then positive engagement with the United States is required, not simply criticism in areas where there is disagreement.
In particular, pre-emptory withdrawal of troops from Iraq would simply further threaten the security of the Iraqi people.
The solution can only lie in the transfer of political control, working with the support of the United Nations, in order to support the emergence of a peaceful, democratic and prosperous Iraq.
Â Â  .â The resolution on Transatlantic relations proposes strengthening cooperation between the ÎU and the USA, through the creation of 'a long-term collaborative framework for cooperation and the launching of a joint Action Programme', including in the military sector, the main pretext being 'the Fight on Terrorism'.
Of course, it does not fail to formulate a wish list about the need for this fight to be carried out with respect for 'human rights', but it does not say a word about the drastic measures for restricting individual rights which have been launched.
At a time when the aggression of the USA has exceeded all precedents, the resolution comes to silence all those, including in Greece, who insist on seeing the ÎU as a worthy opponent of the USA and ÎÎÎ€Î, stressing that 'ÎÎÎ€Î remains a fundamental guarantee of transatlantic stability and security' and that the ESDP will be developed 'to complement ÎÎÎ€Î' and will be its 'substantial reinforcement'.
Despite the fact that the report also formulates proposals for controlling arms, it remains a report which is absolutely in keeping with the new imperialist order.
Â Â  . We have today voted on the report on human rights in the world in 2003 and the EUâs policy on the matter.
It is in many ways a good analysis with well-formulated conclusions.
We believe, however, that the report should have been confined to those areas of human freedoms and rights that are part of the UN Charter.
By extending the report and introducing new so-called human rights with the character of social rights, the demands for traditional human freedoms and rights and the criticism of countries that do not comply with these are weakened.
We are not, for example, opposed to social rights, dependent upon a countryâs economic conditions.
The position of the disabled is, of course, infinitely better in Sweden than in poor countries such as Bangladesh and Laos.
There is, however, no reason for taking a less serious view of violations of human and democratic freedoms and rights, just because these are committed in poor countries.
Â Â  . Whilst I agree with numerous points in this annual parliamentary report, I must highlight the way in which I believe it is being used, yet again, as a political tool, whereby countries considered âfriendsâ are protected and others singled out as targets by the USA or by the EU are subject to criticism; a clear case of double standards.
Nevertheless, this year it expresses âgrave concern at the continuation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflictâ.
Despite holding the Israeli Government and the Palestinian people almost equally responsible â a position to which I am strongly opposed â it does condemn the assassinations carried out by Israel and the ongoing Israeli activity to establish settlements, which includes allowing settlers illegally to move into the occupied territories.
There is mild criticism of the continued expropriation of land for the construction of the so-called âsecurity fenceâ.
This is the very least we can do, in light of the denial by the Israeli Government, with the complicity and support of the USA, of the most basic rights of the Palestinian people, who are subjected to the most brutal violence.
As for the brutal aggression and occupation of Iraq by the USA and its allies, not one word in the report...
Â Â  . â 2003 was an even blacker year for human rights, a year in which the people of Iraq were subject to the unprovoked and murderous attack of the USA and its European allies, while the people of Afghanistan and the Balkans continue to sigh and bleed beneath the boot of the conquerors.
The crude interventions by the imperialist powers, with the fomentation of conflict in every corner of the world, are a daily occurrence.
The murder of the Palestinian people continues.
Human rights are trampled over on a daily basis, while poverty and misery in both the third world and the developed countries grow worse.
The ÎU and other imperialist centres bear almost sole responsibility for this situation.
The resolution, despite its positive references, states that 'progress has been made' on respect for human rights, 'in particular through the European Union's commitment'.
At the same time, it fully supports the hysterical stance of the EU and the USA on terrorism and says nothing about the trampling underfoot, on the pretext of combating terrorism, of basic democratic and social freedoms or the countless violations of the USA, simply hinting at some, without saying who is responsible, with the exception of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay.
For these reasons, we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece did not vote for the report.
We express our support for the peoples who are fighting against the New Order for their rights.
Â Â  . The report before us is an annual report, which is wide-ranging and addresses a variety of subjects and should be analysed with great care.
The original version of the report focused on just three areas and contained some provisions that were entirely out of place, particularly in areas such as terrorism and so-called reproductive health.
The rapporteur accepted a large number of amendments, which led to this less unbalanced version.
The various situations highlighted in the ânewâ report are, nevertheless, almost all taken out of context.
The document contains issues that do not fall under the traditional concept of âhuman rightsâ; indeed, they go far beyond the original meaning.
I voted against the report.
I object to the way in which the report has far exceeded its scope.
I cannot allow the European Union to use this method â endeavouring to bring, on a permanent basis, all other kinds of rights under the umbrella of âhuman rightsâ â to find an easy way of extending its scope for action.
It is wrong for the EU to seek to increase its competences by means of deliberately blurring concepts which, in turn, makes it more difficult effectively to safeguard fundamental human rights.
What we are seeing is a clever move that will subtly pave the way for the European Union to deem the most diverse fields âhuman rightsâ and to intervene in any area it wishes.
Â Â  .â The procedure to repeat the trial of Leyla Zana and her three other Kurdish fellow members of the Turkish parliament, at the request of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, was a parody of a trial just like the original proceedings which sentenced her to 15 years in prison for 'crimes' of opinion.
The new judgment against Leyla Zana and her three fellow members is a fresh insult to the European Parliament, which honoured Leyla Zana with the Sakharov prize in 1995, it is an insult to the European Court of Human Rights and it is an insult to European law and civilisation.
As long as Leyla Zana and her fellow members remain in prison in Turkey, as long as people are being sentenced for crimes of opinion, it is clear that any reforms in Turkey clash with the deeply conservative state.
We expect the Commission, in view of the report on Turkey to be issued towards the end of the year, to multiply its efforts to bring about the release of Leyla Zana and a general amnesty for prisoners being detained for 'crimes' of opinion.
Â Â  . I am appalled by the decision by the State Security Court in Ankara to reconfirm the fifteen-year prison sentences, first handed down in 1994, to Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak, Turkish MPs of Kurdish origin representing the Democracy Party (DEP), due to their activities in support of the fundamental rights of Kurdish people.
This was a disgraceful decision that brought to a close a new trial, begun on 28Â March 2003, which was the result of a concerted international campaign to free Leyla Zana and her fellow MPs.
The fresh trial had been prompted by the 2001 ruling handed down by the European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg, which noted the lack of independence and impartiality of the State Security Court, and breaches of the defendantsâ rights, which were to occur again in this second trial.
The European Union is called on simply to condemn this decision and to request that Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak be freed from prison.
The verdict is an illustration of the current situation in Turkey, a country that wishes to accede to the European Union, but which has thousands of political prisoners, where the Kurdish people are denied the most basic rights and which continues its military occupation of part of Cyprus.
Â Â  . By noting the continued stagnation of the European economy, the report takes the opposite view to the Commission.
Unfortunately, the only aim of this realistic observation is to serve to justify the call for the Member States and the European institutions to come still more to the aid of the employers.
It is somewhat comical to hear this Parliament, dominated though it is by defenders of the free-market economy and by destroyers of public services, resort to support from the state in coming to the aid of the European economy.
In fact, this report describes what some Member States, such as France and Germany, are already doing. Whilst observing the Maastricht criteria, these countries are shamelessly running up their budget deficits in order to help those same employers who remain extremely determined to maintain, or even increase, their profits in a period of stagnation.
Whether the Member States choose to support employers through inflation, that is to say by lowering purchasing power, or through budgetary austerity, that is to say by cutting back on public services, shedding jobs and freezing salaries, or through a combination of the two, it will in any case be the working classes that will pay.
What you call your broad economic policy guidelines actually seek to reduce the share that the world of work has in the national revenue in order to increase the share of the wealthy class.
Clearly, we cannot but denounce this policy and oppose it.
Â Â  . We voted against this report because Parliament supports the monetary and budgetary orthodoxy â the neo-liberal politics â of the EUâs economic policy guidelines.
The report maintains emphasis on the structural reforms of the Lisbon Strategy, such as measures to make the labour market more flexible, in other words making workers more adaptable and contractual provisions more pliable, which has led to greater insecurity in industrial relations.
This is not all, however.
The report paves the way for the private sector to enter the fields of pensions and health, at a time when over 1.5 million workers in the European Union have swelled the ranks of the unemployed since 2001, at a time when more and more companies are closing down and others relocating, and when the long-trumpeted upturn is taking its time to appear.
The right approach would be a policy of economic regeneration, committed to reinvigorating production and labour, with the aim of promoting economic growth, jobs and social and economic cohesion.
The Stability Pact and the process of liberalisation and privatisation must be suspended immediately; we must combat company relocations, promote productive investment and stop encouraging precarious contractual arrangements, such as short-term contracts.
We were consequently very unhappy to see that our proposals were not included in the final resolution.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.(3)
(4)
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0182/2004) by Mrs Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on women in South-East Europe (2003/2128(INI)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, as you know, following the fall of the Berlin wall, the area of south-east Europe was shaken by ethnic quarrels and armed violence, resulting in deep political, economic and social changes.
In the report I have drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I present the situation of women in south-east Europe as configured during the transitional period, compared with the previous situation.
My report complements the reports on relations between the Union and the countries of south-east Europe and the progress of these countries within the framework of the stabilisation and association agreements.
My intention was to present an integrated picture of the position of women in an area in which there are important differences between countries, but a great deal of similarity in the problems which they face.
The report focuses mainly on the following sectors: education and economic activity, participation in democratic institutions, violence against women and sexual exploitation, health and reproductive rights and trafficking in women and children.
In most countries of the Balkans, there has of course been a considerable improvement in the situation of women over the last five years.
Nonetheless, the basic problems remain and the question of addressing them is not very high on the political agenda of the countries in the area.
There is no sign of change in numerous sectors and, where there is some change, it is very slow in coming.
Armed conflicts, the perceptions of the regimes, traditional social prejudices, outdated practices and attitudes and ethnic quarrels have marginalised women.
It is telling that women from various minority groups, such as the Roma, receive no or little state care.
The report analyses the problems, giving typical examples of the weaknesses in each individual country, in order to send a strong message to the governments of these countries, so that they can immediately develop actions and initiatives to combat discrimination against women and actively promote gender equality.
As far as education and the economy are concerned, the acute changes have differentiated to a major degree both the positions and possibilities of different generations of women.
Demographic trends today demonstrate that family life is no longer a primary life objective for women, who are more interested in their economic independence and professional achievement and are therefore investing more time and energy in education.
In numerous countries in the area, such as Greece, most university students are women.
As far as professional life is concerned, women are more often employees, in other words they are employed in the tertiary sector, in services, and are less often employers than men.
They are also less often self-employed.
In the sectors in which women are mainly employed, pay is generally low and there are few prospects.
I also note the higher percentage of unemployment and poverty among women in the Balkans.
As far as the participation of women in political decision-making is concerned, the situation is rather disappointing in most countries, although this participation is tending to increase constantly.
One of the main similarities between these countries in the political sector is the fast spread of non-governmental organisations which are active in womenâs rights and are making a significant contribution to strengthening the position of women in employment and politics.
However, I must point out that, in comparison with other regions of Europe, such as central Europe, the Balkan countries have the highest level of exclusion of women from political decision-making positions.
As far as women's health and reproductive rights are concerned, I stress that particularly stressful living conditions, by which I mean the economy of survival based on the intensive exploitation of female human resources, the increase in violence against women and the fact that, in numerous countries, the health care systems have collapsed, put women's health at real risk.
Similarly, in the Balkan countries, domestic violence is often one problem with dramatic dimensions; it is also basically a problem which is inadequately recognised and addressed.
This problem, together with trafficking, has reached explosive dimensions.
Nonetheless, in the entire area, there is a lack of serious and systematic statistics on the problem, a lack of adequate legislative regulation, monitoring and guidance and a lack of economic and psychological support for victims.
As far as trafficking in women is concerned, south-east Europe in general has been identified in recent years as an area in which the trafficking networks act almost unimpeded.
Trafficking prospers because it is of course economically viable and it constitutes a basic part of the sexual economy and part of consumer society.
Trafficking in the area is a real industry, consisting of small- and large-scale businesses and local and international networks.
The industry in question has political support and economic resources in the countries of origin, transit and destination, in the form of corrupt officers, and I should like to quote as a typical example the scandal of sexual slavery in Montenegro.
A woman from Moldavia, the victim of trafficking, recognised key political figures as clients and/or as those involved in the white slave trade.
I should also like to stress that the peace forces in the area have increased this phenomenon.
To close, I should like to say that it is certain that the road towards the economic and social development of south-east Europe and respect for the rights of women depends on their integration into European structures and I should like to remind you that the European Council in Thessaloniki in June 2003 emphasised that it supported the European prospects of the countries of the western Balkans.
Europe cannot be secure and at peace while violence, ethnic hatred and violations of fundamental rights are a daily occurrence within its borders.
The role of women in reconciliation, peaceful coexistence and development in the countries of south-east Europe must be given the recognition it deserves by the European Union and strengthened in every possible way.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission welcomes the adoption of the Karamanou report on women in South-East Europe and the many valuable observations and proposals which it contains.
In its relations with the countries of South-East Europe the EU is striving to promote stability, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human and minority rights, including of course gender equality.
The Commission pays the utmost attention to ensuring that gender issues are integrated into the mainstream of all European Community assistance programmes as a cross-cutting issue.
It is nevertheless clear that in a number of countries the situation is far from ideal and is a problem of great political importance.
The Thessaloniki agenda for the Western Balkans as endorsed by the EU-Western Balkans Summit in June 2003 specifically states that support for activities to defend women's rights and improve their situation should be better reflected in EU policies towards the region.
Involvement of non-governmental organisations, civil society and local authorities in EU-supported policies and activities is of paramount importance.
Regarding trafficking in human beings, in the Thessaloniki agenda the EU also urges the countries of the region to act both domestically and regionally in line with the principles of the EU and proposals contained in the Brussels Declaration of September 2002.
The EU assigns high priority to victim assistance, training programmes for competent bodies, exchange of information, public awareness, and strategy development.
In this context, coordination of all international actors is essential.
Most recently the Commission has pointed out in its 2004 report on the Stablisation and Association Process for South-East Europe that gender is insufficiently ensured and domestic violence remains a problem in several countries.
Although improvements have been made in certain countries on issues such as equal salaries, equal treatment of men and women concerning employment, training, career advancement and working conditions, and women's participation in government, progress is generally slow and insufficient.
Under the regional CARDS programme for 2002, the Commission published an open call for submission of proposals for support for the rule of law, good governance, public accountability and freedom of opinion.
Promoting the equal participation of men and women in the democratisation process was one of the priorities of the CARD stabilisation programme for 2002.
Of the twenty-two projects selected for funding which are ongoing until 2005, one is funding a women's leadership programme and another a project on women in media.
The rest relate to work with various representatives of civil society to improve the access of citizens more generally to the democratic process.
With regard to the 2003 CARDS regional programme on democratic stabilisation, an open call for submissions was issued recently and the deadline for receiving proposals is 28 April.
While this programme does not specifically target women, it supports equality of men and women and the participation of diverse civil society groups and associations at local grassroots level in the process of strengthening democratic structures.
Furthermore, an additional call for proposals under the 2003 CARDS regional programme is due to be issued soon.
The programme proposes to strengthen capacities of civil society network associations in order to deliver better services to their member organisations.
This constitutes a logical continuation of the 2002 initiatives and we expect and hope that women's associations will submit sound proposals in response to this call.
Finally, a new CARDS multiannual programming cycle is currently under preparation and the suggestions in the Karamanou report will be duly taken into account in the context of this exercise.
As pointed out in the report, problems have also occurred and still exist in certain candidate countries.
In order to address this situation, from 1999 to 2003 gender equality projects under the PHARE national programme and MEDA totalled more than EUR 13 million.
During the same period, participation by the candidate countries in the Community programmes involved close to EUR 1Â million and gender equality projects financed under civil society programmes totalled EUR 2.5 million.
Once they are members of the European Union, these states will obviously be subject to the same obligations and benefit from the same instruments as other Member States.
Issues related to gender equality and the improvement of women's employment are raised in the regular reports on Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.
This matter is being dealt with in the negotiations on the Union's social for the first two countries.
Furthermore, as pointed out by the honourable Member, more that 20 projects have been financed for civil society actions to improve women's conditions.
Recent legislation adopted in the three countries is improving the legal situation of women and the Commission is following the implementation of this legislation very closely.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Balkans are an area of vital importance to the European Union.
My political group has supported their move towards Europe and all the development and cooperation procedures which have been applied.
Historic experience and daily life in the European Union have demonstrated that development and prosperity cannot be achieved without democracy, without respect for human rights and special attention to women's rights, without making full use of the manpower of both sexes, without a dynamic civil society.
That is why I wish to welcome the initiative by Mrs Karamanou in drafting a report on the rights of women in the Balkans.
Within the framework of the monitoring of the stabilisation and association agreements, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has drafted various opinions, one of which I had the honour of drafting, in which it emphasises the problems faced by women in the Balkans and the need to integrate equality into all policies.
The seriousness, however, of the issues, as presented to us by the rapporteur in her report, and the challenge of addressing these issues, for the sake of development in the area and good collaborative relations with the European Union, warrant a special report.
I also take this opportunity to welcome the statement by Commissioner Nielson on including many of the proposals by my fellow Member in her report in the new CARDS programme.
Finally, I wish to say that, in the face of this challenge, we are responsible on both sides.
We, as the European Union, must activate all the mechanisms and potential for a good collaborative approach with the Balkans, but also the countries of the Balkans must take serious account of the fact that democracy and standards are the best guarantee of their development and their integration into the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate my colleague, Anna Karamanou, on the report she is presenting today, which contains an enormous amount of information and which will be very useful when trying to resolve some of the problems we are facing today.
We are fundamentally talking about democracy, Mr President, because we are talking about equality and freedom, the combination of which should result in democracy.
Democracy has not reached the women of the Balkans.
Trafficking in women, domestic violence, difficulties accessing reproductive rights, lack of political participation, unemployment, poverty and prostitution are the reality of thousands of women living in the region.
Each country has its own distinctive reality.
In Albania we could emphasise the serious increase in the trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation.
Bulgaria is entirely lacking in mechanisms for creating equal opportunities between men and women, which is a prerequisite for transposing our rules.
Trafficking in women and girls in Bosnia Herzegovina is also increasing.
In Croatia, violence against women goes unpunished.
In Greece, we are faced with serious problems in terms of the political representation of women.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the sexual abuse of Albanian and Roma girls takes place on an almost daily basis and the legislation does not include any law relating to the crime of trafficking.
In Romania there are crimes on ethnic grounds, mainly against Roma women.
These women have practically no access to contraception and forced marriages and poverty are also part of their reality.
In Serbia and Montenegro, there is a very clear increase in trafficking in women, also influenced by the arrival of Kafor troops.
In Turkey, violence against women is widespread and sentences are still reduced for what are so wrongly termed âcrimes of honourâ.
We must open our eyes, Mr President.
We must pay attention to the situation of women in this region and we must not move ahead without taking account of the daily reality of thousands of women and girls living in poverty, exploitation and hopelessness.
The European Union must serve as an essential lever, as the incentive for these countries to commit themselves seriously to human rights and freedom for their citizens.
No cultural tradition can be placed above universal human rights.
There cannot be first- and second-class citizens.
