On the basis of that Green Paper, the Commission initiated a discussion process in 2002.
The European Parliament, and in particular the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, has made an important contribution to that debate and also given it impetus.
Mrs Theato, everyone here knows that we really would not have made the progress that we have with the project for a European Prosecutor without your active support and your commitment.
I would particularly like to thank you for that on the Commission's behalf.
Last week, the Commission presented a follow-up report to the Green Paper, summarising the outcome of the public consultation.
Most people who took part in the debate and in the consultation process have a basically positive attitude towards a European Public Prosecutor.
As we all know, the governments had more reservations about it than the members of the legal professions and of the non-governmental organisations, and in particular than people who have to deal with the question every day.
But only a minority are totally against the project.
Over all, however, openness to the project of a European Public Prosecutor has grown appreciably as the year has gone by.
The Commission therefore reaffirms its proposal for the establishment of a Public Prosecutor.
This outcome is all the more important now that the Convention - as someone has already said - has entered its crucial phase.
Specific proposals for a constitution are now being discussed.
Last week the Convention Presidium proposed including an Article 20 about the European Public Prosecutor's office in the 'Justice and Internal Affairs' Title, and the Plenum of the Convention will give its opinion on that next week.
In this crucial phase it really is essential that Parliament and the Commission should be pulling in the same direction and sending the Convention a clear message.
It is already a cause for some satisfaction that our common concern has nevertheless come far enough for the European Public Prosecutor's office to have been given an article of its own in the draft treaty.
The debate has done much to bring this about and it is very much to your credit.
However, the Commission takes the view that the Presidium's proposal does not go far enough.
It stops short of the actual objective.
What is proposed is a clause empowering the Council to create the office of European Public Prosecutor unanimously at some time in the future.
With an empowerment clause of that nature, the European Prosecutor may well turn out to be an empty promise in an enlarged Union of 25 or more Member States.
That is the risk.
We must therefore anchor the office of the European Prosecutor in the Treaty itself, otherwise it is to be feared that the project really will be postponed indefinitely.
I am glad that Parliament and the Commission are in full and complete agreement on this eminently important and highly political question.
I hope that a large number of amendments will be tabled for the Convention's plenary session on 3 and 4 April with the aim of creating a European Public Prosecutor in the Treaty itself.
The Commission therefore welcomes the European Parliament's support, which is expressed very, very clearly in Mrs Theato's report.
I congratulate you warmly on this report, knowing how much personal commitment lies behind it.
In the Convention's decision-making phase that now lies before us, it is of the utmost importance that Parliament gives a clear sign.
The Commission agrees with the essentials of Mrs Theato's report on the Green Paper, as I have said.
But we do not agree entirely on every point.
We are, for example, still debating whether there is a need for a Preliminary Chamber, whether national court control of the Public Prosecutor's decisions is sufficient or not and whether it can be transferred.
So far as Eurojust is concerned, the Commission also considers it desirable that the European Public Prosecutor's office should be close to this institution.
We have said more about this in our follow-up report.
There are still doubts about whether this can be achieved effectively by means of a strengthened Eurojust taking on the tasks of the Public Prosecutor's office.
This is being discussed.
Both functions - the central criminal prosecution of crimes against the Union's financial interests and the coordination of national criminal prosecution authorities in other areas of crime - could be brought together in a common structure, under the same roof so to speak.
Transferring Eurojust to the first pillar is in this respect a necessary condition but not a sufficient one.
That also has to be made very clear.
The Commission also agrees with the report that some questions connected with the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's office still need further discussion.
This is true of the question of secondary law.
In our follow-up report we said we wanted to look in more detail at the following questions in particular, namely the question of evidence, so that evidence lawfully collected in one Member State can be admitted in another Member State, and the procedural guarantees for the accused, on which a special consultation is taking place on the basis of another Green Paper presented by my colleague Mr Vitorino.
The Commission will comply with the request of the Committee on Budgetary Control and look at these questions in detail in the course of this year.
In so doing it will be guided by the proposals made by the Convention and in particular also by the work in the field of justice and internal affairs.
The important thing now, however, is that a European criminal prosecution authority should be anchored in the Constitutional Treaty itself with a basis in law for developing the secondary law that will then be necessary.
That is the only way of dealing effectively on the criminal law side with the current difficulties in fighting fraud and corruption that are such a drain on the Community budget.
If we want to help to make the building of Europe more popular with the citizens and taxpayers, we must send an effective signal with the future Treaty.
Mr President, Commissioner, by means of this report presented by Mrs Theato, Parliament is calling on the Convention to include a modification in Article 280 allowing for the creation of a European Prosecutor.
At the heart of this issue lies the concern to protect the financial interests of European taxpayers.
For some time the European Parliament has been calling for the creation of a European Prosecutor with competences relating to the Union's interests.
It is important to point out the existing differences between the Member States, which result in a lack of efficiency.
We must ensure greater European cooperation and move forward with the creation of a European judicial area.
The role of the European Prosecutor would be to tackle cross-border fraud by means of the adoption of specific rules making it possible to combat that fraud, including the definition of crimes.
The new Constitutional Treaty must make the basis for this European Prosecutor clear, and it should be based on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, resolving the problems caused by the fragmentation of the current European judicial system.
We must achieve a transparent system which preserves the balance between efficiency and the investigation procedure, in the event of cross-border crime, and respect for fundamental rights, with coherence and cooperation between the existing structures: OLAF, Eurojust, Europol.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has presented certain amendments aimed at taking this clarification further, and I would therefore ask the other groups to support them.
I would finally like to stress this report's aim of contributing to the constitutional process under way so that we might clarify this issue of the European Prosecutor, which is enormously important for the future of the Union.
I must congratulate Mrs Theato, who has done an enormous amount of work, which has not been easy, and I hope she will achieve the proposed objective.
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this House fully supports Mrs Theato's report and also congratulates her on the work presented to us here.
I believe it is no accident that the Committee on Budgetary Control repeatedly comes forward with such initiatives since we are finding from experience that it is impossible to protect a budget that has now grown to EUR 100 000 million with the funds of 50 years ago, that is with national funds.
This clear statement and such initiatives as today's Theato report are things we owe to our taxpayers.
They know there have been initiatives like OLAF.
We know everything is not yet perfect.
There are intermediate stages and I believe a Public Prosecutor of this kind will not be the most perfect thing of all time, either.
But it will be a very important step towards protecting Europe's taxpayers.
And it is important, above all, that Parliament should make clear that this institution will have a democratic foundation.
Europe also has institutions, such as Europol, that are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, and it is therefore not surprising that people learn from the media that the Member States apparently allow Europol, behind closed doors, to process quite fantastic amounts of money.
Obviously there is no transparency because Parliament is not involved and I believe it is important that we secure these things for the Public Prosecutor.
We have already on occasion - and in other reports - pointed out that we want this Article 280(a).
Parliament voted on it again two weeks ago in Strasbourg and I hope that here, too, Parliament will back the rapporteur's third paragraph, which deals with this.
From time to time, quite specific examples make clear how important a Public Prosecutor is for us.
Not long ago, we called on the smallest Member State, Luxembourg, to take action in a case - the so-called Perilux affair - that has been pending at the Luxembourg Public Prosecutor's office for years.
Massive amounts of European taxpayer's money are involved.
Luxembourg is not responding, and we must stress from this place once again how important a European Public Prosecutor would be to perhaps give a bit of a kick to Member States that do not take European taxpayers' interests quite so seriously.
Such cases come up repeatedly and it is particularly annoying in Luxembourg's case because Belgian courts have already reached findings in the matter.
Again warm congratulations and I think this House will take a good and important decision today with this report!
Mr President, I should like to state that I find it quite unacceptable that fraud involving EU funds should amount to something like two billion a year and even be increasing in some areas.
At the same time, it must however be acknowledged that this is basically a national problem in as much as approximately 80% of the EU budget is administered by the national authorities. I think that, in this area, the Member States display a fundamental unwillingness to take the necessary initiatives to deal specifically with fraud involving EU funds.
This is borne out by, for example, the Commission's statement that, out of every four cases that are brought to light by OLAF and that should lead to the national authorities' being prosecuted, only one has legal consequences.
I find all this unacceptable.
It does not however lead me unconditionally to endorse Mrs Theato's conclusion that the optimum and only solution lies in setting up another institution: a common European Prosecutor in the form of a body taking precedence over national legislation and demanding extensive harmonisation in areas in which the Member States traditionally have different legal traditions and legal concepts.
I need only mention harmonisation of penal legislation, production of evidence, penalties and the rules governing legal processes.
If we were to implement this model here and now, I would anticipate major conflicts of authority between the common European Prosecutor and the national authorities, as well as some overlap in relation to other Community initiatives such as Eurojust, OLAF and Europol, initiatives that, in view of the short period of time they have been up and running, should at all events be given more time to produce results in areas including that of fraud involving EU funds.
That having been said, however, I do in actual fact support in principle the idea of setting up this authority and embedding it in the treaty.
I just do not think that the time is ripe for such a drastic harmonisation of fundamental areas of legal policy, as proposed by Mrs Theato.
I believe instead that a European Prosecutor's office should be developed gradually and within the framework of strengthened Eurojust cooperation.
That is, moreover, the model mentioned by Mrs Theato in Article 22, Paragraph 2 of her report.
In general, it is these considerations that form the basis of the amendments to the report tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the establishment of OLAF, the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's Office would be the next logical step in fighting financial fraud in the EU in the interests of the European taxpayer.
On behalf of my group I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mrs Theato, for the courage and persistence with which she has fought for this matter for years, and I also expressly include Commissioner Schreyer in my thanks for supporting the fight for a European Public Prosecutor's Office in the Green Paper and countless hearings.
Unfortunately, we still do not really have a Community policy for European home affairs and justice.
The third pillar not only excludes Parliament from important areas of parliamentary codetermination and control, but is also the cause of many democratic deficits in European legal and justice policy.
The establishment of OLAF as a European fraud office without judicial accompaniment creates a legal vacuum at European level.
Once again, we have taken the second step before the first.
Unfortunately, the Convention does not really seem to be seeing how acute the problem is either.
What other explanation can there be for the fact that the Convention Presidium is again insisting on unanimity in the Council for a decision on establishing a European Public Prosecutor?
The Council has shown in the past that it is not single minded in this and it has unfortunately also repeatedly shown that it is not always single minded in really working to prevent fraud and to protect the EU's financial interests.
Let us therefore show great unity and a broad majority in Parliament today.
I believe we urgently need such a broad majority in order to demonstrate to the Convention Plenum in particular that we are against such unanimity and that we believe that the European Public Prosecutor's Office must have a really important place in the new treaty, that the establishment of this Public Prosecutor's Office must be decided by qualified majority and that here, too, Parliament must be given rights of codetermination.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Theato, for her work on this proposal despite the fact that I disagree with it.
One of the most important factors when we look at the creation of new offices or new institutions under the European Treaties is that there are a number of elements that have to be remembered first and foremost.
These are basic issues.
Is there a public demand for this?
No.
Will it be more efficient?
No.
Will it deliver a better form of justice?
No.
Will it more effectively secure the financial interests of the European Community or the European institutions?
No.
The reason is that in each Member State we already have in place a number of public prosecutors with special competence in their own areas to deal with fraud and criminal prosecutions and to understand the rules and requirements of evidence in each of the Member States.
We must ensure that throughout all of those public prosecutors' offices there is the necessary understanding of what the European Union's financial interests are.
There must be greater cooperation between OLAF, the Court of Auditors and those national prosecutors in the bringing of prosecutions in the national courts and there must also, in addition to the Eurojust system, be a greater opportunity for the sharing of interests, for the sharing of education and for the sharing of understanding between the judicial members in each Member State so that a commonality eventually arrives.
I am somewhat disappointed by one of the comments in the report stating that common rules of evidence must be established.
In the British legal system, which is the common law system, the rules of evidence were established over 322 years - and yet we are going to bring in common rules of evidence willy nilly?
It is important that we remember that the people in the European Union are entitled to have proper representation in relation to their concerns.
They are entitled to have their taxes protected but the best way to protect the taxpayers and the taxpayers' interests is at the national level.
Mr President, there cannot be anyone in the House who is not aware of the most important rule in politics: when you are in a hole, stop digging.
There is also the joke about the tourist who, lost in depths of Ireland, asked a local how to get to Tipperary and he was told 'I would not start from here'.
Yet, lost at the bottom of the hole, starts Mrs Theato, who declares in her explanatory statement that 'it has long been acknowledged that the Communities' financial interests require special protection under criminal law'.
I agree, but if there were no Community funds, there would be no Community financial interests and, therefore, no need for their protection.
That is where I am coming from.
It has never made sense to hand over money to an organisation to spend in a manner that has evaded reform and which cannot be accounted for.
That is the 'hole'.
The answer is to stop digging. Stop giving the Community money.
As for the creation of a European Prosecutor: that might be your desired destination, but my advice is that if I were you, I would not start from here.
The essentially corrupt and uncontrolled system is the problem.
Attack the cause, not the system.
Mr President, the protection of financial interests must naturally continue to be one of our primary objectives.
In this connection, we also support the creation of a European Public Prosecutor, but after detailed discussions we also believe that this cannot be a cure-all for the future.
The existing options must also continue to be developed.
By this I mean strengthening OLAF and encouraging improved cooperation within the official machinery.
It is noticeable, for example, that the Netherlands reports four times as many fraud cases as, for example, Spain or Greece.
If Member States fail to get to grips with their fraud cases, they must also face the threat of having their subsidies cut off or they must be made to pay for the losses to the EU resulting from their authorities' lax controls.
Mr President, as a former occasional legal prosecutor myself, I find that the case for the European Public Prosecutor has been made far from effectively.
As a member of the European Convention, I think our job is to look for ways in which we do not add to institutional bureaucracy, but we try to simplify things so that the citizens of Europe are both protected and more in touch with those who represent them.
I cannot see the advantages of having this particular office even if, as one of my colleagues has just said, it is embedded in another institution.
There are difficulties in relation to cost and bureaucracy.
There are difficulties, as has been suggested, in relation to the fitting of this particular role into the legal systems of Europe, which are very different in their effect, in the evidence they collect and the nature of the prosecution process itself.
In my view, there is also a difficulty on the legal base.
In addition, if we are to allow the organisations presently in place to reform, this would not be helpful to them in the process.
What we need is more cooperation between States and the Commission - between authorities.
We need to clarify internal accounting arrangements and to give greater penalties to States which take inadequate approaches to fraud.
We need to encourage greater action by States and improve the role of the Court of Auditors.
We need more internal reforms.
The reform strategy of the EU has, in my view, stalled at the present time - it needs to be revived.
Frankly, there is no point in treating Member States of the EU as naughty children, taking their toys away from them and giving them to some over-worked and inadequate new minder.
If we respect our membership to the EU, we ought also to respect our ability to prosecute effectively and to deal with fraud and reform as necessary.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is absolutely undeniable that, when criminal fraud is being perpetrated and when the national authorities are failing to address the problems, the protection of the Community's financial interests is not working or is working poorly, and that the present situation is unsustainable, as Mr BÃ¶sch recalled a short while ago with regard to the situation in Luxembourg.
Our rapporteur, Diemut Theato, has been tireless in calling for a European Public Prosecutor to be established in order to address this situation.
Commissioner Schreyer has also given her unrelenting support to this initiative, and I therefore wish to congratulate both of them on their hard work and dedication.
Nevertheless, and with all the friendship, consideration and respect that I have for them, I must highlight two aspects of this matter that I believe are crucial.
I believe that European citizens would not understand our institutions resolving once again to consider only economic issues, ignoring the concept of citizenship.
I do not think it is acceptable to establish a European Prosecutor who looks after our financial interests but who ignores, for example, crimes involving the trafficking of human beings, particularly of children.
Furthermore, the number of European bodies working in the field of preventing, fighting and prosecuting crime, Europol, Eurojust and OLAF, and the complexity of defining the scope of each of these counsel caution in this field.
The worst situation we could face would be to increase the entropy of the system, with the various bodies being concerned only with their own competences, without the fight against economic crime on a European scale being pursued more effectively.
I wish to say a final word to express my reservations about the principles of the secrecy of justice and of the independence of the prosecutor's office when adopted as absolute principles, as has happened, in the latter case, with the Commission Green Paper.
One only has to bear in mind the disappointing results achieved in my country in this field to understand the need not to make the same mistakes.
Mr President, I too, like Mr Kirkhope who took the floor a few moments ago, used to be a public prosecutor, but I reached and have again reached diametrically opposed conclusions.
I call on those who truly believe in European integration to be consistent and to support the plan for a stronger European Union, that is, which can avail itself of all the necessary means in order to exert real influence on the scourge of fraud prejudicial to the Union's financial interests, since until now, these interests have not been adequately protected by the Member States with their laws.
It is a fact that each year the amount of fraud prejudicial to Community budgets - that is, in the final analysis, prejudicial to European taxpayers - amounts to approximately EUR one billion, as rightly stated by the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Theato - who has all my admiration and respect - and all the studies agree in saying that this phenomenon is set to steadily increase.
This is why the existing legal instruments to combat fraud such as the conventions and protocols ratified by the Member States, the cumbersome nature of actually putting into practice mutual assistance in criminal matters, the nature of OLAF which, under its mandate, has to restrict itself to mere administrative checks and, above all, the fragmentation of the European criminal law-enforcement area are totally insufficient to effectively fight this phenomenon, and the excuses which have been proffered until now do not convince me that we should abandon the European Public Prosecutor either.
The mere decision in principle is, however, not sufficient: if we really are in favour of establishing a European Public Prosecutor, we must be consistent in also providing him with the effective means to operate.
We must therefore define with the greatest precision, at Community level, the crimes and penalties stipulated for criminal acts and moreover, draw up common provisions in the field of European Union criminal law and criminal procedural law.
Consequently, I also believe, as the rapporteur Mrs Theato says, that in observing the separation of powers, the European Public Prosecutor and the deputy European prosecutors must be independent and carry out their mandate on the basis of the principle of mandatory prosecution.
Furthermore, it will be necessary to subject the European Public Prosecutor's actions to judicial review, both with regard to investigations and to committals for trial.
In conclusion, honest citizens of the Union can only welcome the creation of an instrument which fights dishonest people at all times and in all areas.
Mr President, the discussion on the criminal-law protection of the EC's financial interests has been dragging on for quite some time now.
A great deal of time and energy has been invested; unfortunately, chiefly in using this deficiency to set up a European judiciary.
This report is based on political motives, as the previous speaker illustrated.
It is no wonder, then, that it arouses political opposition.
I regret that this is to the detriment of an objective discussion.
Where the report refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is running ahead of reality.
After all, the Charter has not yet been incorporated in the EU Treaty as legally binding.
Nor does my group wish it to be, in view of the mediocrity of its contents and the fact that it duplicates national constitutions and the European Convention on Human Rights.
If the resolution were really aimed at an effective criminal prosecution of fraud and criminal activity detrimental to the interests of the Community, it would have received our support.
This has proved impossible, however, now that this report has overreached itself and is aspiring after the European Union as a political entity.
Mr President, it appears that protection of the European Union's financial interests is being taken as an excuse for the creation - and this seems to be the principle aim - of a super-prosecutor, which is virtually bound up with the establishment of the European arrest warrant, on a line seeking to replace national jurisdictions: a line on which the Italian Government has taken a stance of clear opposition, with precise explanations given on several occasions.
A proposal - for a European Public Prosecutor - which, as luck would have it, has been put forward again by the Praesidium of the Convention: Article 20 proclaims a European law creating a European Public Prosecutor's office, whose structure should be decided by a majority vote.
This gives rise to further concerns, not least because very sensitive issues arise regarding the Prosecutor, such as the principle of the free movement of evidence, insofar as this means that the conditions for the admissibility of evidence specifically laid down in the legal system of the individual state in which judgment is to be passed will be glossed over.
Cross-border crime will not be tackled by destroying national legal traditions, but through appropriate controls and with efficient, effective measures to fight, prevent and eliminate international financial crime.
Mr President, I was pleased to hear that two days ago the Belgian authorities brought fraud charges against former Commissioner, Mrs Cresson, four years after her misdemeanours brought down the Santer Commission.
This, too, shows the urgent need to create a European Public Prosecutor to bring to court solely and exclusively cases of fraud involving European money, and to do so soon after the offence was committed, because a preventive effect can only be expected if prosecution and conviction follow quickly.
Although in principle I would be the last person to advocate a further transfer of powers to the EU, in this exceptional case it is justified because all - and I stress all - the bodies that have been responsible for the protection of European money up until now have failed lamentably, most of all the present Commission, which is being reduced by this task to throwing around verbal abuse.
The need for action is greater than ever, however, because the amount of fraud, mismanagement and nepotism is growing.
I need only mention the most recent goings on in the European Statistical Office, EUROSTAT.
For the most part, national public prosecutors cannot cope.
But hanging the small fry and letting the big fish get away is having a devastating effect on European citizens' confidence in the European institutions.
I therefore appeal to the Council and the Convention: we do not need any more green papers.
What we need is a clear legal basis that clearly defines the task to be performed.
Then there will be no more room for objections from individual Member States.
This first step must be taken now with the revision of the treaties and eastwards enlargement.
If we succeed, this institution will be linked inseparably to Mrs Theato's efforts, and I expressly thank her here once again for her persistent efforts.
Mr President, today we have an open market within the European Union, but that means that the market is also open to fraudsters.
Most of the fraud against the EU actually comes from money not collected.
The Commission has estimated that EUR 90 billion has been lost to the EU budget from cigarette smuggling alone.
We have some measures in place to stop fraud from occurring.
OLAF has been established, it does its job and passes on the file to the Member States - where it sits on a shelf.
We could sanction the Court of Auditors, but the question still has to be answered: who prosecutes?
We could fraud-proof further but the question remains: who prosecutes?
The establishment of Eurojust is there, but again: who prosecutes?
The answer, which is factual rather than theoretical, is: almost nobody.
Member States are not serious about tackling fraud in the EU.
It took five years for them to ratify the Convention on the protection of financial interests.
Prosecution against people who rip off the EU is absolutely minimal.
The current system does not work.
It is extremely difficult to prosecute cross-border fraud, partly because evidence collected in one Member State does not count in another Member State.
What we have here on the table is a Green Paper.
It is essential that the European Public Prosecutor's powers are restricted to the financial interests of the EU budget.
Anything beyond that opens the door to massive complications and serious constitutional implications - which is why Paragraph 4, which calls for a judicial area to be set up, is nonsense.
If the problem exists now, just imagine how difficult it will become following enlargement.
If we are serious about tackling fraud, we must accept that the current system does not work and until there is an acceptable alternative, we must go along with this.
Mr President, the first point I would like to make with regard to combating fraud is that there is one problem that requires urgent attention.
There is currently no legal institution competent to carry out enquiries within the Community bodies, due to the latters' privileged status.
If any task can be justified for a European Prosecutor, it is this, first and foremost.
Apart from that, with regard to the possible future creation of a supranational body responsible for conducting inquiries and taking public action against the Member States in the event of violations damaging the financial interests of the Community, we feel that the proposed operation has more disadvantages than advantages.
Naturally, variations in national legal areas can, in some cases, hinder the prosecution process.
The purpose of Eurojust, however, is to remedy this problem while respecting national competence.
We must first allow it to act and develop before judging its effectiveness.
The supranational European Prosecutor proposed by the Commission, meanwhile, would lead us into an administrative black hole, since not only would we have to harmonise charges, penalties, restrictions and all kinds of procedures, such as acceptability of evidence, but we would also have to consider the issue of protecting individual freedom for all coercive acts required by the European Prosecutor: searches, seizures, telephone tapping, arrest warrants, judicial reviews and pre-trial detention, not to mention, of course, the vast issue of the democratic control that would need to be established.
This is a huge issue, Mr President, and I strongly encourage my fellow Members to choose Eurojust instead, as this could achieve the same results without the problems of destabilisation.
Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Theato on her report.
I believe she has crystallised a lot of the hard work that has gone into this subject.
She has proposed what I think to be a convincing case to the European Convention for inclusion of this provision in an amended treaty.
In discussing this matter, we should not create the feeling - which some people have done and have been trying to do - that, in some way or another, the European Union's treasury is a more leaky vessel than those of the Member States or similar treasuries throughout the world.
We are no better or no worse, but we do compare with the higher standards of accountancy and accountability.
On the other hand, most of the arguments that are put forward against this idea are political, ideological arguments.
The arguments sought to stir up the people who are concerned about a transfer of power and competences from national parliaments to Europe and the creation of more unnecessary bureaucracy.
I do not see it this way at all.
We have transferred to this Union 1% of our national taxation, which is used in the interest of Community policies.
We have provided the financial control to deal with that.
We have provided OLAF to further investigate suspected problems.
But we do not take the final step, which is to create the means to prosecute people who we have found guilty of violating our laws.
I have experienced this in my everyday life; I have seen cases in which companies and individuals have been found guilty of abusing Community funds.
I have seen situations where a large number of people from a particular sector, which is well financed by the Union, seem to be able continuously to get away with violations of our rules and regulations on the spending of money.
In one case, I see the public taxpayer in a Member State being forced to pay through the clearance of accounts for the crimes of individual companies.
In other situations, I see the failure to pay levies whereby the national government, again, picks up the bill.
If we had a European Prosecutor dealing with our own resources - we do not want to take it any further than that - I think the focus of the authorities in the Member States who actually spend this money would be sharpened.
I also think that OLAF would be less frustrated when, after having proceeded and found situations serious enough to be passed on to Public Prosecutors at national level, it does not happen.
If we had a European Prosecutor, we could satisfy our taxpayers that we were taking matters to the proper conclusion.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the circumstances of this debate are certainly not the best for expressing one's thoughts.
On behalf of the Italian Radicals, we will continue to consistently oppose the bare idea of the creation of a European Public Prosecutor which is not accompanied by those instruments and those arrangements which form part of the legal and cultural heritage of our countries.
How can we possibly consider just a European Public Prosecutor without the judgment, appeal and defence mechanisms which are inherent and peculiar to each country's legal system?
Rushing headlong in this way can only make the structure that we are trying to give Europe even more justicialist and export a certain model of Italian justice with which we are all familiar and which has caused a great deal of harm in our country.
These are the reasons why we will be voting against the Theato report, having already voted against in committee, not because the idea per se is without foundation, but because it lacks all the attributes to make it effectively fair, as justice also at European level should be.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Theato on the report which I supported in the Committee on Budgetary Control and which I also expect to support in this plenum.
I would like to place the report within its context and point out that we are talking about establishing the European Parliament's position in relation to the Commission's Green Paper on the European financial prosecutor.
By means of this publication, the Commission intends to establish an extremely broad debate on all the issues relating to this figure and this has led it to include certain points which, if this were a legislative draft, would be considered crude, with gaps, and questionable in many respects.
The Green Paper, however, can be summed up in the idea, the intellectual hypothesis, that the defence of Community, and therefore cross-border, financial interests can perhaps be better defended by a figure also at Community level in this same field.
The rapporteur's work is conditional upon this structure and therefore has to respond to the most significant issues in the Green Paper and also glean from that supplementary and premature information the essential notion, which is to achieve the legal basis necessary to continue a careful analysis.
There are two topical reasons why this treatment and the approval of this report are advisable.
On the one hand, the current Convention and the next intergovernmental conference which will establish the future of Community law and, on the other hand, the imminent incorporation of the new members which, on entering, should be faced with a legal basis which would allow them to be involved in the collective work of creating, when appropriate, the figure of European financial prosecutor.
Mr President, the Theato report on the Commission's Green Paper on the protection of Community financial interests and on the creation of a European Public Prosecutor has had a lot of preparation and a long debate.
At the beginning, we agreed on this, provided that the office of Prosecutor remained, and still remains limited, precisely, to the financial interests of the Community.
During the debate and the assessments made by the Parliamentary committees however, the original measure was in danger of being distorted and taking on a different, dangerous form in the European institutional context.
This is why the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, early on, prepared a negative opinion but, subsequently, following intelligent steps by Mr Lehne and explanations from the Chairman, Mrs Theato, it set out a compromise opinion and tried to bring the institution which we want to regulate back towards the original suggestion.
Further discussions with Mrs Theato enabled us to reach a united, compromise position, which we hope will be endorsed in the Chamber this morning.
With great sensitivity, Mrs Theato took this issue on herself because, in actual fact, the European Union's legal system does not provide for competences in the field of criminal law and criminal procedural law, or a judiciary endowed with all the degrees of adjudication able to guarantee the full right of defence.
In the absence of such conditions, the creation of an independent European Public Prosecutor without any controls would damage, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the already fragile interinstitutional balance between the Union and the States in an area as sensitive as justice: it would therefore be illogical and unjustified.
In particular, the creation of such a body would seem truly premature if we consider that we have not yet attained the objectives on judicial cooperation, let alone, where necessary, on the harmonisation of the rules on Member States' criminal-law issues.
It is in the context of Eurojust - this certainly does have a subsidiarity problem and a major problem with coordinating the European States - and in this context alone that we can truly achieve a significant, uniform result which respects the States and at the same time provides the guarantees which the European Union must have.
This is how we are going to vote, and we will table these amendments to the Convention, which obviously cannot incorporate a European Prosecutor, an unrestricted super-prosecutor, which would run counter to all the guarantees which nevertheless exist in Europe.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place shortly.
Mr President, this morning the MEPs from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, when we looked in the postboxes here next to the Chamber, discovered a poster with our name and the word 'murderer'.
I believe that until now, Mr President, only our colleagues in the Basque Country have been accustomed to this, to seeing their names on the targets painted in the street, and for some of them, Mr President, we have observed a minute's silence here in this House.
I do not believe this is compatible with the spirit in which the European Union was founded, which is also incompatible ?and I say this respectfully - with certain posters which we saw yesterday here in the plenum.
I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to appeal for tolerance, which is the foundation of European integration.
The response of colleagues already speaks volumes on your appeal for tolerance.
Regarding the incident to which you refer, I condemn it totally.
Whoever did this has behaved in an unacceptable and disgraceful way.
A parliament is the tribune of the people and Members are fully entitled to express their policy analyses and preferences and to do so in serenity, in dignity and with respectful tolerance of each other.
In the light of what you have reported this morning, Mr Galeote Quecedo, I propose to ask the services whether we can discover how this incident happened and who perpetrated it, so that if possible we can learn a lesson from it.
If we need to make changes to the Rules to cope with disgraceful incidents of this sort, I am determined that we shall do so.
(Applause)
Mr President, I had requested the floor to condemn these intolerable actions and to express my solidarity with my fellow Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and I wanted to make the proposal that you yourself have made.
I support it on behalf of my group.
Mr President, there is no need for me, or for any of the Spanish MEPs, to say we are against this type of practice and against all types of violence.
But I must say, Mr President, that this is happening within a context in which millions of Spaniards are demonstrating against the war and in which the Spanish Government of Mr Aznar is comparing States such as France and Germany ?
? with Saddam Hussein, in the Congress of Deputies.
Just yesterday he described the States who are against the war as allies of China and Russia, rather than saying that this is a European position which is opposed to that of the United Kingdom and Spain.
(Applause)
There is absolutely no justification to be made for the disgraceful behaviour we have seen here today.
The next item is the vote.
Report (A5-0045/2003) by Salvador JovÃ© Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a tuna tracking and verification system (COM(2001) 406 - C5-0408/2001 - 2001/0170(CNS))
(Parliament adopted the text)
Report (A5-0336/2002) by Gianfranco Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for amendment of the constituent acts of Community bodies following the adoption of the new Financial Regulation (COM(2002) 406)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolutions, 1 to 12)
Report (A5-0077/2003) by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and Terence Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets containing the European Parliament's recommendations to the Council on the introduction in the draft Accession Treaty of a financial framework (2003/2050(INI))
Before the vote:
Mr President, I do not fully understand why we are going to vote without any explanations, since Mr Brok and Mr Wynn took part in a three-way dialogue this morning on behalf of the committees.
I think that Parliament should be given further information as to the results of this dialogue before taking a decision.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regarding this morning's negotiations I can inform you that there has been no agreement so far and the trialogue will continue next Tuesday.
I see prospects for agreement, but I also believe acceptance of this recommendation is also a decisive instrument guaranteeing our objectives in this matter, namely equality for Parliament and the candidate countries in the Budget procedure.
Please therefore take this as a speech in support of the resolution.
Mr President, in accordance with Rule 69 of our Rules of Procedure, the Commission can explain its position on Parliament's amendments and, in the event that it does not accept all of those amendments, the rapporteurs - because I agree with my co-rapporteur, Mr Harbour, on this - would request a postponement of the vote on the legislative motion for a resolution, pursuant to Rule 69(2).
Mr President, could I first of all very briefly thank both Mr Harbour and Mr Medina Ortega for their very hard and effective work in drawing up this report.
During the extensive debate on the report, and indeed during the useful and open debate on the oral question on pensions yesterday evening, I gave details of the many amendments which the Commission can readily accept and I also indicated those which we are not able to accept.
The amendments which cannot be accepted by the Commission - there is not a very long list - are Amendments Nos 16, 22, 23, 24, 37, 39, 53, 55 and 63.
This is not a long list, easily available in translation in all languages!
I shall pay particular attention to the amendment on Members' assistants, as it is a matter of concern in this House.
I can only repeat at this juncture that the Commission is aware of, and sympathetic to, the concerns that have been raised in Parliament.
I consequently hope that representations will eventually have the effect of resolving this important employment issue by breaking the interinstitutional deadlock in a positive way.
In postponing the vote on the legislative resolution, I understand that the House is seeking to provide itself with an opportunity to exert pressure on outstanding matters of concern at a later stage.
I hope I do not exceed my brief when I say that I urge the House to follow its intended course in a timely way.
I am absolutely certain that the rapporteurs fully comprehend the necessity of doing so.
I look forward to that final vote.
Mr President, as we have heard, thank heavens that there were only a few amendments the Commissioner could not accept!
In any event, I would ask, on my own behalf and on behalf of my co-rapporteur, Mr Harbour, that it be referred back to committee and I hope that we will soon be able to bring the legislative package back to Parliament.
- (DA) The June Movement is voting against establishing a tuna tracking and verification system.
The purpose of the proposal is to comply with international obligations under EU law, to which we strongly object.
It must however be emphasised that we are in favour of introducing arrangements for protecting dolphins and other threatened species. It is just that this must not be done under the auspices of the EU.
Each individual Member State should, as far as possible, endeavour, through international and regional cooperation, to promote the conservation and protection of threatened species.
Mr President, I can see male and female pensioners among the dense crowd of members of the public.
I was thinking precisely of them when I voted for the introduction in the Accession Treaty of a financial framework, because my personal aim and the aim of the Pensioners' Party is to have safe pensions, which enable elderly people to live in dignity, also in the candidate countries.
I also hope to see an immediate increase in funding for the construction of infrastructure for industries, and consequently for the well-being of all the workers, unemployed and pensioners, including those in the other two candidate countries which are not going to enter the European Union in 2004, that is, Romania and Bulgaria.
. (FR) We voted against the Brok report because the European Parliament's self-seeking fight against the attempt to discontinue its budgetary prerogatives has led it to assume the ludicrous position of refusing to allow the people themselves to take a budgetary decision instead of their representatives, by adopting the Treaty.
This result clearly shows the extent to which this House is guided by short-sighted judgments, primarily inspired by its obsession with taking power away from the Member States.
How can we expect the people to be interested in this kind of debate?
The matter should also provide an opportunity for us to question the basis of the multiannual Financial Perspective established by an interinstitutional agreement in 1988. It is highly ambiguous.
Having been decided at European level, it has since been used to convince the national parliaments that they no longer have any real decision-making power when the time comes to set their annual contribution to the Union. Furthermore, it is probably detrimental to the European budget itself, as it limits opportunities to adjust it annually as required.
For all these reasons, if the Financial Perspective falls victim to the current crisis between the European Parliament and the Council, we shall not be sorry.
. (PT) I have welcomed and supported this outcome of the conciliation process.
I fully subscribe to the determination to improve the protection of the health and safety of consumers, preventing, which is what this new directive does, substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction and preparations containing these substances from being marketed for the use of the general public.
In fact, as we know, 'marketing' implies greater responsibility for ensuring that the product in question will fulfil the purposes for which it is intended without compromising public health and safety (of persons and goods).
This is a term that gives the general public the feeling that certain products are 'trustworthy'.
This trust must therefore be matched both by the provision for and listing of these products or substances - a measure proposed by the Commission, which I welcome - bearing in mind that the new EU strategy on chemical products will involve the registration of around 30 000 substances - and by a preliminary evaluation of the risks inherent in each substance.
In fact, the monitoring, registration and handling of chemical products and substances must be covered by a set of rules that is clear, easy to understand and appropriate to the purposes for which the use of such products is intended.
Mr President, as this report explains, cement used in construction contains chromium IV which causes occupational diseases - known to all bricklayers - referred to as cement dermatitis.
I therefore could not fail to vote for this directive which limits and seeks to reduce the danger of the work of bricklayers who build what surrounds us.
As representative of the Pensioners' Party I would like, however, to urge a directive to be adopted in Europe which reduces working hours - for harmful working activities such as bricklayers' work - so that we have fewer occupational diseases.
. (PT) Although I understand the need to apply the precautionary principle so as to reduce the risks inherent in contact by chromium with the skin of civil construction and cement industry workers, it is my view that this proposal for a directive does not provide the best assurance of this.
First of all because sufficient account has not been taken of the results of the previous regulation (2001/60 EC).
Secondly, because it is not based on harmonised methods for determining chromium levels, which could consequently lead to distortions of competition and to reducing safeguards for workers.
Thirdly, because it establishes an unacceptable derogation for unbagged cement.
We know that a lack of objectivity in applying the precautionary principle has led to countless cases of non-compliance.
My fear is that this will also happen with this regulation.
. (PT) As I stated in the debate yesterday, I consider one of the parts in question to be acceptable.
This first amendment to the Directive concerns nonylphenol (NP) and nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE), used in the production of some materials.
This leaves no room for doubt that, since NP and NPE tend to accumulate dangerously in living organisms, framework directive 2000/60/EC, on water, classifies NPs as 'priority hazardous substances' and since enormous quantities of NP and NPE are marketed and used, their release into the environment must be strictly limited.
My reservations centred on the second amendment to the Directive, on the use of hexavalent chromium (or chromium VI) in cement and in cement preparations.
Today, with the first block of amendments having been adopted, thereby eliminating the second block that originated in the specialist parliamentary committee, I welcome various Members' efforts to reach agreement, which explains this major change in commitment.
This is greatly to be welcomed and could attenuate or eliminate any remaining resistance that might be felt.
Nevertheless, now that some partial votes have been taken and the pace of voting in plenary does not allow us immediately to find out the overall balance of Parliament's final text, I have chosen to abstain ?
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
We have long argued for the development of research in clinical methods in the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries.
Much of the hope of the impoverished third world - currently the portion of the globe suffering under the heaviest burdens of death and misery from HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB - is vested in our ability to offer funding for research and medicines that are effective, easy to use and affordable.
I particularly welcome the fact that up to EUR 600 million will be made available for the fight against these diseases, of which the EU will contribute up to EUR 200 million.
It is important to recognise, however, that while this is a very welcome step, it is a small amount compared with the cost to the world if these diseases are left unchecked.
Mr President, I see that my previous explanations of vote have been heeded in the drawing up of this provision.
On other occasions, I have called for the funds spent on scientific research by each of the 15 Member States to be combined in order to avoid money being wasted and so that more can be used to make rapid scientific discoveries which will benefit all Europeans.
With this decision, EUR 200 million provided by the Member States is combined with EUR 200 million provided by the European Union and EUR 200 million provided by the private sector to fund research which will allow us to find more effective treatments for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
I therefore voted for the Cauldron report with great pleasure.
. (FR) The return of AIDS, malaria and even tuberculosis is symptomatic of the poverty caused in certain nations by global free trade and uncontrolled ultraliberalism.
These three pandemics have reminded us that the planet is like another Space Shuttle Columbia.
When an atypical form of pneumonia breaks out in Vietnam in 2003, death is the result, whether in Hong Kong or in France.
This shows that health is a global public good.
The problem has been under discussion within the WHO for months.
Washington stubbornly refuses to allow poor countries free access to generic medicines.
The United States are vetoing intellectual property rights and patents on molecules that save lives.
In 2001, however, when they were under threat from anthrax, they considered that the patent on cyclosporine, owned by the Bayer laboratory, should be waived.
In other words, the partnership between Europe and the developing countries is clearly a positive but insufficient initiative.
The world is suffering from a lack of social imagination.
We need to realise that large-scale problems, such as pandemics, immigration or scarcity of drinking water, are global in nature, whereas the solutions can be found at country level.
The challenge is to examine the solutions to these problems on a global level in order to prevent them from destroying those who are too short-sighted to think beyond their own country.
. (PT) Our commitment to combating transmissible diseases, with particular focus on poverty-related diseases, such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and on improving vaccination and healthcare levels by the more developed countries funding health programmes, by removing barriers of access (licences and patents) to pharmaceutical products faced by developing countries and the barriers faced by international partnerships in developing new generations of products is crucial.
I must once again point out that 70% of those infected with AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa and that AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria account for 5 million deaths per year.
I therefore welcome the EU's proposal to participate in research programmes for new clinical interventions for combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
This participation cannot, however, replace the EU's financial commitments to combating these diseases.
I congratulate Mr Caudron on his good work.
. (PT) I approve of Parliament's proposal and amendments because I believe that these improve an important Commission proposal, establishing a viable and timely response for resolving a serious and universal problem: a long-term research programme intended to boost new clinical interventions to combat poverty-related diseases in developing countries.
I also support the report because it refers to a Commission proposal in which financial contributions converge from sources as diverse as the EU, national research programmes within the various participating States and from the private sector, involving the affected countries themselves in the programme.
The exponential increase in the sums involved in this programme in comparison with the previous programme, together with the ongoing concern to make the results of research genuinely accessible to the populations of developing countries, is making it more likely that the programmes will be effective.
I wish to note, however, that also because of the sums involved, this form of European cooperation requires the implementation of Community funds to be closely monitored.
. (PT) The gravity of the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis and the need to increase levels of aid at national, regional and world level are undeniable.
Millions of people are dying every year in the poorest countries.
I fully agree with developing this programme in its various closely linked and interdependent strands: promoting prevention, encouraging treatment and making essential medicinal products more affordable, and stepping up research and development.
Regarding the Attwooll report on shark finning (A5-0043/2003) I voted against Amendment No 13 which allows for shark fins and body parts to be landed separately.
The procedure renders futile attempts to monitor the numbers of sharks being caught.
That the Commission and the Council will determine the final shape of the regulation should be a consolation.
But sadly this is not the case.
The proposed regulation originated with a petition presented to Environment Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m by the Shark Trust, and with a question I tabled in the Environment Committee.
I feel sure that Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m will feel let down by DG Fisheries.
That an official from this DG's Conservation Unit can dismiss the concerns with the words 'I must trust much more the opinion of our fishing industry if it is for them to obtain good returns from their landings' suggests to me that he has a strange idea of conservation.
Perhaps Commissioner Fischler should put him in charge of inspecting abattoirs.
European citizens seeking to protect fish species from extinction can have no confidence in a Commission DG which seems to have sold its soul to serve the interests of the Spanish fishing industry.
. (PT) I have voted in favour of this report.
Whilst respecting the personal taste and the gastronomic heritage of certain communities and ethnic groups, and I do, of course, respect these, there are nevertheless minimum requirements for catching and preparing the species intended to satisfy these appetites and tastes.
The practice of removing sharks' fins and throwing the rest of the body into the sea, sometimes while the animal is still alive, is considered to be a threat to the survival of some species of shark and, furthermore, lays itself open to a charge of barbarity, which is entirely incompatible with the principles and declarations that have been upheld throughout the process of European integration.
The report presented by Elspeth Attwooll (ELDR, UK), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, welcoming the Commission's proposal for a regulation intended to prohibit this practice therefore warrants my full support.
Mr President, Amendment No 2 to recital 2(b) of the report by Mr Harbour and Mr Medina Ortega abolishes the weighting of pensions according to the pensioner's place of residence, so that equal pensions are paid out for equal contributions.
This is a sound economic principle which I would like to see applied throughout Europe.
As we know, I regret to say that there are citizens in some states, not least Italy, who have not paid any contributions and yet receive the same sized pension as citizens who have paid a lot of contributions.
All 15 Member States should follow Europe's example!
With the proposal to reform Staff Regulations, the European Union is being called on to apply internally the general choices made by big business, as it promotes cutbacks in public services and attacks workers' rights.
Efforts to reduce wages and benefits, impose new taxes and drastically reduce pensions and pension rights are all part of the attack on workers' rights.
The abolition of services and greater favouritism and dependence are being promoted within a framework of cutbacks in the role of public services and a more vigorous, peculiar sort of patronage which will serve the interests of lobbies, large companies and strong political families.
The majority of employees and the trades union of the various institutions of the European Union oppose Mr Kinnock's proposal.
But, Mr Kinnock is using the usual tricks, with the connivance of certain trades union leaders, in an effort to strike the European public service a decisive blow and set an example for national public administrations.
We support the just demands of the workers and their movement.
We consider that the European Parliament should stand by the view that this matter requires the codecision procedure and should not allow the Commission and the Council to take decisions without any form of control on a matter which, moreover, also affects the smooth running of Parliament.
- (SV) We wish to take this opportunity to explain our reasons for voting against Amendment No 58 to Annex II, item 4 and Amendment No 59 to Annex II, item 34.
We do not believe that the issue of the position of assistants should be addressed within the framework of the report on Staff Regulations of officials and other servants of the European Community. Instead, we believe that the issue should be debated within the framework of an assistants' statute or in the discussions on the Members' Statute.
We think that improving and clarifying assistants' conditions of employment is an important issue but do not believe that it should be discussed within this report.
We are doubtful as to whether Amendment No 58 is relevant and safeguards assistants' interests.
We therefore believe that the issue should be analysed in more depth and debated separately on a subsequent occasion.
We voted against Amendment No 64, even though it seeks to create a 'less unequal' system for the employees of the Parliament.
Generally we want the staff to have equal rights regarding salary, thus we could have voted in favour of the amendment, if the 16% was given to all new members of staff regardless of origin.
- (DA) We are voting against the amendment because we are opposed in principle to the expatriation allowance's not being given to all employees on the grounds that it is not given to employees resident in Belgium at the start of their employment.
We agree with the content of Amendment No 64 and would have voted in favour of it if it had meant the expatriation allowance's being granted to all employees.
- (NL) The Council has the power to make a different proposal from the one the Commission and Parliament had in mind after Parliament has agreed to it at second reading.
It is a clever idea, therefore, to accept an amended proposal but not the legislative resolution at this stage.
I am in any case unhappy with the proposals for four reasons.
The first reason is that people with practical experience but without the required training are ruled out of these jobs from the outset.
Secondly, the number of officials is reduced, and the number of work contracts with a worse legal position may increase to two thirds of the workforce.
Thirdly, there is still no satisfactory arrangement for the protection of whistle-blowers, who want to bring malpractices within the organisation out into the open.
Fourthly, even the pension problems remain unsolved.
It is a bad thing that accusations of sexual harassment could potentially lead to punishment for those whose accusations come to nothing.
A good thing is that, from now on, employees only need to announce their publications, without first requesting permission.
Voting in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market took place so late that only one day remained for the tabling of amendments before the plenary session.
This does not look like serious decision-making to me.
Mr President, I have to admit that I had a little nap during the votes, and, while I was asleep, I saw the 15 Heads of State, meeting in Brussels for this European Council, having an animated discussion. One of them said to the others: 'In order to balance the pensions accounts, you should do as we used to do in Italy and still do today.
In Italy, when we select the Finance Minister, we give him a medical examination. We x-ray his chest to see if he has a heart of stone.
We test his eyes to see if he has square pupils for squaring the accounts. Then we carry out a blood test to see if he has a high resistance to alcohol because, in some governmental circles, a toast is drunk every time a pensioner dies.
We selected our Finance Minister in this way and so we do not have to worry.
You should do as we have done!'
. (PT) This Resolution assumes the need to refocus the Lisbon Strategy in order to ensure that the Member States and candidate countries attain their objectives by 2010 and I support this assumption.
Although progress has been made in job creation and in reducing unemployment, the progress of this Strategy has nevertheless been extremely slow.
The efforts of all Member States and the EU must therefore focus on four priority objectives.
First: to increase employment growth and social cohesion by supporting the revised European Employment Strategy, by creating a Task Force for employment, and by reforming pensions.
Second: to stimulate the promotion of innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit, facilitating the creation of innovative companies, increasing investment in these areas and not overlooking the fundamental role of the SMEs in creating employment.
Third: to work on interconnection in Europe and on deepening the internal market by removing all barriers to its improvement.
Fourth: to guarantee environmental protection associated with job creation, by investing in clean technologies and by launching environmental actions.
Although we are going through a period of economic stagnation and of policy uncertainties, we cannot allow these priorities to be overlooked.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) The Brussels Council removed from its agenda the speech by ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, President of the Convention, on the basis that the subject of Iraq required more urgent attention.
In fact, however, the Council hardly discussed Iraq either, in order to avoid exacerbating the existing division.
We might well ask ourselves whether the postponement of the speech by the President of the Convention could be indicative of deep unrest, for two reasons.
The first, of course, concerns the Iraq crisis, which shows that a unified foreign policy is impossible and which will probably lead to the formation of at least two Europes, with either a vertical or horizontal split.
This possibility, however, is not currently part of the Convention's plans, which are still mainly along the lines of the united model.
The second reason relates to the presence, or absence, of the candidate countries at Council meetings.
It is true that they are not yet Members, but is it possible to discuss the Convention without them?
If so, should it not be clearly stated that they will be full signatories to the future, so-called 'constitutional' Treaty, in other words, that this Treaty can only be concluded after 1 May 2004, when they have become Members?
That is our position.
. (ES) The increasingly open and competitive economic environment in which the business world has to operate these days and the need to promote a form of economic growth capable of guaranteeing the employment and social well-being of the citizens, fully justifies the strategy and the agreements adopted by the European Council to provide that strategy with new impetus.
These agreements should have been much more ambitious in terms of their proposed scope and the fields covered, in view of the accumulated delays in the implementation of the measures agreed in Lisbon.
So I have voted in favour of the resolution, but I regret that it does not include a reference to the need to guarantee access to third-country markets on a reciprocal basis and with full respect for the rules governing international trade, an aspect which I believe to be essential.
In terms of maintaining and improving employment, the measures will be of little use, however necessary they are, if our companies are not able to export as a result of the unfair competition in the field of external trade which the EU is obliged to control.
. (EL) The Brussels Summit did not say a single word in even mild condemnation of this crime against the Iraqi people.
It only turned its attention to the imperialist war in order to express its fear that it might cause big business's profits to fall and to propose preventive measures to escalate its anti-grass roots attack.
In the name of the misleadingly titled, anti-grass roots 'Lisbon objectives', it decided to promote measures and policies, in the name of competitiveness and entrepreneurship, which undermine employment, social, insurance and pension rights.
Guidelines were issued for extending and broadening part-time and temporary employment, agency systems and flexible employment relations, basically abolishing collective agreements, cutting social spending back even further, handing the wealth of the people over to private capital, 'liberalising' public-sector and public utility services and encouraging health and health care to be turned into commodities and insurance systems to be privatised.
They are, of course, deluding themselves if they think that the workers will be distracted by false promises and PR tricks.
It is they who feel the pinch of recession, constantly eroded incomes and falling living standards.
They are organising and stepping up their fight against the choices being made by big business and the European Union.
Increasingly radical grass-roots rallies are springing up and the wave of opposition to the cruelties of capitalism is swelling in every Member State of the European Union.
. (FR) We are called upon to state our position on the outcome of the European Council on the Lisbon Strategy.
We note that, once again, the Heads of State and Government are following the liberal ideology of European integration.
The aim of the Lisbon Council of March 2000 was to establish the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
Three years on, the results are far from conclusive, to say the least.
As the number of redundancy plans rises in Europe, as growth in the eurozone is slowing down - 1% instead of an estimated 1.8% - and as the jaws of the Stability and Growth Pact are closing, the Fifteen are continuing to liberalise railways, energy and air travel, deregulate social protection and make the job market more flexible.
That is why we refuse to endorse the Council conclusions.
What we urgently need now is a complete change of direction towards greater democracy and citizen control, more public services, increased social protection based on solidarity and greater equality between men and women and between nationals and immigrants.
. (PT) The environmental dimension has still not been sufficiently integrated into the Lisbon strategy.
I therefore feel that both the European Commission and the Member States must ensure that, before the 2004 Spring Summit, three objectives are fulfilled: first of all, extending the list of structural indicators that serves as a basis for evaluating the performance of Member States, including new environmental indicators that evaluate the European situation in areas such as water resources, biodiversity, soil degradation, chemical pollution and food safety.
Secondly, the European Strategy for Sustainable Development must be updated in light of the commitments given at the Johannesburg Conference and monitoring mechanisms must be established to evaluate the European Union's compliance with worldwide targets.
Thirdly, also where the environment is concerned, the Lisbon strategy must provide for a genuine plan of action, including policies, targets and timetables for implementation.
Many of these targets have been debated on various occasions at European summits but have ultimately fallen by the wayside.
It is now time to include them in the Lisbon strategy.
Mr President, on this, the eighth day of the action in Iraq, I would like to convey my sadness at the suffering of the civilians affected by this conflict.
At the same time, however, I believe it is necessary to point out that Saddam Hussein's regime has led directly to this end result because of the massacres he has carried out, in particular using weapons of mass destruction, and his endless time-wasting tactics in response to requests to disarm and change his behaviour.
Even today, he is making things worse for himself with his strategy of drawing the fighting into towns in order to take the people hostage and use them as a human shield.
As I have already said, the way in which UN debates have been conducted over the past few months is cause for regret.
Today, however, we must express our solidarity towards our allies, whose troops are fighting on the ground and - I would say this in particular here - towards our British fellow Members.
Like the Brussels Council of 20 March last, we hope that this combat will result in a free, sovereign Iraq, whose regime does not pose a threat to its neighbours or to its own people.
Which way did I vote on the extremely serious issue of Iraq? Well, Mr President, I slept very well last night and, once again, I had a dream.
There was a boxing ring. The two boxers were President George W. Bush and President Saddam Hussein.
The referee was the Secretary-General of the UN, Kofi Annan. Miss Europe, dressed in a miniskirt, was the ring girl, holding a board bearing the words 'First round'.
George Bush was immediately knocked to the floor by Saddam Hussein and lost the round amid applause from all the pacifists in the world.
When I saw George Bush lying on the ground, I was moved to pity and I decided to rush to the aid of the cowboy and vote for our support to be expressed to the United States of America, which has saved Europe from dictators in the past.
Mr President, I regret that this House has been unable to adopt a clear position on Iraq.
I would therefore like to state my position for the record. I consider this war to be illegal, immoral and politically counterproductive.
I also believe that we must use the current crisis in foreign and security policy to unite Europe in foreign and security policy, not against the USA but as a self-assured partner; sadly we are still not that today, and it is our own fault.
Mr President, it is with great regret, not to say anguish, that I see the outcome of the vote on the motion today in this House.
It is tragic to see that, like the Council, Parliament too has decided not to speak out.
The deserted Chamber is, at this moment, the tragic symbol of our behaviour in this international crisis which is proving so terrible.
This sign of impotence can only be a cause of pain to all those who have always hoped and continue to hope that Europe will be to the world a shining example of balance, progress, peace and guaranteeing respect for the rights of peoples and international law.
Despite the fact that no resolution has been adopted, there were significant votes, the most important of which would appear to be that in which Parliament opted by a large majority for a common foreign and security policy with areas of enhanced cooperation.
This is the only glimmer of hope in the despair which follows a vote which does us no credit.
Mr President, I do not have Mr Fatuzzo's talent for expressing the feelings we might have towards the soldiers from democracies who are currently fighting a many-headed enemy in the desert, but I too would like to convey my sadness that Parliament has been unable to make a formal statement.
Nevertheless, important votes have been achieved, as Mr Procacci has just said.
I believe that the Liberal Group's resolution came closest to what could have been a Parliamentary position rejecting, in particular, all hysteria of the kind we see all too often at the moment.
I would add that Europe's failure, if Europe has failed - and this empty room seems to be a sign of this - is certainly, with regard to the negotiation process that preceded the commencement of hostilities, a clear failure of the intergovernmental approach.
The way our governments prioritised national positions and the real or illusory idea of national interest over the European interest shows us that, if crises can bear fruit, then what we need is, indeed, to launch a new European foreign and security policy based on a new federalism for the new century.
Mr President, with their implausible, verbose, confused, ambiguous, hypocritical joint resolution, the Socialists, the Greens and the Liberals have folded completely.
They have managed to achieve the impossible in the current circumstances, by drafting a resolution that does not contain a single recital condemning US-UK military belligerence or a single article demanding that it should cease.
Their righteous indignation is directed solely towards the Iraqi authorities, who are asked not to use their weapons, while promising that they will be brought before an international court anyway, which borders on the ridiculous.
Since when, under international law, has destroying a nation with bombs been a legitimate way of changing a government, even if it is an authoritarian one, like all the others in the region for that matter?
Does this mean that all the mechanisms of law and collective security can be violated on a whim of the powerful?
That is the only issue which needed to be raised today.
You did not want to raise it.
You did not want a resolution.
This is a dark day for Parliament.
Mr President, the positions I have adopted on today's votes on the crisis over Iraq have all been underpinned by an undeniable principle of solidarity.
Now that war has begun, this should be a time for unity, whether or not one agrees with the war.
When one of the Member States, the United Kingdom, is at war, our duty is to stand shoulder to shoulder with it.
When any of our allies in the Atlantic Alliance calls for our solidarity, we must stand shoulder to shoulder with them, especially during the most difficult times, so that we can count on them in the event that our own security is called into question.
Those who take the view that Resolution 1441 is inadequate should remember the 16 previous resolutions and the around 7 000 inspectors who in the last twelve years have spent almost seven years inspecting, without any visible results.
Those who still prefer inspections to continue, using the rhetorical threat of the use of force, should remember that the disunity of the international community revealed in the UN Security Council has been the most lethal weapon ever given to Saddam Hussein.
To those who, albeit entirely legitimately, are solely concerned with the humanitarian consequences of an armed conflict - and we are all concerned - I would say that we are opposing the harsh reality of the Iraqi people, who for decades have been subjected to a continual and silent ethnic cleansing and to the devastating consequences of a despotic, cruel and unpredictable dictatorship.
We all want peace, as quickly as possible, but the peace that I want to see is a secure peace, without the threats of terrorism or of the use of weapons of mass destruction, a peace that entails freedom not only for us but also for the Iraqis, as well as prosperity that is properly shared with those who need it most.
. (EL) The Greek Presidency of the Council maintains that it is making a quantum leap forward in order to overcome major differences within the European Union over Iraq.
It forgets the innocent victims in Baghdad, the inexorable siege of Basra and the rivers of blood, and talks instead about who will rule Iraq after the war, the USA or the UN.
In fact this is a step backwards, to the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, when France, Britain and Spain quarrelled and haggled over who would control Morocco, Libya and Egypt.
The European Union must not shy away from what is happening; it must call for this illegal war to stop, in accordance with Article 11 of the Treaties requiring its foreign policy to be in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter, and it must condemn the British Government.
Tony Blair, of course, is preparing to come to Athens in a few days' time, for the signing of the Treaty by the 10 new Member States on 16 April.
He would do better to stay away.
For the Greek people he is persona non grata.
If he does come, if the bloodstained invader of Iraq sets foot on the Greek soil of freedom, he may be sure that he will never forget the reception which the Greek people have in store for him, a peaceful reception of course, but with flag-waving and voices raised in song.
. (EL) Regardless of the fact that the European Parliament was unable in the end to pass a resolution on Iraq, the way in which the majority of MEPs voted on the individual amendments is indicative of how it is dealing with this new demonstration of imperialist barbarity.
All the amendments condemning the war as unjust and illegal and calling on the Member States not to provide facilities to the invaders were rejected.
In an unprecedented distortion of the truth, the majority of members even voted against amendments which simply stated the obvious, that this war is being waged without the backing of the UN, is opposed by most members of the Security Council and has incited millions of people to take to the streets in daily protest.
By contrast, the amendments adopted prove that all the European Parliament is interested in is the so-called 'reconstruction' of Iraq, for which read the sharing out of the spoils, and further militarization of the ?U by strengthening the CSDP.
It seems to us that the more the American and British imperialists stain their hands with the blood of the Iraqi people, the further the masks of the so-called moderate European imperialists will drop.
The only opponent able to put an end to the war and overturn the powers supporting it is the anti-imperialist, grass-roots movement.
. (FR) I voted against the compromise resolution on Iraq because it goes back on the position taken up by Parliament on 30 January last.
The new resolution does not condemn this unilateral military intervention, which has taken place without the backing of the UN, which I consider to be essential.
Some Members appear to be more susceptible to the language of force and the fait accompli of this war than to international law and public opinion as expressed in street demonstrations.
The European Parliament, while bombs are destroying Baghdad and international law is being disregarded, is content to bemoan the war, regret the fact that inspections did not continue and ask the belligerents not to use weapons of mass destruction. This would undoubtedly have been a cause for concern for our citizens.
No resolution at all would be better than this lame compromise.
I wish to record my absolute abhorrence of the war against Iraq, which is in breach of international law and natural justice.
Unilateral action by the US and UK Governments endangers world peace, regional stability and undermines the authority of the United Nations.
I am deeply disappointed at some Member States and applicant countries who give military support to the conflict.
I am further disappointed at the hypocritical stance adopted by the Irish Government.
It parades a fictitious commitment to neutrality while allowing US army planes to use Shannon airport despite the clear condemnation by the Irish people of the action in which these planes are engaged.
I call on Parliament to demand the immediate end of this illegal war.
Parliament should call upon the United Nations Security Council to be convened, to take control of the situation and to mandate the Secretary-General to initiate steps to stop the war.
The United Nations Security Council should also authorise the deployment of UN human rights monitors throughout Iraq.
Iraqi and Kurdish authorities should provide the monitors with full access and cooperation to protect the Iraqi population, including the Kurdish population of northern Iraq, now potentially at risk of attack from Turkey.
. (FR) A swift end to hostilities in Iraq is highly desirable, as is the need to reduce collateral damage as much as possible.
In this context, we are in favour of setting up a humanitarian programme as a matter of urgency, in order to provide aid to the Iraqi people as soon as possible.
Looking at the bigger picture, we would like to see the preparation of plans to rebuild Iraq under the auspices of the United Nations.
We must also obtain a commitment from the Turkish authorities not to take any steps that could aggravate a new conflict in northern Iraq.
. (PT) Despite the humanitarian tragedy that the war against Iraq is causing, the majority of the European Parliament has unfortunately not adopted proposals by our group that sought to condemn this unjust, illegitimate and illegal war, which has been decided on unilaterally, in total breach of international law and against the majority opinion of the peoples of the entire world.
The proposals that called for an end to the bombardments and for a return to international legality were also rejected, as were those suggesting that the war now underway is a disaster for the region as a whole and for the entire world because it constitutes a threat to international security and runs the risk of creating permanent instability in the region, of causing the fragmentation of Iraq and of heightening tension, also leading to the resurgence of terrorism.
Consequently, so little remained that it would be preferable to maintain the position adopted on 30 January, in which the majority of Members of the European Parliament affirmed their commitment to the United Nations' remaining at the centre of the world order and roundly condemned a unilateral war.
We shall continue to fight against war, and to ensure its immediate cessation for the sake of peace.
I had hoped the European Parliament would do its job to bridge differences between our countries at this time of international crisis, and like every rational member in this Chamber I believe everything possible must be done to avoid war whenever possible.
However, when an amendment passed which specifically condemned the decision to take military action which has already started, and which involves some of our own countries, I found it impossible to give my support.
MEPs should instead have looked forward to our joint task to seek the swiftest possible end to conflict with the minimum of casualties, to humanitarian assistance for the Iraqi people and to plans for the rebuilding of the country under the firm auspices of the United Nations.
Europe will not truly influence America or world affairs unless we are able to resolve our differences and speak with a common voice.
That is the lesson to be learnt from today's failure to find an acceptable common resolution.
- (NL) For a year and a half we have known that President Bush of the United States wanted war.
Now that war is a reality, many politicians seem to have forgotten their objections.
They deplore the fact that the United States is acting outside the UN, but now want to show that they have remained friends.
The focus of attention has shifted to the redevelopment of a common foreign policy in the EU and common military action.
People no longer want to talk about the disaster for the Iraqi population, which has already suffered many years of war, isolation and sanctions, but rather about post-war reconstruction.
Of course, no one need shed any tears if the brutal dictator Saddam is removed, something which might have succeeded much earlier if Europe, the United States and Russia had not supplied him with weapons.
We do not know whether his successor will be any better for the Iraqi people, but he will certainly be better for the supply of oil to the United States.
The Kurds want their freedom, but the chance of breaking away from Iraq will not come from the United States.
I am afraid that the only result of any US victory will be that the US Government will wage war more often against regimes it considers hostile.
That is why this war must be stopped before it is too late.
The majority that rejects stopping it becomes an accessory.
Their best-case scenario now is that no judgment be passed.
.
(IT) The European Parliament cannot, on the tragedy of Iraq and the Middle East, continue to be divided and present different positions for ideological and exploitative reasons. Many points in a number of resolutions tabled preserve the discrepancy between what is a partisan position and what ought to be a political message seeking to further peace, the elimination of a bloody dictatorship and reconstruction, under the auspices of the UN.
To this end, we should start to concentrate as of now on relieving the suffering of children and the oldest citizens.
We must, once more, condemn the subversive attitude of those who persist, whatever the situation, in feeling that they must first and foremost represent their own political faction and who, for reasons of party politics, prevent the achievement of common positions.
. (PT) My position has been sufficiently expressed in the way I have voted in the many interlinked votes that have been held on the various motions for resolutions.
Let nobody else say that there is 'a European position' on this matter and that it is the decision of any particular government that has torn the EU apart.
The problem is extremely serious and complex and cannot be resolved either through demagogy, or through Member States passing the buck to one another.
Nor can it be resolved through attempts at blackmail, or through coercion within the Union.
The European Parliament's inability to adopt any position at all on the Iraqi crisis either, specifically in the current context, reveals the complexity of the real difficulties that exist - and these can only be overcome when there is mutual respect for the existence of these differences and for the significance of these differences, leaving behind the regrettable irresponsibility of the left, the daydreams of the pacifists and the dangerous new impulses of a certain centre- European approach.
Whatever is said about a so-called 'American empire', it is quite clear that Europe will never achieve a common position on international matters and issues as sensitive as this by transferring intra-European imperial bad habits or by knee-jerk reactions that betray the lingering presence of this old memory.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
In a debate yesterday on the situation in Iraq, a deeply respected French colleague said that it was hardly the time to lay blame when men, women and children were dying in this tragic war.
It is time to focus on the humanitarian needs of this long-suffering people and on the reconstruction of this beautiful country.
We must commit to giving our utmost support, financial and otherwise, to achieve this.
In so doing, we must ensure that we show the deepest respect to the different religious traditions in this country and to this ancient civilisation which has contributed so much to the world.
Words alone may contribute little to the resolution of this conflict.
For those of us who feel forced to stand and watch helplessly, Pope John Paul II, one of the world's greatest leaders, who has consistently reached out to the Muslim community, has asked us to fast and pray for a speedy end to this war.
. (FR) The various motions for resolutions concerning the situation in Iraq have been rejected one after the other by the Members of the European Parliament, who have been unable to agree on a single clear position with regard to this issue, even though it is essential to all our citizens.
Like the other European institutions, the European Parliament therefore appears to be a prime example of contradiction and impotence.
That should give cause for thought to those in the Convention who would like to increase Parliament's power.
Mr Simitis said to us yesterday that the Brussels European Council had carefully avoided getting to the crux of the matter.
The distribution of votes in Parliament today not only invalidates the vote distribution for the last resolution, but also highlights the scale and extreme nature of the differences of opinion that separate the various peoples of Europe with regard to the international situation.
We are far from the desired goal of a European people, or a so-called European public opinion, which the European Parliament is supposed to reflect.
The inability to establish a position on Iraq clearly shows that, although the European Parliament can act as a useful forum for discussion and debate, it cannot become a relevant setting for policy-making.
Foreign policy clearly remains the privilege of the people and the national States that represent their will.
. (PT) I have abstained from voting because the resolution that has been tabled is not as decisive as it could be with regard to the US position on the practice of preventive attacks.
I wish to emphasise the solidarity that we must show towards the Iraqi people and to the relatives of the young American and British soldiers who have died in this unjust war.
Mr President, I welcome a tough policy to restrict the use of pesticides.
According to the World Health Organisation, they are responsible for large numbers of cases of illness and even death worldwide each year, and their use has steadily risen.
This legislation will reduce the risk to human health and the environment posed by pesticides and is aimed at halving the quantities used within a decade.
This can only be achieved by creating a framework for taxes and other levies on pesticides and I support the plan to stop Member States from reducing VAT on pesticides.
Producers or importers should assume responsibility for the recovery and safe disposal of all pesticide packaging and pesticides past their expiry date and revoked pesticides products.
Reducing the levels of harmful active substances and in particular replacing the most dangerous by safer, non-chemical alternatives and encouraging pesticide-free crop farming are aims I very much welcome.
Mr President, it is, of course, a good thing that Europe is attempting to limit the harmful products which are used in farming to kill parasites and make fruit, vegetables and all agricultural produce as healthy as possible and to grow them in the greatest possible quantities.
However, I ask myself - and I wonder whether you might be asking yourself the same thing, Mr President, and whether the Greens, above all, might be asking themselves - why we do not increase research and scientific activities to create genetically modified organisms, GMOs, in agriculture to produce large quantities of high quality plants, fruit and agricultural produce which are resistant to parasites, which would therefore remove the need for genuinely harmful pesticides.
- (DA) We have today voted in favour of Mrs Van Brempt's report but believe it to be crucial to draw attention to the fact that the use of pesticides can never be regarded as a sustainable alternative, irrespective of whether there is a reduction in their use.
Instead, the sustainable use of pesticides gives the green light to the spreading of poison.
We have the following comments on the actual proposal.
The limit value should relate to a variety of different pesticides, plus their breakdown products.
The proceeds from fees should, most importantly, be used for clearing up in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle.
If pesticides are used at any stage at all in the production process, the final product should be labelled to that effect.
Finally, it should always be possible for a country to pioneer the right to maintain and introduce bans on the use of pesticides, partly on the basis of a national assessment in terms of the precautionary principle.
. (FR) I supported Mr Mulder's amendment aiming to delete Paragraph 30 of the Van Brempt report, as I consider it ridiculous to continue to invoke the precautionary principle with regard to GMOs.
For 12 years, in many parts of the world, it has been proven that the use of pesticides can be reduced thanks to genetic improvements, and there is nothing to suggest that GMOs are not a sustainable agricultural alternative.
Europe has been producing mad cows, dioxin chickens and other such delights.
Throughout the rest of the world, over 50 million hectares of genetically-improved plants are being grown with fewer chemical inputs and pesticides, and there are no scientifically-proven contraindications.
. (FR) I voted for this report.
It is essential to point out that this involves, first and foremost, a health problem.
An increasing number of diseases are undoubtedly linked to over-use of pesticides.
We should exert pressure on the various players concerned in order to rationalise and significantly reduce the use of these pesticides.
As far as possible, recourse to alternative crop-protection solutions should be encouraged.
We are aware of the responsibility of the agricultural professions, whose ambition is to achieve optimum product quality while preserving their way of life.
The environmental stakes in this matter are high: the quality of water and soil is suffering badly from over-use of pesticides, frequently with tragic, and sometimes as yet unknown, repercussions for human health.
It is vital for research to continue in this sector.
That is why I feel that, at this stage of research, it is premature to rule out the use of GMOs as a way of combating harmful organisms.
Strict independent monitoring combined with successful application of these new methods will allow organic agriculture to develop rationally.
The basic aim of the strategy is to reduce the impacts of pesticides on human health and the environment.
Pesticides are expensive commodities and farmers only use them where necessary.
We must not overlook the fact that pesticides play an important role in modern agriculture: using pesticides efficiently can increase crop yields and help maintain high standards of food quality and safety.
Pesticides play an important role in these elements demanded by European consumers.
The suggestion to reduce pesticide use by 50% is not predicated upon any scientific data.
It is a figure drawn from thin air which somehow gives the impression that pesticide use is inherently bad.
This is clearly not the case.
Minimising risks can best be achieved by improving controls on the distribution and use of pesticides, as well as substituting the more dangerous substances with safer alternatives.
Education and training programmes also play an important role in introducing alternative cultivation practices.
And indeed, there is certainly potential for using CAP pillar II funds to this end.
We also need to remember that a regulatory framework for marketing and using plant protection products already exists under EU law.
Any future strategy must remain compatible with the existing framework.
. (PT) Agriculture in the European Union is increasingly dependent on pesticides (327 000 tonnes in 1999).
Although we understand the importance of these substances in controlling pests, the fact is that alternatives do exist, particularly in organic farming.
Although it is believed that there can be no profitable agriculture without the intensive use of pesticides, this is only true if the environmental cost of all products is included in their final price.
Pesticides, however, entail enormous costs to the environment, such as the contamination of groundwater and the loss of biodiversity and costs to human health, such as endocrine disruption, infertility and cancer.
It is worth recalling that, according to the WHO, every year pesticides cause disease in 3 million people and the deaths of 220 000 throughout the world.
I therefore welcome this Communication by the European Commission and the report by Mrs Van Brempt, intended to ensure that European legislation on the use of pesticides is revised.
In this future legislation it is crucial that targets are defined, as well as timetables and means to ensure compliance with the objective of achieving a 50% reduction in the use of pesticides in the EU by 2010.
. (PT) I have abstained from the vote on this report despite feeling that overall it pursues the right approach to meeting the ambitious targets decided on at the Gothenburg European Council to promote sustainable development, even making this a criterion to be taken into account in all Community actions.
Primarily, according to the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture 'The communication is based on the study drawn up by Dutch institutions, without consulting the authorities of all the Member States.
As a consequence, it reflects the environmental issues linked to a certain system of production, and the measures outlined are not at all suited to the special features of the various European regions'.
I think, however, that the report goes too far and is somewhat unrealistic in some of the products it suggests prohibiting and, with regard to the use of tax-gathering mechanisms, imposing taxes as a deterrent, I have the greatest reservations about the logic of Community taxation that, as we know, is removed from the sphere of the European Union's competences and powers.
I also disagree with the references made to including GMOs in this provision, whereas, due to their special nature, they should instead be addressed separately.
I do, however, welcome the rapporteur's proposal to create national monitoring databases that contain all available non-chemical alternatives ?
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
- (DA) We are voting in favour of the resolution despite the fact that we do not in principle believe that this is an EU concern.
Since the limits already lie within the EU and it is a question of amending already existing regulations, we shall not vote against crew members' being given the aid to which they are entitled.
As I think you must be aware, Mr President, I am here because I have been elected by the pensioners to represent the Italian Pensioners' Party.
I have to say that, although this is not one of the subjects on which I usually speak to pensioners, I and the Pensioners' Party are in favour of the creation of a European Public Prosecutor, but only once we have a European penal code and a European code of criminal procedure.
I heard one Italian member of parliament say to another: 'Why is it that we are opposed to the creation of a European Public Prosecutor?'
'But of course we are!
Public Prosecutors in Italy - whom we are wont to condemn so heavily for being biased - are certainly better than the European Public Prosecutors which would be instituted by this directive!'
I therefore decided to take the same line as these Italian members of parliament, for justice is certainly the most important guarantee for all citizens, wherever they live in the world.
- (SV) We have voted in favour of the report aimed at establishing a European Prosecutor.
It is important that there be a supranational prosecutor able to protect the EU's financial interests.
The present system too often leads to problems due to the Member States' having different rules.
A European Prosecutor is therefore needed who can be effective in combating fraud directed against the EU's financial interests.
It is still too early to express an opinion on the precise rules that should apply to this prosecutor, but we are encouraged by the fact that the debate has begun.
It is important right now, however, to emphasise that the EU's prosecuting office must only devote itself to protecting the EU's financial interests, and nothing over and above that.
. (FR) We voted against the Theato report because the institution of a European Prosecutor would serve mainly to increase Brussels' power.
This objective undoubtedly explains the Commission's amazing determination to push this proposal through.
It had already presented it to the intergovernmental conference responsible for drawing up the Treaty of Nice, which rejected the offer.
The governments then chose the far more sensible option of Eurojust, in other words, the option of improved cooperation between national legal systems, with no supranational aspect.
The Commission is now back on the offensive with a Green Paper, and of course the European Parliament is following close behind.
Unfortunately for them, the competent working group of the Convention did not adopt this proposal as there was too much division.
Not a problem!
The Presidium took it up on its own initiative and automatically included it in its draft European Constitution.
Behind this determination, once again, lies a simple power struggle.
In the eyes of federalists, the European Prosecutor would have the main advantage of providing entry into the national legal systems and leading to a chain of reforms until total integration has been achieved.
We, on the contrary, must promote the idea of a network of national systems cooperating with each other.
Those of us who are members of the Moderate delegation wish to make it clear that we are in favour of establishing a prosecutor for crimes against the Community's financial interests.
We cannot however support the establishment of a general European Prosecutor with wider powers.
The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that, as MEP's, we have a duty to protect EU taxpayers' money.
We believe that the piecemeal approach to tackling fraud within the EU has been insufficient, and, whilst agreeing with the establishment of Eurojust, OLAF, strengthening the Court of Auditors and fraud-proofing legislation, we do not believe that these measures will tackle the problem of prosecution of EU fraud.
The role of the European Public Prosecutor should be restricted strictly to that of protecting EU finances.
We do not believe in the establishment of a European judicial area.
The role of the European Public Prosecutor should be to coordinate the prosecution, but the prosecution itself should be passed on to the Member States, who should have an obligation to prosecute.
Despite reservations on certain details contained in the Green Paper, we believe that it is important to allow for the possibility of establishing the European Public Prosecutor before enlargement takes place, and the added complications of prosecuting fraud in ten extra countries.
If we are serious about protecting the financial interests of the EU, we must accept that the current system is not working, and until we have an alternative on the table we must go along with this report.
. (IT) In the light of the work that the Convention is doing in the fields of justice and security, the proposal to create a European Public Prosecutor is in danger of widening the gap between the different positions which have already emerged within the Convention.
The need for a Community body to address and settle the specific issue of Community fraud can be resolved through Eurojust, and it is clearly becoming increasingly necessary to strengthen Eurojust.
For this reason, while we support the spirit of part of the proposal, namely the need for a Community instrument, we do not accept the instrument identified, and so we will abstain.
.
(DE) Fraud in the EU results in losses in the region of EUR 1 000 million a year.
Despite improvements in combating fraud, it is almost impossible to bring the abuse or improper application of EU money under control.
I repeat at this point my old criticism that structural abuse is inherent in the system.
Intelligent crooks are always one step ahead of the authorities.
That is why I also believe that far-reaching reforms are necessary.
Moreover, citizens cannot understand how on the one hand national austerity budgets can be tightened up while on the other EU money disappears.
And enlargement gives the problem a further dimension.
I expressly support the measures Mrs Theato proposes in her report, but I still maintain that only a fundamental reform of EU subsidies can get to the roots of the problem.
. (PT) Despite my concern at seeing serious irregularities in the management, use and protection of the Community's financial interests and despite my conviction that the Union's aims and values will not be upheld unless fraud is combated - which warrants a coherent and coordinated policy - I have voted against this report.
Agreeing in principle with the need to address this form of crime does not mean that we can show contempt for the various national criminal-law solutions of the Member States, arising from their own legal systems and traditions and much less allows us to discredit their abilities to dispense justice, in cooperation wherever necessary (Art 31 TEU).
The attempt to absorb the functions of the Member States put forward in the report, invoking the needs for effectiveness and on the pretext of combating financial crime, is, in my opinion, yet another obstinate federalist assault, which rejects other accessible and effective solutions and discounts the crucial and irreplaceable role of the States as conduits for European integration and privileged implementers of the law.
The express idea of creating a European system of criminal and procedural law that far exceeds the strict bounds of this report (and the provisions of the Treaties) is clear proof of this, since there has been no broad and thorough debate, or any serious discussion of all the implications arising from this.
- (SV) I voted in favour of the report.
The reason for my position is the tragic fact that fraud against the EU amounts to approximately EUR 1 billion every year. What is more, that amount is rising every year.
Legal proceedings are impeded by the fact that the national systems are so different from one another.
Moreover, the Member States patently fail to take legal measures against fraud.
Something must be done.
Establishing a special prosecuting office for combating financial crime against the EU would therefore be a proper and necessary step to take.
I have voted against Paragraph 1 on '? common provisions in the field of criminal law and criminal procedural law in the European Union'.
The same applies to Paragraph 4, to the effect that the European Parliament believes that '? in addition to the European area of freedom, a European judicial area be set up'.
In both these cases, the demands are too far-reaching and infringe the Member States' administration of justice.
Paragraph 21, clause 7 paves the way for the existing system's '? being extended - if appropriate - to other crimes'.
The wording would make it possible for a future European Prosecutor's mandate to be extended to include new areas of responsibility, over and above financial crimes against the EU.
Apart from the fact that this is, from the point of view of principle, a very dubious proposal, it needs to be analysed in depth before there is any presentation of it.
The proposal for a common prosecutor for financial crimes is the first step towards a common prosecutor for other crimes too, something I am unable to accept.
In the present situation, there is no reason to establish a European Prosecutor.
It is more important to evaluate what intergovernmental cooperation has led to.
It is too early, moreover, to evaluate Eurojust, which appears to be operating well.
It is also possible further to deepen intergovernmental cooperation in this area.
That concludes the votes.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 1p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 27 March 2003.
The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 3 April 2003 has been distributed.
The following changes have been proposed:
Monday
As regards the report by Mr Medina Ortega (JURI A5-0443/2002) on the Commission communication on simplifying and improving the regulatory environment, I have received from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian-Democrats) and European Democrats and from the Group of the Party of European Socialists a request to refer this report back to committee pursuant to Rule 144(1) of the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, following the discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and furthermore as a result of the presentation of new Commission documents on the same issue of improving Community regulations, my group believes that the report should be referred back to committee, with a view to presenting a proposal in plenum which can receive the widest possible support.
As no one wishes to speak against this request the matter is duly referred back to committee.
Wednesday
I have received from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance a request to include Council and Commission statements on humanitarian aid to Iraq.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the humanitarian situation in Iraq is clear to us all.
That is why our group still believes in the importance of a statement by the Commission and the Council on humanitarian aid prospects in Iraq and on the initial decisions that have been taken in this regard by these two institutions.
We would therefore ask for this point to be added to the agenda.
Mr President, the humanitarian situation was appalling prior to the war in Iraq because of the embargo.
It is now disastrous.
We have all been aware of that for a long time, however.
It is not news.
When our delegation of 31 Members of the European Parliament went to Baghdad two months ago, we met the UN agencies, who warned us.
Their representatives told us that, if there was a war, the situation would be disastrous.
I am therefore very pleased to say that the UN did not wait for Europe's support to address the humanitarian situation.
I consequently believe that Europe, which was unable to condemn this war and call for it to be brought to an end, should not try to salve its conscience by debating the humanitarian situation in this House.
Of course, we should shoulder our responsibilities, but there is no point in making a much overdue statement on this issue.
I am therefore against such a statement.
Mr President, the proposal presented by our group last week that we should debate humanitarian aid to Iraq was rejected with arguments such as 'it is hasty', 'we have not thought about it', or 'perhaps when the war is over'.
Mr President, I frankly believe that this is not a serious approach.
Our group believes that this debate should begin as soon as possible.
Mr President, I remember that very recently this Parliament approved a joint resolution stating that this crisis was unprecedented and required urgent action.
And it is not just necessary from a humanitarian and solidarity point of view, but also from a political point of view, because we must also re-establish the European Union's unity of action in the face of this conflict, this crisis and this war.
And the best way to do this would be to talk and to reach an agreement on humanitarian aid.
Mr President, I just wanted to protest at the decision of a majority of the Conference of Presidents not to send a delegation from the European Parliament to the first hearing of the trial of Leyla Zana, who is of course a Sakharov Prize laureate.
This decision was, I am glad to say, opposed by the Liberal Group and also by the GUE Group, but the Conservatives, Socialists and Green Group insisted on cancelling the delegation.
There had been lobbying from the Turkish side not to go, on the grounds that this was a sensitive time in Turkey.
Of course it is, but since the views of the Turkish population on Iraq are shared by most EU citizens, the EU as such should be neither more nor less popular than normal.
It is always a sensitive time to raise human rights and Kurdish rights in Turkey, but if we do not, we let down Turkey itself and its prospects of getting into the EU.
I therefore hope this House will join with me in deploring the majority decision in the Conference of Presidents.
I understand that a delegation will be sent to the second hearing on 25 April 2003, and I hope that arguments will not be found to cancel that as well.
The first decision was utterly deplorable.
I should like to confirm that at a recent meeting of the Conference of Presidents it was decided that a delegation would be sent to the next hearing, which is on the 25 April 2003.
Mr President, at the height of the two-fold crisis of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease in October 2001, the Commission proved incapable of managing the beef market.
This led to the collapse of cost prices and a rise in retail price.
In the face of this, the French trade unions shouldered their responsibilities, taking part, at the specific request of the Jospin government, in negotiations to prevent the collapse of the high-quality end of the market by establishing a minimum price.
This, to us, is a responsible attitude.
The Commission does not take the same view and heavily penalised what it calls an agreement on the price of meat.
The fact that these trade unions spoke out against CAP reform does not mean that the Commission should eradicate them.
That, Mr President, is why I am calling on you to ask the Commission to reverse this disgraceful decision, which equates to a genuine attack on the freedom of trade unions.
I would also appeal to you to ask the Commission to come to Parliament in order to provide an explanation, pursuant to Rule 38 of the Rules of Procedure.
The European Union can only function if it remains humanistic and fraternal.
I shall follow that matter up in the light of your comments.
Mr President, last week, at the Etaples cemetery, the graves of British and Irish soldiers were desecrated in response to the instigation of war in Iraq.
Mr President, I hope you will be able to associate yourself with the feelings of horror and concern that this desecration has already inspired, coming as it does at a time when British soldiers are fighting a war which, whatever the controversy over its instigation, sets democracies against totalitarian fascism.
I am not speaking solely as a Frenchman and an anglophile, but as a European militant who, one year away from the centenary of the Entente Cordiale, would like you, Mr President, to associate our institution with the commemoration of an event that led to a century of community, blood and glory and which is thereby a founding event of the European Union.
Mr Nordmann, I am pleased on behalf of the House, and from the Chair, to associate myself and the Presidency of the House with your remarks.
Mr President, on a point of order, I also wish to associate myself with those remarks.
However, what I wish to raise is the threat from SARS that may arise in Europe in the absence of any power at European level to deal with this matter in a concerted and coordinated way.
I realise there will be a debate on this matter, but unfortunately I will not have the opportunity to express an opinion on it.
I urge the Council to convene an urgent and informal meeting of European ministers for health to seek to coordinate a European response.
I ask this House and all the Member States to support the initiative by Commissioner Byrne to amend our Treaties so that we at least have the same powers to deal with human disease as animal disease.
I am sure, Mr De Rossa, that in the absence of your participation in the response to the Commissioner's statement, the Commission will happily take note of your comments.
Mr President, I would like to draw your attention, as corroborated by accounts in the Israeli and foreign press, to the fact that the Tulkarem refugee camp was invaded early on Wednesday morning by Israeli forces.
The soldiers ordered all men and boys between 15 and 55 to leave their homes and congregate at two locations in the camp.
There they were kept for many hours and interrogated one by one.
The army detained 11 men who were said to be wanted terrorists.
The other men and boys were then loaded on to buses and lorries which took them several kilometres outside Tulkarem, where they were told to get off and forbidden to go back to their homes for the next three days.
The army left them there with nothing but the clothes on their backs, making no provision of any kind for their three days of enforced exile.
Meanwhile some of the women of the Tulkarem refugee camp came to bring food and basic provisions to their husbands, brothers and sons, but then found that the soldiers would not let them back into the camp and they too became displaced.
An Israeli army colonel has taken public responsibility for this action, which is obviously against the fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a signatory.
He has declared it to be a good and successful action with satisfactory results.
I will take note of your comments and will raise them with the Israeli authorities and communicate the results to you.
Mr President, on a point of order, I wish to draw your attention to an article in the Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s, dated 30 March and headed 'Eavesdropping on half a dozen countries at Council headquarters.
EU alleges Israel was spy.'
Mr President, I am not naive enough to think that this incident is unique, and recognise that it is common practice for intelligence agencies worldwide to gather information for their governments.
Nonetheless, I should like to ask you what measures Parliament's security services have taken to detect similar bugging and spying devices within the newly-built Parliament offices.
In view of the committee report on Echelon, we should address the issue with some urgency.
As regards control measures, in the light of your question we are consulting the other institutions to establish whether there are things which remain to be done.
To the best of our knowledge, no one is eavesdropping here, since we try to conduct our business in public.
Nonetheless, we will continue to take whatever measures and precautions we can.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regardless of the agreements we may reach next Thursday on the resolution on Cuba, I would ask you to take urgent personal action to deal with the situation of the 78 people arrested, accused of conspiracy on the basis of Cuba's 1999 law on the protection of national independence and the economy.
According to a Spanish newspaper the main accusation against one of the people arrested, RaÃºl Rivero, is conspiracy by means of a subversive French agency, Reporters sans FrontiÃšres.
This demonstrates the current paranoia of the Castro dictatorship.
Since, furthermore, they are subject to entirely summary trials, I believe it is urgent that you intervene so that the situation and conditions being experienced by the accused may improve.
This group has been referred to on more than one occasion in this House in the recent past, by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra amongst others.
I have written to the Cuban authorities in very clear terms on the matter, but have not yet received a response.
I shall communicate the response to Members interested in the issue if and when I receive a reply.
We have already tried to intervene in the matter.
Mr President, we cannot but condemn the disdainful attitude of the US Secretary of State towards his European partners in ???? and the European Union in refusing to descend from his throne and receiving the European Union troika and his other counterparts at ???? headquarters as the new sovereign.
Mr Powell called for the dirty imperialist war to be sanctioned by the United Nations Organisation after the event and for the central role of the USA in sharing out the booty of the Iraqi people to be ratified.
In exchange, he offered the countries of the European Union and ???? a few crumbs from the bloodstained spoils of Iraq, provided they fund so-called humanitarian aid.
The Council owes us an explanation as to why no one in the meeting with Mr Powell uttered a single word in condemnation of the war.
What is this new role for the United Nations Organisation to which the Greek Presidency is already referring?
It must explain to us if, despite the constant, mass demonstrations by the people of Europe, the European Union is prepared to play the role of undertaker and follow the instructions of the USA to the letter, as leading government officials have given us to understand from their public statements.
This sort of political stand, which directly serves the interests of big business, will provoke even greater grass-roots reaction.
Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has decided - as Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm mentioned earlier - to ask for questions on Cuba to be put orally, so that we can discuss with the Council and the Commission the problems in that country, and to enable us, in an appropriate setting, to address the arguments in depth and come to our conclusions.
Mr President, a majority in my group have therefore already expressed their objection to a topical and urgent debate, as we believe the situation in Cuba to be so grave and so important that three-minute debates are not an appropriate place for taking decisions on the subject.
Mr President, I am familiar with your statement on the recent arrests in Cuba, and also with the Council's condemnation of Cuba's actions.
This is one reason why we believed that this issue should be dealt with in this context rather than in a topical and urgent debate.
Your response to the present situation was indeed the right one.
I want to ask whether we will actually have this oral question session.
It seems to me that the House has already spoken on the matter of the debate on breaches of human rights and the rule of law.
That debate will be held, but I do not think it should prejudice the possibility for a more detailed reflection by colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, if the committee wishes to do so with a view to organising an exchange of views with the other institutions.
Mr President, please allow me to express here in this House - which I have considered my home for ten years - the horror I feel at the death and mutilation of innocent victims in Iraq.
They all have names, just like you and me, and they are in no way mere statistics.
I wish to express my anguish because, although victory is being claimed, we do not yet know how this disaster is going to end; and shame, because this Parliament has not been able to reflect the views of millions of Europeans who are speaking out against this war throughout Europe.
I very much regret that this Parliament has not been able to draw up a resolution which says something very simple: 'Stop the war. Stop the killing'.
I would also like to express my horror at the fact that for some days we have seen the United States' Government blatantly and obscenely distributing the booty in the form of profits from reconstruction.
I think it is shameful that this Parliament has not even condemned this: this disgusting obscenity of the booty being distributed over the dead bodies not just of Iraqis but also of young British and American soldiers who are also losing their lives.
Mr President, I had no choice but to express these feelings.
I am bound to say that I share your general sense of disappointment that the House was unable to agree on any one of the multiple options available.
In terms of our preparation of these debates, perhaps it commends an appropriate degree of serenity, as well as the determined passion and commitment that we bring to these issues.
Mr President, I would just like to respond to the contribution from Baroness Ludford, who commented on the fact that in my capacity as chair of the EU Turkey delegation, I am supposed to have requested that no delegation be sent to Leyla Zana's trial.
That is incorrect.
I wrote a letter to you, Mr President, asking for the delegation to be postponed, not for it to be cancelled.
That is an important difference, because I, too, realise how important this delegation is.
Only it is also important to know when such a delegation will be going and who is going with it.
It is not true that only the Christian Democrats, the Socialists and the Greens thought that 28 March might not be a particularly good date.
Much more important was the fact that Mrs Zana herself let us know through her lawyer that it would not be a good thing to attend her trial on 28 March.
I find it slightly odd that there are groups in this Parliament, and now Baroness Ludford too, who want to go whatever the cost because Parliament has decided to go.
On the other hand, what the person we are visiting and want to support thinks about such a request is, in my view, very important.
She has repeatedly told us that it would be much better to go at a later date with the full Parliament delegation.
That is how the matter stands, and I think it is a pity that the Baroness has not put these things in a good light.
Mr President, on a lighter note, it is traditional for Parliament's spring part-sessions to be pleasantly besieged by schoolchildren, by groups of pupils and students from all over Europe.
It is the season for organised school trips.
However, not everybody is equally able to take advantage of this great opportunity which we could be offering to all our European young people: indeed, the pupils and students from the furthest, outermost regions cannot come for reasons of money, because of the costs involved.
Up until a few years ago, Parliament gave tangible assistance and funding to schools and schoolchildren throughout Europe, but then, in order to save money, this funding was stopped.
I have looked into the matter briefly and discovered that some funding is given to the Regions - to the regional authorities - but that it is up to the Regions how they administer it.
It does not seem right, Mr President, that schoolchildren who come from far away should not have the same opportunity as those who live nearer to come and see how we work and what we do, as they would have had in the past.
I feel that, out of all the money we might spend on groups of visitors, the money spent on young people is, without a doubt, the most important and such as to warrant a small financial sacrifice too.
Mr Santini, I shall ask the services to prepare a note for you on the evolution of the different budget elements in recent years.
In my role as President, having met a good number of school groups, I know that we continue to invest heavily in the Euroscuola programme for children from schools within the Union.
This will soon be extended to children in schools in the candidate countries.
I will ask colleagues to communicate with you on other changes and see if this is an issue we should consider.
Mr President, on behalf of my group I have always made an effort to support dialogue between this Parliament and the Cuban authorities and people.
But I believe, Mr President, that this Parliament should not fail to raise its voice in these circumstances, when there has been a wave of arrests of peaceful dissidents, of defenders of human rights and independent journalists, such as RaÃºl Rivero and Ricardo GonzÃ¡lez Alonso, for whom the prosecutor is asking for sentences of between 20 years and life, within the context of a summary trial, which neither the press nor diplomatic representatives accredited in Havana have been able to attend.
Mr President, my group and I are aware of and we support the initiative presented by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to hold a debate on this situation in May, but I believe, Mr President, that this Parliament would not be doing its duty, and would be doing little to serve the cause of freedom, unless it raises its voice to condemn these events and all acts of violence which have taken place or which may take place in Cuba, to communicate its solidarity with the families of the victims and the people arrested, and to be very firm in its fundamental demand for freedom.
As regards your suggestion for a date in May, I am glad to see that your group's president, Mr Poettering, was listening.
Such a proposal should come from your group or any of the other groups via the Conference of Presidents.
Mr President, you have called for serenity in these debates, but bombs do not create a feeling of serenity.
I condemn the desecration of the cemeteries in England, which I consider deplorable.
Today, however, in the face of war, my feelings of horror do not stem from this, but from the thousands of Iraqi deaths and the intensive bombing that is spreading terror in Baghdad and Basra and killing men, women, children and old people. It also stems from the water shortage, which might lead to epidemics.
I have noticed that the indignation of some Members of this House is selective.
I personally condemn this war, the oil trusts and other trusts linked to the UK and US Governments, which are terrorising an entire nation and already sharing out the profits of reconstruction.
Mr President, a number of Members have expressed concern about the humanitarian situation in Iraq.
What we can say with confidence is that the situation of the people of Iraq will be enormously improved with the removal of Saddam Hussein and his tyrannical regime.
This House should congratulate the actions of the coalition armed forces, in particular of the United States and the United Kingdom, who have been instrumental in bringing about the downfall of that ghastly regime.
I am sorry that Saddam's supporters in this House have been confounded.
We should congratulate the coalition armed forces for their restraint and their great success.
Mr President, I would like to insist that the seriousness of the events taking place in Cuba requires an in-depth debate, and I would therefore be delighted if we could pursue the idea of an oral question with an in-depth debate on the issue.
I would also like to insist, however, that one issue does not cancel out the other.
I therefore believe that the seriousness of the summary trials which have taken place, the seriousness of the arrests suffered by people who have simply exercised their right to free expression, or the right to employ the law in force to create areas of freedom, requires that this House immediately speak out in order to send a message of hope to these people who are currently experiencing great suffering and worry and I believe it would be very positive if on Thursday we can condemn what is taking place in Cuba.
Mr President, I too would like to ask you to send a message to the President of the United States, Mr Bush, and to the United Kingdom Prime Minister, Mr Blair, recognising the remarkable achievement that, after only two weeks of war, we are now beginning to see the long-suffering Iraqi people being freed from one of the bloodiest tyrants in the world today, and with such a low level of civilian and military casualties, all things considered, in view of the enormity of the task involved.
Every loss of innocent life is a tragedy, but Saddam Hussein has executed and tortured more people in the last two weeks for desertion and for welcoming our troops than the alliance may have killed accidentally as a result of the military hostilities.
War is never without a price in terms of human suffering, but human freedom and global security for all of us here today has no price.
The next item is the Commission statement on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to inform this House of the circumstances surrounding the condition known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, to use the acronym. It can be divided into a number of different questions.
What is it?
Where does it come from? How does it spread?
How can we stop it?
This syndrome is a respiratory disease that has recently been reported in Asia, North America and Europe.
The illness usually begins with a fever, sometimes associated with other symptoms such as chills, headache and body aches.
After two to ten days SARS patients may develop a cough that might progress to difficulties in breathing.
In 10 to 20% of cases patients will require mechanical ventilation.
It is estimated that in 4% of cases SARS proves to be fatal.
At present no treatment beyond good intensive and supportive care has been consistently shown to improve the condition of persons with SARS.
In relation to the causative agent, the scientists have detected a previously unrecognised virus belonging to the family of coronaviruses in patients with SARS.
While the new coronavirus is still the leading hypothesis for the cause of SARS, other viruses are still under investigation as potential causes.
On the question of transmission, the principal way SARS appears to be spread is through respiratory secretions called droplets, namely, when someone with SARS coughs or sneezes droplets into the air and someone else breathes them in.
Nevertheless, other ways of transmission cannot be ruled out, such as direct close contact with an infected person.
In particular, health-care workers or household members of a SARS patient have been known to be affected.
But concern has been raised on other potential ways of transmission.
On the question of the origin: recently a WHO investigation team has been authorised by the Chinese Government to travel to Guangdong province.
Scientists currently speculate that the SARS virus either jumped to humans from an animal species or mutated into a more virulent form.
In its continuing work, the WHO team is expected to visit Foshan City, where the first case of SARS was reported.
On the question of numbers in the European Union, all 15 Member States have reported to the Commission a total of 46 cases - 19 probable and 27 suspected - with no deaths.
It is also important to note that there has been no local transmission within the European Union.
In the candidate countries, EFTA and other European countries, 14 countries have reported data, a total of eight cases - three probable and five suspected - with no deaths.
In the other countries, to date a total of 2396 cases have been reported, including 89 deaths.
The unknown factors combined with the global spread of this disease have inevitably prompted extensive media attention.
However, we should not lose sight of the fact that although SARS is often referred to as a 'killer pneumonia', estimates indicate that it kills fewer people than 'normal' influenza.
SARS, however, demonstrates very clearly that we are living in a truly global environment, where the increasing mobility of people also enables diseases to move ever more freely.
Because of the ease and extent of modern travel, an increasing level of preparedness is required across borders to deal with the threat posed by communicable diseases.
In the European Union, surveillance and coordination at Community level need to be strengthened to address the threat to public health.
I have been stressing this need for some time now, and in the European Convention, the report prepared by Mr Katiforis has recognised this and I hope the Convention will take this up in its discussions.
The EU Communicable Diseases Network started its work three years ago to detect and control communicable diseases in people, irrespective of the cause and means of transmission.
This Network serves to survey and investigate the outbreaks.
This also involves identifying the cause and defining control measures.
The Commission's role is to coordinate and support these activities.
This SARS outbreak puts to the test the real capacities of the two pillars of the Network - epidemiological surveillance and early warning.
The Network committee has, together with the Commission, defined and put into operation an effective surveillance system.
This system picks up all suspected SARS cases and gives a complete and clear picture of developments during the outbreak.
Obviously we have to be cautious, and err on the side of safety.
This approach seems to be working: most of the suspected cases turn out to be something else.
However, this does not give grounds for complacency.
The European Union surveillance strategy on SARS is fully connected to the global surveillance coordinated by the World Health Organisation.
The second element of this strategy is prevention.
We must work together to reduce exposure to the disease.
Unnecessary travel to affected areas should be discouraged or postponed.
Hong Kong and the Guangdong province of China have been identified in this respect by the WHO.
This is under constant review and further advice will be issued if the situation in other regions warrants travel restrictions.
Similarly, all would agree on the importance of health screening on departure from the affected areas and the provision of information to passengers and flight crews.
The Commission is playing its role of coordinator, and encouraging common approaches and criteria.
During the last three weeks my services have tried to integrate national measures with global ones, through regular meetings, audio-conferences and consultations with the Member States, candidate countries and the WHO.
SARS, of course, entails other dimensions in addition to public health implications.
The SARS outbreak has already made a political and economic impact.
Travel advice has had an impact on air travel and tourism in Asia.
Now, industry exhibitions and meetings have been postponed and it is predicted that Asia's economic growth may be affected.
Obviously, earlier notifications to the WHO by those affected could have mitigated many of the effects.
This is a key lesson for the future.
I must stress that the capacity of the Commission to extend its coordinating and facilitating role any further is currently at its very limit.
In the absence of new arrangements to pool the existing expertise we will not be able to go beyond our current efforts.
I have referred on many occasions to our plans to strengthen our capacity to deal with communicable diseases.
In my view, the most effective way to strengthen Community activities is to set up a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
As many of you will be aware, we are well advanced in the preparation of the enabling legislation which I intend to table in the next couple of months.
My proposal will be to establish such a centre by 2005.
The centre will enhance surveillance.
It will coordinate and facilitate common responses, and collaborate with Member States, third countries and international organisations, in particular the WHO.
It will not replace existing national capacities, but rather hook them up to act as a reference and coordination point both in routine and crisis situations.
This will also play an important role in an enlarged Europe.
On a multinational level the SARS situation can be said to be under control, but not improving, as had initially been expected.
In Europe the situation still appears to be manageable.
However, the strict control procedures will have to continue.
In the fight to beat this disease it is crucial for anybody who believes they have the symptoms and have travelled in the affected areas to consult their doctor.
We must not neglect the support that the EU and its Member States can give to the affected countries in their search for the cause and the remedy.
There is still an ongoing discussion whether the responsible agent is close to the common cold or coronavirus.
We must continue to support the WHO in its endeavours in this regard.
Finally, I can assure you that the Commission will continue with the Member States, and in close collaboration with the candidate countries and the WHO, to do everything within its powers to defeat the spread of SARS.
In response to what Mr De Rossa said earlier, I can say that there have been preliminary discussions with the Council to organise a meeting of the Council in the near future to discuss this issue further.
Mr President, we have an excellent opportunity today to debate and understand certain basic public health issues and advance them at European Union level.
As I had the honour of acting as rapporteur on public health for the European Union, may I say that it is extremely important that one of the three lines of approach of this programme over the next five years is to develop a rapid response to health hazards.
I have two or three comments and then I will come back to what the Commissioner said about a centre, which is essential now, if we are to be able to deal efficiently with health hazards.
As I am sure you all well know, the mobility which exists today, with millions of people travelling to all corners of the planet, has boosted infectious diseases enormously.
We have seen as much in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome. It started in a province of China and there are now cases even in Europe.
The second important point is that there are sudden epidemics of new diseases.
Over the last twenty years, there have been reports of thirty new infectious diseases, or variations on old diseases caused by mutating viruses, or even the re-emergence of old diseases such as tuberculosis, to give but one example.
Consequently, all this calls for constant vigilance, constant monitoring and a response, an organised, coordinated response.
Then there is the known resistance to antibiotics which bacteria are developing.
Nowadays, you go into hospital to be treated for some illness or other and suddenly the whole hospital is contaminated, sometimes very, very seriously.
So these sorts of bacteria, which we cannot treat with antibiotics, are also a hazard and we need research to deal with them.
Finally, one last point: biological terrorism.
Biological terrorism, where terrorists use bacteria spores or viruses or some other means, is also a threat that calls for a coordinated and proper response.
To come back to what the Commissioner said earlier, what I have just said bears out the need he mentioned for a centre at European Union level which will have the facilities, a network of laboratories, to study and monitor and coordinate these responses, so that we can investigate diseases quickly and quickly establish both their causes and how to treat them. Consequently, we need to have the courage to promote this centre.
A symposium on this centre was held at the European Parliament in November under the aegis of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, attended by thirty of the most eminent epidemiologists.
Allow me to read you the conclusion in English, which dates from November, in other words before SARS. It says:
Mr President, I fear that I must disappoint Mr Trakatellis, something that is relatively easy when he hopes that the members of the Convention are now listening and will suddenly start regarding health policy as a priority.
I do not believe that they will.
Having listened attentively to Mr Byrne and Mr Trakatellis, I agree with them, and, whilst much of what they have referred to is of course necessary, what we have done so far is not enough.
The European system for the epidemiological monitoring and control of communicable diseases that we already have can only be as good, in terms of quality, reliability and speed, as the national systems, and these differ in every respect.
That is why I agree with you that we should set up a scientific research centre.
That, though, will be but a drop in the ocean.
I am sure that you, Mr Trakatellis, want more research, and equally sure that Mrs Malliori will endorse that, but that is not what we really need.
The European Union has hitherto specifically excluded the possibility of harmonising legislation.
It is specifically laid down in our system for combating communicable diseases that national legislation will not be harmonised.
You stated earlier, Commissioner, that the most important thing now is prevention, that we must, for example, reduce encounters with certain diseases and exposure to them.
What about if plague returns to Europe or breaks out again anywhere?
What about if polio, infantile paralysis, again becomes widespread?
Are we prepared for those eventualities?
I can tell you plainly that, no, we are not prepared.
An epidemiological system that results, for example, in it being recommended in some countries - but not in others - that one should not travel to certain regions, and in observation being carried out at airports in some European Union countries, but with nothing of the kind being done in others, is no use whatever.
So I have to tell you, very plainly, that the only thing we have to do - although we all have to agree on it - is to incorporate in the Treaty a competence for health policy.
Mr Trakatellis, I would be the first to applaud enthusiastically if you were to get your group to accept that.
I have not read any great number of statements on the Convention in which that desire was expressed, and I am quite certain that Mrs GrossetÃªte has not either, but as for you, Mr Poettering - and I see that you are listening - do you say that there has to be a Community competence for health policy?
We are eager to find out!
It might well not have done so at the highest level, but my group has clearly stated that we want no more centres serving as alibis.
The European Union is meant to have proper competences to deal with such problems.
What will we be saying to people at next year's European elections?
Do we really have equal standards - at least minimum standards - of hygiene, which enable us to fight disease and beat it?
You asked, Mr Trakatellis, whether people in hospitals can get even more ill.
They can indeed, because we have no comparability between hospitals' standards of hygiene.
Is that the European Union that we want our citizens to live in?
No!
We want not just competition and the internal market, but also social security and health care.
So far, we have not achieved them.
If we now take this case, of SARS, as an example and want to make something of it, we must succeed in gaining a mandatory competence at European Union level for health policy.
I ask you, Mr Byrne, as a matter of urgency, to support us in this and bring our need for a Community competence to the ears of the Commission and Mr Prodi - who has always told us that he has an ear open to the soul of the people, something that the examples of the European Food Agency and the Food Safety Authority have brought to our notice.
Mr Byrne, I will support you if, in the forthcoming Budget debates, you demand more personnel and double your budget estimate.
When it comes to summoning up the courage to do that, though, you are on your own.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I would like to send my condolences to the families of the victims - a total of 100, as the Commissioner has said - of this epidemic of atypical pneumonia. This virus, as we have also said, is spreading at the speed of air travel over the whole planet, in particular in South-East Asia and Canada.
Europe so far appears to have been spared, relatively speaking. The Commissioner has given the current figures in the Member States and the candidate countries.
I would also like to thank him for his detailed description of the two-way exchange of information between the WHO and the EU monitoring system.
At this stage, what can be said?
First of all, I believe there is cause for concern, if we refer to the statements made by a WHO spokesman, who said that this will be complex and could be a very long-term project.
In short, the fight against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic seems to be a real race against time for health authorities and researchers all over the world, in particular as far as treatment is concerned.
Secondly, we do have grounds for reassuring European citizens, as far as we can, as the Commissioner stated in a press release that only those suffering from the disease are infectious, which facilitates traceability.
That said, however, it should be stated here that it is impossible not to be disgusted by the Chinese Government's behaviour, which was both thoughtless and irresponsible.
It took the Chinese Minister for Health almost five months after this virus first appeared to make the information public.
Having said this, I shall return to Europe to end on the most important point. It should be noted here that this new crisis provides yet another argument for the case of those, including the previous speakers and, of course, myself, who want public health in the broadest sense to become a shared competence of the Union.
