They want to arrange the fine tuning of migration themselves, although their strategies have already been a failure at national level for decades.
I trust that we will soon manage to persuade our colleagues at national level that there is no alternative to Union-wide control of migration.
Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that after the tragic events of 11 September, asylum and immigration policy will be undergoing drastic changes.
In the light of this, it may have been more appropriate to postpone the discussion of these reports because they do not take into consideration recent international developments.
Particular attention should be devoted to the formulation of Paragraph 15 in the Pirker report.
The present document emphasises that the Member States are obliged to respect the rights and duties of third-country nationals.
In my opinion, this is a bridge too far.
Two-way integration is not feasible as long as there is no reciprocity and mutual recognition.
In other words, only if reciprocity and mutual recognition are secured in third countries can two-way integration take place.
The Pirker report has the merit of being frank. It presents immigration as a simple problem of merchandise linked to the needs of the capitalist system.
In effect, the report regards as positive the view that immigration should be envisaged from an economic viewpoint, as a function of the needs and capacities of Member States.
Article 23 could not be clearer.
Each Member State has the freedom to define the skills profile and number of workers required on the basis of the needs of its labour market.
In other words, the proposed Community policy on immigration is a quota policy.
By adopting such a position, Europe shows that it is still a long way from recognising the right to immigration.
What we have here is residence permits restricted by the requirements of the bosses and the fantasies of the demographers.
Even the issue of keeping families together is going to be subject to different rules for each group of immigrants, which is the exact opposite of freedom of movement, freedom to select one' s place of business, and the right to live with one' s family.
Massively overexploited, immigrants are the victims of liberal deregulation.
I shall end by saying that only the general regularisation of the position of illegal immigrants plus citizens' rights will enable us to combat effectively the modern slavery which we are being invited to support.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are fully aware that this debate addresses one of the most important and 'hottest' issues at European level: Common asylum and immigration policy.
This situation is the result of two separate factors: firstly, it has come about because the Treaty of Amsterdam granted new competences to the Community, opening up new possibilities for action on a European scale; and secondly, because there has been a considerable increase in migratory pressures from third countries, the devastating effects of which have been highlighted by certain recent tragic events, such as the massive influx of refugees from the Kosovo crisis and the tragedy at Dover.
It is therefore necessary, for both humanitarian and economic reasons, to define a global policy that is able to effectively manage these migratory flows, which currently constitute a legal vacuum, to which the European Union cannot fail to provide a response.
We must take account of the fact that three different types of people are involved in this problem: asylum seekers, temporarily displaced persons and economic migrants.
Although the symptoms are similar, it is important to distinguish the causes and find different answers.
Confusing the status of these people does not help to solve the problems we are facing, and actually makes them worse.
We also know that this external pressure adds to the internal pressure felt by States that are facing a decline in their own population, caused both by a slowdown of population growth and a reduction in the population of working age, with an increasing population of those over the age of 65. Concern is also growing about the sustainability of social security systems.
The answer cannot be to make vain attempts at preventing and halting immigration at Europe' s borders.
The answer lies, instead, in managing and freezing it at current levels.
Hence the need for a carefully thought out, clear and coherent common European policy for the management of migratory flows.
In order to prevent new problems emerging, we will have to consider the real labour needs of each Member State and the resources available for the reception and integration of these immigrants.
It must be understood that we incline more to the approach advocated by Mr Pirker.
I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on his announcement today that, within a month, he will be presenting two initiatives on combating illegal immigration and on repatriation.
Lastly, I wish to emphasise that we need to adopt a prudent approach to a sensitive issue that requires intelligent answers.
It makes more sense, for example, for us to give priority to legalising immigrants who can be integrated into the labour market and who are already on Community territory than encouraging a new wave of immigration.
Mr President, at this stage, the European institutions and this Parliament in particular are fully aware that due to the complexity and importance of the subject we are dealing with today, a legislative programme is needed that will only be effective within the framework of a common and coordinated European approach.
There are many points of agreement between the Commission communication and the reports we are debating today.
We need to develop a more proactive policy which recognises that pressure from migration is set to continue and that properly planned immigration can bring benefits to Europe, to the migrants themselves and also to their countries of origin.
Our aim is to improve the management of migratory movements within the framework of close cooperation with countries of origin and of transit, strengthening the fight against illegal immigration and combating the criminal networks involved, guaranteeing, at the same time, the rights of victims.
What is required is a more open and flexible policy which, in addition to providing greater coordination of policies aimed at reducing migratory pressures and strengthening border controls, could have the benefit of achieving a reduction in illegal immigration that would be advantageous to those very people who truly need the protection that refuge and asylum affords.
We should maintain these levels of protection at all costs, as envisaged in the Geneva Convention, for this is also a sign of European identity that fills us all with a sense of pride.
I would encourage Commissioner Vitorino to continue his good work and to keep to the timetable that has been fixed, and the Council to be equal to the position adopted at Laeken, thereby fulfilling the commitments made at Tampere.
It is time to take practical decisions and not to make statements that are only balanced because of their ambiguity.
These are the hopes and needs of Europe' s citizens.
Mr President, we cannot talk about immigrants and immigration without distinguishing between the different types of immigrants. There are at least three different types of immigrants: political refugees, refugees from war zones and economic migrants.
Once this distinction has been made, it immediately becomes clear that a single asylum law cannot cover all three categories, as Mr Evans proposes.
Not only does this document fail to correspond to reality, it even goes so far as to demonise the Member States which demand the right to decide whether to recognise the right to asylum on a case-by-case basis, depending on the way the society of the country in question is structured and the adequacy of the reception facilities available, without incurring negative repercussions for anyone.
Instinctively, all of us have always been supportive of those who find themselves in the dreadful situation of being forced to leave their own country and apply for asylum in another, but the level of danger to which the rapporteur would have it conceded that all applicants are exposed in their countries of origin is not always acceptable. He is compelling governments and Member States - to put it in colloquial terms - not to make a fuss and to open their gates without delay, invoking the Geneva Convention as if it were a magic password, a skeleton key, rather than what it actually is, a series of guarantees that place those seeking and those granting asylum on an equal footing.
Mr Evans' proposal to establish a common minimum standard - as he calls it - actually invalidates this principle by making it too permissive.
The same may be said of the proposal to introduce a single procedure - as it is called - which, in practice, takes away from the host State any possibility of verifying the suitability of the applicant, who cannot be denied any right, mind you, and whose only obligation is to produce his credentials, as happens among respectable people.
The problem is that refugees and exiles often provide easy cover for decidedly undesirable guests such as drug dealers, traffickers in human beings and terrorists who pretend to be immigrants and then train as pilots and destroy skyscrapers and all the people working inside.
The caution and controls that the rapporteur is denying the States are the fundamental elements of basic, legitimate protection of the States and their citizens.
The Pirker report, which I do support, on a common immigration policy, is much more responsible, not least because it is more balanced, does not make concessions to cheap populism and respects safety measures.
Lastly, to those Members of the left who have attempted once again to bring up the usual controversy against Mr Berlusconi today, I would point out that they are at least a day late.
They should read the Arc-en-ciel; although they have missed the debate, they are still on time for the train of cheap populism and pointless political speculation.
Mr President, thank you for allowing me to take the floor after such a long and full debate.
I believe that there is no doubt at all that the two reports we have seen today prove that we need a common policy on migration and asylum.
I should like, in passing, to pay tribute to the Commissioner' s statement and to all the work that Parliament has carried out, which shows that we attach real importance to these issues, particularly in the current circumstances.
I believe that here today we have been able to make our different views clear, and perhaps we have also made clear the difference between asylum and economic migration.
I am not sure, however, that we have entirely avoided confused thinking.
On the subject of migratory flows and the right of asylum, we must make it clear, in the face of all opposition, that rights and obligations have to be shared, by both migrants and host Member States.
We must not have a situation in which certain people can take advantage of the loopholes in our harmonisation in order to create an underclass of Europeans by introducing second-class workers or deferred citizenship.
It seems to me to be important that the rights of workers, of whatever origin, should be asserted and given tangible expression in order to combat the trafficking in human beings, by which certain people exploit misery and distress.
As for our asylum policy, it will gain in terms of quality and justice if we can agree to recognise that it needs to be supplemented by other compulsory cooperation policies which enable everyone to live with dignity and self-respect in their own countries.
In all cases, asylum policy should reject arbitrary criteria linked to the current situation.
I should also like to ask, simply, that we should also give political rights to those whom we welcome for their work.
Mr President, I would ask Members to ponder one question: is it viable in today's world for all matters of asylum policy to be decided within the parameters of the Geneva Convention?
The Geneva Convention drafted in 1951 was conceived as a temporary measure.
It was negotiated in a very different world - a world still haunted by the shameful failure of Western countries to offer sanctuary to the victims of European fascism.
It was designed first and foremost to ensure that refugees from communist tyranny would have access to safe havens.
But the world has moved on.
Mass air travel has facilitated unprecedented migratory flows.
The great majority of those seeking better lives in new countries are actuated by understandable - indeed laudable - economic motives.
But the terms of the 1951 Convention, and specifically the requirement to assess all claims individually, even if the applicant is manifestly coming from a safe country, encourage economic migrants to seek entry as refugees.
This clogs the system to the disbenefit of those genuinely fleeing from injustice and wrong.
I support, as Mr Pirker's report does, a degree of controlled primary immigration.
All countries can benefit from the energy and enterprise of people who are prepared to cross whole continents in search of a better future.
For such a policy to gain public consent it must be fair and transparent and it must be open to account.
It cannot be right for the judiciaries of our Members States, by applying a peculiar interpretation of the 1951 Convention, to operate an immigration policy beyond the control of elected politicians.
If we want to manage a sustainable policy of legal immigration and, at the same time, protect the rights of those most in need of sanctuary, we must take back control of our asylum laws from the judges.
Far from enlarging the scope of the Geneva Convention, as Mr Evans suggests, we should scrap this outmoded accord and replace it with something more suited to the modern world.
Mr President, today's debate on asylum and immigration is extremely topical, what with insecurity and fear about military operations in the Middle East giving rise to mass movements of desperate people.
Waves of refugees have already reached the European Union, their first port of call being Greece, which is the European Union's closest border with the Middle East.
Ladies and gentlemen, Greek islands are under pressure from an unprecedented influx of refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from Afghanistan.
Greece is having to shoulder a burden which is out of proportion to what it can cope with, which is why the European Union urgently needs to take its share of the responsibility, in this specific case by helping Greece to draw up an integrated joint plan to protect the right of asylum and ensure that the Geneva Convention is fully applied.
Obviously, the sacred right to asylum must not, under any circumstances, be undermined by the measures needed to combat international crime and terrorism.
In any event, mass movements of people will be dealt with under a fairer global policy to reduce inequalities and resolve differences using peaceful means.
Mr President, the increase in the number of asylum seekers over the last few years is causing grave problems for Member States, which are having serious difficulty in coping with the situation.
As Deputy Mayor of the city of Lyon, I see this problem every day.
In my city, the number of conventional asylum seekers has doubled in a little less than a year.
The two Commission communications that we are debating today are certainly an important step forward.
However, we must go further and put an end to the current situation, in which some Member States allow in refugees coming from certain countries whereas others do not.
We must ensure that the countries that receive refugees really do have the means to do so.
In recent times, however, those means have been reduced.
We can no longer receive asylum seekers with dignity.
In our cities we have families living under canvas.
This is absolutely unacceptable. Winter is approaching and we are heading for a catastrophe.
In order to make progress, however, I invite, above all, the governments of Member States and the Council to take the courageous decisions that are necessary.
Insisting on maintaining positions which are too national will end up becoming indecent and irresponsible when the lives of thousands of refugees are at stake and when certain districts in our major European cities are at risk of turning into ghettos.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief, because I know that voting time is approaching.
First of all, I wish to thank you for all your contributions to this debate, including the critical contributions, and clarify two points of criticism I think are important.
First: with regard to the comment by Mr Nassauer, the Commission has not abandoned the principle of the safe third country.
It has not abandoned this principle at all and in fact we are working, in Council, on a definition of a safe third country and I am sure that, as Mr Nassauer said, Mr Schilly will continue to be as tough a negotiator on this matter as he always has been.
With regard to the second aspect, I should like to remind you that the Commission has given itself the task of reviewing its proposals in light of the international situation that has arisen following the terrorist attacks in the United States of America.
The review is now underway.
We shall undertake this task with the utmost rigour and the results will be submitted to Parliament. The Commission does not take a positive view, however, of the implication that there is a link between terrorism and immigration.
The Commission has put forward proposals that respect rights and seek to manage migratory flows. There are also proposals on combating illegal immigration.
Any attempt to portray the Commission as having no initiatives on fighting illegal immigration is unfair. The proposal for a framework decision against trafficking in human beings adopted by the Council last week is a Commission proposal.
The communication on illegal immigration, the communication on repatriation policy and the communication on the joint policing of borders have been on the 'scoreboard' since May 2000 and are part of the Commission' s work programme that was submitted for debate in this Parliament this year. These are not the result of emergency measures arising from the terrorist attacks; they are an integral part of this Commission' s coherent and consistent immigration policy.
Lastly, I wish to thank Parliament for its support.
I hope that, with the clear ideas that have emerged from this debate, the Laeken European Council will be able to take a step forwards.
These measures provide added value at European level and I thank the European Parliament for its contribution.
(Applause)
Mr President, I feel I must request the floor because I find this situation intolerable and wish to protest at the great number of speeches from large political groups in this Chamber that have sought, this morning, to link terrorism with immigration, asylum seekers and, more than once and in a direct manner, immigration of Islamic origin.
This seems a very irresponsible attitude to me, a time-bomb threatening peaceful coexistence, and I would like to remind you all that many a terrorist with white skin has been born to the world from our own European continent.
Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­, I am afraid that was not a point of order.
I will not permit any further discussion of this.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the reasons I expressed yesterday and considering the fact that you have adopted my legislative amendments, I call upon you to postpone the vote on the legislative resolutions until the possibility of an agreement with the Commission and the Council increasing Parliament' s role, pursuant to Rule 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, can be ascertained.
I therefore call upon you to vote on the motion which is not a legislative resolution, to make the political positions of this House on the matter quite clear.
We now come to a proposal, in accordance with Rule 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to adjourn the vote, and we shall now proceed to vote on it.
(Parliament adopted the proposal) President.
The matter is accordingly referred back for reconsideration to the committee responsible.
Before the final vote on the second proposal:
Mr President, I repeat what I said just now, that is, I call upon you not to vote on the legislative resolution but to vote on the following motion, which is not a legislative resolution.
We now come to a proposal, in accordance with Rule 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to adjourn the vote, and we shall now proceed to vote on it.
(Parliament adopted the proposal) President.
The matter is accordingly referred back for reconsideration to the committee responsible.
(Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution)
Report (A5-0297/2001) by Mr Linkohr on behalf of the Committee for Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the guidelines for the research programme of the Coal and Steel Research Fund on the amended Council motion for a resolution [COM(2001) 121 - C5-0167/2001 - 2000/0364(CNS)] on the adoption of the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Coal and Steel Research Fund.
Before the vote:
Mr President, in view of the Commission's response to the debate last night and, in particular, to my colleague Mr Mombaur's point on the expiry of the Coal and Steel Treaty, the protocol attached to the Treaty of Nice and the legal uncertainty now surrounding that, I would ask the rapporteur to comment on this point.
Would he be in favour of referring it to our own legal services as the Commission is apparently about to do?
Mr Linkohr, as rapporteur, has the floor.
Mr President, as rapporteur I cannot but agree with that. Not being myself a lawyer either, I would be interested to know what the Commission's position would be in the event of Nice not being ratified before the Treaty expires, for then, or so my reasonable human understanding tells me, a legal vacuum results, and that is something we should have looked into.
In that respect I would like to support Mrs Ahern in what she has said.
Having already, however, been called to speak, I wanted to point out to you that Amendments Nos 1 to 5 are founded on a misunderstanding.
We did not vote on them at all in committee.
They may well be substantially included in the Turchi report - there is no need for anybody to worry about that - but I recommend that we should not vote on them today, and, insofar as I am entitled to demand such a thing, I demand that.
I would gladly submit that to this House's decision.
I shall call for a vote on Mr Linkohr's motion, but not on Amendments Nos 1 to 5.
(Parliament adopted the motion.) Before the final vote:
In this instance, I ask for a vote on the legislative resolution, in particular because of items 8 and 9, on which we have just voted.
In my judgment, it is sufficient if we proceed to examine the Turchi report, but because of items 8 and 9, I would really attach importance to us now actually voting on the resolution.
I ask you to vote in favour of it.
(Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution.)
Explanation of vote - Turchi Report (A5-0303/2001) and Linkohr Report (A5-0297/2001):
.
(FR) The two reports on the expiry of the ECSC Treaty state - and deplore the fact - that the Council is asking Parliament to give it discharge regarding activities which it has no means of controlling.
In other words, Parliament may vote for what it wants but it will be the Council who decides.
That is certainly one way of recognising that Parliament serves only to give the stamp of democracy to decisions which are not democratic.
These two reports also state that the so-called social aspect of the ECSC is to be abandoned, precisely when we are envisaging the accession of countries on which the European Union intends to impose the restructuring of their coal and steel sectors so as to make them profitable, profitable, that is, to possible Western investors.
In spite of this 'social aspect' of the ECSC, the restructuring of coal and steel in Western Europe has resulted in the dismissal of hundreds of thousands of workers, a disaster for many people.
Some regions, such as Lorraine, have taken years to recover from the companies that were closed down and the jobs that were lost.
We can imagine what it will be like for the workers of Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary, who will not even have the chance of compensation or early retirement.
Rather than using the balance from the liquidation of the ECSC as a research fund, which will in one form or another profit the bosses, the sums released in this way should be used in their entirety to continue to pay the wages of the workers who will be thrown out onto the street as a result of future restructuring programmes.
We have therefore voted against these two reports.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.24 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Arms exports
The next item is the report (A5-0309/2001) by Mr Titley, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Council's Second Annual Report according to Operative Provision 8 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports [13177/1/2000 - C5-0111/2001 - 2001/2050(COS)].
Mr President, 11 September showed us that the world we live in is very insecure.
We discovered that the world's security, stability and economy are much more fragile than we previously believed.
Wherever we look - whether at the fight against terrorism, the horrors of the Balkans, the nightmare of a small town in Switzerland, the virtual anarchy in parts of Africa - one common theme emerges everywhere: the huge number of weapons which are freely available.
That is one of the main causes of instability in the world, and we must act before the tidal wave of weaponry overwhelms us all.
The Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was a significant development in controlling this trade.
It is clear from the second annual report that there is rapidly growing cooperation between Member States, both in terms of implementing the code and of achieving greater mutual understanding of the interpretation of the code.
It is also clear that arms export policy in relation to security is becoming more closely aligned.
There is much greater transparency in arms controls policies.
Most EU States, except for Austria, Greece and Luxembourg, now produce their own annual reports, albeit with a huge variance in the quality of information provided.
It is worth noting that the NGOs' Safer World holds up the UK's annual report, first introduced by the then Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, as an example for other countries.
The code's influence goes beyond the EU: all the accession countries, the EEA, EFTA States, Canada and Turkey now subscribe to the code's principles.
Member States are also seeking to apply those principles in wider international fora.
It would be a mistake to underestimate the importance of what has been achieved or the considerable mindshift that is taking place among Member States in this field.
Nonetheless, there are areas where the code needs to be strengthened.
The principles of the code will be constantly undermined if action is not taken to control and license arms brokers.
It is beyond belief that in many countries you need a licence to own a shotgun but not to trade in weapons of any type.
Some arms brokers are legitimate businesses; many, however, are little more than merchants of death.
Action in this field must be an absolute priority.
Similarly, controlling the activities of EU armaments companies will inevitably be compromised by the uncontrolled licensing of production outside the EU.
We further need a more harmonised system of end-use data provision, certification and enforcement.
Controls of official exports are important, but the illegal trade in arms is our biggest problem.
I welcome the work of Member States towards a UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons, reminding Parliament that the definition includes things like shoulder-carried, anti-aircraft missiles.
I very much regret the attitude of the USA to that conference and the influence of its gun lobby.
We can only hope that recent events will cause the USA to reflect on the need for global partnerships to remove the causes of insecurity.
We must have a global crackdown on this illegal trade.
Greater transparency is the guardian of our security in this field.
Despite the rapid advances made, I would like to see all countries producing publicly available annual export reports in a commonly agreed format.
The Council's annual report ought to be more detailed, as I have set out in my report.
We would naturally encourage greater scrutiny of arms policies by Member State parliaments.
I was delighted that last year Member States agreed a Common List of Military Equipment to which the code applies.
We now need a common list of non-military security and police equipment, and I am happy to accept the amendments on that subject.
The list, however, has to be meaningful and provide the basis of effective action in this field and not be a statement of general intent.
We will not win the war on terrorism - which we are all talking about at the moment - unless we control arms, the tools of this deadly trade.
That is the challenge confronting us now and it is even more important today than it was this time last year when we debated the first annual report.
Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Titley on his very sound and constructive report.
His efforts, as well as useful contributions by other fellow MEPs, have enabled this Parliament to reach more or less consensus on an otherwise very sensitive issue: the control of the arms trade.
In light of the attacks in America, there is growing awareness of the fact that the vast distribution of arms worldwide leads to unstable countries which form the breeding ground for terrorism.
The Titley report rightly points out that the 1998 EU Code is a major step forward towards a more coherent and transparent European policy on arms exports.
At the same time, however, a number of shortcomings and flaws have been flagged, five of which I should like mention.
First of all, the annual reports of the Member States are not harmonised.
Some countries, including Great Britain and Ireland, give a detailed account of the permits issued and of the amount and value of exported arms.
Other countries, such as Austria and Greece, give no information whatsoever about the licences issued.
In that way, an efficient, effective assessment is, of course, difficult.
The annual report would, therefore, need to meet a number of standards.
Each permit issued should be accompanied by a detailed description of the material, the addressee and end user.
For permits refused, the reason for refusal should be explained in more detail.
Secondly, in my opinion, the monitoring procedures concerning the end user of the exported arms should be stepped up.
In Africa, Togo and Burkina Faso are officially the end users of arms supplied from Bulgaria, whilst in reality, these are passed on to Liberia and the rebels of Sierra Leone.
Embassies of EU Member States could play a more supervisory role in situ.
Penal measures should also be introduced for transit countries that violate arms embargos.
Thirdly, I am of the opinion that tighter controls should be in place for the production of military equipment under licence abroad by EU companies or in the framework of industrial joint venture agreements.
It is not acceptable for a certain country to be refused a licence for weapons and for arms manufacturers to be able to circumvent that ban by supplying arms components which are then assembled on site.
A fourth shortcoming is that there is no control whatsoever on private arms dealers, the number of which is rising all the time since the end of the cold war.
Of the five hundred million light arms in circulation worldwide, forty to sixty percent of these are illegal, according to the UN.
A final serious shortcoming of the EU Code of Conduct is that it is not legally binding.
At the moment, it is a no-strings-attached gentlemen' s agreement.
Sanctions cannot be imposed on those who breach the Code.
Finally, I should like to express the hope that the EU Code of Conduct will form the basis for a worldwide code on the export of arms.
It makes no sense whatsoever for Europe to be committed to controlling the arms trade, while China and Russia continue to export weapons to crisis areas without any restrictions.
In that sense, the UN Conference in July was a missed opportunity, and I believe that this topic must remain a permanent feature in the transatlantic dialogue.
Mr President, Mr Titley has lived up to his reputation and has produced an excellent report on the Code of Conduct concerning arms exports, on which we would like to congratulate him.
Needless to say, the report receives the full backing of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
That is why I should not so much like to confine myself to the technicalities of the report, but rather to a number of general observations.
On 11 September, the first reports rolled in about the horrific attacks in the United States during the vote of the Titley report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
The European Union has reacted adequately and coherently.
All available means are being deployed right across the pillars.
One would wish for the same promptness of action in other areas too.
The EU can do anything if it puts its mind to it.
Where the arms export is concerned, we have to make do with a Code of Conduct which is considerably restricted by Article 296 of the EC Treaty which protects national security interests.
That is such a vague concept that Member States, if they so wish, can more or less do their own thing.
In fact, it has never been clear to me in what way national security interests can be different from those of the European Union.
The arms export agreements are also typified by a large degree of voluntariness, but also, for example, by inconsistent agreements on the end use of exported arms.
That is why an EU-wide and effective approach is lacking.
Not all relevant information is made available, which obstructs the transparency of the policy.
Annual reports are useful, but joint action is preferable, of course.
Mr Titley' s report mentions a few areas which require attention, such as the destabilising distribution of hand-held weapons. That causes great chaos in some parts of the world.
The trade in these weapons also sustains phenomena such as child soldiers.
My group would like to turn this into a priority, also in cooperation with the candidate countries, the countries of the Stability Pact and countries such as Ukraine and Russia, for we know that many of the hand-held weapons which are in circulation in the world originate from those countries.
The EU must make every effort, together with those countries, to tackle the often criminal trade in weapons.
Here too we require a new international coalition.
In the light of 11 September, it is important to tighten the agreements on the export of so-called dual-use goods.
I am curious about the discussions which are undoubtedly already taking place behind the scenes.
The citizens would like to know how the export policy will be adopted to prevent the wrong expertise from falling into the wrong hands.
I would quote the reports on terrorism and the use of weapons of mass destruction in this connection.
Here too, better cooperation with Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States is necessary.
What will happen to the export of encryption software?
Will new arrangements be made in this connection?
The least we can ask from the Council and the Commission is to indicate the role which can improve the organised arms export policy in the fight against terrorism.
As far as I am concerned, the debate on Article 296 can be re-opened.
Arms export must form an integral part of the new EU security policy.
Only then will it be truly effective.
Mr President, I welcome much of what is in the report, particularly the need for transparency, the issue dealing with the end use of weapons and the illegal trade in arms.
As Mr Titley mentioned, the control of small arms is important.
It is a major problem, as we have seen from the tragic events in Switzerland.
There needs to be a mechanism to control non-military security and police equipment.
But I do not support the idea of a European defence industry and we need to look at getting rid of the defence industry. The recent tragic events in the United States have actually given a shot in the arm to the arms industries.
I will mention one in particular because it is relevant to Ireland, and that is Raytheon.
This company has seen a 40% jump in share prices as a result of the events of 11 September and thereafter.
We must look at the whole issue of arms production in the first place.
I mentioned Raytheon because it is ironic that, in spite of the peace process in Northern Ireland, Nobel peace prize winners stood on a platform welcoming into Derry Raytheon, one of the world's biggest arms manufacturing companies.
It is appalling to encourage manufacturers of weapons, or their components, into a place where people are killing each other every day with weapons so that these products can then be transported to other parts of the world to cause havoc and deprivation.
We do not want peace here and wars in other parts of the world.
We should look at ending the trade in weapons completely and the idea of government support for an industry that is responsible for death and destruction around the world is unacceptable.
As regards torture weapons, we have a situation where these weapons are being sent to certain parts of the world with an EU stamp on them.
This is completely unacceptable.
In my own country, Ireland, there has in recent times been an increase in the arms industry, mainly involving US-based arms manufacturing.
This manufacturing comprises mainly components, but irrespective of whether components or end-use weapons are concerned, we should not accept the production of weapons.
There are far more beneficial ways of creating employment for people in a given area than the production of something that is used to kill another human being.
Mr President, in principle our group agrees with the report by Mr Titley, who has done an excellent job in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
There are some aspects of the report that we do not agree with, such as that referring to the defence industry, but, generally speaking, this effort to achieve transparency and for the EU to play a crucial, I would say leading, role in the process of world disarmament and also in achieving peace is positive, and, for this reason, we think that it is a good report.
However, there are various aspects that could be improved, especially following the sad events of 11 September, since when North America has been promoting the indiscriminate sale of arms to all those it considers to be potential allies in the fight against terrorism.
We think that this is an appropriate moment to adopt clearly transparent behaviour that would avoid these double standards, and for this reason we, through our colleague Mr Brie, have tabled several amendments which seek specifically to prevent such problems - such as cases, for example, in which arms are indirectly sold to countries that contravene EU agreements through third countries, as is the case, for example, with Turkey, or Israel, bombing or attacking the Palestinians, or Pakistan.
For this reason it would be a good idea to have more control over these sales.
We also think that it is important - as stated by Mr Titley in his speech - to include terrorism as an objective.
Lastly, we also think it imperative, in order to improve transparency, for the Commission itself to draw up a report that clarifies this series of measures so that the role of the EU can be much greater and more decisive in achieving a world at peace and without arms.
Mr President, those who declare that they are dedicated to fighting terrorism need to cleanse themselves of all hypocrisy and must condemn those who carry out the worst acts of bloodletting under the guise of freedom fighters.
In Dublin this weekend, Gerry Adams boasted that the IRA campaign of atrocities were the acts of freedom fighters and not the acts of terrorists.
No wonder The Wall Street Journal the other day carried an article with Adams and bin Laden linked together.
Actions, not words alone, can cleanse the hands of those nations in Europe which have both armed and furthered the aims of terrorists and have then refused to extradite those criminals for proper trial.
Mr President, until a few weeks ago, the distinction between conventional weaponry such as light and heavy arms, on the one hand and weapons of mass destruction on the other, in other words, nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, seemed relatively clear.
Now the very concepts of what constitutes a weapon are in doubt, when a civilian aeroplane can become a missile when guided by a murderous ideal.
We may be tempted to adopt an attitude which is at once relativist, with regard to the means, and ultra-safe, with regard to actions.
I would say, however, that there is now a greater need than ever to prevent tendencies that are not firmly anchored in politics.
Particularly at a time when, as is becoming obvious, we need to speed up the construction of our common foreign and security policy, which must be given the appropriate resources and be supported by an effective shared commitment.
This policy must go ahead on the basis of cohesion, which also means trust between Member States, and of coherence between the ideas that are put forward and practical action.
We are today discussing an issue, arms exports, to which these principles must be applied, today more than ever before.
It would, of course, be better if there were no need to discuss weapons, but, unfortunately, the world we live in is not like that.
The European Union' s Code of Conduct on arms exports adopted in 1999 is a key instrument for harmonisation and control in this field.
With regard to the Council' s second annual report, on implementing this Code of Conduct, the rapporteur himself welcomes the greater transparency and the convergence between Member States arms exports policies and the adoption of common principles by third countries. He also, however, highlights the need to go further, putting an end to illegal sales and exercising greater control over arms dealers' fees and on the destination of arms.
I therefore support the thrust of this report, although once again, I wish to emphasise the need for coherence and cohesion in this field.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is naturally useful to have a report on arms trade.
That is also true of a European Code of Conduct.
But I hope that the tragic circumstances in which we find ourselves will also galvanise us into action, for example in order to render this Code of Conduct compulsory, as Mr Titley rightly pointed out in his report, and finally to also make progress in supervising the arms trade.
For although that is what we intend to do, if we have no control over the end-user certificate, it is impossible to check whether that arms trade is legal or not.
Similarly, the production under licence by EU countries in third countries is another one of such issues.
Ultimately, we will need to reach the stage where we have black lists of countries to which we do not under any circumstance supply weapons. This will need to be monitored and sanctions will need to be put in place.
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Titley on his work and acknowledge his endeavours to include the point of view of civil society on arms exports.
I would, however, mention certain negative points: firstly, light weapons.
The UN Conference in July was a failure: in my opinion, the EU should commit itself resolutely once more to enforcing a reduction.
As regards transparency, I feel that this is still too superficial and that Parliamentary scrutiny should be obligatory for arms exports.
Then there is no reference to the OCCAT Agreement which actually protects industrial cooperation and is the basis for laws such as Italy' s which make it possible to export arms without infringing human rights rules.
Then there is an arms exports control policy which must be in line with European common foreign policy.
In short, I consider the Titley report to be important, but I feel - this is my point of view and is not a criticism of the Titley report - that the European Union should, in these tragic times, set itself the target of disarmament, not rearmament.
You will excuse me, Commissioner, for addressing you alone, but the Council benches are empty.
I would like to say that I find the Council report very interesting. This Code of Conduct is also of major importance and this debate is very dignified, although we should ask ourselves how much we are actually achieving.
We must have the courage to go deeper into certain complex issues which are still to be resolved.
The first of these issues, which has already been mentioned by all those who have spoken, is the need to make this code law, that is to convert it into a legally binding instrument, seeing as, nowadays, everything depends on the good will of the Member States of the European Union, which are even free to decide whether or not to submit an annual report, which not all the Member States have chosen to do.
Another complex issue which has yet to be resolved is that of a Community system of controlling the end use, the final recipient of the arms exported and the brokers who, in the arms trade, in arms trafficking - the word trafficking may be more appropriate, more to the point - are the real money-makers.
It is a matter of serious concern that all this is not happening, that we do not have such a control facility, bearing in mind, for example, that the Taliban will probably be fighting in Afghanistan with arms supplied by the West, including some of the countries of the European Union.
Lastly, the candidate countries.
What guarantees will we have that the candidate countries will be able to respect this Code of Conduct properly?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as regards these questions, there is only one risk, which is engendered by our hypocrisy in disregarding - as has been pointed out - the great difference between a gentleman' s agreement and a law.
I will therefore close by reiterating that, until the Code of Conduct becomes law, we will be at fault, and this report' s due reference to the values of democracy and the protection of human rights is likely to be reduced to a mere, ineffective appeal.
Mr President, the report is more critical on the subject of the export of weapons than any previous report by Mr Titley.
Despite this, we must observe that its demands do not reach their target either as regards parliamentary scrutiny or as regards transparency.
As far as parliamentary scrutiny is concerned, there is no demand for formal provision for an opinion by the European Parliament, and that is the least we can ask for if we are to have some degree of influence.
I take an even more critical line on what is said about transparency.
Here, Mr Titley speaks of transparency in the form of a framework agreement.
We know, however, that the framework agreement between six EU States to promote the defence of industry and of a global defence market is precisely the most opaque procedure ever, that it clasps tightly what it used to give: no parliamentary scrutiny and no debate, even on the conclusion and ratification of this agreement.
That must be changed.
Mr President, one thing for sure is that the excessive profits reaped by multinationals, especially American multinationals, from manufacturing and selling arms far exceed the profits to be made from drug trafficking or crude oil.
Tensions, armed conflict and mutual genocide are being provoked and fomented in order to promote the production and consumption of all sorts of arms and munitions, thereby increasing sales and boosting profits.
And governments have no objection; in fact they are doing their utmost here, given that, as we all know, they cream off huge sums of money from manufacturers supplying arms.
Whatever Mr Titley's intentions as rapporteur, in today's general climate of militarisation and warmongering, with a new structure to NATO, with the militarisation of the European Union and, more importantly, with the shameless exploitation of the terrorist attack in the United States, codes like this, even if they do not pull the wool over the people's eyes, are no more than a hypocritical wish list.
We believe that strict controls are needed and that the manufacture of all types of equipment - and not just exports as the report suggests - should be denied, if not banned.
In the final analysis, however, this is a matter for the popular front, for the global and national peace movement which, as we have seen recently, is burgeoning - and thank God it is.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Titley for another excellent and characteristically intelligent report, which we have read with very great interest.
As his report and his speech have made clear, the issue of arms exports is tremendously complex and close collaboration is required by everyone in order to address its many different angles.
There were a number of good speeches in the debate, some of which referred to the relevance of the appalling events of 11 September and their aftermath.
I should like to respond to what Mr Paisley had to say.
As he is not in his place, maybe my remarks will be borne to him on angels' wings.
I agree with the definitional point he made.
It is an enormously important point for us to make.
Some of us from Spain or the United Kingdom have personal experience of this; some of us have friends who have been murdered by terrorists.
There is no such thing as a good terrorist.
There is no distinction between good and bad terrorism.
What is a terrorist?
A terrorist is a man or woman or, alas, a deluded child who sets out in the morning to murder innocent men, women and children to make a political point - the propaganda of the deed.
That is not justified.
It is never justified.
There are never extenuating circumstances, any more than there are ever extenuating circumstances from extrajudicial killings by a State.
So I hope that when we start talking about definitions we will remember what terrorism really is.
We will have views about the political roots of terrorism.
We will have strong views about the importance of trying to find political solutions to some problems.
However, I hope we will not be morally confused about what constitutes a terrorist act.
During the debate on last year's report, I stated that the ultimate responsibility for arms exports belongs to national governments.
However, it is also clear that some aspects of the arms trade lie within the remit of the common foreign and security policy, with which the Commission is fully associated.
The Commission is making every effort to move forward with the implementation of those recommendations which lie within Community competence and we stand ready to collaborate with Member States where joint responsibilities are involved, for example when one is talking about dual-use goods.
As Parliament is already aware, the associated countries of central and eastern Europe, Cyprus, Turkey, Malta, and our EEA/EFTA partners have issued declarations through which they align themselves with the criteria and the principles contained in the European Union's Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.
The Union has continued to assist the candidates in their efforts to bring their legislation and administration fully into line with the provisions of the code.
Furthermore, the European Union continues to urge the world's main arms exporters to subscribe to the principles and criteria developed in our code.
We would react most favourably to the idea of drafting an international code of conduct on arms transactions, on the condition that it is based on the same principles as the European Union code.
The Commission strongly supports the honourable Member's call for the establishment of common rules for European Union control of the legal trade in small arms and light weapons, as well as effective European Union controls to combat and eradicate trafficking in these arms. In this respect we welcome the agreement reached at the July 2001 UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons.
Although the final text falls well short of the Union's initial expectations, it marks an important step forward.
It represents a delicate and hard-fought compromise, which would not have been achievable only a couple of years ago.
If all parties involved were to adopt a more positive attitude, the agreement would become a more effective tool for addressing the concerns of all participants in the future.
For the first time the international community has set out some principles for national and international measures which might curb the illegal trade in small arms.
They aim to establish reliable controls on the production, export and transit of weapons; to apply reliable markings to them in order to trace their origin more successfully; to criminalise their unlicensed production and trade; to regulate the activities of brokers; and to destroy surplus stockpiles and all confiscated weapons.
A new conference will be held no later than 2006 - I suspect that recent events may bring that date forward - and in the intervening period, biennial meetings will consider the progress made on turning the objectives of the conclusions into tangible reality.
We will work hard with the Member States to ensure an active and ambitious follow-up.
The European Union's commitment to concrete action in the field of small arms is illustrated by a number of projects currently under way or under consideration in different parts of the world.
In Cambodia the European Union gives technical, administrative and financial support to the government and selected NGOs for actions aimed at promoting the collection, control and destruction of weapons.
We also support Operation Rachel, a joint South Africa-Mozambique project, to collect and destroy arms left over since the civil war.
We provide equipment to the Georgian and Ossetian police forces as part of a programme which consists of the voluntary handover and subsequent destruction of small arms in the region.
We also support the UN Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Lima, which works to promote the control of small arms in Latin America and the Caribbean.
We are also considering further projects in the Balkans, Africa and South Pacific.
During the past few months Commission services have begun drafting EC legislation on a number of non-military items such as instruments of torture, to which the provisions of the code should, in our view, apply.
Work is now near completion, and the Commission intends to submit a proposal to the Council soon.
This marks a first step in tackling the issue.
Compilation of a more extended list, which might include items that also have civilian uses - instruments of internal repression such as riot-control equipment, for example - would require the commitment of significant additional resources.
If we are going to take on such a task - which involves establishing the eventual end use of the items and, perhaps, the identity of the end user - then we shall need more resources.
However we will, of course, pay careful attention to what Parliament has to say on that issue.
Progress in that field is conditional on the willingness of Member States and Parliament to make additional resources available for these purposes.
So I repeat our gratitude to the honourable Member, Mr Titley, for an important report.
I hope that year by year we can continue to respond constructively to what he has to say.
Anybody who looks at the violence around the world, the violence often associated with the breakdown of States, from Somalia to Sudan, to Sierra Leone, to Afghanistan; anybody who looks at the situation created by the breakdown of States knows how much the trade and small arms is responsible for continuing the violence and making the violence far more lethal.
So this report is an important one, and I hope we can respond to it over the coming months and years with appropriately constructive behaviour.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Political and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan
The next item is the Commission statement on the political and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan.
I shall ask Commissioner Patten to take the floor immediately.
I should like to begin the Commission's contribution myself and then at the end of the discussion ask Commissioner Nielson to say something about the humanitarian situation in which he has been actively involved because of his responsibility for ECHO.
If I have to leave before the end of the discussion it is not for lack of appreciation of the importance of what we are discussing - I believe this issue is going to dominate the international agenda for the next few months - but because I have to attend an important meeting before the EU-Russia Summit with the Deputy-Premier of the Russian Federation to discuss the modalities for beginning discussions on a common European economic area.
We will try to agree the terms of reference of our work this evening before our summit with President Putin tomorrow.
There will be other reports on the Troika visit that I took part in last week with the Foreign Minister of Belgium, which holds the presidency, and with the Foreign Minister of Spain - the next presidency - which demonstrated our commitment to the issues we were discussing.
With my friend and colleague Mr Solana we went to Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria, all in the space of four-and-a-half action-packed, sleep-free days and nights.
I should just like to say two or three words about that visit and make two or three points about the political situation in Afghanistan, leaving the humanitarian issues, which are of such compelling importance, to Commissioner Nielson.
Then I would like to say a word about a draft regulation which the Commission has today adopted.
The main purposes of the Troika visit were three-fold.
First of all, we wanted to make the point clearly to the Islamic countries we were visiting that the campaign against terrorism is not a campaign of the West against Islam.
It is not a campaign of Europe and North America against the poorer countries of the globe.
It is a campaign of decent governments everywhere against those who would try to make their political point through murder and mayhem.
It is a fight, in my judgment, between those who stand up in favour of civilisation, of a number of different religious bases and those who represent the forces which have always been opposed to civilised values.
We made that point strongly in every country we went to.
For me, it is very important to recognise that if we are to make the point around the world that human rights are universally valid, including the right not to be murdered by terrorists - if we are to make that point successfully around the world - it is very important for us not to give the impression that we have a monopoly of virtue, that we in Europe are perfect when it comes to talking about these matters.
It is also exceptionally important for us not to concede that human rights bear a different weight according to the continent you are in.
It feels exactly the same to be tortured, whatever sort of country you are in.
It is exactly the same if you are locked up as a journalist or an editor because you disagree with the government, whatever country you are in.
Those sort of rights are universally valid.
It seems to me that we dilute the integrity of our argument if we give the impression that somehow different civilisations have fundamentally different approaches to human rights.
The second point we were seeking to make is that out of the appalling events, out of the atrocities of 11 September, we must hope that it is possible for some good to come.
Adversity sometimes produces an opportunity to be constructive, positive and to build better for the future.
One thing we said in Pakistan, Iran and elsewhere is that we have a chance now - taking account of the awful things that have happened - of opening some doors and windows which have been closed for too long.
Thirdly, we say that it is a clichÃ©, a truism when people talk about 11 September to say - rather like the fall of the Berlin Wall - nothing will ever be the same again.
But it is actually true.
Nothing will ever be quite the same again.
One way in which we have to make sure that nothing is ever the same again is to try to ensure this time that multilateralism, that international cooperation, works a great deal more effectively in the wake of those awful events than it perhaps has since the 1940s.
That is the challenge to us: to make sure that when we discuss conventions against terrorism in the UN, everybody signs them and everybody implements them.
Those are the sort of practical challenges that we are going to face for weeks and months and years in the future when these events are no longer on the front pages of the newspapers.
Those were three points that we - the only four-person Troika in the business - were making insistently at each of our stops.
Concerning the political situation in Afghanistan, which we were able to discuss both in Pakistan and in Iran, there were of course different views of the situation.
In Iran, for example, there are very strong views about the Taliban.
That is not surprising given the number of Iranian diplomats that were killed three or so years ago by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
There is a general agreement that the political situation in Afghanistan remains extremely fluid.
There are reports from neighbouring countries that the Taliban are in terminal decline.
There are also reports that speak of some Taliban military successes and of a return to what passes for a sort of grim normality in Kabul.
The Taliban continue to show no real sign of being ready to give up Osama bin Laden or forcefully to encourage his voluntary departure from the country.
The opposition Northern Alliance has declared itself ready and willing to assist the United States and international coalition efforts.
Following the death of Commander Masood on 8 September - and I know he made an important visit to Parliament not long ago - there is greater uncertainty as to the cohesion of this alliance.
What is certain is that no wholly military solution is possible in Afghanistan.
In both Pakistan and Iran, where as I said there are very different views of the situation in Afghanistan, there was agreement that only a broad-based government made up of representatives of all factions and ethnic groups in the country, taking account of the security concerns of neighbouring countries, can begin the process of restoring Afghanistan to normality and pave the way for reconstruction.
The means of doing this may be through the Loya Jirga or Grand Assembly mechanism.
It would be for the Afghan people to decide what kind of Loya Jirga process they want and what role different political personages might play in such a development.
I repeat that there is a shared perception of what the outcome should be: a broad-based government.
How you get to that broad-based government is incomparably more difficult to work out, but there is also a shared perception that the world outside - even in the shape of the United Nations - cannot impose a political settlement on Afghanistan.
We can and should aim to facilitate a political settlement, and having facilitated it not then walk away.
We have to make sure that a better government, which will emerge from that sad, embittered country will be able to count on the long-term support of the international community to rebuild from the ruin of the medieval ferocity which has been unleashed on Afghanistan for the last few years.
I should like to make one other point.
We have in the Commission today adopted a draft regulation on specific measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating international terrorism.
The draft proposal includes all those individuals and organisations potentially related to the 11 September attack covered by the US Executive Order issued by President Bush last week.
But it takes the form of a framework regulation which could serve as the vehicle for a wider campaign against terrorist financing.
There is a considerable urgency to this regulation, which is put forward on the basis of Article 308, for reasons which I am sure I do not have to set out for Parliament.
In these circumstances we would be extremely grateful if Parliament could consider an emergency procedure, if possible completing the consultation process during this week's part-session.
We would then be able to put the draft regulation to the General Affairs Council next Monday.
I know that the President of the Commission will be writing to you on these lines, Madam President.
We understand the difficulties.
We do not want in any way to curtail examination of this important measure; but if it could be done very rapidly it would send the right signals.
It would be an opportunity to demonstrate that in exceptional circumstances the Community institutions can act with real despatch.
Not only would we thereby signal the strength of our determination to rise to the challenges presented by the 11 September attack, but we would show that the EU institutions are able to respond to crisis situations.
I will finish my remarks with that point.
So far, in the proposals brought forward by my friend and colleague, Mr Vitorino, a couple of weeks ago, we have demonstrated that though we are sometimes the butt of people's humour about the lack of speed of our reactions, when it really matters we are able to react very rapidly and comprehensively and we are able to demonstrate in practice what multilateralism should mean.
If there is any institution in the world, if there is any group of countries in the world that can demonstrate the benefits of multilateralism, of arguing about fish quotas or budgets, rather than murdering one another, it is the European Union.
That seems to me to give us a particular responsibility to show leadership in the coming weeks and months and I hope we will be able to do so with this regulation this week.
Madam President, as Mr Patten stated, with four aircraft carriers heading towards the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, the very least that can be said of the situation in Afghanistan is that it is uncertain.
Even the President of Pakistan - a country where over the last few days there have been huge demonstrations of support for the Taliban regime - has unambiguously stated that the days of the regime are numbered.
The offer to open up the government of three Afghan provinces and the exodus of people fleeing the country to avoid being mobilised against potential intervention by the international alliance clearly suggest that this is true.
If, to this fact we add the decision made yesterday in Rome to create a Supreme Council of National Unity instructed to form a provisional government and name a Head of State, we can truly arrive at the conclusion that the situation in Afghanistan is changing from one day to the next.
So, Madam President, in this context, what attitude should the European Union adopt?
Well, in my opinion, the European Union, faced with the crisis situation in this region, should present itself as an element of stability and moderation.
The EU should contribute to the establishment of a democratic government in Afghanistan.
The EU should encourage the full application in that country of respect for human rights and fundamental liberties, which the Taliban regime refuses to acknowledge, as proposed by the mission led by Commissioner Patten and the Troika.
At the same time, the European Union has to sign up to the international alliance referred to yesterday by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at their General Assembly.
Lastly, Madam President, the European Union should give its support to an enormous humanitarian task.
We should not forget that 25% of the 22 million Afghans will survive thanks exclusively to international aid.
However, Madam President, it is important that the European Union does not commit a series of errors.
Firstly, that of supporting governments that do not have sufficient popular support, as happened in the first Afghan crisis a decade ago.
Secondly, the European Union should not commit the error of carrying out indiscriminate actions and of not pursuing tangible objectives.
For we should not forget, Madam President, that our objective should not be to dominate a country that certainly holds a strategic position, but not to encourage the action of extremist elements that could cause the overthrow of regimes such as those in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan or Egypt that would make Bin Laden a martyr or a political military leader or, something that would be far more serious, a religious or spiritual leader.
I think that in conclusion, Madam President, we need to give our total support to Mr Patten' s proposal and behave with maximum diligence and efficiency to support the Commission' s proposals today.
Madam President, Afghanistan is a country with an average income per inhabitant of USD 800.
This statistic makes it the poorest country in Asia and the world' s fifth poorest country.
There are some five million people who rely on food programmes.
Millions of people live on the Iranian side of the border, millions of others live on the Pakistani side.
The borders are now closed, but it is expected that another million people will end up fleeing.
The hands of the WFP and UNHCR are tied, for they cannot work in that country.
There are a few other international NGOs which boast sound structures and can offer aid.
Over the past few years, the Commission has granted a great deal of aid via the ECHO programme.
I should like to hear Commissioner Nielson give us an extensive account on this in a moment.
We know that we are extremely limited in what we can do.
We, as Europe, must do more.
We cannot cross the borders.
We can use the structure in the country to some extent.
UNHCR and WFP are in the same boat.
I would actually like to echo Mr Lubbers, the High Commissioner of UNHCR who stated that 'in fact, we also need a new coalition which can cope, as it were, with the huge humanitarian tragedy which is unfolding before our eyes' .
I am consciously disassociating myself from tomorrow' s debate on security issues that is much broader still.
I should now like to home in on this particular region, however.
We will need to take action in Iran.
We, together with UNHCR, will also need to take action in Pakistan.
We will need to do this as Europe.
To date, each of our Member States has failed to earmark sufficient funding.
They are dallying and dithering.
The European Union has taken sound initiatives in that respect, for which I should like to praise Commissioner Nielson and the Commission, but now is the time to build this coalition.
For if we are not able to tackle this humanitarian issue jointly, we will be presented with the political bill in due course.
You are dividing the world into two.
You are on your own side but not on ours.
It is not 'them' or 'they' , but it is our joint responsibility to act in that region.
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I hope that the Commission, in close cooperation with all those involved, the international NGOs, UNHCR, WFP, in Iran, in Pakistan, with the political initiatives which Commissioner Patten indicated a moment ago, manages to send out that signal on time: a new coalition for humanitarian aid in the region.
Madam President, Commissioner Patten correctly said that we have no quarrel with Islam.
I say that we have a quarrel with those who abuse Islam and who turn the principles of Islam into weapons against the innocent.
In the same way, we have no quarrel with the Afghan people.
Our quarrel is with bin Laden who shelters in Afghanistan and with the Taliban, they seem to be almost one and the same, and we pity the situation of the Afghan people.
They are already one of the poorest nations upon Earth.
Two million Afghan refugees are sheltering in the Islamic Republic of Iran and they have been for some years now.
It is sad to see how little international help has been given to those refugees or to their hosts, the Iranian government.
These refugees fled acute starvation and utter brutality in Afghanistan to find a haven in Iran and there are huge numbers of new refugees now on the move.
The psychological terror that our new alliance has properly caused against terrorism in the region is causing the new flight of so many new millions of refugees.
We must ask ourselves, how we can save lives?
We have always supported NGOs.
We have perhaps given less interinstitutional support.
I plead here to the Commission to look closely at how best to involve our work with that of the United Nations, particularly UNHCR and the World Health Organization, for only the UN, can command the volumes of support that are needed in such a situation, in terms of food, clothing, shelter and the provision of basic needs.
I ask the Commission to assist the refugees who have already fled and are in situ elsewhere.
May I also include the 3.5 million Iraqi refugees in the region.
We must do all we can to help.
Madam President, with regard to the humanitarian dimension of this disaster, I fully concur with Mr Van den Berg.
However, I would like to add one more aspect, which is at the same time a question, a question to the Council, who are not here.
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner a question instead.
A special area of concern when granting aid is the protection of the aid workers.
It is extremely dangerous to grant the necessary aid.
Is the Commission aware of any European countries being prepared to provide those aid workers military back-up?
Next, I should like to turn my attention to the political relationship between the EU and Afghanistan.
What is that relationship not?
Let us be clear about that too.
It does not aim to arm the Northern Alliance.
Neither does it aim to overthrow the Taliban by military force or play the role of Florence Nightingale, caring for the wounded and displaced once the American big brother has smashed everything to smithereens.
So what is - or what should be - the role of the European Union?
Allow me to quote three examples.
Firstly, I believe it would be beneficial if the European Union, as in the past two, three weeks, were to exercise its moderating influence on the United States, so as to prevent any unnecessary civilian victims from being claimed when the Taliban are brought down.
This is an extremely important condition for any broad coalition in future.
Secondly, I strongly urge the United States and Europe not to make the same mistake as we did fifteen years ago, when we supported the mujahedin in the fight against the Russian presence in Afghanistan by filling the country with arms and then walking away.
That is not acceptable.
Mr Joschka Fischer, Germany' s Foreign Affairs Minister, put this across very articulately, in my opinion, when he said that we can no longer afford any black holes on the global map.
Next, I should like to move on to my most important point.
In my opinion, any aid, whether it be military, financial, political or economic, now and in future, to the Afghan opposition, whether it be royal or not, should be typified by at least one aspect, namely that this aid should be conditional.
It is not acceptable for Afghanistan to be lumbered with another regime which fails to observe democracy and human rights.
As far as I am concerned, the lesson we should draw from the cold war is, or should be, that not every enemy of our enemy is our friend.
It is friends, in particular, that need to be alerted in an open and critical manner to respecting democracy and human rights.
And that should therefore apply to any aid to any Afghan opposition.
Finally, if the Taliban are fought or overthrown in the name of fighting a strange regime which has been repressing human rights for the past five years, for example where women' s rights are concerned, then that is a fair motivation for this fight in my view, but we then also need to be consistent, and this must also apply to other countries in the region.
It is unacceptable for a country such as Saudi Arabia to escape our attention, because it now forms part of our coalition, for that country too violates human rights and operates an anti-democratic regime.
In my opinion, the real consequences of 11 September can only be drawn if we display the honesty to tackle that country and that region.
Only then will we have a truly justifiable argument against the objection which is currently being heard in that region that our anxiety with regard to Afghanistan would be one of selective indignation.
Madam President, I am able, as it were, to take up where my esteemed fellow MEP, Mr Lagendijk left off. Who is it we are cooperating with when we wish to strengthen democracy and combat totalitarian regimes, and what is it we are cooperating about?
In the course of the next few days, we shall no doubt become much clearer about what is possible.
We still do not know, of course, how the United States will react.
We still do not know whether the United States will choose to use violent methods and first and foremost seek revenge, or whether we shall in actual fact be given the opportunity to engage in a radical fight against terrorism following the terrible events of 11 September.
With regard, however, to the issue of whom we are to cooperate with, I would urge us to focus upon the very special circumstance that what we have here is a population exposed to violent oppression and that we must be alert to the fact that half of this population is doubly oppressed. I am talking about the female portion of the population.
I should like to emphasise that there are in actual fact women' s organisations which are still attempting, in Afghanistan too, to fight for women' s rights.
One of these organisations, RAWA, is trying to create the opportunity for both boys and girls to go to school, and we know of course that illiteracy is very high in Afghanistan - 96% in the case of women and 72% in the case of men - so that this is in itself a useful thing to fight for.
They are also attempting to put some documentation together and to do some fact-finding in Afghanistan so that those of us outside the situation have a chance of actually knowing what is going on.
When we find out, it is up to us to use that knowledge, and I should like to call upon us to do just that: to use the knowledge that there are courageous women, committed to democracy, and to cooperate with them in our attempt to eradicate the breeding grounds for terrorism in, for example, Afghanistan.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the response to recent events must be broken down into several different parts, and I will not focus on internal security or military solutions, seeing as I clearly do not have the necessary 'intelligence' , nor will I concentrate on humanitarian responses, for I am sure that the European Union and the international community as a whole will be able to respond generously, effectively and competently, as they have always done in the past.
The problem is not one of humanitarian efficiency or effectiveness, which have been proven for a long time now, but rather of deciding what political response to make to the matter at hand.
I am happy to be able to say this here in this Chamber because Parliament and the European Commission have been the only, rare exceptions among the institutions to pay constant attention to the issue of Afghanistan: in recent years, Parliament has been able to present to the Member States and the Council of Ministers a whole range of political and other suggestions.
We can only lament the fact that we were never heeded and our suggestions never taken up or even considered.
We have been trying to draw attention to the indisputable problem of the tragic violation of human rights for years and, since 1997, the Commission and the European Parliament have also been reiterating that there is a problem of terrorism and drugs in Afghanistan, that is, a major geopolitical problem.
All we can do is lament the indifference shown by the major international institutions.
At the present moment, however, I feel that we have to make a choice: there are moments in history when one has to stop hesitating and take sides, and if we are to do so we must not side with religious fanaticism, dictatorships or some other form of nationalism, but with the liberal democracies - with all their failings and imperfections, admittedly - but also with all their power and their capacity to operate systems which are better equipped to protect human rights in the world.
My concern is the political response.
I fear that it would be a mistake to think that our only enemy is terrorism and, in particular, possibly just Osama Bin Laden.
The issue is much more complex than that: our current enemy is that explosive mixture of authoritarian regimes and dictatorships based on religious fanaticism.
We must make an effort and go deeper into the matter rather than simply believing that if we catch Osama Bin Laden - which would be right and proper and is a legitimate, necessary thing to do - then the problem will be resolved.
A 'holy alliance' to combat terrorism is being formed, made up of a collection of unlikely, not to say dubious allies: there are a number of regimes which are likely to join this alliance, each for its own reasons, each maybe drawing up a list of its own genuine or alleged terrorists with the aim of suppressing its own dissidents, who may well be non-terrorist, democratic individuals.
We must be careful not to put everything under the same umbrella indiscriminately.
I wonder whether it would not make more sense and be more useful to create a world organisation of democracy, of liberal democracy as we know it - and, once again, I do not deny any of its shortcomings - for I feel that this is the institution which we should envisage in the medium term.
Today, when we talk about women or violation or female genital mutilation, we have no organisation to turn to for help.
This is the great challenge before us: to create, export and promote democracy and freedom.
Madam President, the people in Afghanistan, as well as the entire civilised world, stand to benefit from a drastic end to the Taliban regime.
At home, the Taliban keep the country under a reign of mental terror and prefer continuing the civil war to relieving acute famines.
Viewed from outside, their prompt departure from the political stage deserves the highest commendation, because the Taliban export terrorism.
The handiwork of their guest Osama bin Laden is a case in point, as is the fact that they export narcotics on a large scale.
However, Afghan history and today' s political reality prove that the Taliban can only be driven out by internal opposition forces.
That is why we deem the present Afghanistan strategy of the American administration to provide financial and material aid to the broadest possible coalition against the Taliban around the king in exile, Zahir Shah, to be the most plausible foreign contribution to this political and military tour de force.
That is why I call on Europe to lend its unconditional support to this strategy.
We are also delighted by the fact that President Bush has earmarked USD 100 million by way of aid for the immense damage incurred to the Afghan refugees.
May this gesture of compassion with the suffering Afghan people be the first step towards a Marshall plan for this country that has been completely razed to the ground by sustained armed violence.
In that way, the international community can discharge itself from its share of the blame for the present situation in Afghanistan and raise a dam against Muslim terrorism and drugs.
Madam President, Commissioner, as I take the floor in this debate, I would be failing in my duty if I did not pay homage, as you have done Madam President, to the memory of Commander Ahmed Shah Masood.
A number of our Members had the opportunity to meet him here just six months ago, at your invitation, and we discovered that not only was he a man of war famous for his tactics and his exceptional charisma, but he could also be a statesman, and a man of peace and reconciliation, the peace and reconciliation for which his country has been waiting for more than thirty years.
My hope today is that this man, my friend, who said that he was prepared to give his life for the sake of the people of Afghanistan, will not have died for nothing.
Obviously I regret the fact that he was not listened to sooner when he asked for international aid to rid his country of the iron rule of the Taliban, and when he condemned the development of that totalitarian movement of Islamic fundamentalism flaunting its desire for world domination.
What Mr Patten has just told us about the political situation in Afghanistan confirms my analysis that Commander Masood' s plan for solving the crisis in Afghanistan could be well underway.
Now that Pakistan has been obliged to stop giving political and military support to the Taliban regime, that regime should collapse under the pressure of the whole of the Afghan people, as Commander Masood predicted.
I think that proof of this has been provided by the agreement that has just been signed in Rome between the opposition forces and the former King Mohammed Zahir Shah, whose prestige is still as great as ever in his home country.
I also see proof of this in the statements made by Mullah Omar himself, when he announced yesterday that he might possibly be overthrown, and finally in the news that has just reached us about the defection, with seven hundred of his militia men, of the Taliban governor of the Javan region on the border with Turkmenistan, which has brought the province of Badghis under opposition control.
Carried away by the idea of realpolitik, the international community, and with it, I am sorry to say, the European Union, had adopted an attitude towards the Taliban that was at the very least conciliatory, working on the principle that they exercised the real power and that they could not do so without the support of the whole of the Afghan people.
At the time I compared this attitude with the attitude that the Western governments thought they ought to adopt towards the Cambodia of the Khmer Rouge before their abominable barbarism became apparent.
Thanks to that same blind tolerance, we have allowed this hornets' nest of Islamic terror to develop on Afghan territory. Its evil deeds were denounced by Commander Masood, and it must now be destroyed, something which I hope will happen very soon.
However, for the sake of destroying a hornets' next it should not be necessary to burn down the whole house. On the contrary, it is essential that the Afghan people should be spared, and given all the assistance, of whatever kind, that they need in order to establish a stable regime based on national reconciliation.
I have the feeling - and Mr Patten has just reinforced it - that this is the direction in which the Union' s efforts are heading, and I welcome this, but I do not forget the disastrous humanitarian situation that prevails in the region as a whole.
I am thinking of the hundreds of thousands of refugees waiting at the border with Pakistan, and also of the people who for months now have been completely without supplies in the northern provinces.
I know that the Russians have set up an airlift for emergency humanitarian aid, operating from the airport at Dushanbe in Tajikistan.
I would not like to see the European Union conspicuous by its absence in this undertaking, in which its assistance is also desirable.
What these people want is, of course, food, but in addition they want medicines, blankets and shelters, and above all they want us to demonstrate our solidarity.
In Bosnia, at the height of the crisis, Europe, acting within the Atlantic Alliance, was able to set up a scheme for parachuting supplies into the most isolated enclaves, those that were at greatest risk.
This is what the people of Panshir are now expecting.
Have we, and have you, Commissioner Nielson, the will and the means to provide it?
Madam President, I am very much in agreement with the majority of what has been said on this matter and I shall, therefore, not repeat what other speakers have said.
I do think, however, that all of it should be taken into account, given that the whole world is waiting to see the European Union' s reaction.
It seems to me that, given the condemnation of the situation in Afghanistan that this Parliament has already issued, and given the danger of the reduction in civil liberties, we have to remain united, as Commissioner Patten has said, and present a united front against terrorism.
I am also worried, however, by something else that has already been said: the tragic situation that has arisen since these attacks.
On the one hand there is the Afghan population, which is facing a serious crisis, as was very clearly stated by the Joint Committee of the FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP) that recently visited Afghanistan, and which has said that, at this moment in time, the country is suffering widespread starvation due to a serious crisis in agricultural production, that could cause the death of a huge number of people.
To this we must add the continuing danger to the farming population posed by the antipersonnel mines scattered throughout the country and the situation of the thousands of refugees in bordering countries - not only in Pakistan and Iran, but also in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan I would like to point out - that have to be dealt with.
However, what also worries me - and it is on this that I would like to focus, Madam President - is the situation of the populations in all the other developing countries, particularly the African countries, who will suffer the worst economic consequences of this crisis.
According to information from the World Bank, the terror attacks condemn ten million more people to poverty, as a result of economic slowdown and, particularly, from the loss of income due to decreased exports, a reduction in tourism, falling prices, etc.
It is true, Madam President, that the European Union and this Parliament now have to form a strong coalition against terrorism.
But we should also consider - and this would send a signal to the whole world - an international coalition against the poverty, misery and despair of millions of citizens across the world who very often seek protection from the very fanatics who organise these acts of terrorism.
I would, therefore, ask that, alongside this coalition against terrorism, we also send a signal, chiefly to the peoples of Africa and Asia, stating our desire to build a coalition against misery, poverty and despair.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the delegation of the European Parliament for relations with Central Asia, I should expressly like to draw your attention to what is happening in countries such as Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
These countries have been, and will be, the first to be affected by the refugee problem as a result of what is now happening in Afghanistan and in that part of the world.
There is, therefore, an unqualified need for European consultation on the provision of emergency aid, something which Mr Morillon was quite right to point out.
Central Asia is a vulnerable and very fragile region.
It is a vulnerable region economically speaking, in terms of respect for human rights and in terms of the fabric of the civil society and democratic institutions.
It is a region which, for years, has required our support in the fight against fundamentalism and the drugs trade.
That is why we need to ensure that we lend sufficient support to that region.
And what do we do?
In the 2002 budget, we cut back the budgetary resources allocated to that region.
I therefore urge the MEPs of the Committee on Budgets, together with the entire plenary session, to rectify that budget and to give Central Asia what it is entitled to.
This is my urgent plea.
Madam President, we are facing a war against terrorism that all freedom-loving people must embrace.
As you know, I was born in a country that understands terrorism, with 65 000 dead - please remember that the LTT suicide bombers in Sri Lanka are not Muslims - but the world has so far turned a blind eye on twenty-three years of terrorism.
The tragedy of 11 September has finally focused the attention of those that love democracy and freedom on the cancer that hides within.
The cancer of terrorism.
A cancer that is fed, not by religion, but by greed, hate, envy and ignorance.
In Afghanistan, the 1963 Constitution as promulgated by King Zahir Shah is an exemplary document.
I salute my colleague, Edward McMillan-Scott, for taking the initiative to lead a delegation to Rome to initiate a coalition between the King and the Northern Alliance, which I am happy to say has now been signed, as General Morillon has just mentioned.
I want to congratulate General Morillon on inviting Shah Masood here, so that in April we had a chance to meet him.
The 1963 Constitution states that liberty is a natural right of each human being - this right has no limitations except the liberty of others, but freedom of thought and expression is invaluable - that every Afghan has a right to print and publish ideas, that education is a right of every Afghan and shall be provided, free of charge, by the State, and that work is a right of every Afghan who has the capability to do it.
What a far cry this is from the tragedy existing in Afghanistan today, where women are beaten, denied education, kept at home as slaves and with one in eight dying in childbirth.
It is a State run by ignorance using the stick of religion, of which they know little, to cower and terrorise their own people.
The war against terrorism is a war to free the people of Afghanistan from the twenty-eight years of slavery.
I salute President Bush and the British Prime Minister for their determination - shoulder-to-shoulder with a Democratic Party and Ian Duncan Smith, the leader of the Conservative Party who was here in Parliament today - to defeat and eradicate international terrorism.
But this must not be a purely Anglo-Saxon affair.
If the EU and this House are to be anything at all, they must have an involvement in ensuring this most basic of human activities; the right to live without being terrorised, the freedom to live without the daily sudden threat of death.
We should not think that we in Europe are not targets.
We already know of plans to attack Genoa, Paris and elsewhere.
When will we learn that is our war too?
Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Commissioner Nielson, I would firstly like to pay tribute to the thousands of innocent victims in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, victims of an attack on our principles, on our democracy, on our system of freedoms, on our way of understanding peaceful coexistence, on our economy, an attack, at the end of the day, on tolerance between peoples and ideas.
The European response has for once been fast and immediate in the case of this Parliament.
The response of the Commission and the Council has also been quick, as Commissioner Patten has just reminded us with regard to the mission by the Troika.
This is a response that should be firm, forceful, proportionate and selective, in cooperation with the United Nations, and which requires political, military and police measures by the intelligence, diplomatic, legal and economic services which have, in one form or another, already been or are in the process of being adopted.
These must be measures that can be adopted and upheld in the short, medium and long term.
I have to remind you that the magnitude and gravity of events is such that the decisions taken here a few days ago that have still not been implemented have already been superseded by events.
I remember several opinions expressed here by various speakers on the occasion of the Watson report on the European Union search and arrest order just three weeks ago.
Mr Massoud, who came to visit us a short while ago, has been assassinated and so will not be able to see to fruition the objectives he spoke to us about here in Parliament.
As a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I would call for the implementation of a major humanitarian aid programme that must be put in place immediately to help the millions of displaced persons and refugees in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries in the region.
The humanitarian disaster that is on the horizon could be of a greater scale than any that has taken place in the past as a result of human barbarity.
I shall conclude, Madam President, by stating that the fight against poverty in the world, that we have highlighted on numerous occasions, is now particularly relevant and that we should make it one of our top priorities if we want to solve this problem in the short, medium and long term.
Madam President, the terrible pictures from New York exactly three weeks ago today have entered our souls to stay.
The speedy declarations of solidarity by Europe and the NATO allies have not been forgotten.
Now that the USA has demonstrated that it is not engaging in cowboy politics, but is giving very serious consideration to every step in the fight against the terrorists, we must not leave it to later to convey our thanks and appreciation across the Atlantic.
But what is being done in comparison?
Take us in Germany as an example: we find fault with the USA and make so bold as to set up rules of conduct.
We are already distancing ourselves from the USA, and an objectionable anti-Americanism occasionally puts in an appearance.
As a German European, I am ashamed of this, bearing in mind also that around 100 Germans were murdered in New York on 11 September.
I can understand why the USA, despite the announcement today that this is an issue for the Alliance as a whole, does not want, if possible, to involve its 19 NATO partners in the military counter-attack against the terrorists and their accomplices, with the exception of Great Britain.
You cannot fight and win a campaign with doubters - and I say that as an officer in the Parachute Reservists.
This is evidence of Europe's incapacity, all the more so as the wrecked twin towers in New York have their counterparts all over the EU.
Afghanistan may well be a target for the USA's counter-attack.
The inhabitants of this country battered over decades are leaving their homeland in droves, eking out an existence in refugee camps in Pakistan.
These people deserve the complete solidarity of the EU and of our Parliament.
Aid from the EU should be unbureaucratic and be given swiftly, bearing in mind that winter is very hard over there.
If we do not help now, it is to be feared that the many young refugees there will be easy prey for one fundamentalist or another.
The European Parliament should consider the advisability of sending a delegation of members of this Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation to Pakistan as soon as possible.
Impressions gained directly from experience are always better than voluminous reports.
Madam President, Afghanistan must be the ultimate example of a tragic and failed State and yet, in spite of this, the will exists for it to remain a unitary State across the ethnic divide.
It has now suffered 28 years of communist dictatorship, followed by fanatic Islamic theocracy, turning it into a pariah State as the Taliban harbours terrorists and executes thousands.
There are over 2 million refugees outside the country and some 5 million internally displaced persons, many of whom may flee if hostilities break out between the US and its allies and Afghanistan itself.
The World Food Programme is hampered by difficult terrain, destroyed infrastructure and Taliban policies which prevent female participation, and which have led to the arbitrary arrest of aid workers on charges of religious proselytising and a ban on communications with the outside world, so essential to an international aid programme.
In spite of this, some 218 tonnes of food got through to Kabul last week to avert a crisis.
It is clear that the West must now think of what can be done post-Taliban to bring permanent stability to the country.
Last week, with two of my fellow MEPs, I was privileged to meet in Rome, the former King of Afghanistan, who has lived in the European Union for much of his life.
We were the first Western elected politicians to visit the royal household since the crisis.
He demonstrated a supreme sense of patriotism and duty to his estranged country, and went as far as to say that he would serve Afghanistan in any capacity his people chose through their assembled tribal council, or Loya Jirga, which he has been working on for the last two years.
He confirmed that he has now received key support from the opposition United Front/Northern Alliance forces and will facilitate an internal settlement appropriate to his country.
He is the only acceptable Afghan figure who can unite all the warring factions and demonstrated the ability, when he ruled his country between 1933 and 1973, to rule constitutionally with tolerance and moderation, even using the English model of sport as a way to unite the disparate ethnic groups.
It was clear to me that Zahir Shah, in spite of his advanced age, was both cogent and fit enough to do the job, after conducting a lengthy one-and-a-half-hour interview with myself and my colleagues.
He has also wisely distanced himself from the restoration of the monarchy as an issue, leaving this to his people to decide.
I urge this House to support the King's mission in this tricky area.
Madam President, I condemn without reservation terrorism and murder.
I agree with my colleagues that there is no reason for it and no-one has a right to carry out such acts.
Terrorists choose violence rather than the ballot box, inflicting death and pain on innocent civilians, justifying their actions by flying the banner of religion, race or political sovereignty.
Islam, like other great world religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, is a way of life for over one thousand million people in this world.
These millions of Muslims, from Indonesia to Nigeria, from Central Asia to the leafy suburbs of California, knew nothing about Osama bin Laden before 11 September.
For these millions and for Islam there is no place for terrorists like him or any others, whoever they are and wherever they come from.
These terrorists have no authority to act on behalf of any people, race or religion.
Therefore, we must fight terrorism and act against terrorists, not innocent civilians who pursue their lives peacefully and who should have the freedom to believe in a religion of their choice.
Human life is precious and the death of innocent civilians, wherever it occurs, is simply not acceptable.
Reason without passion is sterile, passion without reason is heat.
Let us be firm and decisive.
Let us target terrorism: let us remove the causes that conceive, feed and sustain terrorism.
Madam President, the situation was already bad and now it is worse.
I totally agree with what has been said this afternoon on the situation of the people in Afghanistan.
We put Afghanistan on the list of so-called forgotten crises when we fixed ECHO's programme and priorities for 2001.
We had a spending level of some EUR 23 million, which would have covered the continuation until New Year of the very last activity that we were funding there.
In fact we had 29 European NGOs delivering humanitarian aid inside Afghanistan.
They were all there on 11 September.
On 11 September I was on my way to a mission to Afghanistan and to Pakistan.
I was supposed to meet Dr Masood, the Taliban leadership and to go around the whole country seeing the work of these NGOs that we are funding.
I had to cancel the trip.
The morning after, we took the train back from London to Brussels but our luggage was already in the aeroplane for Islamabad.
Now, as I said, the situation is worse.
Winter is approaching.
Winter is such a dominating feature of reality there that even in normal years military fighting more or less stops simply because getting around is so difficult.
So humanitarian aid now faces a really scary challenge.
The international staff of the different aid agencies and NGOs have all been withdrawn from the country.
However, it is very encouraging to see that the local staff is continuing to distribute food - if the food has not been taken over by the Taliban - and is still running health clinics and providing education where it is possible.
Obtaining real, true information is extremely difficult, but we can see that they are trying to keep these activities going even in this situation.
Of course the threat of an outside attack has resulted in large movements of population.
This also has the effect that we cannot rely on people accessing the different storage centres for food as they used to, because they have fled into the countryside in their millions and lost the access to food they had in the cities.
So the internal situation is extremely bad and the people who make it to the border look even weaker than they did before.
Some six million Afghanis are considered to be totally dependent on food supplies from the outside.
If no planting is possible before the winter sets in - and this is most probable - we are in for a very serious threat within less than half a year, even if things work out well in terms of stability.
The very logistics of what is needed down the line, even on the basis of the best case scenario, pose a formidable challenge.
We have supported the different UN organisations very actively, and participated at the meeting of the Afghan support group in Berlin on 27 September.
The UN has launched a UN-donor alert in support of emergency assistance.
The alert calls for some USD 580 million from now until March next year to ensure that delivery of humanitarian assistance and the protection of what is estimated to be around 7.5 million Afghans.
USD 120 million is required immediately.
Funding of this appeal would, in fact, seem to be less of a problem than the overall question of accessibility to internally displaced people and refugees.
There are conflicting views in the discussion as to whether emphasis should be placed on keeping the additional migratory flows within Afghanistan or on encouraging Pakistan and Iran to open their borders, as the UNHCR intends to do.
My personal analysis of this is that we are only able to influence the choice of these people to a very small degree.
Things may happen and we will have to be very flexible in order to be able to do what we need to do as things develop.
We have never had to draw up a contingency plan with so few given elements and so many unknowns.
The need to keep food aid going was central to the discussion at this Afghan group meeting.
Everybody agreed on the urgency, but concurred that the prospects for actually delivering such aid were quite poor.
Most participants argued that food-aid distribution without the presence of expatriates could expose Afghan partners to undue risk.
My earlier reference to Afghan local staff continuing to do what they did before the expatriates had to leave relates to deliveries of existing food and other stocks.
It is a far more difficult and demanding task to manage the convoys of new supplies coming in, given the internal situation that exists today.
Things are different in the north-eastern part controlled by the Northern Alliance and in the rest of the country.
But from the humanitarian point of view it is quite evident that our activities must be targeted at the whole country.
That is how it must be.
We are using three financial tools to fund the aid to the Afghan population.
First - and this is to set the record straight - over the past ten years we have provided humanitarian aid of more than EUR 400 million to internally displaced persons in Afghanistan and refugees in neighbouring countries: ECHO funds, drought mitigation and response activities like food aid, agricultural rehabilitation, water and sanitation rehabilitation, assistance to internally displaced persons and to refugees in Pakistan, as well as prevention of displacements and support for returnees.
So this is more than just food aid.
ECHO and the organisations working with our money have managed to build up a portfolio of meaningful activities that they have been able to continue.
I add that one unfortunate international case is not representative of the situation of the 29 organisations that the Commission is funding.
It is a difficult situation but it is important to note that the organisations we are funding cannot be accused of the same kind of activity.
They were able to work with expatriates until 11 September and to build up a portfolio of activity, which I was very much looking forward to coming to see.
I pay tribute also to my predecessor in this job for laying the seeds of this kind of good cooperation with the European humanitarian NGOs.
We have, this year, committed EUR 23 million to ECHO, channelled through NGOs and different UN agencies.
As I said, this would have covered a continuation of this level of activity until the end of the year.
Then this terrible act of terrorism took place.
We reacted immediately with an additional EUR 4 million.
This is committed for action through the World Food Programme, UNHCR, and the International Red Cross.
Now our response has to go beyond this.
We will approach the budgetary authority in order to get the green light for accessing and using funds from the emergency budget reserve, as in earlier years when ECHO's normal budget did not cover the needs that arose because of terrible events.
We announced EUR 25 million a week ago in the Commission.
It will form part of this operation and be directed at the immediate situation of the refugees.
We will be asking for more money.
But this is covered by the normal procedure for accessing additional money.
The second line of support is EC aid to uprooted people.
Here we fund activities creating environments conducive to a sustainable resettlement of returnees and activities aimed at persuading people to remain in their villages.
This budget line will commit funds from October for a budget of EUR 19 million in Afghanistan, EUR 3 million in Pakistan and EUR 2 million in Iran.
Funds are channelled through Afghan NGOs and UN agencies.
The third line is EC food aid and food security.
Since the beginning of this year this line has committed 30 000 tonnes of food aid to the World Food Programme and 7 000 tonnes to NGOs.
A further EUR 7 million is now being requested by the Commission for the WFP Afghan programme.
Let me address some of the questions that have been asked.
Mrs Nicholson mentioned that we should do more through UNHCR and WHO to broaden the broad basis and improve the organisation of this assistance.
In relation also to Mr Van den Berg's remarks, from a commercial management point of view, if you will, the operation in Afghanistan is a good case of cooperation between the UN organisations and those very professional and relatively big and specialised NGOs which, for some years now, have formed part of the operation.
What we need now are operational plans for concrete action.
We hear in the media now about a convoy getting through the Khyber Pass and going north.
This is a 'pilot scheme' , so to speak, which may also progress towards Kabul and on, to try to see what is possible.
But there is no overall plan in place; this was a response to the UNHCR proposals in the discussion with donors for better planning so as to know what to do and not be burdened down with red tape, as Mr Knolle called it.
This is not the problem.
I would go as far as to say that in general this is not the problem with our work in the humanitarian aid area.
Please keep in mind that the totality of ECHO's budget is used every year and this year we are coming to you asking for more because of this situation.
The red tape here is minimal.
Protection was mentioned.
Here we are in a terrible dilemma.
We cannot push those voluntary organisations that work with our money into doing something that goes beyond what they want to do.
On the other hand, we have a problem as a funder, for example if they want to do something very daring that may get them into trouble and we just do what we can on the issue of security, no questions asked.
Chechnya is a case in point; the Russians are still denying our NGOs access to radios, and this is a real problem for the safety of the people there.
This is a balancing act and the responsibility that we have as the funder of the activity goes far into the issue of security.
Again, working with the UN is partly an answer to this, but working to deliver humanitarian aid now to the Taliban-controlled part of Afghanistan under some sort of armed protection is not an option.
There has to be a very open humanitarian mode of operation where suspicion about how one moves around in their country is not a factor.
But this is extremely difficult.
I agree with what Mrs Frahm and Mrs Bonino said about the situation of women.
This is the most extreme version of a denial and violation of human rights apparent to us.
It is part of the conflict that they are in the midst of, and one would hope that sanity emerges after what we are about to go through now.
Mr Belder mentioned the export of drugs.
It should in all objectivity be noted that the Taliban has made an incredible effort to reduce the production of opium and this may be one of the best cases globally that we have seen where they have done what the international community would like to see done.
It reflects a totally different agenda, but has in fact taken place, and so I believed I should mention it.
As regards Mr Morillon's reference to the deceased leader of the Northern Alliance, Ahmed Shah Masood, we have no better answer than the one very well presented by Commissioner Patten as our view of the need for a comprehensive sort of basis for shaping the future of Afghanistan.
This is the line to take.
Mr Morillon also asked me if I had the determination and the means to do what must be done.
We are relying on the international aid organisations to do what needs to be done on the ground.
We have not been hesitant in mobilising funds and are actively participating in the region with the people representing ECHO who are permanently stationed there.
We are participating in the debate on how to organise things and to understand the situation as much as possible.
In response to Mr Staes, consideration for the countries in the Central Asian region bordering Afghanistan to the north will be part of the package I mentioned and we are discussing resources in addition to the EUR 25 million that we have publicly mentioned.
In respect of the dialogue with the budgetary authority, we are not releasing figures other than this EUR 25 million, but this will be an element in that package which we will be coming back to quite soon.
Thank you for your patience.
This is an extremely demanding situation.
I see this as something that demonstrates to us that, looking back on the history of our own experiment in Europe, we got organised to do what needed to be done in Europe after the Second World War and we did it.
The problem we are discussing here today and the challenges it involves tell us that Europe now needs to get organised and find a way of achieving what the world needs to achieve.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
Guidelines for the trans-European transport network
The next item is the Commission communication on Guidelines for the trans-European transport network.
I now give the floor to Mrs Loyola de Palacio, on behalf of the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its meeting today, the College of Commissioners adopted a proposed review of the trans-European transport networks, as well as the review of the Financial Regulation, which allows for a doubling of the Community funding in these projects, up to a level of 20% of those projects.
The trans-European transport network has been the backbone of our internal market since it was introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht and, thanks to the guidelines which we jointly adopted in 1996, the European Union has a structure of networks of European interest which allows the interconnection of our regions and aids the mobility of people and goods.
These trans-European networks are Europe' s first attempt since Roman times to treat its infrastructures in a truly global and integrated fashion.
The review we are proposing today attempts to update the development of this system and add new priority projects which respond to the problems of the challenges which our common transport policy has raised in recent years.
The liberalisation of transport systems and the increase in demand for mobility have caused an imbalance between the different modes of transport and have contributed to the creation of bottlenecks in certain areas of our infrastructures.
Both the Gothenburg Summit and the Transport White Paper adopted on 12 September have identified these failings and have demanded that the Commission implement urgent measures to overcome them.
In today' s proposal, the Commission recommends including amongst the priority projects, as well as the so-called Essen projects, eight new rail, combined transport, inland waterways and intelligent transport - specifically the GALILEO project - networks and withdrawing three of the initial projects which have now been completed.
The new projects would be: first, a rail crossing for the Pyrenees which would overcome the natural obstacle which separates the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of the continent.
Second, the high speed train, East-west combined transport, from Paris to Vienna, which will later be extended to Budapest and will complete our network by opening the door to enlargement.
Third, the navigability of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen, which will connect the North Sea to the Black Sea, thereby improving the interconnection between the Danube and the Rhine.
Fourth, the GALILEO satellite positioning system, which has been recognised as a priority by successive European Councils and by this House.
Fifth, the road connection between Germany and Denmark via Fehmarn according to the Oresund model, which will improve interconnection between the Nordic countries and the rest of the continent.
Sixth, the high speed rail interoperability of the Iberian network, by adapting it to the track gauge of the rest of the European continent, which will ease sky and land congestion.
Seventh, the extension of the Brenner project from Munich to Verona, as far as Naples, adding the Bologna-Milan line.
Eighth, the extension of the high speed train south as far as NÃ®mes, which provides a connection between the north and south of Europe.
The necessary global investment for these projects, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, will amount to more than EUR 66 000 million which must clearly be financed essentially through national, regional, private, public and also, where necessary, Community funds.
Geographically, they involve the whole of our territory and they will have a decisive impact on the competitiveness of our economy.
This review also includes in the trans-European networks certain minor technical modifications of existing projects which were left outstanding after the conciliation of the package of guidelines in 1996.
In the Transport White Paper, we committed ourselves to this review, which is the most urgent priority, being followed in 2004 by another which will include in more detail the projects of the new countries of the Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, it would be premature to do so now since, despite the preparatory work, which has made good progress, there is a lack of important information which we will only be able to obtain during the final phase of enlargement.
This Parliament will therefore examine the next review and this is a political commitment which I reconfirm to this House.
Mr President, I am very pleased to fulfil through this work the mandates of the Council and the new requirements of our common transport policy.
Now that the White Paper and the review of the trans-European networks have been presented, I trust and hope, within the framework of codecision, that this Parliament will make its contributions, the added value of which is evident.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know that, while this has been approved today by the Commission, there are currently other topical realities, specifically the consequences for the airline industry of the events of 11 September, which you will possibly be concerned about.
Of course, I will answer any question which you may ask me on this subject.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, thank you for giving us this interim report now.
We are dissatisfied with the Member States, which have practically left you in the lurch over the last eighteen months.
The interim report on trans-European transport networks has been overdue since 1999.
We thank you for presenting it now.
So, to our first question: in your report, you make it clear that you want to add new elements, but that you also want to insist on existing projects which the Member States are still working on - such as the Brenner Tunnel - now at last being finished.
I would therefore ask you how we are together to ensure, even with a possible change to the financial arrangements, that older projects as important as the Brenner Tunnel, but also new ones such as the Franco-Spanish link across the Pyrenees, or the fixed Femarn Belt link between Denmark and Germany actually get built?
Madam Vice-President, you have already alluded to my second question: when are you going to expound to us in committee or in this House what your policy will be on combating new competition in the form of subsidised air travel?
Alternatively, the question arises of how the airlines can be helped after the tragic events of 11 September.
Mr President, I think we can agree wholeheartedly with the Commissioner's main remarks.
I can endorse what Mr Jarzembowski said.
I would, however, like to ask the Commissioner, whether she is able to concur with our view that we can learn from our experiences to date with the Trans-European Networks.
One insight we have gained, for example, is that when the Heads of State and Government decide upon a list, it is not necessarily better than a list of priorities drawn up by Parliament.
Might we perhaps put this experience to use?
In any case, I find the Commissioner's approach in the White Paper, concentrating on rail and waterways, very much worthy of support.
The issue there is whether or not we should check all the financing instruments, not only the money we have for the TEN, with that in mind.
For if it is only in the TEN that priority is given to rail and waterways, then the other funds - for example the Cohesion Fund and others - will have to be looked at and checked with a view to their perhaps taking these new priorities into account as well for the sake of consistency.
Those are my two questions.
Commissioner, a moment ago, you listed a number of projects which will be followed up, for example the high-speed link from Paris-Vienna-Budapest eastwards, and making the Danube navigable.
I wonder whether the latter actually falls within the scope of such a thing as establishing trans-European networks.
I can understand why its repair would come under its scope, in a manner of speaking, for there is already a link there at the moment.
That was my first question.
Secondly, it has become increasingly clear to me that with regard to links within the candidate countries, requests are mainly made for north-south links, and not only for east-west links from Europe and beyond.
My question is therefore whether there are currently any plans to set up more north-south links in the present candidate countries?
Exactly, Madam Vice-President, we must not lose sight of the North or of the South.
Sometimes, in Spain, we say that we should not lose sight of the North, that is to say we should not lose our way, but, on the other hand, we should neither lose sight of the South.
So that there are no doubts, I will now tell you the order in which you will take the floor.
The first group of three will comprise Mr Ripoll, Mr Izquierdo and Mrs Langenhagen; the second, Mr Varela, Mr Savary and Mr RÃŒbig.
And following the reply of the Vice-President, we shall pass on to another item.
Mr Ripoll therefore has the floor.
Madam Vice-President, I would like to thank you for being here and ask you two very brief and specific questions.
Firstly, could you confirm that the whole of the Spanish high-speed network is included in the trans-European networks?
And secondly, if the answer is yes, what are the scope and consequences of its incorporation for European infrastructure and from a Spanish point of view?
Mr President, Commissioner, the merit of providing information quickly is to achieve an effect of surprise when giving good news.
And I must congratulate you on the news you have brought us today, which was directly related to my first budgetary question, which I now have to adapt.
However, I would like to stress the importance I attach to moving from 10% to 20% in the projects.
My question is, 'how have you done it?' .
Because this action is of interest to us in terms of future actions and requests by this Parliament.
So where did you get that 10% from?
Can the same be expected for other modes of transport?
Secondly, the environmental impact.
When you appeared before us in 1999, at your hearing as a candidate for Commissioner, you said that you would pay very close attention to the environmental impact.
Do you intend to maintain this level of attention in relation to these projects and not be mechanically subject to the will of the States, which normally incorporate truly harmful environmental effects into some of these areas?
Thirdly, we have still not been able to digest the projects which you have just mentioned to us, but I would like to ask you a question with no ill intention, but simply so that we may know your initial opinion: do you think that your proposal tackles the problems of the peripheral regions and is therefore of a cohesive nature?
Mr President, I believe that the terrible experiences in America are causing the European satellite navigation system, GALILEO to be looked at from a new political and economic angle.
The Member States have in the past supported this good initiative of theirs only with reluctance.
Do you believe that there is now a new readiness on the part of the Member States to implement GALILEO without delay?
Mr President, the whole of the European gauge high speed network of the Iberian Peninsula is, in fact, included in the networks.
There is going to be an enormous effort to integrate the Iberian Peninsula with the European rail network and this will bring about such interoperability, thereby making rail transport - for both people and goods - a genuine alternative to other types of transport.
Secondly, what I have just said will clearly serve to integrate the Iberian Peninsula more with the rest of the European Union, just as the Rhine-Rhone project or the Paris-Stuttgart-Linz-Vienna, and, later, Budapest, rail project will serve to integrate the East with the rest of the current European Union.
The same can be said of the link between the Scandinavian Peninsula and the European continent by means of the new alternative connection to the Oresund Bridge, to the Oresund connection, which is also approved in the new plans.
Therefore, Mr Izquierdo Collado, it does serve to integrate the peripheral areas with the centre and, in this respect, it is cohesive.
As for the aforementioned 10% and 20% thresholds, these are financing possibilities.
It does not mean that 10% or 20% will be granted.
There are times when 5% is granted and is the maximum limit.
Second issue.
We will have to see whether the Council and Parliament support it.
Third issue.
It works for all modes of transport, because these trans-European networks do not only include the elements I have indicated.
Generically, there is the interconnection between ports and their adjacent land area, that is, rail interconnections, land interconnections, the intermodal interconnection not only of the sea ports but also of river ports, the modal interconnections between rail and airport, for interconnection with the air sector, and the interconnection between rail and road, essentially in the freight sector.
In other words, there is another series of generic elements that I have not expanded upon, which are also included in these networks.
In particular, we have to solve the problem of bottlenecks.
In the case of bottlenecks, with much less action in terms of budget, we can achieve multiplier effects.
Ten per cent of the road network and 20% of the rail network is affected by habitual bottlenecks.
This does not mean that 20% of the rail network is a bottleneck.
But there are problem points within this rail network that eventually effect 20% of the European rail network.
Of course, we will try to ensure that funding is at the maximum level in these cases.
In relation to environmental impact, I maintain what has been said before.
We have prepared all of this in common agreement with the department of Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and with the Commission' s Directorate-General for the Environment and we have agreed that we will continue to work jointly on its implementation and promotion.
Mrs Langenhagen, we are going to hold a debate in relation to GALILEO.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are aware of my personal interest in this project, which I believe to be crucial in terms of European Union strategy.
In my personal opinion - although it is shared by the Services and by the Commission as a whole - what happened on 11 September gives us all the more reason to move ahead with this project.
Clearly, not all of the applications that increasingly depend on the American global positioning system can rely on a single system.
We need a second system that will complement and strengthen the current system, which is the American one.
It is not a question of competing with the Americans. It is a question of participating, together with the Americans, in order to make the whole system more secure.
In any event, you know that Council will have to give its definitive opinion on these issues at its last meeting in December and I hope that on that occasion we will finally clear up any ambiguities and doubts once and for all and we will move ahead with a project which is essential to the future of the European Union.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and congratulate her on having appeared so quickly before this House to give us this important information today.
Although she gave a general reply earlier in relation to Spain, I would like, if you will permit me, to ask about a specific aspect which has a lot to do with peripheral regions, or rather the most peripheral of the peripheral regions - the Galician Finisterre.
I would like to ask you whether these new guidelines approved by the Commission, in relation to Spain and the high speed railway, include connections with the Autonomous Community of Galicia and, if so, whether you can explain how.
Thank you, Commissioner, for this new information on the trans-European networks.
I should like to mention one issue, and at the same time take the opportunity to say that I welcome the fact that it has been included, and that is the crossing of the Pyrenees.
It is an issue that has received much less media attention than the Alps, but it is probably a more critical one.
Even now, the number of heavyweight vehicles which cross the Pyrenees every day between the Iberian peninsula and France is greater than the number crossing the Alps.
We shall therefore be faced with the development of a very critical situation, because infrastructures on the Atlantic side are lagging behind.
As for the actual crossing, or central railway tunnel, I believe that this is a very good thing, but we must not forget that this tunnel will certainly not be constructed in the short term, since the Lyon-Turin tunnel and the Brenner tunnel have to be built first.
I would like to make a personal plea - and I would like to hear your opinions on the subject - for emergency structures at either end of the Pyrenees, particular between the Basque Country and the Atlantic coast.
It seems to me that it is there, first of all, because that is where the people and the activities are, that we shall free the bottleneck in the road and rail routes leading to the Iberian peninsula.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, thank you for your initiative.
The citizens want enlargement to build visible bridges.
The Slovak government seeks a bridge in the form of the joining of Vienna and Bratislava airports into a mega-airport with a 'Transrapid' rail line to improve transport links.
This could well be the first stage of the Paris-Vienna route you have mentioned.
I believe it would be a very important initiative to take it onward as far as Budapest.
We also have, however, the shipping junction on the Danube, and in the long run this would become a triple junction.
Do you think this programme could also facilitate the financing of junctions of this sort?
Mr President, many thanks to Mr Varela.
If we are talking about the Galician stretches of the high speed network, yes, they are included, as are the interconnections with Portugal, insofar as, I insist, it involves adapting and modifying these constructions in accordance with the European gauge, whether they be new lines or adaptations of existing lines, and I should like to make this clear.
Furthermore, there is another series of projects which affect that part of Europe, such as issues relating to ports and other issues that I will not go into now.
Mr Savary, I fully share your concern about the Pyrenees.
When, as the person responsible for transport in the European Union, I look at a map to see what is happening, I see a barrier, a wall, with a pass on the right of the map, on the far eastern side, and another on the left, in the west, and in between there is nothing.
There is no railway.
It now seems that there is going to be a pass at Canfranc but, for the moment, there are just those two passes.
The Commission believes that, between now and 2010, we must provide a pass for a further 100 million tonnes between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of the European continent.
We must now begin to discuss, prepare and work on a rail project that will create a great Pyrenean pass, not at the western or eastern extremes, but at the most central part; that will go further than the contribution of the possible creation of the Canfranc pass; that will create a truly significant rail route for goods.
We are talking about high figures.
As you say, undoubtedly both the Spanish and the French governments will have to consider alternatives, because for that great central Pyrenean pass we are talking in terms of around 2015 to 2020, that is, in 15-20 years time, and this type of project has to be planned that far in advance and they have to be dealt with and initiated within that timescale.
Apart from that, in any event, one of the Essen projects is still under way, which included the Basque 'Y' , which also involves a European gauge link via that entrance to the Iberian Peninsula.
I would like to say to Mr RÃŒbig that the Vienna-Bratislava motorway is included in the projects (I have not mentioned it because it is a lesser issue), which includes the stretch of that motorway within Austrian territory.
A rail interconnection is not envisaged at the moment, but I would like to say that all of these aspects will clearly have to be looked at with care for the 2004 review, when enlargement has taken place, at least its first stage, if there are to be more stages.
Thank you very much, Madam Vice-President.
That concludes this item on the agenda.
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0333/2001).
We are not going to have an hour and a half. We are going to have an hour and a quarter at the most.
I would therefore ask Members to cooperate so that we can get through as many questions as possible.
Mr Vitorino represents the Commission.
Part I
Question No 27 by (H-0700/01):
Subject: Illegal immigration into the European Union through Morocco What measures will the Commission propose in order to regulate illegal immigration through Morocco, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the kind of tragic events which occurred this summer in Community waters?
I am grateful for your explanations, but I wanted to stress the urgency of the issue.
Specifically, this summer thirty or forty people, that we know of, have drowned as a result of the operation of these illegal immigration networks.
It is calculated that last year four or five thousand people drowned trying to cross the stretch which separates Morocco from Spain.
I would therefore like to repeat the question, Commissioner, of whether there is any possibility that, without waiting for the result of the Barcelona process and the broader renegotiations on association, we can reach a very practical agreement in terms of policing and control so that the Moroccan authorities may prevent these deaths, which are reaching frightening proportions.
Mr President, I fully agree with Mr Medina' s belief that we are facing a human tragedy, that we cannot expect an ideal solution and that we will have to discover the solution as we progress.
In order to progress, however, the two sides must agree on the mechanisms to be applied.
This is something which is yet to reach a point which I consider acceptable.
We therefore have great hopes that at the Association Council next week progress can be made on the identification of specific cooperation mechanisms, including police cooperation on border control.
In any event, I would like to stress that in 2001 a very substantial proportion of the budgetary line which I mentioned has been dedicated to actions for cooperation with Morocco, increasing that country' s administrative capacity in the management of illegal immigration, which is not just a human problem: it is a political problem, especially for Spain.
But it is also a problem for Morocco, because Morocco is today a transit country in which there are many sub-Saharan illegal immigrants, with very harmful social consequences for Morocco.
I believe that after next week we will have better cooperation perspectives, which I hope will be the result of the meeting of the Association Council.
Question No 28 by (H-0730/01):
Subject: Release of Mr Albin Kurti and other Kosovars still being held hostage by the Belgrade authorities Of some 2000 Kosovars who were kidnapped and held hostage by the military and paramilitary forces belonging to the regime then in place in Belgrade in the days leading up to the international police operation in Kosovo more than 28 months ago, 229 are still being held in Serb prisons.
One hundred of them are being held for common law offences, while the remaining 129, including the student leader Arbin Kurti, are being held for their convictions or for 'political' offences.
In February 2001 the Serb and Yugoslav parliaments passed an amnesty law allowing the release of 30 000 Serbs and some 400 Kosovars.
At the end of April 2001, 143 prisoners were released from Jakova prison.
The Serb judicial authorities had stated that the cases of the remaining Kosovar prisoners would be the subject of a rapid judicial review followed by release.
Despite these commitments given by the Belgrade authorities, however, and despite the Council and Commission's repeated promises to intervene forcefully in order to put an end to this intolerable situation, the matter has still not been resolved.
Has the Commission decided no longer to consider it a priority to resolve this issue?
If not, what initiatives will it take in order finally to bring about the immediate release of Arbin Kurti and the 129 Kosovar hostages and the transfer of the 100 Kosovar prisoners still being held in Serbia for common law offences to the UNMNIK, which is the only competent body in this connection?
The European Commission remains concerned by this issue and I can assure the honourable Member that we are taking every available opportunity to exert appropriate pressure on those in a position to take decisions on this issue.
As the honourable Member recognises, considerable progress has already been made and we welcome this.
The remaining prisoners' cases are being reviewed and where convictions cannot be supported by evidence the prisoners are released.
Where there are grounds for conviction, appeals are being launched.
The ICRC monitors the condition of individual prisoners and maintains contact with their families.
As regards the transfers of prisoners from detention in Serbia to the United Nations' Mission's facilities in Kosovo, this matter is being discussed by the appropriate authorities.
Simultaneous reform of the judiciary with the help and advice of international organisations, such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE, which are now both present in Belgrade, is under way.
The rule of law and respect for minority rights are key conditions applying to relations with and assistance for the Former Republic of Yugoslavia and its neighbours.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you.
Having said that, however, I should point out a certain number of things.
On numerous occasions, your colleagues at the Commission have talked about priority with regard to the transferring of the Kosovar hostages from Serbia to Kosovo.
They did so when the criminal Milosevic was still in power.
That was almost a year ago, and there has been a change of regime in Belgrade, so it is even more incomprehensible that these problems have still not been solved.
You talk about grounds for conviction, you talk about appeal procedures, but it has been established and confirmed, by this Parliament itself, that the Belgrade authorities were not competent, that only UNMIK was competent to deal with these cases, that the transfer had therefore already been accomplished, in law, and it was simply a matter of implementing it, and that has been the case for the past two years, Commissioner.
Well, that is quite a long time for us, but I think it is an extremely long time for those who are still incarcerated in the gaols of Belgrade.
In the case of Mr Arbin Kurti in particular, who was a student leader, I really do not understand what objections or other factors can still be preventing his transfer.
. (FR) On specific cases, I would say that direct responsibility for monitoring trials lies with the ICRC.
The Commission raises the question from a general political viewpoint, and I can assure the honourable Member that when speaking to the authorities of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia we have always urged the need for decisions to be taken as quickly as possible.
I must emphasise that there are some cases in which crimes have been committed.
In those cases, it is up to the law to decide what should be the fate of the accused, to charge them and to launch appeals so that justice will prevail in the end.
As far as political relations are concerned, I can assure the honourable Member that we have never ceased to urge a rapid resolution of all the situations that are being assessed, and I must point out that some progress has been made, but of course, any period of time is too long when one has been charged with an offence, especially when the charge is unjust, and the Commission, for its part, will continue to urge as rapid a solution as possible in those situations which are still being assessed.
Question 29 by (H-0737/01):
Subject: Trials in Kabul The trial began in early September before an Islamic court in Kabul, Afghanistan, of four citizens of a Member State of the Union, Germany, together with two US and two Australian citizens, all of whom are aid workers with Shelter Now International.
In accordance with the Islamic law of the country, the prosecutor is demanding the death penalty for conducting Christian missionary activities.
At the same time, 16 Afghan citizens have been charged with converting from Islam to the Christian faith, for which the prosecutor is also demanding the death penalty in accordance with the Islamic law of Afghanistan.
What representations has the European Union made to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to secure respect for the legal rights of all the accused and their protection in the context of the European Union's endeavours to promote religious freedom as an integral part of human rights, as enshrined in the UN Charter, the Council of Europe Convention and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the German government has specifically requested that the European Union should neither adopt positions nor take action in relation to the eight humanitarian aid organisation workers, specifically from the 'Shelter Now International' non-governmental organisation, who are currently on trial in Kabul, in Afghanistan, accused of attempting to convert Afghan Muslims to the Christian religion.
The governments of the three countries whose nationals are involved in this situation, Germany, Australia and the United States of America, have decided to act jointly at this stage and have stated that they would prefer to find solutions to this problem on a strictly bilateral level.
The honourable Member will be aware that the trial of these eight people is under way.
Given the current situation and climate, the Commission does not consider it to be appropriate, or even helpful, to make any further comment on this situation, since the decision must fall to the governments of the nationals involved. I can assure you, however, that both the Commission and all of the European Union' s Member States will, of course, continue to follow developments carefully and closely.
Thank you for your answer.
Mr Vitorino' s reply made no mention of the sixteen Afghans brought before the courts and accused of having converted from Islam to Christianity.
These people are threatened with the death penalty under Islamic law.
My question to Mr Vitorino is: have we in the European Union, in our fight against the death penalty and in support of religious freedom, in any way acted on behalf of these people who are in actual fact threatened by the death penalty?
In what way is the European Union taking action against all those Arab and Muslim countries - in practice, almost all of them - in which converting from Islam to Christianity is in actual fact punishable by death?
Irrespective of what happened in the United States on 11 September, we must be tireless in our campaign against the death penalty.
My question is: What has happened to these sixteen Afghans who are in danger?
Mr President, I do not think that the honourable Member can doubt my position or that of the Commission on the death penalty or on freedom of religion.
If he had the opportunity to hear what I said, for example, in the debates on the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights, he will find the answer there, not only in rhetoric, but also in clear and unequivocal laws.
I admit that we do not have any specific information on the situation of the sixteen Afghans to whom he refers.
Apparently, however, these sixteen Afghans will be committed to trial at a later date, in other words, not at the same time that the eight citizens of Germany, the United States and Australia are to be tried.
We support, of course, the statement by the troika, the 'Afghan Support Group' , a joint contact group, currently chaired by Germany which has issued an unequivocal statement of support for these non-governmental organisation workers, whether they be citizens of the States I have mentioned or Afghans caught up in this situation.
Thank you very much for your presence and participation in this Question Time, Mr Vitorino.
We will move on to the second part.
We have twenty minutes per Commissioner, not a minute more.
A very good afternoon, Mr Bolkestein.
