Furthermore, the recent European Council, instead of deciding on greater solidarity with the candidate countries, practically all of which have extremely serious economic and social problems to address, has actually reduced the aid package established in Berlin in 1999.
Nothing has been decided on future financing, except that CAP appropriations will be frozen after 2006 with a downward trend, in order to serve more countries with less money!
The financial block is therefore scheduled to take place after enlargement.
There is a great risk of the enlarged European Union simply ending up as a free trade area, with no real solidarity and therefore no European integration.
EIB Annual Report (2001)
The next item is the report (A5-0364/2002) by Mrs van den Burg, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Investment Bank annual report for 2001 [2001/2256(INI)].
Before giving the rapporteur the floor, I would like to welcome Mr Maystadt, President of the European Investment Bank, who will speak later on.
Madam President, let me first start with a word of welcome, also to Mr Maystadt.
I should also like to thank the EIB for the fruitful cooperation which, in the tradition of the past three years, has developed as we have commented on your annual reports.
I think that Parliament can be pleased with the way in which you have taken on board the suggestions from those previous reports, and I hope that this will also be the case with my report.
In your introduction to your 2001 annual report, you described the EIB as a policy-driven public bank whose mission is to help achieve economic, social and, ultimately, political goals.
I could not agree with you more.
The EIB can play an important macro-economic role and underpin EU policy in key areas.
The EIB is a public bank, accountable to the public for the policy it pursues.
It is with these considerations in mind that I have written my report and I have emphasised a number of aspects in this respect.
Today, I should like to single out five elements from my report.
They are: capital increase, pension funds, labour market policy and employment policy, EU enlargement and adequate supervision of EIB policy.
First of all, capital increase.
In its annual meeting of 4 June, the Board of Governors decided to increase the capital by EUR 50 billion.
Parliament welcomes this decision and believes that funding this capital increase from the bank itself is a wise decision.
We condemn, however, the Board's refusal to agree at this stage to a further increase in the next five years.
Parliament also applauds the decision to increase the funding of some projects in the sectors hardest hit by the economic slow-down from 50% to 70% of the total project budget.
I should also like to draw your attention to the facility which the EIB offered during the autumn floods in Central and Eastern Europe to bolster emergency programmes to as much as 100%.
I think that this fits in well with the image of an active bank which supports the EU's goals.
In that way, the EIB also becomes visible to the citizens.
I should next like to turn to the subject of pension funds.
In my report, I enlarged upon the role of the bank as borrower on the capital markets.
The EIB plays a major role in this area too, particularly on relatively new markets, such as in some accession countries.
With its triple-A rating and long-term bonds in different currencies, the bank is a major protagonist and a very safe investment for pension funds, for example.
A drawback is that EIB bonds are not always freely accessible.
Government restrictions often apply precisely to investments made by pension funds and insurance companies.
The EIB can play the role of icebreaker in order to promote long-term investments and, as a result, give investors more scope for riskier investments in their new economies.
For example, the EIB could be an interesting partner for pension funds.
This is why I tabled one more amendment before the plenary's debate on my report, and I should like to invite the bank to play an active part.
I should also like to hear Mr Maystadt's opinion on the matter.
My third point concerns labour market policy.
The Amsterdam action programme has been more effective in drawing attention to projects in the social sectors.
Since time immemorial, the majority of investments have been in the area of hard infrastructure.
It is, however, also important to invest in social infrastructure.
I would apply the two-pronged Lisbon objective, both economically and socially, to EIB policy.
Like last year, Parliament calls on the EIB to assess the impact on employment of the projects and activities implemented and supported by the EIB and to enhance the internal and external expertise in this field within all the bank's different activities and directorates.
I am interested what Mr Maystadt's intentions are in this area too.
With regard to enlargement, we discussed the first round of the EU's enlargement in Parliament on Tuesday.
The EIB can also do its bit by giving a high priority to activities in the accession countries and by allowing those countries to take part as fully-fledged participants.
I have a feeling that the new Member States take too little advantage of investment opportunities.
It seems as if they are imposing restrictions on themselves because they do not want to run up excessive debts.
A creditable ambition which can bring them closer to monetary union, but something against which I would put question marks at this stage.
Parliament has advised the EIB at any rate not to overlook the social dimension and to set up a special programme for the candidate countries and other partner countries, which should address the objectives of social cohesion.
Mr Maystadt may be able to enlarge on this point too in his response.
Finally, Parliament urges an intensified co-operation of the EIB and the EBRD on the basis of a well-considered and efficient division of tasks.
In fact, this will be discussed in a separate report by Mr Markov in our committee and in this House in the foreseeable future.
My final point concerns monitoring.
The importance of transparency and of the adequate supervision of the EIB group is something that has always enjoyed Parliament's undivided attention.
As a public investment bank, the need for adequate monitoring is obvious, but there is still room for improvement in this respect.
This is largely due to the EIB's dual position as, on the one hand, originally a tax-funded public institution and on the other hand, a normal bank which, in the case of the EIF, which also forms part of the group, is also a venture capital fund.
As financial institutions, they are not subject to the normal prudential supervision that is set up for other institutions at national level.
This monitoring at national level was the subject of a report which I supported here yesterday.
I think that this can also play a part in the case of the EIB.
A final point concerns the recommendations tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control and I shall leave Mr SjÃ¶stedt to put the case for these.
I have given almost all of them comprehensive coverage in my report.
Madam President, President Maystadt, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament for having once again taken the initiative of organising a debate on the work of the EIB.
I would congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, on her extremely interesting and comprehensive report which emphasises the EIB's role as the Community's primary long-term financing institution for key sectors of the European Union, the candidate countries and other partner countries.
I would briefly like to consider the following four points: collaboration between the EIB and the Commission, the EIB's work in the partner countries, the EIB's work in the candidate countries, and the Tripartite Agreement between the EIB, the Court of Auditors and the Commission.
The first point: the EIB is a policy driven public bank.
Its task, as President Maystadt himself pointed out, is to contribute to the achievement of the political goals of the European Union in cooperation with the Commission.
In this respect, the Commission warmly welcomes the growing cooperation with the Bank in various priority sectors such as regional development and the environment, and also areas addressed by the 'Innovation 2000 initiative' such as research and development, the audiovisual sector and information technology.
The Commission supports the EIB Group's consolidation of its activities concerning SMEs.
It agrees with the European Parliament's point of view whereby the Bank should adopt the Commission's definition of SMEs.
The Commission acknowledges Parliament's wish to evaluate the impact on SMEs of the 'Multiannual Programme 2001 - 2005 on small and medium-sized enterprises', known as the MAP.
In this respect, the Commission intends to draw up an interim progress report on the MAP in 2003, including its impact on SMEs, as required by the Council decision on the MAP.
Furthermore, again as required by the same decision, the Commission will submit an external assessment report to the Council and Parliament by the end of December 2004.
The second point: the EIB has increased its financing activities in partner countries, working in close cooperation with the Commission.
In this context, the Mediterranean Investment and Partnership Facility, launched in Barcelona last October, will constitute an important initiative to boost economic development in bordering countries in the south.
The Commission has given substantial backing to this initiative, pledging EUR 255 million of the Community budget over the next four years.
Moreover, the EIB, again in conjunction with the Commission, is preparing to implement the new investment fund for ACP countries laid down by the Cotonou Agreement.
As regards the Balkans, the Commission and the Bank are currently looking into the possibility of granting the Bank a mandate to operate in Kosovo.
The third point: with regard to the EIB's work in the candidate countries, the Commission endorses Parliament's view that absolute priority must be given to the Bank's activities in these countries.
We believe that the funding requirements are considerable and that the EIB and the EBRD must work closely together in order to contribute to the growth of the new Member States of the European Union.
With regard to the integration of the candidate countries into the EIB structure, the Commission is pleased to note that the Member States have, at last, reached an agreement on amendments to the Treaty with regard to the governance of the EIB and on its subscribed capital following accession. Once the agreement of the candidate countries has been obtained, this will enable the new Member States to be integrated into the EIB structure immediately after accession.
Lastly, the fourth and final point: a very brief comment on the Tripartite Agreement between the EIB, the Court of Auditors and the Commission.
The Commission feels that the basic principles of the Tripartite Agreement reflect a fair balance between the rights of the Court of Auditors and those of the EIB, and that these principles must not be altered.
As for the Community budget, in accordance with the Tripartite Agreement, the Court has access to a wide range of information about the Bank's operations under mandate and is entitled to additional information whenever it so desires.
The Commission warmly welcomes Parliament's initiative calling on the interested parties to review the agreement, an initiative which will doubtless constitute an opportunity to update a number of technical and administrative aspects in the light of changes which have taken place.
Madam President, I want to say a few words about the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control regarding this report.
My committee and I are grateful for the fact that the rapporteur and the committee responsible have chosen to take on board so many of the views we have presented.
Thank you very much.
The European Investment Bank has for many years been one of the EU's more anonymous powers that be.
At the same time, the EIB has very great influence by virtue of the extensive loans both to the Member States and to the candidate countries.
It would be sensible to have a more comprehensive political debate on the bank's approach and also more comprehensive scrutiny of the bank's activities on the part of the other EU institutions.
The reason for the European Investment Bank's having been a fairly anonymous wielder of power in the EU is no doubt the special status of this body.
It is a bank which, moreover, is basically owned by the Member States, at the same time as being a part of the European Union.
We suggest, partly by means of the following proposals, that it be scrutinised more carefully.
We wish to increase the Court of Auditors' access to information from the European Investment Bank.
In the long run, this access to information should be similar to the access that exists to information from the European Central Bank.
This is something that can be brought about through the tripartite agreement, which is subject to future review.
We should like to see increased cooperation between our committee, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the European Investment Bank.
It should, for example, be possible to welcome the chairman of the bank to our meetings.
We should also like to acquaint ourselves with more documents concerning the European Investment Bank's internal audit.
We should like to see the environmental dimension strengthened through the EIB's incorporating the Ãrhus Convention and the obligations under it into its policy.
We are concerned here with public access to environmental information.
In a year or so, we should also like to see a progress report made on the task taken on in Gothenburg concerning impact on climate change.
Finally, I just want to add that there is a need to evaluate the system of global loans which is at present a little too vaguely defined.
A thorough evaluation needs to be made of the actual impact of the loans.
Madam President, Mr Maystadt, this is the third time that Parliament has been able to give its opinion on the EIB's annual report.
The report by Mrs van de Burg is balanced and consistent, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has therefore adopted it unanimously.
I would nevertheless like to make some observations.
First of all, I should like to comment on the role of the Bank.
The role of the EIB is important.
The Bank is a major investor on the European market and outside, with considerable macro-economic clout.
This macro-economic clout does not require the EIB to have its own macro-economic policy.
The agreement is that the Bank serves the EU's goals.
The Bank deploys its investment funds in order to strengthen the EU's macro-economic policy.
In other words, the Bank's mission does not require it to adopt a pro-active role.
The EIB is to promote economic and social cohesion within the EU by financially supporting the goals which the European Union has in mind.
As a result, the EIB naturally has macro-economic influence, and, indeed a great deal of it, but this influence is not a goal in itself.
I should now like to turn to the plan by the Group of the Party of European Socialists to include in the structure of the EIB a body to define the scope for employment and the effects on employment of EIB projects.
Creating employment is not one of the Bank's tasks as such, but it is sometimes, of course, a side-effect.
The Bank's task to modernise means the effect could also be the complete opposite, intensifying the eternal dilemma between productivity increase through high-grade investments and employment.
Given this dilemma, there is no point in setting up an extensive employment barometer.
In my view, employment is not a goal in itself as far as the Bank is concerned.
In order to avoid unnecessary administrative costs, we have agreed to the simple registration of employment effects - or employment impact assessment, to use a fine phrase - but without any snags.
In other words, employment impact assessment should not take on the scale of the Bank's environmental section.
Sustainable environmental policy is one of the Bank's explicit tasks.
We are thus opposed to a comparison of the employment barometer with the environmental section.
We will try to prevent the comparison between the two, suggested by the word 'similar' in the amendment, by a split vote.
We believe that the EIB funds should be used for investments and not for the system itself if this can at all be helped.
Finally, there is the question of monitoring.
At present, the Bank's outgoings are covered by the EU Member States.
It also generates money itself by issuing bonds.
In our view, the issuing of bonds to pension institutions, as proposed by the rapporteur, is unwise for the time being because there is as yet insufficient transparency within the Bank.
We hope that the amendments we have tabled will prevent the link being made to pensions in the final report.
We expect of the Commission that, after three years of debating the issue of monitoring, it will finally produce proposals on how better monitoring can be arranged and what the Court of Auditors' exact role might be.
I believe in the Dutch saying: 'vertrouwen is goed, maar controle is beter' - trust is good, but control is better.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are currently considering, which I must commend for its quality, clearly emphasises the importance of the European Investment Bank as a crucial instrument for the funding of projects throughout the European Union. It also, however, highlights the decisive role that this bank plays in the economies of the candidate countries for which it proposes, as a matter of fact, to create a special social policy programme.
For this reason, the increase in social capital recently decided on can be considered to be in line and consistent with these structural objectives, which are so important to achieving a global European economy that is prosperous and fully sustainable.
The European Investment Bank is already responsible for more than 5% of all investments made in the Union, which has enabled more than 400 000 jobs to be created, specifically through the support that the bank gives to small and medium-sized enterprises.
It should be remembered that the European Union has recently taken on increased responsibility for the funding of venture capital, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the EIB.
Unfortunately, as the rapporteur also points out, the work of the European Investment Bank is sometimes limited by the orthodox and rigid rules for the consolidation of public finances, which must be complied with under the growth and stability pact.
We must remember that a large part of the EIB's remit is geared towards investments of a structural nature, such as infrastructures or venture capital for small and medium-sized enterprises, and that the success of these investments is often dependent on the possibility of mobilisation in partnership with public spending.
The understanding that has just been reached, therefore, is not indifferent, in the framework of the current budgetary rules, to the flexibility that is crucial to the correct implementation of the growth and stability pact.
Today it is increasingly clear that Europe has an aim which is also an undeniable need: that of becoming a highly competitive area and therefore, of creating wealth and of harmonising its distribution.
This aim can only be achieved, however, through support for structural investments and is, consequently, unfettered by restrictions that could endanger these investments.
The quality of expenditure, whether public or private, must be the guiding framework for investment policy and the European Investment Bank has an irreplaceable role in this framework.
I congratulate the rapporteur on the content of her report and on having been able to interpret these aspirations.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Maystadt, I want to begin by thanking Mrs van den Burg for the sterling work she has done.
There is also cause, I think, for sincerely commending the EIB and Mr Maystadt for the way in which the dialogue between the European Parliament and the EIB has developed in recent years.
From having been, as Mr SjÃ¶stedt pointed out, a fairly closed institution, the bank has since opened itself up to dialogue and the exchange of opinions.
My first coming into contact with the EIB a number of years ago was due to the fact that independent organisations complained about the EIB's lack of transparency and its failure to appreciate the need to contribute significantly to the EU's efforts to devise a policy in favour of a sustainable environment.
Crucial progress has been made within both these important areas.
As we all know, nothing is so good, however, that it cannot be improved, and that applies too to access to information in several languages.
Madam President, the rapporteur's ambition has been further to emphasise the EIB's overarching role in macro-economic and financial terms and in terms of political strategy.
I share that approach in principle, but I would at the same time warn against we in Parliament's expressing too many wishes, legitimate enough in themselves but meaning that we cease to focus upon the EIB's main tasks, namely those of promoting regional development, supporting forward-looking technology, taking account of the environment and concentrating on the candidate countries and what are termed the partner countries.
As you can hear, the EIB now already has more than enough on its plate.
I would emphasise, however, that the EIB's efforts in the Balkan countries, which are part of its remit, deserve increased attention.
Where supervision of the EIB is concerned, we would repeat our proposal that the issues be addressed at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference.
Finally, I should like to ask Mr Maystadt how he views our desire for a panel of experts to be set up, of the type to be found within the World Bank.
I know that there is a certain scepticism within the EIB where the view is that the EIB cannot be compared with the World Bank and that, moreover, the EU has the institution of the Ombudsman.
What does the EIB intend to do to disseminate further knowledge concerning the global loans, that is to say the loans to small enterprises?
Madam President, as permanent rapporteur on loans and guarantees for the Committee on Budgets, I have only positive things to say on the whole about the EIB.
I have, it is true, been astonished at the levels of bureaucracy that exist between the Bank, the Commission and the Council, evident from the financing of environmental protection investment in Russia's Baltic basin.
What happened showed that the Bank is not just a financial institution but also a political playing field.
The environment suffered as a result of the political games played by representatives of the Member States.
The European Union guarantees a large portion of what the EIB lends and its loans in this respect do not carry any risk.
A 3A credit rating keeps the cost of borrowing low in other forms of fund-raising on the part of the Bank.
As the EIB has a good credit rating and the bad debt risk is low, it should adhere to stringent social and environmental criteria when granting loans.
We have to promote aims that work for the common good.
With that purpose in mind, the Bank must listen very attentively to the totally justified opinions of the NGO, Bankwatch Network.
Our group backs the calls for improved monitoring of the Bank.
Madam President, I warmly welcome this report.
My group has submitted a small number of amendments which aim to highlight the importance of greater transparency and environmental commitment in the work of the EIB and also, in particular, to ensure that the EIB applies the highest ethical standards possible in project financing, including withdrawal from any project carried out in breach of national legislation or where corrupt enterprises are involved.
In connection with that last point, I am sure Mr Maystadt is aware of the ongoing court case in Lesotho, where European companies are on trial for allegedly paying bribes to win contracts in the Lesotho Highlands water project, a project part-funded by the EIB.
Since corrupt practices in the award of contracts for development projects represents a major threat to the provision of good governance, would you agree, Mr Maystadt, that it is crucial that the EIB examine its due diligence procedures, with respect not only to the Lesotho project, but also to all future projects, and will you report back to Parliament on its findings?
A brief question to the Commission: will the Commission honour the commitment made several years ago to provide the necessary financial support to the Lesotho Government, so as to enable it to pursue these court cases to their conclusion and thereby guarantee good governance?
Madam President, Commissioner Monti, President Maystadt, please allow me to congratulate the rapporteur on her calls for the EIB to attain higher targets in terms of support provided for the Member States' economies.
This Bank performs a special task: the distribution not of all funds, but only of funds intended to contribute to the achievement of the Union's objectives.
This institutional task has helped to create new wealth and to support entrepreneurial initiatives in the regions of the Union which are most lagging behind.
The Bank's efforts to support certain sectors, such as the environment sector, where EUR 5.9 billion has been allocated to environmental protection projects, are certainly commendable.
The most important aspect for territorial development is still support for SMEs.
In this case, partner banks which also distribute funds need to provide detailed information about the investments.
It has therefore been suggested that a credit ceiling is set in advance for SMEs and that, at the end of the financial year, a report is submitted to the European Parliament on the actual use of the pre-established ceiling and on any reasons or difficulties encountered which caused it not to be used, or only to be used in part.
I certainly support the major undertaking of the EIB in the candidate countries, but objective 1 regions should not be forgotten: even after they no longer have this status, they should be monitored as appropriate and given substantial credit support so that they can conclude their development process - certainly not fully completed - by 2006.
We should pay special attention to the Bank's Statute, which can only be amended in accordance with the procedure for amending and revising the Treaties laid down in Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union.
In particular, Article 5, which provides for 6% to be paid in by the signatory Member States, should be amended.
An increase in this percentage would lead to higher loans and, consequently, greater support for the areas concerned, and greater profitability for the Bank or, alternatively, with the same amount of revenue, a reduction in the applicable rates.
Mr President, I should like firstly to commend the rapporteur, and also Mr SjÃ¶stedt for his opinion on this report.
I have had the satisfaction of working on EIB matters for many years, and I often say that it is more difficult getting into the EIB than into Fort Knox.
It is still a hard fight to obtain greater transparency and supervision where the EIB is concerned.
The bank is still very unwilling to open its accounts and projects up to external supervision.
It is almost impossible for the Court of Auditors to obtain access to documents.
The bank always refers to banking secrecy or to the fact that the money does not come from the EU budget but from its own resources.
In March 1999, the EIB, the Commission and the Court of Auditors signed an agreement concerning the Court of Auditors' being able to supervise the EIB, but I firmly believe that the agreement must be altered so that it gives the Court of Auditors the same right to supervise the EIB as it has to supervise the ECB.
I am extremely pleased, moreover, that Parliament is now making this demand.
Why should the EIB have special status?
That is something I absolutely cannot accept.
I would compare the EIB with the goblins' bank in the Harry Potter books, namely a totally closed institution in which no one must interfere.
Madam President, allow me first of all to tell you how much I appreciate having this opportunity to continue the dialogue with the European Parliament, in particular at a time when this House is opening up to members of parliament from States that are soon to join the European Union.
Two weeks ago in Vienna, speaking before the annual European Investment Bank Forum, President Cox recalled the historical importance of enlargement and emphasised, with particular eloquence, that this move is the essential extension of the work towards peace and stability commenced by the founders of European integration.
For its own, modest, part, the European Investment Bank, which was created by the Treaty of Rome for the purpose of providing financial support for the political objectives of the European Community, is trying to contribute to successful enlargement.
The European Investment Bank, which already has a portfolio of loans of around EUR 18 billion in this region, making it by far the main backer, will, of course, continue to back the necessary investments in the future Member States.
Three areas in particular are targeted: infrastructures, with particular regard to transport, energy and telecommunications; the environment, because tremendous investment is needed in order to achieve compliance with Community standards; and, lastly, direct foreign investment, because it is a particularly powerful tool in bringing conditions in the candidate countries into line with those in the current Member States.
The preparation of the candidate countries for accession is therefore one of five priority axes adopted by the Council of Governors of the EIB last June, when it agreed to a 50% capital increase for the European Investment Bank.
I shall briefly mention the other four priority axes.
First of all, regional development, with a view to devoting 70% of our direct loans and at least 50% of our global loans to projects based in regions eligible for assistance under the Structural Funds.
Then what we call the i2i (Initiative innovation 2000) programme, which was implemented following the Lisbon European Council and which aims to encourage investments that contribute to transforming the European economy into an economy based on knowledge and innovation.
Over EUR 13 billion of loans have already been approved within the context of this initiative.
Another priority axis is environmental protection and improvement, with the objective of devoting between one quarter and one third of our total loans each year to environmental projects.
The fifth and final priority axis is our support for the European development aid policy, in particular with the launch of two new facilities: the Euro-Mediterranean Facility, which was established by the Barcelona European Council, and the new Investment Facility created by the Cotonou agreement between the European Union and the ACP countries.
Having thus briefly summarised the five priority axes for the coming years, I would now like to try to respond to the various speakers. I confirm that I will be available to give fuller, more precise answers at committee meetings.
I would like first of all to respond to your rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, who has put a great deal of effort into preparing this excellent report.
I would like briefly to raise a subject close to her heart: the use of EIB bonds by pension funds.
In the United Kingdom, pension funds have already invested in long-term EIB bonds.
We have not yet had the same success on the euro market, but we are trying to find formulas that might be of greater interest to pension funds and insurance companies.
Employment, which many of you have continued to focus on, clearly constitutes a final objective.
I believe, however, that it would be dangerous to make the number of jobs created directly by a project the deciding factor in the decision on whether to finance the project.
In this regard, I share some of the reservations expressed by Mrs Peijs.
We consider that our project must have a positive impact on the economy, through the innovation-productivity-growth-employment chain, but that it would be dangerous to establish too direct a link between the number of jobs created and the choice of a particular project.
With regard to the financing of SMEs, I would remind you that we finance small and medium-sized enterprises in two ways: on the one hand, through global loans, as half of our global loans go to small enterprises, and, on the other, through the provision of risk capital from the European Investment Fund.
I would say to the Commission, in response to the comment by Commissioner Monti echoing one of the report's recommendations, that, in fact, we plan to adopt the Commission's definition of small and medium-sized enterprises.
We must, however, first solve one problem, which is that of medium-sized enterprises.
The latter are in danger of being considered too large to receive global loans but too small to benefit from direct loans.
When we have found the appropriate method for medium-sized enterprises, we will in effect be able to adopt the Commission's definition.
With regard to the important matter of monitoring the European Investment Bank, I would say that, naturally, we are entirely open to monitoring by the Court of Auditors within the scope of its competence.
Mr Blak, I can assure you that the Court of Auditors has access to all the documents it wishes to obtain within the context of the tripartite agreement concluded between the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank.
This agreement operates to the satisfaction of all three parties.
The President of the Court of Auditors confirmed this to me and you have just heard Commissioner Monti say that the Commission, too, is satisfied with this agreement, which will be renegotiated and renewed.
In this regard, there is therefore no problem.
The Court of Auditors has the power to monitor the use of Community funds and, insofar as the EIB uses Community funds, the Court of Auditors must clearly be fully able to exercise its monitoring powers.
There is also, however, the sector of EIB activities which have nothing to do with Community funds and are financed by our earnings from financial markets all over the world.
These activities, naturally, also need monitoring.
Moreover, it is in our interests to be monitored effectively, and we are already monitored by a verification committee and external auditors who report directly to the governors.
That said, I think it would be desirable to find a form of supervision that is appropriate for a bank.
I have already said this before the House, and I confirm it today.
We are entirely open to the idea, and even keen to be subject to a form of banking supervision.
Furthermore, that is why we are following with great interest the discussions taking place on the possible creation of a European banking supervisor.
Mrs Lucas raised some interesting points, but I have already exceeded my speaking time.
I will be able to give her more information in committee, in particular with regard to the Lesotho project she mentioned.
I can simply confirm that, as soon as we became aware of signs of possible fraud, we ordered a detailed audit and communicated the information assembled during this audit to both Olaf, the monitoring body with which you are familiar, and to the Lesotho legal institutions.
We did not uncover any fraud with regard to the use of EIB funds, but our enquiry at that time enabled us to discover other factors which we communicated to the competent authorities.
I shall be able to say more about this in committee.
Madam President, I hope that the House has found my response informative and that it has given you an idea of the way in which we and all the Bank's staff view our responsibilities and intend to put them into practice over the coming years, in close cooperation with the Commission and maintaining dialogue with Parliament.
Mr President, thank you for coming here today and for the information you have kindly shared with us.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
report (A5-0352/2002) by Mr Lipietz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission's XXXIst Report on Competition Policy 2001 [SEC(2002)0462 - C5-0282/2002 - 2002/2142(COS)]
report (A5-0353/2002) by Mr Herzog, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 2001 scoreboard for state aid (spring 2002 update) [2001/2196(INI)].
Madam President, in the short time available, there being two reports to be discussed, I will try to consider a number of different issues.
First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Herzog and Mr Lipietz, for their excellent reports.
Once again, they both reflect Parliament's overall support for European competition policy, support which is so important for the Commission and its departments.
Allow me to set out the main features of our competition policy in the state aid sector.
The Commission has continued its efforts in this sector in order to simplify, modernise and clarify the rules and practices.
New regulations and Community guidelines have been drawn up. For example, at the start of this year, new multisectoral regulations were adopted setting out a much clearer body of rules for the assessment of regional state aid for major investment projects.
Another important example is the use of block exemptions, which allow Member States to grant aid without the need for prior notification.
Block exemptions for small- and medium-sized enterprises and for training have been adopted and, recently, an exemption for state aid for employment too.
With regard to the reduction and adjustment of state aid, the Member States undertook to reduce the level of aid in the Conclusions of the Stockholm and Barcelona European Councils.
In effect, we have seen a clear downward trend, but undeniably, the cumulative effect of aid totalling EUR 82 billion is continuing to substantially distort competition in the Union.
I will now, if I may, respond to some of the points raised in Mr Herzog's report.
I firmly believe that the best way to promote overall Community industrial competitiveness is precisely to maintain a firm policy on state aid. state aid policy is criticised at times, in that it is said to be at variance with measures seeking to attain certain Community objectives.
In my view, this variance is, in the majority of cases, more imagined than real.
The aim of state aid control is to ensure that the positive effects of one particular measure are not counteracted by the distortion in competition which the measure itself creates.
I also endorse the view, expounded in the report, that we need to focus more on assessing the effectiveness and efficacy of aid.
This is one aspect of the aid policy for which the Member States are chiefly responsible.
They must develop ways to assess aid schemes, whereas the Commission, for its part, intends to help this process by providing a forum where experiences can be shared.
As regards competition law, our activities have been characterised by our debate on the Commission proposal to update its procedural rules.
Work being carried out by the Council regarding the Commission proposal - a proposal fully supported by Parliament, which once again, I would thank - is now nearing completion.
It is expected that the Council will agree on the text of a new regulation next week.
I am sure that we will also see considerable improvements in our procedures with regard to the aspect which Parliament emphasised most in its resolution, that is the fact that European competition rules should be applied in all cases where trade between Member States could be affected.
Updating Regulation 17, ladies and gentlemen, is an example of the permanent culture of reform which the Commission is seeking to encourage within the institution and which - as we shall soon see - also applies to mergers.
I would like to point out, moreover, that as regards updating competition rules, it was the Commission, three years ago, which took the initiative.
You will also recall that it was not all that easy, at the start, to persuade the Member States that it would be in the interest of better European governance to have more decentralisation in this respect.
As regards mergers, the number and complexity of cases which reach second phase investigations has increased rapidly.
In 2001, the Commission issued five prohibition decisions.
Even though this is the highest number of prohibition decisions issued in a single year, this figure continues to represent only around 1.5% of all final decisions.
In this connection, it probably will not have escaped your attention that, in October, the Court of First Instance overturned two of these prohibition decisions, in the Schneider/Legrand and Tetra Laval/Sidel cases, and there was also the judgment in the Airtours/First Choice case, already referred to in your report.
A detailed discussion on the consequences of these judgments for the Commission's work would take more time than we have today.
I would, however, like to make a few comments.
We are carefully considering the judgments, both in order to decide whether to appeal to the Court of Justice, and in order to take appropriate action for the future.
Nevertheless, we should not allow these specific, individual cases to distort our view of the Community merger control policy.
As you know, we initiated a vast reform of merger control procedures a long time before these recent rulings.
If necessary, it may be appropriate to take advantage of the lessons we have learnt from these judgments in order to put into effect an even more radical reform than that originally planned: this is precisely my intention, as I have already said.
Regardless of whether or not we appeal to the Court of Justice, it is right and proper that the Commission learns as many lessons as possible from certain assessments which have been made and, accordingly, the reform will be even more far-reaching and sweeping.
I am, however, keen to specify, quite clearly, that the improvements which we expect to see in the instrument will in no way mean a more lenient policy.
We believe that merger control policy - just like competition policy in general - must be fair but, at the same time, strict.
I intend to propose to the College a sweeping reform of the merger control system by the end of December, and I would like to briefly highlight some of its aspects now.
The first point concerns the length of investigations.
A major advantage of the European system is the short investigation times, as is widely acknowledged.
Nevertheless, these short time frames also create some drawbacks which translate, as it were, into a certain tension, at times quite charged, in the final dealings between the parties and the Commission.
Therefore, we will not relinquish the benefits derived from these short investigations - which exist in Europe but not in the United States - but we will also propose the introduction of a certain amount of flexibility through a series of provisions to extend certain deadlines.
The other improvements to the decision-making process which I plan to propose include: the formalisation and extension of the existing system of cross-checks in all cases which reach second phase investigations; greater transparency, allowing access to the dossier and dialogue between opposing market views at an earlier stage than is currently the case; more human resources in the Competition Directorate-General, both in order to work in a more appropriate fashion with regard to the high standards set by the Court and to improve our economic analysis capabilities.
I would also like to touch briefly on judicial control in the event of company mergers, which I am aware is of great interest to the European Parliament in general and to Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen in particular.
Recent judgments have shown that the European courts exert strict, meticulous control over the Commission's analyses in merger cases.
Judicial control, which exists and is strict, should not, however, only be effective in terms of thoroughness, but also in terms of speed.
In this respect, there is still substantial room for improvement, in terms of the speed with which judgments are issued.
A fast track system has already been introduced, and we sincerely hope that the Court of First Instance will be able to deal more swiftly with and increase the number of fast track cases.
The Commission is willing - as we have already stated - firmly to support the granting of further resources which the Court will certainly need to implement these improvements.
Furthermore, it may be helpful to consider whether it would be appropriate to have judicial panels of experts handling certain categories of cases at first instance or a unit specialised in mergers at the Court of First Instance.
Whatever kind of reform is considered in order to achieve a successful system, it is, in any case, important not to lose sight of the many merits of our administrative system.
I must say that, following the publication of the Commission Green Paper, there were very few calls to abandon or make radical changes to the current system.
If forced to choose between our system and the US system, many businesses - several of which are American - have indicated a preference for the European Union's system during consultations.
Moreover, as you know, systems grounded on administrative decisions in this field are certainly not exclusive to the Commission.
Indeed, this is the model used at national level, in the majority of Member States, and it reflects European legal traditions.
My proposals will therefore significantly improve the current system: in some fundamental aspects, they will completely transform the present system.
My ambition is that what we propose will be the most modern and effective merger control system, and it will improve the European model by incorporating certain aspects of the US model.
As time is short, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not expand on other important points addressed in the two reports by Mr Lipietz and Mr Herzog.
In particular, I am unable to consider one point which I know, however, to be of great interest to the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath, and that is international cooperation, an area in which considerable progress has been made over the last year.
Madam President, Commissioner, please excuse the absence of my colleague Mr Lipietz, who has had to stay in Paris this week because a loved one is very ill.
Our committee was not, in actual fact, unanimous on the report I am about to present to you on his behalf, in contrast with its unanimity on the report on the European Investment Bank.
That is why around 40 amendments, including, moreover, a dozen or so tabled by my own group, have been tabled for discussion in plenary.
Despite the differences of opinion that are quite traditional within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on this type of report, I shall emphasise the points on which we agree, first of all highlighting our warm support for the work carried out by Commissioner Monti and his staff.
Everyone in our committee is in favour of a well-organised European competition policy and the Commission's report for 2001 bears witness to the efforts that you and your staff have made.
International action, to which you have just referred, does not present any more of a problem.
We are in favour of establishing global rules.
The report therefore emphasises the need to strengthen international cooperation in the field of competition.
The majority, if not all of our colleagues are opposed to renationalising competition policy, and this is a strong political message.
You have just referred to the recent judgments of the European Court of Justice.
Paragraphs 4 and 5 of our report clearly state: 'the European Parliament does not consider the recent judgment of the Court of Justice (?) as disqualifying the work of the Commission'.
The issue we should be raising instead is the reorganisation of the Court of Justice.
You mentioned various alternatives.
The report describes the creation of a new legal chamber.
I do not know what your opinion is on the problem of state aid, which is the subject of the report by Mr Herzog.
If I understand correctly, next year we shall have a single report on competition policy and state aid policy.
I am delighted to hear it.
Another point of agreement of great political importance concerns the fact that state aid should, as laid down by the Treaty, focus on horizontal objectives.
In committee, the disagreements tended to concern the way in which the objectives were defined and implemented.
We have already discussed this with you at length.
A great deal of progress remains to be made.
I have just learnt of the conclusions of the Competition Council in this regard.
We must work towards making the various actions of the Commission compatible and coherent with European policies.
In this context, the opportunity for recourse to state aid in order to achieve these horizontal objectives should be reiterated.
There is one last point of agreement between Members: we need to strengthen the legislative role of the European Parliament in all aspects of competition policy.
The report specifically calls - this work is naturally the responsibility of the Commission - for Parliament to have the right of codecision with regard to legislative procedures concerning competition.
Two points have caused a great deal of controversy and a number of amendments concerning them have been tabled in plenary.
The first concerns our stance with regard to the candidate countries.
There is a consensus within the committee that competition rules should be considered to apply without discrimination to all the Member States.
The effective implementation of competition policy, however, has led to debate.
Although we must be strict in combating corruption - and the Commission's reports emphasise how serious these problems still are in many of the candidate countries - some of us would like to see a degree of flexibility in the assessment of this state aid, along the lines of the attitude of the European Union during German reunification, when it seems that we adopted a particular attitude towards the new, reunified LÃ€nder.
The last point of agreement between committee members is their favourable view of the liberalisation of several economic sectors.
Some consider that the processes underway are generally balanced and satisfactory, while others believe that these liberalisation processes do not comply with all the objectives of the European Union.
Madam President, in order to avoid having to speak again, I would like very briefly, on behalf of my group, to highlight the importance we give to a number of amendments we have tabled on our assessment of the examination of state aid in the candidate countries.
Then there are our Amendments Nos 19 and 22 on services of general interest, both at international level - WTO negotiations - and national level.
Lastly, Commissioner, I would like to hear from you.
As you know, the Convention has already received a number of contributions on the subject of services of general interest.
Others will follow and I believe it would be appropriate politically for the Commission, also, to communicate to the Convention a contribution on the way in which it envisages the relationship between competition policy and services of general interest.
Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues who have supported me and in particular those who share the view of this report, which I believe to be balanced and concerned with real situations.
I note that the amendments tabled by Mr Evans and Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen ruin that balance and in fact condemn any state aid in market activities.
I therefore hope that these amendments will not be retained and that the balance achieved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be preserved in plenary.
I worked together with the Directorate General for Competition, which very carefully manages state aid policy, and I am very pleased with how the dialogue progressed.
Like any competition policy, the policy on state aid is facing new challenges.
Its prime objective remains to reduce all aid that distorts or could distort competition, but other objectives should also be taken into consideration: competitiveness and growth - the Lisbon objectives - and social cohesion, which involves support for struggling regions to catch up and develop.
This is why the Stockholm and Lisbon European Councils made the commitment not to reduce all aid, but aid in the sense of Article 87, in other words aid that creates unfair competition.
They particularly advocate redeploying aid towards the horizontal objectives.
All of these Council decisions must be implemented firmly, but with discernment.
I stress in my report that the effectiveness of horizontal aid must be evaluated.
For example, the legitimacy of aid for research, the environment, training and employment is clear, and increases in this aid are often desired.
However, it is not always effective in terms of the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, and we should therefore move forward with our recommendations.
It would be dangerous to ban any notion of sectoral aid, however.
This aid could prove to be essential for strategic projects on which Europe is falling behind and the market is declining, but also for dealing with unfair competition on the global market, or to save production operations that are faced with very serious economic shocks.
We are aware that the Commission has also itself opened the debate on the interaction of competition and industrial policy.
The enlargement of the Union to the Central and Eastern European countries also poses difficult problems which must be dealt with fairly.
If the private sector will not fund the modernisation of the steel industry in Poland and the Czech Republic, in a global context of excess capacity, should we nevertheless ask those countries to give up developing that sector?
A re-examination of steel aid is essential.
In the same way, while it is legitimate to aim to eliminate special tax arrangements and convert them into regional aid, it should not be forgotten that countries such as Ireland benefited a great deal from them until recently and that as the economic level of the Eastern regions concerned is particularly low, it will not be possible to create viable companies straight away.
Regarding services of general interest, a perspective of progress is emerging.
The Council and the Commission are re-assessing their interest for the Community.
In accordance with the wishes of Parliament, the Court of Justice recognises that financial compensation, in return for the obligations imposed, is not aid.
We therefore want the Commission to speed up its discussions on this basis and to propose new tools soon in order to ensure free choice, resources for services of general interest, and competition, as well as to safeguard non profit-making activities.
Finally, we ask it to speed up the work on considering tax systems, described by the Primarolo group as encouraging unfair competition, in terms of state aid that should be eliminated.
Ladies and gentlemen, the scoreboard is a step forward in achieving transparency and in the public debate, and we welcome this.
However, the Commission is aware of the limits that we have highlighted.
The comparability of data between Member States is not guaranteed, the effectiveness of aid has not been evaluated and a comparison between the Union and its major world competitors has not yet been provided.
These are also areas to work on in the future, and in view of which, it would be desirable to increase the involvement of civil society.
Allow me to add a few words on competition policy as a whole.
Competition is essential for the viability and efficiency of the internal market.
However, the European Union has a great deal of progress to make in terms of industrial and technological development.
We should not move backwards in terms of competition policy, but we need to bring industrial and competition policies to the same level in the treaties and in practice, otherwise the Union will fall behind in terms of innovation, scale effects, networks and creation of companies.
Experts already believe that its potential for growth in terms of production and productivity has slowed down, while we wish to speed it up.
The process of mergers is only one aspect of the problem.
We are aware that the general centralisation of powers within the DG poses a problem, but we do not want to swing towards the American model.
In the reform under preparation, we would prefer a much more open, deliberative instruction procedure, which allows for reasonable timescales, while the decision would still be the responsibility of the Commission.
Mr President, thanks are due to the Commissioner for the competition report, but congratulations also go to both rapporteurs for presenting us with their analysis of the issue.
The competition report is based solely on the accountability of the Commission.
This means that our comments carry about as much weight in the Commission as Economic and Social Committee opinions, and no more; we must be clear about this.
This is not to say, however, that the Commission, which has been given considerable competence here, wishes to restrict its rights in the field of competition.
Allow me to make a number of critical comments about the further development of competition policy per se.
Progressive globalisation, the fact that the European economy is characterised by mergers, and an ever tougher competition policy have consequences for the situation on the ground in that they bring changes for the labour market.
This does not mean that I wish to bring this process to a halt; I want to put to you the view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which is that the employment guidelines are no longer sufficient on their own to compensate for the labour market problems arising from increased competitive pressure combined with today's weak growth.
I know that we should not, indeed we must not, pin excessive blame for current problems on competition policy; I am clear about that.
But what I wish to say is that the possible extension of competition rules to services of general interest would appear to me to be problematic.
It is not for the Commission to define these on its own; it must be done by politicians in general.
Competition policy is undoubtedly of value in itself, but must be reconciled with socially important areas of general interest, and this is even more important as the European Union prepares for enlargement.
I hope that you will have sympathy for this view, Commissioner.
Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I should like to make a few comments, which are mainly procedural in nature.
We welcome the abolition of the notification requirement for competition agreements.
I think this is a positive development that will reduce the administrative burden on companies and the authorities.
We would, however, urge the Commission to fulfil a justified desire on the part of companies to obtain more legal certainty, particularly in complex matters.
We would ask the Commission to investigate whether it would be possible at all in exceptional cases, involving large investments, to make general statements about the compatibility of agreements with European competition rules, as is common in America with the Business Review Letter.
The modernisation of competition policy can only succeed if the competition rules are applied in a uniform and consistent manner across the EU.
What we need is a European appeal option against decisions taken by national competition authorities.
We would ask the Commission to take the necessary steps in this direction.
As Mrs Peijs said a moment ago: trust is good, but control is better in cases like these.
Thirdly, the network of national competition authorities requires a clear and transparent statute.
At the moment, it is still unclear how cooperation goes on, and there is no real statute for it.
Such a statute should clearly set out how the Commission and national competition authorities should relate to each other and how mutual cooperation takes place, particularly, for example, in the exchange of confidential information.
I think that very sound and clear agreements are needed in this respect and I also believe that the candidate countries should be involved in this.
Finally, we take the view that it would benefit the democratic legitimacy of economic competition legislation if Parliament, too, were to be given codecision rights in this area.
Mr President, the control of state aids is one of the three pillars of competition policy.
Many of these aids concern industry, the energy sector, the transport sector or agriculture, which is why the Committee on Industry has issued an opinion on the Herzog report.
In this opinion, which was adopted by a large majority, we firstly welcomed the State Aid Scoreboard, which provides greater transparency and openness and gives a clearer overview of the situation.
Secondly, in conjunction with this, we adopted a series of demands in the Committee on Industry, which are addressed to the Commission.
Firstly, we welcome the objective of continuously reducing overall aid allocations.
Secondly, we say that future scoreboards should include subsidies in the accession countries.
Our third demand - and this is an old request - is for the thresholds applied to the 'de minimis' rule to be raised.
In the future we want the smaller cases to be exempted so that local decision-makers have more room for manoeuvre.
In addition, we want the special tax arrangements to be subjected to more intensive scrutiny and to be included in this Scoreboard.
Finally, in particular where services of general interest are concerned - other Members have already commented on this - we want the Commission to at last get round to doing its job, as it has been saying it will for so long.
We know that a Green Paper on the provision of services of general interest is currently being prepared.
We hope, Commissioner, that this Green Paper, which is of course being drafted primarily under the authority of the Commission President, will encompass all aspects of services of general interest.
We do not think that in general these services should be exempt from the competition rules, as has just been said, but that where the picture is unclear, clarity can be achieved.
Our final point in the Committee on Industry is a long-standing demand on the part of Parliament.
It concerns the regulations on which you have just reported, Commissioner, and which will entail an update of Regulation No 17.
We want these regulations - including the forthcoming rules on services of general interest - to be classified as internal market legislation and to be subject to the codecision procedure.
I know that this is not in your interests, but it is in ours.
Nevertheless, we hope for your understanding on at least some of these points.
Mr President, I am speaking today on behalf of Mr Evans, who is the shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group.
He very much regrets that he cannot be here today.
We have presented some amendments to these reports, with the general aim that they should provide more encouragement for free trade.
In the last few years, the European Union has rightly focused on the need for greater competition and consumer choice and has often used its powers to great and beneficial effect.
Increased free trade and the reduction of unfair subsidies have been a most positive result.
Just as policies of this kind produced handsome rewards for businesses and consumers when my country, under a Conservative government, rediscovered and pioneered these practices in the 1980s, they are now doing the same in the rest of the European Union.
Encouraging greater competition is an enormous task.
For the first three decades after the Second World War, state aid and protectionism were less controversial.
It is still difficult to combat these traditional ideas and entrenched interests, especially in a climate where the opponents of free trade often have the catchier slogans.
We are most fortunate that we have, in Commissioner Monti, someone who is convinced that the opening of markets and the freeing of trade is in everyone's interest.
We are most grateful to him for his persistent and hard work in combating anything, be it cartels or subsidies, that impedes the operation of a fair market.
The report by Mr Herzog concerns the newly-introduced scoreboard for state aid.
This is a most useful tool.
We fully support its introduction and are anxious that it should be used enthusiastically.
It is most encouraging to note that it points to a decline in state aid, although we would like to see a further decrease.
The disparities between countries show that some Member States provide up to three times as much state aid as others.
It is our hope that the scoreboard will serve as an encouragement to Member States to continue and accelerate their reforms and that the scoreboard will also assist the reforms of the new Member States after their accession in 2004.
Mr Lipietz's report focuses on general competition policy and we are pleased to see that it reflects many of our concerns.
In particular, the report highlights the lack of progress in the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets and urges action in the opening up of European markets in energy, transport and postal services.
The report rightly congratulates Commissioner Monti and his staff on their approach.
We in this Parliament should urge him further along the path he has chosen to take.
I would like to conclude by commending the continuation of the European Union's policies in these areas to Parliament.
I hope Parliament will support our amendments and I look forward to even greater progress in the years to come.
Mr President, the debate on the Annual Report on Competition Policy ought to be the most important debate on this subject to take place in the House each year. This is not always the case however.
The explanation can be found in the nature of Parliament and its Rules of Procedure. They do not lend themselves to discussion of long-term issues.
After all, this is a political chamber, not an academic body or a group of experts. To take an example, here we are at the end of 2002 debating the content of a Commission report relating to 2001.
Many significant events have taken place since then.
Given these constraints, any report by Parliament is unlikely to be a suitable document and provide an overview of the present state of the debate on European competition policy. I do not of course wish to imply any criticism of Mr Lipietz.
He has done good work.
What happens is that interplay between political majorities and minorities, a feature of chambers like ours, means that a whole range of elements tend to be added to resolutions such as the one before us today. Often these elements have little direct bearing on the main issue, which on this occasion is competition policy.
Clearly, this is nothing new.
I am sure Mr Lipietz would agree with me. When he appeared before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs he regretted the introduction of many of the additional sections and the rejection of other potential ones.
I am therefore bound to agree with the rapporteur. I believe that if the report were approved as it now stands, it would not prove to be a document offering useful insights or significant contributions to the current debate on competition, despite the rapporteur's good work.
Further to Commissioner Monti's statement today, you should all agree on these shortcomings. In Mr Monti's view, there are several serious problems in the area of competition at present.
These relate to modernisation, to reform of Regulation 17 dating from 1962, which we trust will be undertaken as a matter of urgency, and to the various difficulties arising from repeated jurisprudence on mergers at the Court of First Instance. I refer to the three rulings.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European competition policy and the Commission's work in this field have been vital to the creation of the single market.
Thanks to the introduction of the euro, it has become obvious that price differences between the Member States still exist.
Allow me to suggest that we should today be considering whether competition policy needs to be strengthened, institutionally or in some other way, so as to overcome the last remaining barriers between us and the single market.
These, then, are some of the problems we should be tackling.
It is unfortunate that we have failed to do so in the course of this debate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Monti, on the subject of the report concerning the scoreboard, I wish, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to say that we are not satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the committee and have therefore, together with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, tabled a number of amendments.
On condition that these amendments are adopted, we shall vote in favour of the report.
I would also thank the Commission for the work done on the scoreboard, which is a very useful tool for achieving the objective of a general reduction in state aid.
I welcome the report on the Commission's 31st report on competition policy.
I am especially pleased with the support given by the committee to my proposal that consideration should be given to setting up a competition court, Article 225 A of the Treaty of Nice having paved the way for such a possibility.
A competition court would increase the legal protection of European enterprises.
A competition court would have to operate as a counterweight to, and supervisor of, the Commission's experts on issues relating to competition policy.
It would ensure that the Commission was no longer viewed as the body that both investigates and judges enterprises. It would make for greater transparency of the enterprises concerned.
I absolutely do not want to see a weakening of competition policy in general.
On the contrary. Nor do I want to see the Competition Directorate-General's role in competition policy weakened.
I want to support Commissioner Monti and all the other forces for good in their view that, in the future too, competition policy should remain precisely that, with no interference from other policy areas, such as industrial policy.
I am delighted that Mr Monti is well disposed towards a European competition court.
I would also take the liberty of looking forward and commenting on the Commission's motion for a resolution for reforming EU competition law.
Throughout the reform process, the ELDR Group has supported the Commission in stating that reform is necessary.
At the same time, we have maintained that this must not lead to a renationalisation of competition policy.
The Commission has assured us that this will not happen and has referred to a network's being set up, consisting of the Competition Directorate-General and the national competition authorities.
I am confident that this network would be effective.
At the same time, I would, however, put forward a proposal that I hope the Commission will consider.
It is about creating a special unit or task force in the Competition Directorate-General whose task it will be to ensure, and monitor the fact, that the competition rules are applied equally in all the Member States.
This is a large and important task that will become still greater with the forthcoming enlargement.
I shall go into this in more detail in a letter to the Commissioner.
Mr President, Commissioner, now that the internal market is complete, our regions are obviously operating in a more competitive environment.
That is why it is necessary constantly to improve European rules in this field.
Since, however, the European Union does not exist in isolation from world trade, a competition system is also needed in the WTO context.
If we are to take seriously the task that we set ourselves at the Gothenburg Summit, following on from the Lisbon Summit, then competition policy must not only be limited to economic conditions, but must also take into account social and environmental factors.
An economy cannot be competitive if it does not have a highly skilled workforce at its disposal, if wages and salaries are so low that competition does not bolster domestic demand but chokes it, and if manufactured products carry no guarantee that they are not harmful to public health.
That is why we need a change of thinking here, to transform the internal battle for subsidised locational advantages into a debate about how we can make the way people live more sustainable.
Competition policy must champion the concept of equal opportunities.
It will not, however, be possible to achieve equality of opportunity if technical standards are insufficiently harmonised, if Member States' tax policies differ so greatly that it is impossible to compare the actual cost burdens, and if social standards in the Member States diverge widely.
I do not oppose state aid; I support it, provided that these aids have a binding legal basis that is the same for everybody and provided that they do not help to perpetuate the use of old, environmentally damaging techniques and technologies but instead promote investment for the future.
In short - and this brings me back to where I started - competition policy is about creating an equilateral triangle around economic policy, social policy and the environment.
Mr President, the report by our colleague Mr Herzog is excellent, and the amendments tabled by our group only add to it.
However, the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party really destroy it, in that they delete at least ten articles and paragraphs from it.
I am therefore surprised, as in a way it is the whole human aspect of this report that is deleted by those amendments.
You are aware that the Treaty establishes that aid provided by Germany to regions of East Germany is in line with the single market.
Our colleague quite rightly states that this aid could be allocated to regions of the candidate countries.
But there is just deletion and more deletion, and given the extent to which the PPE-DE declared its support for the social market economy in Estoril, I must admit that I do not understand.
Mr President, in sport, an opponent is needed in order to win.
Football is such a sport, which can only exist by virtue of there being an opponent present.
In a fair game, an opponent should have the same means available as the other party.
This is, after all, about fair competition in which a battle can be fought for first place, but also for honour.
In professional football we have noticed, in the Netherlands for example, how a Commission measure on state aid triggers reactions.
For example, I gleaned from a Dutch newspaper this week that our Socialist fellow MEP, Mr Max van den Berg, would like to exempt professional football clubs from European rules on state aid.
However, in my view, this reaction overshoots the commercial goals pursued by professional clubs.
Unlike Mr van den Berg, I would therefore express my support for the measures which the European Commission has taken to reverse, if possible, the aid granted to professional football.
In my opinion, the granting of state aid is, and continues to be, a measure which is explicitly temporary in nature.
If aid is granted for a longer period of time, then competitiveness becomes distorted.
An aid-based relationship of dependence between industry and government is an interference in the functioning of the market.
I would also at the same time acknowledge the positive effect state aid has.
After all, if thanks to a temporary measure, socially useful goals are achieved, temporary aid is quite justified.
This is to give companies an incentive to achieve such goals.
I should at this point like to draw your attention to the importance of granting aid in order to implement environmental legislation.
It is a fact that industry is hit by high costs as a result of a plethora of new measures.
If, as a result of environmental measures, Europe's competitiveness were to suffer compared to non-EU countries, I would deem it justified for costs to be borne by society to a limited extent and subject to clear conditions.
With regard to the accession of the candidate countries, a new chapter should be added to competition policy and the question of state aid.
A number of candidate countries provide foreign investors with favourable fiscal conditions.
This is with a view to protecting local employment.
Paragraphs 17 and 18 of Mr Herzog's report expressly refer to the issue of aid to the steel industry in different accession countries.
In this connection, I am of the view that Amendment No 16 concerns a change that leaves no room for doubt.
I would call for the unambiguous and fair treatment of the candidate countries with regard to state aid and competition.
I therefore endorse Amendments Nos 20 and 21 to the Lipietz report which clearly state that the accession countries are faced with problems that are different from those of the current Member States.
However understandable state aid is from the standpoint of the candidate countries, this is, and always will be, a form of state aid that does not fit within the rules on state aid and competition.
A clearly defined exemption position gives the new Member States the scope to improve healthy economic relations.
I should like to conclude with a question to Commissioner Monti.
Over the past couple of years, it has become clear that the accession countries have an economic structure that is different from that of the EU Member States.
This structure and mentality change less quickly than we would like them to, so the accession countries require an approach customised to the needs of each of them.
Application of the rules in full is a measure that does not do any justice to the development of a social market economy in the accession countries.
How do you propose to find a fair solution to the problem of state aid in the accession countries?
Mr President, the Treaty establishing the European Community does not prohibit dominant positions, only the abuse of them.
It does not establish a system of prior approval for mergers.
Therefore the creation of a dominant position following a merger does not have to be negotiated in advance with the Commission and such a dominant position is not in itself contrary to the Treaty.
Once again the Commission, in order to maintain its importance, has taken on powers that it does not have, inventing entirely arbitrary, or worse, ridiculous criteria to serve its cause. An example of this is when it analyses market shares country by country and product by product, while taking advantage of the frivolity or even absence of the French authorities when it comes to safeguarding French industrial interests.
Meanwhile, while the Treaty establishing the European Community in no way forbids the development of state companies, the Commission in Brussels hounds French public companies as symbols, which in its eyes are intolerable, of triumphant Colbert-style state intervention.
In this respect, any attempt at forcing the French Government to privatise public sector companies will provoke a vigorous response from all employees or, and why not, a general strike across all sectors of industry.
It is not only the services of the Directorate General for Competition that need to be reformed, but also Commissioner Monti, who knows nothing about industry, who should be disowned, and the Commission in Brussels needs to be put back in its place.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you can see we have before us a whole host of topical matters and decisions related to competition policy.
Given the short time available to me, I will have to confine myself to state aid policy and therefore to Mr Herzog's report, which we Social-Democrats fully support.
Allow me first to make a comment, Commissioner: do not be too disconcerted by what the previous speaker has just said.
This really is far removed from what the vast majority of Members of this Parliament thinks.
I believe that the vote on the two reports later on will also show that we do not agree with what has just been said.
As I have already mentioned, we endorse this report by Mr Herzog on state aid, which supports the strict policy of state aid control that is implemented by the Commission on the basis of the treaties.
It is a balanced report, which points out that state aid policy also has to meet other EU objectives, in particular competitiveness, growth and employment, and this in accordance with the Lisbon strategy.
That is why I am very pleased, Commissioner, that you also mentioned this principle explicitly in your introductory remarks and expressed your support for it.
It is good that there has again been a decline in state aid.
This is the result of the Commission's tough aid control policy.
Because not only do these aids carry a risk of distorting the market, but also aid must of course, in each instance, first be obtained from elsewhere and may then be lacking in another area.
Neither can they be rejected wholesale, however.
Instead qualitative criteria must be used to assess each grant of aid to ascertain whether the objective sought might not justify distortions to the market, which may be limited in time, or whether these measures might even eliminate existing distortions to the market in the medium term.
In this context, Commissioner, I should like to recall two points, in connection with which I asked questions and made requests during a debate on the same subject all of a year ago.
It is true that the most competitive region, which is of course what we want to be, has to distinguish itself by having competitive companies.
This means that the companies should manage as far as possible without aids and that any aids have to be directed at increasing the competitiveness of these companies.
In the process, however, it is not only the individual company that needs to be assessed; the entire net product chain of which the company is part needs to be taken into account.
If you wish to apply qualitative criteria it is not enough to focus solely on one single company.
My second point concerns a request that I wish to make in the field of regional policy.
Today we are already discussing how regional policy will actually work after 2006.
Much will change for the present EU of 15, for the old Member States, and it is right that it should.
But in this context we really do need to consider how we are going to rebalance regional aids across the Member States.
We need to discuss this and we need to do it in good time.
We might conclude that everything can stay the same, but we might also conclude that we need a new mechanism of some kind.
Do not make us wait until the end; let us start this discussion now!
Mr President, solely in terms of free competition and the free market, any aid, whether it is state aid, European aid or local aid, disrupts competition.
Incidentally, I believe and would like to say that this influence on competition is positive when it enables land to be developed, the provision of efficient public services, a reduction in inequality, better social management, consideration of the long term and more research and development.
By approving the approach of Mr Herzog, whom I would like to congratulate and whom I support, I therefore confirm that state aid is necessary and justified, as he says, on at least two conditions: on the one hand that it clearly and solely fulfils the objectives set in terms of amounts and duration, and on the other hand that it is transparent and that its results are monitored and evaluated.
Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with what Mr Monti said in a recent interview, namely that the considerable gap between growth and unemployment rates, which puts Europe at a disadvantage compared with the United States, is caused to a large extent by economic structures in this continent which continue to be much less open to competition.
In my view, a competitive economy open to competition would bring tangible social benefits in the European countries.
The Commissioner thus concluded that we need an even more vigorous competition policy than that in the United States, and we should give him credit for having pursued it, even accepting the risk of making mistakes or in any case, making judgments different from those made by judicial bodies called upon in some cases to decide.
With regard to state aid, in particular, Europe is set to face an extremely important challenge over the next few years in the current negative economic climate.
Efforts to recover state aid are being made alongside protectionism and state intervention in the economy: a perilous path to take.
The Treaties wisely set strict limits on state aid and these limits must be preserved and confirmed, not least where governments seek to misuse or liberally distribute state aid, something they will increasingly seek to do.
There are other unresolved issues: former state monopolists - starting with EDF, Enel, France TÃ©lÃ©com, Deutsche Telekom - state aid for broadcasting, state aid in the event of structural adjustments and, in this context, also state aid disguised as something else.
Mr President, I will close by saying that the Italian Radical Members will vote for the Riis-JÃžrgensen and Evans amendments, which will make the Herzog report more balanced.
Mr President, European competition policy is one of the European Union's central policy instruments and that is why I would very much welcome it if the Commission were to stand alongside Parliament and also include this sector in the codecision procedure.
I really do think it is important for us to make competition policy more democratic and invest it with greater legitimacy than it has had so far, because after all the decisions that the European Union makes on the internal market, the market economy and competition are justified by the fact that competition has a distributive function and is therefore said to contribute to fair income distribution, increase social welfare and act as a mechanism to ensure that the factors of production are efficiently allocated.
This should improve supply to the benefit of producers and consumers and finally it should also act as an incentive to promote technical progress and maximise the national product.
Obviously we all consider market power and processes of concentration to be damaging.
These considerations should also play a role in our debate about a constitution and in the revision of the treaties, and I very much hope that they will also be even more visible in the application and reform of competition law.
Finally, this policy must also be brought into line with the Lisbon process and its objectives.
That is why the annual report is certainly a successful report and it is also positive that for the first time it addresses the issues surrounding services of general interest.
Unlike Mr Langen, I expect the Green Paper to provide not only a thorough analysis of how to handle the provision of public services of general interest, but also a decision on a starting point for future legislation.
In this context, I welcome the fact that you wish to put the public service guarantee on the same footing as the principle of free competition.
I hope that the Commission will produce a proposal for a framework regulation or framework directive as quickly as possible and that it will take account of national specificities and traditions and in particular leave it up to the Member States to define public services.
Commissioner, you were right to say how important it is to control cartels and mergers.
I should like to stress once more here that there is certainly a need to analyse the individual parts of the latest court rulings in precise detail and to draw conclusions from them.
But these court rulings do not in any way dent Parliament's confidence in the Commission's competence, which has been amply proven over the years.
Commissioner, I should like to ask you to take greater account of workers' rights in your merger control work ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, as a result of competition policy, large sectors of European industry have lost jobs and a significant share of the global market; more to the point, they have lost hundreds of thousands of workers to the dole queues.
This policy has helped create huge monopolistic groups which have acquired a dominant position on the market by promoting mergers, alliances and takeovers and greater unaccountability when it comes to price fixing, thereby ousting competitors - mainly small and medium-sized enterprises - from the market, and has resulted in massive waves of redundancies, spiralling unemployment and loss of wealth.
The view that competition policy is the sine qua non to job creation has proven to be misguided, because exactly the opposite is happening in practice.
What worries the European Union is the delay in finalising the liberalisation of the natural gas and electricity markets, the energy markets, and transport and postal services, and the delay in completing the full liberalisation of the markets and privatisations and making temporary and provisional forms of employment the norm.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece support the workers standing up against and opposing this liberalisation ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
We will vote against the three reports by Mrs van den Burg, Mr Lipietz and Mr Herzog, which complement each other in the field of so-called competition policy.
Your economy based on private profit is entirely incapable of dealing either with long-term expenditure on infrastructure or with all the social and human consequences of a competition that could turn out to be fatal to society.
This is why we need, on the one hand, a European public bank to fund infrastructure projects and, on the other hand, a degree of state interventionism in order to do what private capital scorns and to dress some of the many wounds opened up by your economic system.
We are in favour of defending public services that are useful to the population.
We are against the state being used as a crutch for private capital.
Our vote against these reports as a whole expresses our opposition to the whole current economic system, which only serves to provide maximum wealth for a privileged few and in no way to properly satisfy the needs of the majority of the population.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the final speaker in this debate I should like to stress once more that competition policy lies at the very heart of the internal market and I believe that for the European Union it is a very important policy instrument for strengthening Europe's position in the world and pursuing the Lisbon objectives.
Competition policy is supposed to protect European consumers, lead to fair market prices, create increased supply and increase all market participants' dynamism and capacity for innovation.
Competition policy prohibits both State and private monopolies.
It fights measures that distort competition and it is a precondition for all companies to have fair opportunities in and on the market.
We are on the right track, but unfortunately we have not yet reached our goal.
We are on the right track because we are seeing a fall in the number of cases investigated and because there has been an increase in the fines imposed.
We have not yet reached our goal because obstacles to fair competition abound and there are many different bodies with responsibilities in this field, which allows distortions of competition to creep in, and because we are too slow in implementing some directives.
We have not yet reached our goal because we have not completed our work in the interests of public welfare, because services of general interest do not yet have the clear exemptions and rules within competition law to make it possible to allow services of general interest and competition law to function harmoniously together.
I also welcome the Commission's proposal to apply the 'de minimis' rules to all arrangements between SMEs and call on the candidate countries to implement the competition rules quickly so that there are no distortions of competition between different industrial locations.
Mr President, I very much appreciate the strong across-the-board support expressed by this House for a vigorous competition policy in Europe.
It is an enormous task, as Mr Purvis stressed.
It is also very important to note, as Mr Junker did, that there is a fundamental consensus in favour of a vigorous competition policy involving international cooperation and against a renationalisation of European competition policy.
I also note the willingness to keep the European Commission as the decision-making body, under the judicial review of the courts.
Thank you, Commissioner.
We should be thanking you for your efforts under such conditions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Ladies and gentlemen, within the framework of interparliamentary relations, it is my great pleasure to welcome a delegation from the Syrian Parliament. The delegation is led by Mr Abdul Kader Kaddoura, Speaker of the Syrian Parliament.
This is his second visit to the European Parliament.
In welcoming Mr Kaddoura and his delegation, I should like to highlight the importance we attach to this visit. It is the first of its kind to the European Parliament since 1983.
Syria is the last remaining country in the Mediterranean basin with whom an Association Agreement has not yet been finalised.
Negotiations between the Commission and Syria have been continued since 1997. I am informed that a very positive atmosphere reigned at the most recent meeting, last week.
Further, contact between the Syrian Parliament and the European Parliament could trigger ongoing dialogue within the Euromed Forum.
We trust this visit will help to strengthen links between the European Parliament and the Syrian Parliament.
Mr Kaddoura, I very much hope that the meetings you and the members of your delegation held proved fruitful. I hope too that they will signal the start of a new era in which the people of Syria and the European Union will come closer to each other.
(Applause)
Mr President, yesterday we held a debate on Mrs van den Burg's report on temporary work.
This debate lasted from 10 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. and 28 speakers took part in it.
When I asked this morning whether there was a video recording of it I was told that there was not because proceedings were only filmed up to 8 p.m.
Mr President, we say that we want to treat all debates alike and yet those whose reports are debated after 8 p.m. are always at a disadvantage.
Transparency is not guaranteed.
We are there; the interpreters are there; only the audiovisual service cannot be there because its resources have been drastically cut.
I consider this to be an unacceptable situation.
(Loud applause)
I think that your comments, which were also a complaint, should be carefully considered.
I hope that you will receive a positive response.
Mr President, MEPs are at present in danger of being scalded since, in the last half hour, there has only been hot water in the showers and toilets.
Is there by any chance some new scare about new germs spreading here?
I would ask the Quaestors to investigate the matter.
Thank you for your comment, Ms Thors.
Mr Pronk, do you have any objections?
Mr President, it is possible but we have to say 'where appropriate after consultation of the social partners '.
We had mentioned this before, and it is also more logical, so: 'where appropriate after consultation with the social partners'.
Mr President, I would like to ask the movers of Amendments Nos 31 and 37 to clarify whether they intend that this should ban the therapeutic cloning of human embryos.
Mr President, this amendment has nothing to do with stem cell research.
It deals exclusively with the issue of human cloning.
The wording I have used is taken from Parliament's own resolution of September 2000 on human cloning, where we called for a universal ban.
The debate has already taken place.
I think that the intentions are quite clear in the text.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wish to explain something: Mrs DamiÃ£o has been suffering from quite a serious illness. Consequently, she has not been able to attend this vote or be involved in drafting the report.
On behalf of Portugal's socialist delegation, I wish to thank the House, in particular the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, for the support they have given her, which has given a serious intellectual boost to her recovery.
Mr President, I thought that Mr Herzog would present the oral amendment in his text.
It will then read: ...'welcome the bank's commitment to improved transparency and efficiency of its global loans and its response to critical questions regarding these instruments'.
That will be the first line.
It is the Greens.
Sorry, I am mixing it up with another report.
We withdraw the first part of the amendment, which deleted three words, therefore we retain the terms in the report 'financing the economy'.
If, following the floods that engulfed Central Europe this summer, the earthquakes in Turkey, Greece and recently in Italy, there were still a need to demonstrate the necessity of an aid fund for victims of disasters, the news of the sinking of the Prestige should finally convince us.
Although this Solidarity Fund is a necessary guarantee, it is not a sufficient one, however.
Providing aid to the victims of such disasters should not prevent detailed consideration of their causes, our production methods and economic orientations.
On the contrary, it should encourage us to radically question our economies of profit!
These economies produce small profits for shipowners registered in Panama, recruiting Filipinos and flying the flag of Gibraltar!
But personal and family tragedies, incalculable losses for the European and international communities caused by each sinking of an illegal tanker, destroying the socio-economic fabric of the coasts for years and damaging ecosystems and marine biodiversity for centuries!
What I am calling for is more than a solidarity fund, but the creation of a European bank for environmental protection and restoration, which is permanent and one step ahead of environmental disasters, so that the recent Prestige disaster is the last warning shot for these attacks on the environment.
. (PT) The aim of this report was to propose an interinstitutional agreement on the funding of the EU Solidarity Fund and the conditions regulating the use of this Fund.
The interinstitutional agreement in question was proposed jointly by the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, in the aim of laying down the technical arrangements that will enable the revenues necessary for this Fund to be raised.
Under the terms of the agreement, an accelerated procedure was established, guaranteeing the necessary financial flexibility and the speed of the Fund's intervention, starting in the 2002 financial year and running until 2006, in other words, throughout the current financial perspective.
The recent disaster involving the oil tanker Prestige, which has already affected the coasts of Galicia and is also threatening the northern coast of Portugal with the crude oil that it has spilt, is a typical example of the effective and rapid use of this Solidarity Fund, which could only persuade me to vote unreservedly in favour of this proposal.
. (NL) At first reading, I concluded my contribution with the words: 'I am pinning my hopes on the Council's good judgment'.
I can see that I have not been completely let down in this.
The Interinstitutional Agreement that is now before us is clearly better defined than the draft in Parliament.
I should like to illustrate this with three points.
The first one is the Interinstitutional Agreement's scope. This is largely confined to major natural disasters, with good reason.
In the case of disasters of other types, those responsible will be held liable.
The second point concerns the threshold values. The raised threshold focuses the scheme on major disasters and holds out the prospect of this resulting in substantial aid to selected regions.
Thirdly, with regard to the exemption options, the 7.5% limit ensures that the lion's share of the Fund reaches its actual goal.
The Commission has now made the first proposal for granting aid from this Fund.
I hope that as these aid applications are dealt with, it will become clear that the Solidarity Fund functions as a supplement to national measures, both in terms of prevention and correction.
The current situation will then improve on all fronts, with regard to both the affected states and longer-term mutual solidarity.
This is why we have endorsed the Interinstitutional Agreement, albeit with reservations.
I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund.
This vote is the realisation of the fast legislative work that has been done since the proposal was presented by Commissioner Barnier on 18 September.
I would also like to thank him for his efforts in this matter.
When the political will is strong enough, Europe can move forward quickly and effectively.
I only regret that we did not reach the same result following the terrible storms in 1999, which hit France hard.
Today, we can only welcome the mobilisation of this new European instrument of solidarity.
The EUR 728 million will provide additional comfort for the families that have suffered as a result of the natural disasters in the summer.
In my region and in several departments in the South of France, violent storms and torrential floods hit around 400 municipalities on 8 and 9 September, causing the deaths of 24 people and causing very considerable damage.
Today my thoughts go out to those families, the elected representatives of those municipalities and all those, whether civil security forces or voluntary organisations, which have provided help and support during the emergency.
They know the price of solidarity and appreciate, I hope, the gesture that Europe has made today.
Mr President, the proposal for a Council recommendation with regard to the prevention of tobacco smoking only partly corresponds with my views.
In some areas, the Commission goes much too far.
In addition to the many prevention and control aspects, this recommendation also aims to regulate tobacco advertising.
Why is the Commission tabling two texts both of which intend to impose restraints on advertising?
Surely it cannot be the intention that advertising other than that promoting tobacco should fall within the scope of this recommendation?
It is very unfortunate that Parliament is not considering brand diversification businesses.
These are predominantly specialist, and often very small, businesses that use an existing brand to market new products.
However, I can, of course, content myself with the fact that it is ultimately only a non-binding instrument, which must serve as an incentive for the Member States.
Mr President, as someone completely new to Parliament, I have to say that matters such as Mr Maaten's report on the prevention of smoking and on initiatives more effectively to combat smoking and other tobacco use make it difficult for the individual citizen to appreciate the good work we do.
I am happy to leave it to children's parents to decide about this issue.
In this case, it is the form that is dangerous, and not the content.
I think it should be the other way around.
We have chosen to refrain from adopting positions on quite a few parts of the report.
Several of the proposals are such as not to require any common policy at EU level.
Bans on cigarette machines and rules governing gifts and self-service in shops are better drawn up at national level.
We consider bans on food made to look like tobacco to be a case of unnecessary regulation.
The EU should instead immediately abolish the extensive subsidies it pays out for the cultivation of tobacco.
. (DE) Several of the recommendations made by the Commission and Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are to be welcomed from a health policy point of view.
I am thinking in particular of information campaigns and programmes to treat addiction to smoking.
The amendment seeking to introduce measures against involuntary exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces, enclosed public places and public transport also enhances the recommendation.
I particularly welcome the call to promote economically viable alternatives for tobacco growers and to promote the gradual replacement of subsidies for raw tobacco with alternatives.
Obviously we cannot simply take these producers' and their families' daily bread away without offering them an acceptable alternative.
I am not especially happy, however, with all of the recommendations in this report.
The recommendation to the Member States to raise the price of tobacco products artificially by increasing the tax burden will not, I think, be effective in the fight against tobacco consumption.
In the United Kingdom a packet of cigarettes costs twice or three times as much as it does in Luxembourg.
I have yet to hear, however, that tobacco consumption in the British Isles is much lower than in the other Member States as a result, let alone that the problem has been solved.
The only ones who could welcome this would be our finance and budget ministers, in particular those who are having to contend with a larger budget deficit and are therefore facing a 'blue letter' from the Commission because they have exceeded the Stability Pact criteria.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of Procedure)
. (NL) At the time when this proposal was put on the agenda, support from an overwhelming majority was already guaranteed.
This support is much wider than was the case for previous proposals on the subject of tobacco.
Perhaps this is because it cannot be objected to on legal or economic grounds.
This is not a piece of legislation, but merely an initiative that gives an opinion on Parliament's behalf, a non-binding recommendation for the Member States, of which they are free to make use as they see fit.
In many cases, I wish that decisions from this Parliament had this status, particularly dealing with such matters as the liberalisation of the economy or the reduction of government spending.
This is different from cross-border environmental and public health issues, in which it is useful to learn from each other and to carry out the toughest protection measures as a joint effort.
Unfortunately, according to the UN Treaty, the prevention and control of smoking do not fall within the scope of the market but under public health, an area in which the Commission can merely make a recommendation to the Member States.
I have come unstuck on this point before, when I made proposals for protection against asbestos.
This time round, the Council has already made known to us its lack of interest in Parliament's opinion.
I endorse the proposals against smuggling, cinema advertising, and chocolate cigarettes, but do not hold out any high hopes.
. (EL) We are against direct or indirect advertising of tobacco products and [support] measures to reverse the spread and increase of this unhealthy habit, especially among young people.
May we emphasise once again, however, that an anti-smoking campaign is not the same thing as an anti-tobacco campaign and that the anti-smoking campaign should not take the form of a campaign against tobacco cultivation in ?U member states, as the EU argues in Amendment No 17 of the report.
To say tobacco farms are to blame and that tobacco farmers should be punished by proposing that subsidies be abolished, is to deliberately confuse the question of protection of public health with maintaining traditional single-crop farms so that tens of thousands of farmers in mainly poor southern areas, who are not being offered any specific alternatives, can survive.
These proposals are hypocritical and underhand and run counter to consumer interests and public health, given that 70% of the European Union's tobacco is imported.
Consequently, abolishing aid for Community production will not reduce smoking; it will merely make us dependent on imports and flood the European market with tobacco from third countries.
. (PT) Despite the fact that the European Court of Justice has annulled the directive on advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products, of 14 May 2001 because it overstepped Community competence, we see that this report contains a set of non-binding recommendations, which places the emphasis on reducing tobacco consumption by raising consumer awareness.
It also presents a range of proposals designed to deter smoking, particularly amongst children and adolescents, which can only deserve our support.
We wish our position to further emphasise that the concern the European Parliament is showing for public health must not interfere with the competence of national legislators and particularly with protection measures and measures to find economic alternatives that are needed for all those who are economically dependent on tobacco production.
Smoking kills, the litany is becoming tiring. I will therefore take the liberty of irritating some people by repeating that smoking kills one in two smokers.
There is no doubt that those who do not want to hear it are tired of it.
According to the evidence, however, it does not scare people.
The figures are most edifying: in Europe, 500 000 people are struck down by this plague each year.
In Belgium, 33% of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are regular smokers and 51% have smoked.
More serious is the fact that a quarter of women have tried their first cigarette before the age of 15.
In short, young people are smoking more and more, and currently no anti-smoking policy is capable of curbing this infernal trend.
This is why I welcome the adoption by the plenary of the report by Mr Maaten which, by taking up the major anti-smoking measures advocated by WHO, proposes measures to the Council that would be effective in preventing smoking and prevent teenagers from being conditioned by cigarette manufacturers.
This is why I am also categorically opposed to the sale of chocolate cigarettes or liquorice pipes: mimicking a gesture at the age of 5 carries a risk of registering it and getting used to it.
The risk is established, the symbol is disastrous, and all for a quite laughable market!
The Commission is proposing to make the regulations on additives in animal feed more coherent, and we approve of that approach.
However, on the grounds of making what appears to be a technical alteration to an existing regulation, it is taking advantage of the opportunity to make fundamental changes to the authorisation procedure.
Regarding the regulations on additives, we support the proposals aimed at bringing an end to the use of the antibiotics that are still authorised to promote growth, with a transition period, and at simplifying the authorisation procedure for additives that are already authorised for human food.
We also share the principle of continuing to consider coccidiostats and histomonostats as additives until we find other methods of protecting animals against those illnesses.
However, we await proposals from the Commission that will assure us that the same requirements will be applied to imported meat.
With regard to the authorisation procedure, we cannot support the Commission's proposal granting the European Food Safety Authority sole responsibility for investigating applications, which until now was under the authority of the Member States.
For this reason we cannot vote in favour of the report.
. (PT) I have decided to support this report, primarily because of the knock-on importance that the proposal by the European Commission will have for the quality of the products offered to the end consumer.
In fact, this proposal is intended to regulate additives intended for animal nutrition, clarifying existing rules in this field and consequently the authorisation procedures for their marketing.
I think it is entirely appropriate to promote strict quality standards for additives intended for the nutrition of animals that are in turn intended for human consumption.
This is the way to avoid the future occurrence of further episodes such as the outbreak of 'mad cow' disease, enabling us to trace and identify potentially harmful components, eliminating them from the food chain and from the market.
Furthermore, it will allow upward monitoring to take place, both through the obligation on companies to prove the effectiveness of the product and the absence of risk to human health, animal health and the environment and by establishing requirements for the use and marketing of additives.
. (PT) The use of medicinal herbs dates back to time immemorial.
Whilst acknowledging the predominant role played by modern pharmacology, it should also be recognised that medicinal herbs still have their place in medicine and that their therapeutic potential can be exploited.
We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal to create a Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products, which is autonomous and separate from the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products, which will be responsible for the regulation and monitoring of all aspects of herbal medicines.
It is, however, crucial to make the distinction between a medicinal product, even a herbal one, and food or cosmetic products and to ensure adequate deadlines for the herbal product industry to adapt to the new legal situation.
We are counting on the national authorities to provide this support and, confident that they will do so, we have given our vote to Mr NisticÃ³'s report.
Mr President, last night I dreamt about Mrs van den Burg.
She did not appear to me as a young girl, like when we dream of the Virgin Mary: I had pored over her document for so long that I dreamt she was an elderly lady.
It was 40 years in the future and so she was in her sixties.
She said to me, 'I signed up with all the temporary work agencies to try and find a job, but when the time came to give me a job, they all said: 'We didn't like your report much!
You can wait,' and so I have not found a job in the last 40 years.'
'Why ever not?', I asked her.
'Because in my report, discussed 40 years ago in the European Parliament, I did not provide enough safeguards for people who sign up with temporary work agencies to ensure that they would be fairly placed in jobs by these agencies.
Therefore, in your explanation of vote, urge the House and Mrs van den Burg to do something about this part of the report too!'
In line with the commitment made in Lisbon to a future for Europe involving a quantitative and qualitative improvement in employment and greater social cohesion, I will only support this report if Amendment No 42, which deletes the Commission's proposal of applying a deadline for ensuring the essential protection of temporary workers, is adopted.
I feel it is essential that the so-called principle of 'non-discrimination', which states that a temporary worker should not be treated less favourably than a similar worker in the company using him from the point of view of working and employment conditions should be applied fully and therefore without 'discrimination'!
In short, this principle should be guaranteed from day one: there can be no exemptions or waivers, particularly given that this atypical way of working, in comparison with all atypical ways of working, is the one that is most liable to violations, despite Community legislation on the subject, and to shameless exploitation, in other words to a sort of 'reification' of employment.
In accordance with this fundamental idea, I will also vote in favour of the amendment obliging the Member States to prevent the use of temporary workers to subdue a strike movement.
This vote entirely distorts the spirit of the directive on temporary work.
Equal pay for equal work, certainly, but the key issue is the reference point.
For the Commission, the reference point was clear: the company employing the worker was the reference point.
Now, the salary of a temporary worker would have to be assessed according to the scale of salaries in the temporary employment agency.
This is a subtle but decisive shift, because by its nature it legitimises a two-tier employment market, or worse the creation of real networks of slave traders slashing prices.
Those who welcome this vote are short sighted, because establishing a salary division between temporary workers and the workers in the companies employing them deals a fatal blow to social cohesion, and that is the Achilles heel of temporary work.
Integration cannot be legislated.
Temporary workers have more accidents than other workers and suffer more harassment.
They pay very dearly for their status.
The social reality is intractable.
If they are paid less for identical work in a company, they will lose any chance of being integrated into it.
Are temporary workers just like any other worker?
No they are not!
And this directive, which is dead before it is born, will certainly not bring them justice.
. (NL) My concern when voting was primarily with the protection of Dutch legislation dating from 1999, which intends to put temporary work on a more equal footing with normal work and to protect against abuses.
Without such legislation, employers can take advantage of temporary workers and rob groups of employees of their basic security, pay them lower wages, offer them less say, force them to work under worse conditions, make early dismissal possible or break strikes of others.
The intention is to create dependency by preventing people from moving on to permanent positions at the businesses that originally hired them.
Temporary work is admissible only if it is a free choice on the part of the people involved, albeit in the service of the temping agency, and if they have all the normal rights of employees.
The two largest groups have reached a compromise that prevents the more far-reaching protection that my group has proposed.
Despite this, Dutch employers are trying to persuade their counterparts in other Member States and the Right-wing section in this Parliament to reject even this minimum level of protection and to ensure that the rules are either rejected or relaxed.
In doing so, they are hoping to cut costs and increase temporary work.
I can only vote in favour if they are frustrated in what they seek to do.
With this proposal for a directive, the Commission is seeking to regulate working conditions for temporary workers in the Member States.
The choice of this restrictive measure is going to force regulations on the Member States that are not necessarily adapted to their specific national characteristics and which could therefore penalise this way of working, whereas the aim was to encourage it.
Although the only possible reply is that promoting temporary work, which provides flexibility for companies and integration or reintegration into the labour market for some types of workers, is quite commendable, there is absolutely no question of doing it at any price.
It would seem that this proposal for a directive does not have a sufficiently sound basis.
Also, this field is the sovereign responsibility of the Member States, which are undoubtedly in a better position to assess the situation of their labour market.
This is why I cannot vote for a text which, far from achieving its objectives, runs counter to them.
The UK delegation of the Labour Party recognises the serious UK Government concern over this directive.
It is important to strike a balance between protecting agency workers and avoiding burdens that could stop business engaging them, particularly for short-term assignments.
Temporary Work Agencies make an important contribution to the employment market in the UK and should not be penalised.
Increased administrative burdens could lead to increases in costs, which could be passed onto user organisations or cause the closure of the business and job losses.
The EPLP has thus voted against Amendment 42 calling for the deletion of the 6-week derogation from the original Commission proposal.
It feels that it is important that at least a 6-week derogation remains in the proposal.
The EPLP voted for Amendment 73 to support comprehensive and effective impact assessments.
This helps SMEs.
The EPLP submitted and supported Amendment 71, calling for an extra transition period for the UK.
It is therefore necessary that there is an additional period of 3 years, allowing 5 years in total, for this directive to be implemented in the UK and Ireland.
The EPLP has supported this report at first reading but with the strong reservations set out here.
. (PT) The main reasons for using temporary workers and temporary employment agencies concern the need to deal with temporary variations in demand.
Statistical information, therefore, shows that placements in user companies are usually extremely short; between one and six months.
In the particular case of Portugal, specific legislation is in place that respects this type of work, and which guarantees the basic rights of these workers, whilst also respecting the particular circumstances that determine the use of temporary labour.
Despite the Commission's view that its proposal is quite flexible, the fact is that the attempt to include in this report the regulation of various basic conditions of temporary work, in my opinion, falls outside Community competence and has no precedent in European legislation, thereby breaching the principle of subsidiarity.
These, in short, are the reasons for my vote against this report.
. (PT) I have voted against this report because I believe that, by tabling various amendments to the Commission's original text, we have ultimately created a framework that is clearly counterproductive to the interests it is intended to safeguard.
In fact, as the rapporteur acknowledges, there are some aspects on which the social partners involved have to date never reached agreement.
Furthermore, equating the factors of the legal relationship of temporary work with permanent work will ultimately lead to this soon no longer being a viable possibility for companies and therefore, one less window of opportunity for many workers.
It should be emphasised that we cannot and shall not allow the same provisions for safety, health and social rights that apply to other workers not to be applied to temporary workers. This protection already exists, in fact, in various regulatory instruments.
It would have been more useful for us to have seen a statistical breakdown of the use of temporary labour in Europe, which successive European Councils have seen as another instrument with which to combat unemployment and for the suggestion to have been made to impose limits on its use, thereby combating not temporary work itself but rather the unacceptable abuses of such work.
We voted against this motion for a joint resolution as, behind its convoluted words and self-congratulation, it is mainly seeking to clear the Russian authorities of responsibility for the dirty war that it is waging in Chechnya.
While we condemn terrorism in any form, it is shocking that the motion for a joint resolution only expresses its 'firm condemnation' of the terrorist attacks in Moscow, and not of the state terrorism conducted by the Russian army against the civil population in Chechnya.
As for the progress of neutralisation of Chechen terrorists in Moscow, it not only shows the ignominy of terrorism, but also the total contempt of the Russian authorities for their own citizens.
We are in favour of establishing the closest possible links between the people of the European Union and Russia, but against the complicity between their leaders, some of which are preparing for war against Iraq while the others are at war against the Chechens.
Who can honestly be satisfied with the results of the EU-Russia Summit?
The proponents of liberalism who only see Russia as another area for the market, competition and privatisations, particularly in the fields of energy, research and transport, certainly can.
As can Mr Putin, who, legitimised by the post-September 11 attitude adopted by the US, is flouting freedom of expression and increasing police and military pressure on all the peoples of the Russian Federation, particularly the Chechens.
We cannot acknowledge these results.
On the contrary, we are firmly on the side of the populations that are the victims of rampant capitalism and fight alongside them to maintain public and social services and to defend the right to work and to retirement.
We support the right of the Chechen people to self-determination even more strongly.
We condemn Russian military aggression and the hypocritical attitude of the EU and Denmark who, on the orders of the Russians, arrested Akhmed ZakaÃ¯ev, the representative of the Chechen president, Mr Maskhadov.
In short, we cannot vote in favour of the joint resolution of the European Parliament authorising and legitimising military operations in Chechnya.
. (PT) Like all compromise texts, this motion for a resolution combines very positive recitals and conclusions, such as the references to the agreement on Kaliningrad, for example, with a dubious and rather weak speech rejecting the terrorist acts that have recently taken place in Russia and, particularly, the recent attack on the Moscow theatre by Chechen extremists.
With regard to the fight against terrorism, we believe that this must be constant and unswerving, because what we are seeing are cowardly and anonymous threats to the life and security of defenceless citizens, who will accept no excuses and no less rigorous support for the authorities combating this phenomenon.
This and this alone is the reason why I have voted against this motion for a resolution.
We could have voted in favour of this joint resolution, as it contains a number of sound recitals regarding General Musharraf's military regime in Pakistan.
However, the condemnation does not go far enough.
Paragraph 2 legitimises the regime following the recent elections in October 2002.
These elections were not democratic.
They were conducted like a commercial transaction.
The rich were able to buy votes from the poor without the electoral commission being able to stop them.
The military at all levels put pressure on the local administration to help their preferred candidates.
These elections were about encouraging politicians to follow the instructions and recommendations of the military, the 'new' allies of imperialism in the region.
All the decisions taken were dictated by economic considerations: continuing with privatisations, deregulations, withdrawing collective agreements and mass unemployment.
According to the institute for planning sustainable development in Islamabad, 6.8 million Pakistanis fell below the poverty line during the last three years of the Musharraf regime.
It is the IMF and the World Bank who really give the orders in the regime.
There is no mention of that in this resolution and the condemnation of the Musharraf regime does not go far enough.
We therefore abstained.
Mr President, this time it was Mr Fatuzzo who came to me in a dream and said: 'Do not you think that the time has come at last for you to state clearly, in a forum as important as the European Parliament, that we need to press forward with research into prolonging citizens' lives and research into eradicating as many diseases as possible?'
'We are already doing that,' I replied.
'No, I'm very worried that there are groups of people who, in one way or another, are against cures for all diseases.
Maybe some pharmaceutical companies, or some hospitals.
It has been said that to think the worst of someone is a sin, but usually you are spot on.
I really would like to call for everything possible to be done, and only the European Union can do it, to carry out research into prolonging our lives and ensure that they are healthy, wholesome and free from disease.'
Mr President, I voted against Mrs DamiÃ£o's report because Amendment No 23 was not adopted.
I am in favour of maintaining the moratorium on genetically modified food, but on no account do I oppose research and biotechnology in general.
. (EL) It is clear from advances over recent years that biotechnology can help us enormously to understand how life develops, to combat disease and to develop new drugs.
At the same time, it harbours dangers, mainly when it comes to 'playing around' with genetic material, altering genetic codes, cloning, preparing genetically modified organisms (GMOs), patenting living organisms and using DNA for keeping tabs on people.
The Commission and the European Parliament are not concerned with developing biotechnology for the benefit of society; all they worry about is how the European monopolies can catch up with the American monopolies, but of course that does not surprise us.
The main battle in this war is being fought with GM foods and a race is being run here with the Americans.
Who cares about the risks inherent in messing about with life and making artificial changes?
Who cares that it is impossible to predict the effect these organisms will have on our planet's sensitive ecosystem?
The responsibility for prevention has been shifted straight on to the consumer (such as the starving millions in Africa).
This is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
We Swedish Moderates welcome the positive attitude adopted by the European Parliament and the Commission on life sciences and biotechnology in this report.
We would, however, emphasise that diversity and a wealth of ideas provide the best impetus to successful research.
This principle should not be lost through EU coordination.
Research policy within the EU must be based upon the principle of subsidiarity.
Research cooperation between the Member States is good, but the EU must not take charge of it.
Except in the case of its own research programmes, the EU lacks competence in the research area, and that is how matters should remain.
We have therefore voted against the proposal for a special Directorate General with chief responsibility for coordinating the biotechnology strategy.
We are in favour of the development of life sciences, biotechnology and, more broadly, of science in general.
This is because it is the means to provide the material basis for the progress of humanity and the intellectual basis for its emancipation from all types of prejudices, starting with the obscurantism that is used by religions and various reactionary ideologies, some of which are very fashionable at present, and which periodically bring back the kind of society in which men are not in control of their destiny but are crushed by an unjust, harmful and abhorrent social structure.
We reject, however, the many direct and indirect indulgences in the report of private companies.
These companies are in no way concerned with what is useful to humanity in terms of the development of science, but rather with what can be sold to customers who have the means to pay for it and provide a profit.
We also reject all the calls for public funding in the interests of private capital, even if those interests are hidden behind the needs of research.
We therefore abstained from voting on this report.
I voted against Amendments 31 and 37 as the wording would be interpreted to also include a ban on therapeutic cloning, which I support under proper ethical conditions.
I do not support the cloning of human beings.
Mr President, the document concerns the European Investment Bank annual report for 2001.
I voted for the report because the Bank's work is extremely important, particularly - and I want to stress this - in providing aid to finance infrastructure, especially in the candidate countries.
It is for this very reason that I want to emphasise the importance of Corridor 5, which links southern Italy, the Puglia region, with Tirana, Skopje, Sofia, Plovdiv and Burgas.
Above all, I would call for the European Investment Bank's funds to be increased in order to finance the construction of the stretch of road and railway between Skopje and Sofia, which is completely non-existent at present, something which is preventing the swift completion of Corridor 5, so important for work in the whole of the Balkan area.
Parliament is right to highlight the impact of the EIB on the growth of SMEs and on employment, particularly through risk-capital transactions.
This impact must be reinforced by operation structures for access by SMEs.
In particular, the invitation made to the EIB to adopt and apply the definition of SMEs established by the Commission is essential for access by the smallest SMEs.
In the same context, increasing investments in the field of accommodation will enhance the important construction sector.
Mr President, the van den Burg report on prudential supervision in the European Union is particularly interesting for the elderly and pensioners, who give their money both to the State which arranges their pensions, through compulsory national insurance schemes, and to private funds, through shares, bonds and investments.
Neither, however, are completely watertight.
To avoid this problem, all we can do, as I saw just now when I closed my eyes, is to undertake to build brick houses. In my view and in the view of the Pensioners' Party, this is the best investment we can make for the future, in whichever part of the world they are built.
The implementation of careful supervision rules in the European Union will protect saving and give people confidence in investments in stocks and shares.
The globalisation of risks should further encourage the European authorities to develop supervision rules at international level.
In this context, the invitation made by Parliament to the Commission and the European Supervisory Committees to organise, jointly with the American Federal Reserve and the Security and Exchange Commission, a transatlantic financial forum, is going in the right direction.
Other, broader initiatives, should not, however, be ruled out.
. (PT) This report is based on some facts and on one basic misunderstanding.
The facts are those we saw in the social communication: the disturbing and unprecedented degree of instability in the world financial markets and the repercussions of this on the so-called 'real economy', with the surge in financial crises which become economic crises as a result of the 'financialisation' of the economy, to which the gradual integration of pension schemes for private profit and the increasing volume of pension funds have largely contributed.
The mistake is to think that, by integrating the EU's financial markets and establishing rules for minimum prudential supervision, under the auspices of new supranational bodies, and by increasing the powers of the Commission, we will resolve the problem of the financial markets' volatility when the main issue is the 'free' international movement of capital and its speculative and parasitical use, with enormous volumes of money concentrated in pension funds and in hedge funds, frequently using the platform of tax havens and instruments that encourage speculation, such as derivatives.
Furthermore, the fragmentation of the financial markets could be a positive factor in avoiding the risks of this financial globalisation, maintaining more localised supervisory systems and markets that are more flexible and adaptable to specific local characteristics.
. (DE) The appeal to national authorities to cooperate more closely in the fight against so-called white-collar crime is certainly to be welcomed.
If, however, you want to give examples of this white-collar crime, and mention money laundering, market abuse and financing of terrorist groups, you should be careful not to add tax evasion to the list.
We all agree that tax evasion should be stopped. Everyone should fulfil their duty to pay taxes.
But this is no reason to confuse tax evasion with tax fraud.
There is a clear distinction between the two.
That is why I tabled an amendment in this regard in committee, but unfortunately it was not adopted.
The same amendment was tabled in the plenary on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
This amendment also deletes the reference to the practice of blacklisting countries if they do not yet adhere to the various international standards in the field of fighting white-collar crime.
The 'naming and shaming' method appears at first sight to be very attractive if the sole objective is to fight against this form of crime, but it actually reinforces the law of the most powerful in international relations.
You would think twice before putting the USA on a list of this kind.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(NL) EU policy aims to give more elbow room to people at the helm of international companies, who are seen as magicians with the ability to guarantee prosperity and prompt economic growth.
During the time when share prices soared sky-high, these magicians were even allowed to line their own pockets quite handsomely with share option schemes.
Moreover, they are being encouraged to take on important government functions in the areas of postal services, energy supply and public transport.
Meanwhile, we have been able to witness in America what these magicians are capable of.
In some cases, the successes ascribed to them and the options paid out to them are based on forgeries.
Measures are now being taken in America to increase control, not so much to curb the omnipotence of large companies, as to restore investor and consumer confidence.
An initiative of this kind is also currently being proposed for the EU.
My support for it is mainly due to the lack of anything better.
Without changing the way in which the economy is organised, even the appointment of large numbers of inspectors would not solve the problems.
We would then be wasting Community funding on bureaucracy.
What is positive is the proposal to set up a common database collating the most important information pertaining to European financial institutions' business data and making it accessible to the public.
The unprecedented crisis in the financial system is the result of the deep economic crisis in the capitalist system and the clash of interests and acute competition between monopolies.
The wave of scandals to hit large monopolies and financial service groups in the USA and Europe has exacerbated the lack of faith in the financial system by highlighting its unaccountability and revealing how the market, small investors and savers, pension funds and insurance companies are constantly deceived, with new ways being found of exploiting and sucking the masses dry.
And yet no control measures with any teeth have been introduced, which perhaps goes to show that the control mechanisms responsible have been hiding rather than monitoring information and have basically acted as consultants in deception.
'Creative', 'constructive' accounting has been well and truly adopted even in national accounts as a way of deceiving citizens.
The only purpose of any supposed controls proposed or applied to date has been to placate justified grass-roots reaction; nothing is being done to prevent or compensate the victims of unaccountable monopolies as they destroy workers and small and medium-sized enterprises, because that would jeopardise the social and economic system itself, based as it is on the principle of exploitation.
We are here to highlight the political dimensions of the economic crisis as we fight with the workers to overturn this rotten system.
The effects of constant announcements regarding the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets that are not followed up with genuine results are a considerable handicap to European credibility with citizens.
These liberalisations should be genuinely set in motion so that they are perceptible to households.
Furthermore, based on the European ineffectiveness with regard to South Korea concerning unfair competition on the ship building market, we urgently need to implement the procedure for settling WTO disputes for the sector in question, also in order to open the way for the emergence of a competition policy at international level.
. (PT) We have voted against the report for the following reasons:
it reiterates its support for rapid progress towards liberalisation of the European markets in energy, transport and postal services and regrets the lack of progress in the effective liberalisation of gas and electricity, which we reject;
we reject the report's position on the acquisition of private companies in the electricity sector by public companies in sectors that have been or are about to be liberalised, which it is attempting to undermine;
we disagree with its call for State aid to be reduced and with its misguided approach to State funding of private providers of general interest services;
the report does not take account of the social consequences of mergers, specifically employment, or of the abuse of dominant positions, and plays down the importance of workers in merger decisions;
we disagree with the report's support for codecision in competition policy.
We obviously cannot ratify the report by Alain Lipietz, which expresses its 'profound disappointment at the lack of progress in the effective liberalisation of European gas and electricity markets'.
On the contrary, we call on citizens to rise up against such a plan.
Like the majority of them, our 'awareness [?] remains very limited' of the benefits of the competition policy conducted at EU level, as it translates into restructuring, redundancies and a low-cost method of satisfying social needs.
Rather than this policy, which is at least as stupid as the Stability Pact, we are in favour of structural policies, planned at European level, for example in the fields of transport and energy.
In general, the Commission's approach aims to make such policies entirely impossible, particularly by reducing state aid, which is systematically portrayed as being harmful.
Unlike the rapporteur, we do not support 'the Commission's continued commitment to reducing state aid still further'.
We will therefore vote against his text, which is a mark of unreservedly rallying to the neo-liberal ideology.
I wish to congratulate Mr Lipietz on the excellent report he has drawn up on the Commission's 31st Report on Competition Policy 2001, which I fully support, particularly with regard to ensuring constant and rigorous monitoring to prevent serious distortions of competition and with regard to the need to create a specialist body, at judicial level, in the field of competition and State aid, so that cases in this field can be dealt with quickly.
I should like, however, to emphasise that although I broadly agree with the rapporteur's support for the Commission's commitment to reducing State aid in the Community, there are still European regions, specifically the outermost regions, in which State aid is a vital measure for supporting their economic and social development.
This has been expressly acknowledged in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
In these specific cases, we must continue to see a degree of flexibility in the granting and authorisation of aid which make a justified and effective contribution to the development of these unique territories and economies.
. (PT) I have supported this report, which concerns the Commission's assessment of competition policy in 2001, because I believe it does so in a well-considered way and makes constructive criticism.
As the rapporteur states, we must acknowledge the fact that the Commission is successfully pursuing its objectives by boldly applying the instruments at its disposal and therefore effectively protecting consumers and their best interests.
An objective contribution to this conclusion is the verified reduction in the number of cases examined and, at the same time, the sharp rise in fines imposed.
In fact, given the high speed of technological development, the march of globalisation, and not least the European economy characterised by frequent mergers, the rigour of competition policy and its scrupulous monitoring by the Commission is crucial.
This policy is crucial to promoting a climate of confidence and to affording proper protection for economic actors, preventing concerted practices, the abuse of dominant positions and other distortions of competition.
I also particularly welcome the rapporteur's proposal to attach absolute priority to policies involving horizontal aid to help industry adjust to the Kyoto commitments.
This is the way forward for a European economy that aspires to be increasingly 'more dynamic and competitive' but also ecologically balanced.
In recent years, the Commission has fulfilled its mission to hunt down state aid with a somewhat blind zeal, seeing aid to be criticised practically everywhere.
For the first time, the Council recently tried to moderate the Commission by using Article 88(3) which allows it, ruling unanimously in exceptional circumstances, to exonerate some aid from any proceedings.
We regret that it did not have that courage earlier, for example when the Commission condemned public aid for employment in the French textiles sector.
The Court of Justice also put on another brake with the Ferring ruling of 22 November 2001, which exonerates public aid when it solely compensates for the excess cost of a public service constraint.
We hope that this case law will be confirmed.
It seems to us that now the corresponding section of the Treaty (Articles 87 to 89) should be updated in order to better define acceptable public aid, for example for employment, the environment or compensating for public service constraints.
Moreover, the Commission should not have exclusive and discretionary powers: the national democracies should also be able to have an input.
The report by Philippe Herzog proposes some minor adjustments to the scoreboard for state aid and gives some pious wishes.
Like him, we deplore the freezing of Research and Development aid, and like him, we are in favour of exceptional cases being considered.
However, the report must be severely criticised in terms of its content.
It deals with the absence of any evaluation procedure as just one point among many others.
It is however, the key issue: rather than being called to vote on a table of figures, according to democracy the European Parliament should have the opportunity to give an opinion based on genuine assessments.
The reason why this aspect is only mentioned in passing is that the rapporteur deprived it of all importance in advance by swearing allegiance to the neo-liberal dogma.
The report closes the discussion before it opens by stating that it supports 'the objectives of reducing aid granted by states or from state funds, in any form whatsoever, which distorts or threatens to distort competition'.
The dominant theme of this report is therefore detailed arrangements with a logic of pure competition, and this is also why we voted against it.
. (PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Herzog on the excellent report he has produced on the 2001 scoreboard for State aid (spring 2002 update), presented by the Commission, which I fully support.
In the framework of competition policy, the half-yearly publication of the scoreboard for State aid since 2001 is an important tool for transparency and debate.
Nevertheless, I share the opinion that the data included in this scoreboard are still not sufficient or adequate to enable a comparison to be made between the behaviour of the various Member States and the real benefits arising from State aid.
We would like to see such a comparison made in the short term because this is the only way in which an informed overall study can be undertaken so that decisions can be taken on the level of aid granted and/or its possible refocusing towards horizontal objectives of common interest, such as research and development, the environment, SMEs, training and employment.
. (NL) Within the EU, government aid is a dirty word these days.
There is no room for it in the pursuit of unlimited international competition and tax reduction.
However, a great deal of government aid is channelled to companies in a disguised form.
In some cases, there is an over-capacity on offer for the transport of freight, as new motorways, goods railways and canals are being built.
Consequently, companies are free to choose which part of this infrastructure they can utilise while keeping their transport costs to a minimum.
Many companies only managed to start up or survive thanks to government aid, and this is not likely to change a great deal in future.
This applies all the more if services of general interest, public services in other words, are considered as part of the economy.
Although those services are vital to the well-being of people and the conservation of our environment, they are, in many cases, running at a constant loss.
Only nepotism, the giving of government funding to business connections, should be prevented.
My colleague, Mr Herzog, as rapporteur, has stated all of this in a slightly less emphatic way, but has tabled sound proposals in order at least to bring the figures more on a par, to increase the ceiling for amounts that have to be declared to EUR 200 000, to adopt an active, regional policy in areas of the Czech Republic and Poland with a strong steel industry, to abolish the inspection of aid to services of general interest and to give Parliament more control over policy.
The right-wing elements in this House will do everything in their power to obstruct this process.
In Stockholm, in June 2001, the European Council adopted the objective of reducing the overall level of State aid as a percentage of GDP by 2003, particularly ad hoc and sectoral aid.
The Barcelona Council of March 2002 confirmed this intention, calling on Member States to redirect such aid towards horizontal objectives of common interest, including economic and social cohesion, and target it to identified market failures.
I believe State aid to be a flexibility instrument that is crucial to correcting disparities and to addressing specific problems under European competition rules, which means that the legitimacy of its use should never be questioned, although it must be undertaken in a moderate and justifiable way.
In the specific context that led to the drafting of this report, I welcome the clear reduction in State aid granted and its redirection towards horizontal objectives, such as SMEs, the environment, R&D, employment and training, which fall beyond the strict remit of economic efficiency, but promote the better preparation of economic actors and Member States for the internal market.
Lastly, I disagree with the rapporteur's call for the codecision procedure to be extended to this field.
I welcome the amendments that have been adopted in various individual votes which, although the rapporteur might not like it, have significantly improved the final text of the resolution.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Mr President, I have just seen the verbatim report of the extraordinary debate on Tuesday morning on the Europarl website, and I noticed that the written statements that some Members, including myself, although I was not the only one, had made under Rule 120 of the Rules of Procedure, were quite simply deleted.
