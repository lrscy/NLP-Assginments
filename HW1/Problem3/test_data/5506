For this reason, aid must be not only swift, but also visible in the appropriations provided.
I therefore believe that the criteria for eligibility to the Solidarity Fund must be amended to provide for this.
Â Â  .
This regulation is intended to respond to the action plan on Economic and Monetary Union, adopted by the Ecofin Council on 18 February 2003, with a view to remedying the shortcomings in EU statistics on the economic behaviour of families and businesses and will make it possible, in particular, to monitor households' saving and consumption and the profitability of financial and non-financial businesses.
Breaking the statistics down by economic sector will undoubtedly improve the information provided by the quarterly financial accounts, clearly âimitatingâ the way things are done for the US Federal Reserve.
We find nothing to object to in the proposal itself.
Nevertheless, what could be considered to be a purely technical issue, which serves information purposes only, is closely linked to the support and direction given to economic policy and above all, to monetary policy in the European Union.
These are tools for adjusting economic policy decisions, since these policies prop up the single Economic and Monetary Union, which lacks precise statistical instruments.
To put it clearly, these are also tools that help to strengthen the Unionâs right-wing and anti-social policies, although they do provide some useful information.
Â Â  . On 1Â January 2004, we saw the entry into force of Directive 2003/96/EC, restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity.
This amendment seeks to ensure that the new Member States have longer exemption periods given the risk they face of a sudden increase in the cost of living.
We believe, however, that the issue goes deeper and we object to the directive on three grounds:
Firstly, harmonised energy taxation is not a fundamental prerequisite for a well-functioning Internal Market.
Tax competition does have its benefits but, more importantly, this is an issue of tax sovereignty, with far-reaching implications for a Stateâs social and environmental choices and tax structure.
This is why the Member States have submitted many requests for exemptions.
Secondly, increasing the lowest rates will lead to higher costs of living, especially for workers and for the least well-off members of society.
It will introduce factors for injustice and fail to penalise those who consume most heavily.
This is the nature of fixed rates and direct taxation.
Thirdly, what is needed is not to shift tax from labour towards environmental âuseâ, the price for which is always passed on to the consumer.
The burden does need to be shifted but to the âuseâ of capital, otherwise, taxation will remain unfair.
Â Â  . Council Directive 2003/96/EC, restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity has become the main legal base in the field of energy taxation, guaranteeing all the current Member States transitional arrangements that will enable them to adjust their national legislation.
Indeed, harmonised taxation is a fundamental prerequisite for a well-functioning Internal Market.
The rapporteur takes the view that âin order to avoid harmful tax competition, the acceding countries have to align their tax rates of excise duties with the minimum levels set within the European Unionâ.
This explains the reportâs call to âall Member States, including the current onesâ to ensure compliance with âthe deadlines set by the Directive and, as such, contribute to the development of the environment-friendly internal marketâ.
Despite the fact that this report addresses a delicate matter â energy taxation â on environmental grounds in particular, and the fact that taxation still requires unanimity of votes in Council, I voted in favour of the text.
Â Â  . Although I harbour fundamental reservations about the process of tax harmonisation, I believe we must establish forms of coordination, in particular as regards avoiding tax on cross-border flows of capital and I am, therefore, a firm advocate of abolishing banking secrecy and of putting an end to tax havens.
The ultimate aim of Directive 2003/48/EC is to enable savings income in the form of interest payments made in one Member State to beneficial owners to be made subject to effective taxation, thus guaranteeing an equitable tax treatment of savings and Member Statesâ rights to tax their residentsâ income, at European level, whilst at the same time removing artificial incentives to the flow of capital in the EU and beyond.
The desire of some Member States, particularly those with direct links to tax havens, to erode the tax base is at variance, however, with their desire to attract capital savings.
The most effective way of collecting savings income is to ensure the automatic exchange of information between tax administrations.
In order to prevent capital flight, other countries must comply with the arrangements made and in this case, we are talking specifically about Switzerland.
Unfortunately, difficulties remain in negotiations with other countries.
We must, however, go further.
We must work on ways of coordinating taxation in order to tax capital movements and cross-border stock transfers at Community level.
Â Â  My abstention in this vote is based on the opinion that I have always expressed on the agreement reached on 19 and 20Â June 2000 at the Santa Maria da Feira European Council which, in my opinion, can only lead to deadlock.
The continued difficulties with Switzerland, despite the conclusion of the agreement that is being submitted to us here, and the difficult pursuit of negotiations with the other third countries, back me up in this assessment and in my vote today.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the agreement between Switzerland and the European Union on taxation of savings income, but I would like to make it clear that I am doing so subject to Parliament being consulted, before this agreement is implemented, about those agreements negotiated with the other third countries: the United States, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino. At the same time, I would stress that its application also depends on the adoption and implementation by the dependent or associated territories of the Member States of measures that conform with those contained in the directive of 3Â June 2003.
Switzerland, like some Member States that opted within the framework of the directive for a withholding tax at source, still sets great store by banking secrecy, the aim of which is to guarantee that the private sphere is respected and that depositors have greater trust in their banks.
Some people constantly claim that abolishing banking secrecy is necessary to combat tax fraud and harmful tax competition.
Alongside banking secrecy, Switzerland, like my country, Luxembourg, has laid down very strict clauses on money laundering and financing of criminal activities.
In accordance with Article 10 of this agreement, Switzerland, and every Member State of the European Union, exchanges information on behaviour constituting tax fraud according to the legislation of the Member State concerned.
Â Â  The draft legislative resolution presented in the report renders meaningless the agreement reached at the Santa Maria de Feira European Council in June 2000.
This agreement makes the entry into force of the directive dependent upon the application of equivalent measures by Switzerland as well as by a number of other countries and dependent territories.
Since this condition has not been fulfilled, I voted against the resolution.
Â Â  . On 16Â October 2001, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate an agreement with the Swiss Confederation providing for measures equivalent to those that must be implemented in the Community, with a view to ensuring the effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments.
Implementing the provisions of Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3Â June 2003, on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments, will depend on the Swiss Confederationâs implementation of measures equivalent to those laid down in the aforementioned directive, in line with an agreement concluded between that country and the European Community.
Consequently, it is proposed that we should adopt the agreement between the Community and the Swiss Confederation, which provides for measures equivalent to those laid down in Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments and the accompanying Memorandum of Understanding.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . This proposal for a directive forms part of the original Monti package of 1998, which paved the way for greater tax harmonisation within the European Union.
Regardless of what one might think of the proposals as a whole and given that we are seeking to create an internal market, one can understand the need to establish a degree of tax harmonisation to combat tax evasion and double taxation.
We do, however, have one fundamental objection to the approach that has been outlined, because the concept of tax harmonisation is federalist in nature and touches on one of the fundamental pillars of state sovereignty: a stateâs ability to tax families and businesses, thus ensuring its autonomy.
Furthermore, we are not convinced of the economic advantages of tax harmonisation as opposed to the advantages of maintaining healthy tax competition.
For this very reason, this directive and the remainder of the package were only approved in June 2003.
The directive relates to interest payments and royalties transferred between associated companies with the aim of abolishing deductions from these payments at source.
This amendment seeks to extend the list of companies covered and to take account of the directive on parent companies and subsidiaries and the directive on mergers.
Our concern is that the directive must not make tax evasion easier or deprive Member States of the appropriate means with which to combat fraud and abuse.
Â Â  . The proposal for a Council decision aimed at establishing a court of first instance specialising in civil service disputes is one aspect of the judicial reform enshrined in the Treaty of Nice, which seeks to solve the growing problem of workload in the Community courts.
It answers the call made in the Nice Summit, under the terms of which âThe Conference asks the Court of Justice and the Commission to prepare as swiftly as possible a draft decision establishing a judicial panel which has jurisdiction to deliver judgments at first instance on disputes between the Community and its servants.â
Establishing this court will enable these disputes, which account for around one-third of the Court of First Instanceâs current workload, to be removed from that court.
This will confine itself, in future, to the role of a court of second instance relating to judgments delivered by the new court of first instance, with the Court of Justice intervening only in exceptional circumstances, in reviewing the judgments of the Court of First Instance.
Despite the staffing and operational costs of this new court, estimated to total EURÂ 2Â 453Â 000 per year, I voted in favour of establishing it, given the added swiftness it will bring to Community court proceedings.
Â Â  . Under the terms of Article 245(2) of the EC Treaty and Article 160(2) of the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC) Treaty, the Court calls on the Council to add the following amendments to the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice: under the terms of ArticleÂ 17 of the Protocol, Decisions of the full Court shall be valid only if 11 Judges are sitting.
With the increase in the number of judges â from 15 to 25 â following enlargement, it is proposed that this quorum should be set at 15.
Pursuant to Article 16 of the Protocol, the Grand Chamber, which sits in particular when a Member State or an institution of the Communities that is party to the proceedings so requests, consists of 11 judges.
It is proposed to increase the number of judges forming part of the Grand Chamber to 13, as well as maintaining the current quorum of nine judges.
According to the rapporteur and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the proposal on which the EP is consulted âappears to have obtained a consensus both in the Council and the Court and is well-founded, and can therefore be approved without amendment(explanatory statement)â.
We see no reason not to endorse this conclusion and therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  . This draft Council decision seeks, further to the enlargement process, to amend Articles 16 and 17 of the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice with regard to increasing the number of judges in what are known as the Grand Chamber and the full Court.
Under the terms of this proposal, the Court would increase the number of judges in the Grand Chamber to thirteen, with the minimum number of judges required to be sitting remaining at nine.
As regards the full Court, with the increase in judges from fifteen to twenty-five, it is proposed that this quorum should be raised from eleven to fifteen judges.
I share the rapporteurâs view that this is a well-founded proposal, which obtained a consensus both in the Council and the Court and I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  . This report could be said to be unimportant and largely technical, but it takes on greater significance when we consider that its aim is to include, following on from the enlargement of the European Union on 1Â May to encompass ten countries from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, the nine official languages of these countries â unless they are already used â in the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
Why does this need to be emphasised?
Because in other processes â such as the important example of the âCommunity patentâ â some people are looking for âsolutionsâ that do not entail full respect for the various languages of the EUâs countries but which seek to impose the languages of the countries with the largest populations and discriminate against the Unionâs other official languages.
Â Â  . The draft Council decision seeks to include, in light of the new division of jurisdiction in direct actions and the enlargement of the EU, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Slovak, Slovene and Czech amongst the working languages established under ArticleÂ 35 of the Courtâs Rules of Procedure.
Following on from the new division of jurisdictional powers between the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance set out by the Treaty of Nice, it is also appropriate to establish a rule for deciding on the working language of proceedings in the court, provided that the requesting party is an institution.
As for the similar proposal for the ECJ, the rapporteur and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market consider that the proposal âwould seem properly founded and is the logical consequence of enlargement of the Union.
It can therefore be approved without amendment(explanatory statement)â.
Our statement on the new linguistic arrangements in the ECJ holds true on this matter too and we consequently voted in favour.
Â Â  . With the accession of the new Member States, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Slovak, Slovene and Czech will become official languages of the European Union.
The draft Council decision on which the European Parliament is being consulted seeks, therefore, to add these languages to the list contained in ArticleÂ 29(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice.
Because I have always fought for multilingualism in every aspect of the process of European integration, I have called for it to be accorded equal treatment in Community actions and institutions and for its equal dignity and use to be recognised.
I could only vote in favour.
Â Â  . At times, substantial issues can be resolved in a single paragraph and this report is a case in point.
Its aim is to include, as a consequence of EU enlargement to encompass ten countries from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean on 1Â May, the nine official languages of these countries â if not they are not already used â as working languages of the Court of First Instance.
Confirming and effectively implementing the principle of establishing all the languages of the European Union as official and working languages â as enshrined in the Treaties â is all the more important because, in the current context, we are seeing trends for the real and increasingly obvious dominance of some languages â those of the most populous countries â the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy â to the detriment of the languages of the other countries that are members of the European Union.
We should, therefore, always give consideration to protecting the language of each EU Member State.
Â Â  . With the accession of the new Member States, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Slovak, Slovene and Czech will become official languages of the European Union.
The draft Council decision on which the European Parliament is being consulted seeks, therefore, to add these languages to the list contained in ArticleÂ 29(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice.
According to the rapporteur and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, âthe proposal is properly founded and is the logical consequence of enlargement of the Union.
It can therefore be approved without amendmentâ (explanatory statement).
We also share this view, because it implies support for the fundamental principle of preserving the languages of the Member States as official languages of the Union.
This is the type of development that will ensure equality between Member States, which is a key value for preserving the European Union as an area of freedom and diversity.
Â Â  . The draft Council decision seeks to include, with a view to the new division of jurisdiction in direct actions and the enlargement of the Union, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Slovak, Slovene and Czech amongst the working languages established by ArticleÂ 35 of the Courtâs Rules of Procedure.
Following on from the new division of jurisdiction in direct actions between the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance set out by the Treaty of Nice, it is also appropriate to establish a rule to decide on the courtâs language of proceedings, provided that the requesting party is an institution.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . This proposal is part of an ongoing review of the legislation to prevent and combat future outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Classical Swine Fever.
It updates Directive 90/426/EEC on the import of equidae and Directive 92/65/EEC on animal health requirements governing trade in imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos.
It aims to rationalise, strengthen and update the legislation governing the importation into the Community of wild and domestic animals susceptible to either FMD or CSF.
For the purposes of the Directive, ungulates are those animals listed in Annex I. Many of these species are not indigenous and are likely to be passing through the Community as part of circuses or zoo exchanges.
To take account of this, I have added a clarification to include transit whenever importation is mentioned in the Directive.
I welcome the flexibility provided for in the derogations.
However, derogations should only be made on a case-by-case basis so the risk of importing diseases is not increased.
Given the vital importance of proper information sources to facilitate a rapid response to any outbreak of a disease in the crucial early stages, I propose an amendment to Directive 90/426 on equidae which would arm us for such a coherent response by providing for the establishment of a Community Reference Laboratory for equine diseases.
Effective coordination requires a reliable and comprehensive store of knowledge on diagnosis and treatment of infectious equine diseases.
Â Â  . The recent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and classical swine fever (CSF) have prompted a thorough review of Community measures to prevent and combat these diseases, as part of the response to possible future outbreaks.
This proposal for a directive from the Commission seeks to strengthen and update the legislation governing the importation into the Community of wild and domestic animals susceptible to either FMD or CSF and, therefore, warrants our agreement in principle.
The proposal consolidates, in a single legal act, the requirements in the field of animal health for importing live ungulate animals and provides for a list to be laid down of third countries from which Member States may import such animals as well as the health requirements to be met.
We have no objections to the amendments that the rapporteur has tabled and therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  . The aim of the proposal for a directive before us is to lay down animal health rules for the importation into the Community of certain live ungulate animals, in other words, hoofed mammals.
The outbreaks of diseases in the European Union in recent years, in particular foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and classical swine fever (CSF), have prompted a thorough review of the Community measures to prevent and combat these diseases.
As part of the response to possible future outbreaks, the Commission proposes to streamline, strengthen and update the legislation governing the importation into the Community of wild and domestic animals of species at risk either of FMD or CSF.
By consolidating into one single act the rules governing imports of both wild and domestic ungulate animals, this proposal for a directive meets the food safety expectations of European consumers, thereby moving a step closer to the high level of health protection in the EU that we wish to see.
Â Â  . This proposal for a regulation is intended to be a vital tool in implementing Article 104 of the Treaty â under the excessive deficit procedure.
It seeks to establish a requirement that Member States must provide data on government debt (Maastricht government debt) on a quarterly basis, forming part of a general trend of switching towards quarterly compilation of statistical data, although the formal excessive deficit procedure will continue to be based on annual statistics.
According to the rapporteur, this will enable the budgetary situation of Member States to be monitored more closely, emerging budgetary problems to be pinpointed earlier and a better understanding to be gained of the impact of efforts made by Member States.
The rapporteur could not have made herself clearer.
Here is a further example of a policy â in this case the Stability Pact â that requires an accurate statistical instrument.
Nevertheless, yet again, a statistical amendment has had a significant political impact, thereby increasing peer pressure on a Member State that has strayed from the aims of budgetary consolidation set out in its stability programme, and from fulfilling the aims of the Stability Pact.
The major concern over this instrument is, therefore, political, especially with regard to its purpose.
This is much more important than other concerns over the costs of compiling the statistics, of complying with the annual indicator or of having to compile statistics retroactively.
Â Â  The radical Members abstained in the vote on the Lehne report concerning the request for defence of the immunity of MrÂ Pannella because, even though we do not question the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Marketâs statement of its opinion, we believe that we should not be complacent about the need to affirm at every appropriate stage, Parliamentâs prerogatives vis-Ã -vis Member States.
Indeed, it seems neither appropriate nor useful to be able to take action to limit the personal freedom of a Member of the European Parliament, even if on the basis of a judgment that has the force of without Parliament being informed of this and thus being able, if necessary, to take the necessary steps to express its opinion on reviewing the limits on its Membersâ prerogatives.
Although in this case Parliamentâs decision might appear to be justified â and we must also consider that the measures to restrict MrÂ Pannellaâs freedom have meanwhile been dropped â we must not in any way interpret this as a precedent, should a similar case arise in the future.
Â Â  . Every year in the EU, some five million people have accidents at work, leading to absences of more than three days, and this amounts to 146Â million working days lost.
Some of these accidents have lasting consequences and affect both the victimâs ability to work and his or her life outside work.
I therefore welcome Mr Perez Alvarezâs report, which illustrates the importance of adopting this directive aimed at raising health and safety standards.
In spite of the introduction, in the Council common position, of amendments approved at first reading by Parliament, certain elements still need to be strengthened:
- preventive measures must be established to reduce risk.
Employers must determine and assess risks and inform the workers of these risks.
The participation, consultation and training of workers must also be encouraged.
- where exposure above the limit values is detected, workers must have the right to a medical examination and to access their health records.
Should workersâ health be adversely affected as a result of such exposure, the employer must take steps to reassess the risks.
- this directive must provide dissuasive sanctions to be applied by the Member States in the event of infringement of national legislation.
In order to make Europe a better place in which to work, this directive must be adopted without delay.
Â Â  . The Council common position lays down exposure limit values on the basis of the biological health effects.
The possible long-term adverse effects of exposure are not being taken into account, because the scientific data are not beyond challenge.
The common position also sets action values, measurable parameters which, if observed, will ensure that exposure limit values are not exceeded.
In addition, it sets out preventive measures to reduce the risks to which workers are exposed.
These rest primarily on the obligation incumbent on employers to determine and assess risks.
The common position likewise makes provision for workers to be informed and trained.
On the whole the common position allows for the main aims and for a number of amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, while some aspects fall short of what is required.
The rapporteur therefore considers that it would be desirable to reinstate the right to a medical examination in the event of overexposure and to strengthen the prevention system set up by the directive.
This directive must also contain a provision relating to the penalties to be enforced under national legislation pursuant to the directive.
Â Â  . I welcome this proposal for a directive, which falls under the heading of measures to improve the working environment and is intended to protect the health and safety of each worker individually as well as to form part of a bedrock of minimum protection designed to avert possible distortions of competition.
The âmore and better jobsâ element of the Lisbon Strategy requires the EU to draw up and establish stringent demands with regard to the quality of working conditions across EU territory, which entails improving the dignity of labour and the quality of life of our citizens.
Lastly, as I said in my explanation of vote on MrÂ Garganiâs report, on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens and mutagens at work (2Â September 2003), we must eliminate dangers that are so often hidden, such as those addressed in this report.
In other words, prevention is much better than cure and is, similarly, much better than compensation.
I therefore endorse Mr Alvarezâs final suggestion, which states that it would be desirable to reinstate the right to a medical examination in the event of overexposure â as proposed by Parliament â and to strengthen the prevention system set up by the directive.
Â Â  . The task of achieving equality between men and women is a vital one for the EU, which has an obligation to be proactive in promoting all actions to this end.
This excellent report seeks to establish a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women.
This programme for the period 2004-2005 will have at its disposal some EURÂ 2.2 million to support such organisations by means of operating grants.
The activities of these organisations will make it possible to carry out:
â awareness-raising activities and dissemination of information,
â actions to promote the reconciliation of private and professional life, and the participation of women in decision-making processes; as well as actions to combat violence against women, gender stereotyping and discrimination in the workplace,
â and, lastly, measures to encourage cooperation with womenâs organisations in third countries and to raise awareness of womenâs issues around the world.
I voted in favour of this recommendation for second reading, which is the fruit of a compromise between the Council and Parliament.
This provides, on an exceptional basis, for transitional clauses concerning the period of eligibility of expenditure to be introduced in this programme.
Â Â  . The purpose of this proposal is to establish a basic act for operating grants to be awarded to the European Womenâs Lobby and to other organisations active at European level in the field of equality.
This act is necessary to ensure compliance with the current Financial Regulation applicable to the EUâs general budget.
The following will thus receive support:
Part 1 â the European Womenâs Lobby;
Part 2 â the ongoing activities of an organisation pursuing an objective of general European interest in the field of gender equality or an objective forming part of EU policy in this area;
Part 3 â any specific actions.
The Council accepted various proposals by Parliament, but rejected the proposal to extend the deadline for the 2004-2005 programme until 2008 and to increase the budget from EURÂ 2.222 million to EURÂ 5.5 million.
The budget for 2004-2005 remained at EURÂ 2.2 million and the request to specify more clearly the activities of the lobby to be supported, replacing âetcâ with âgender mainstreaming in the areas of education, sport, health and social securityâ and âcooperation with womenâs associations from third countriesâ was not granted. This is something that we regret.
The rapporteur proposes that the common position be approved, with just one additional article on the âtransitional clausesâ, already agreed with the Council.
Â Â  . It is certainly laudable to create a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women.
This is all the more important because of the mechanisms of exclusivity that have led to situations of privilege and discrimination in favour of womenâs organisations associated with the European Womenâs Lobby.
Such mechanisms violate human rights and run counter to the basic principles of free and pluralistic social organisation.
At first reading, the rapporteurâs proposals sought to redress this imbalance, but the leftist dogma of the committee concerned saw to it that, once again, unequal treatment and opportunities in favour of womenâs organisations prevailed.
Quite apart from the concerns surrounding this injustice itself, it is grotesque that this situation has been brought about by a committee whose very is to defend womenâs rights and equal opportunities.
The Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities should have a duty to provide a voice and a clear vision for the majority of women, for diversity and a plurality of opinions and interests.
The second reading managed to avoid watering down the initial proposals and to prevent a disastrous and unjust outcome.
There is hope, therefore, of a real improvement in the situation.
Â Â  . The overall aim of EU policy on development cooperation should be to combat poverty and to eradicate it once and for all.
In order to combat poverty effectively â in addition to combating neo-liberalism â equal opportunities between men and women must be established, and women must also play a more active role in the field of politics.
At the 4th World Conference on Women, which took place in Beijing in 1995, a clear agenda was drawn up, aimed at promoting equal rights between men and women, for the first time.
This led the EU to draw up Council Regulation (EC) No 2836/98 on integrating gender issues in development cooperation.
In 2001, an action programme on the mainstreaming of gender equality was adopted in Community development cooperation, which expires in 2006.
Regulation (EC) No 2836/98 is the legal base for budget heading B7-6220 (21.02.06) on Integrating Gender issues in Development Cooperation.
Having expired on 31 December 2003, it must be replaced by the proposal before us.
As joint legislator, Parliament must state that the Commission was very late in tabling the proposal for a new regulation.
The Commission accepted the overwhelming majority of Parliamentâs amendments, but ...
Â Â  . As I stated at first reading, measures must be funded in the area of development cooperation to combat poverty and disease and to develop solutions for education, within a culture of safeguarding basic human rights.
I am, of course, unreservedly in favour of adopting measures that may contribute towards implementing the aims of helping the poorest people.
At first reading, I voted in favour of the report, because I was convinced that the rapporteurâs suggestions would help to fulfil these objectives.
Given that 20 of the 21 amendments tabled by Parliament were accepted by the Council and the Commission, I support this report.
I should like to pinpoint one concern, which I fear has not been properly addressed, and that is the definition of âsexual and reproductive healthâ.
This is a legitimate concern, but it must not be twisted, and turned into a catch-all term covering the development of international programmes to promote abortion, which I would condemn in the strongest terms.
It must be specified that the term âsexual and reproductive healthâ refers to the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, and to the provision of decent conditions for pregnancy, labour, childbirth and post-natal care.
Â Â  . I do not have any objections to the rapporteurâs amendments to the Council common position.
In light of the succession of food crises and of factors in food contamination, such as the presence of dioxins, regulatory frameworks must be created to enhance food safety, of which the hygiene of food for human consumption is an essential component.
The âfarm-to-tableâ principle should be the central theme of the proposed regulation.
A range of measures should be created for the hygiene of all food products in circulation in the Community, including imported goods, along with measures to increase the responsibility of food business operators.
While regulations should aim towards equal application across all Member States, there must be some degree of flexibility to take account of local variations.
Lastly, I should like to express my agreement with Amendment NoÂ 6, which is intended to ensure that the Commission does not have the general power to amend Annexes I and II, adopted under codecision by Parliament and the Council.
Â Â  . Given the importance of ensuring the protection and conservation of the diversity of high-quality traditional and regional foodstuffs, it is only fair to small farmers and producers of small quantities of primary products that Amendment NoÂ 3 of this report should be adopted.
Accordingly, hygiene rules must not compromise âtraditional production methods or raw materials, which can be proven on the basis of scientific findings, established practice or tradition, to form part of the manufacturing process and not to compromise the hygienic quality of foodstuffsâ.
Member States must, therefore, in conjunction with the Commission, be allowed to adopt amendments to the provisions in Annexes II and III, to accommodate the needs of food businesses situated in regions that are subject to special constraints.
This is true of Portuguese cheeses, such as cheese from the Serra da Estrela, given that changes in production conditions may adversely affect the flavour and quality of the product.
Nor do we have any objections to the remaining amendments, which seek, as the rapporteur states, to clarify the structure of this legislative text.
Â Â  As the rapporteur himself says, this proposal for a regulation is an integral part of the overall endeavour to improve food safety within the EU, product quality in third countries exporting to the EU and Community legislation in the area, in this case concerning products of animal origin.
The central figure in the proposed system of official controls is the official veterinarian, who should be provided with both the legal and the technical means to carry out his duties, and this entails public funding.
Foot-and-mouth disease is a good example of the lack of investment in the area of food product inspections.
I should like to express my agreement with Amendment NoÂ 2, aimed at removing from the scope of the regulation the primary production of foodstuffs for private domestic use and the direct supply by the producer of small quantities of primary products to the final consumer or to local shops and restaurants, which are to be subject to national rules.
I also endorse the special treatment accorded to âartisanal small businessesâ producing exclusively for a limited local market.
I also agree with the inclusion, with respect to fishery products, of products derived from aquaculture, without which fishery product controls would be incomplete.
Â Â  . The four reports by MrÂ Schnellhardt adopted today deal with the various aspects of ensuring proper hygiene in the production of foodstuffs as well as rigorous checks and controls.
I fully support the objectives of this regulation.
It is essential that we as regulators ensure a high degree of protection for human life and health.
I believe that the farm-to-table principle has now become a core principle which underpins all regulation in the food and feed area.
In the life of the current Parliament we have agreed a whole new regulatory environment for the sector, and that is something of which this House, and of course Commissioner Byrne, can be justly proud.
I certainly hope that the end result of all this legislation is to increase the responsibility of food business operators both in primary production and in subsequent stages of production.
In conclusion, our overriding aim in all of this must be to decide on the policy that best protects our consumers.
We have an obligation as legislators to create a legal framework that bolsters the confidence of our consumers in the food they buy and eat.
Â Â  . These four recommendations for a second reading on food hygiene and the organisation of official controls form part of a process of legislative reform â the current system is spread across 17 directives, some of which date from 1964 â and adhere to the principle that producers are entirely responsible for the foodstuffs that they produce.
The intention is, therefore, to enforce hygiene rules at all stages, from the farm to the table.
The new legislative package is based on the HACCP system (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point).
I agree with the rapporteur that primary production for private domestic use and the direct supply of small quantities of primary products to the final consumer or to local shops and restaurants should not be subject to the same rules as large-scale production.
I also endorse his suggestion that account should be taken of traditional production methods.
The creation of the concept of âartisanal small businessâ is also a positive step in this regard.
I voted in favour of these recommendations.
Â Â  . The Transparency Directive is one of those needed to complete the financial services action plan, which aims to establish an internal market for financial services in 2005.
The last Spring Council notified Parliament of its wish to complete this process before the forthcoming European elections.
Our opposition to this process, which forms part of the Lisbon Strategy, revolves not solely around federalist issues relating to legislative harmonisation and to the effective loss of sovereignty over monitoring financial services markets and those operating in these markets, it is also based on economic considerations, given that the unchecked movement of capital and the speculative nature of a market focused on the short term and on accruing capital gains are responsible for increased volatility and for the likelihood of financial crises, which affect economic growth and jobs.
The issue of information made available to investors is crucial, not in order to appease investors, but to ensure transparency and truth, which were both absent from the recent financial scandals involving Enron and Worldcom, along with Parmalat in Europe.
While we are purporting to protect small investors and small undertakings, efforts are being made to deregulate and reduce the cost of capital for, of course, the large multinational corporations.
Â Â  The June Movement has voted in favour of Amendment NoÂ 39.
We did not want to see the clause on education removed but, in our judgment, the ability of the Member States to take further steps is a consideration that must weigh more heavily than our position that the EU must not interfere in issues of education.
Â Â  . This proposal for a directive is based on Article 13 of the Treaty, which authorises the EU to take action to combat discrimination, in this case discrimination based on sex.
We have waited for a long time to adopt a directive on promoting equality between the sexes in areas other than work.
Discrimination based on sex is rife in the access to and supply of goods and services, both in the public and private sectors.
This proposal for a directive provides for prohibiting the use of gender as a factor in calculating insurance premiums and other financial services.
In the insurance sector, the âgenderâ factor is used arbitrarily for calculating risk, simply because it is a quick and cheap method.
There is a further form of discrimination that must stop: women should not be penalised because they live longer, and certainly not because they have children and look after them.
The insurance sector must adapt its methods of calculating premiums to the principle of equal treatment and those calculations must be based on strictly objective criteria.
I consequently voted in favour of this proposal for a directive.
Â Â  By voting in favour of this report, I want to emphasise the need for a directiveÂ âÂ based on Article 13 of the EC TreatyÂ âÂ on the equality of women and men in areas other than employment.
Vigilance does, however, remain appropriate, and fighting for genuine equality, actual equality between women and men in all areas of economic, social and political life, is a constant battle that must be continued.
I will take the example of the scope of the directive.
Following significant misgivings and strong resistance on the part of several interest groups, in particular the media sector, the scope of this directive has been âwatered downâ to only now cover access to, and supply of, goods and services, thus leaving aside other areas such as media and advertising content, education and the decision-making process.
At any rate, this proposal must be welcomed as a logical and necessary step towards implementing a policy that will enable sexual discrimination to be fully combated and equality in areas other than employment to be guaranteed.
Â Â  . This is an important report dealing with the issue of gender equality regarding access to, and supply of, services.
I agree with the Commission proposal as to the scope of the Directive.
While social protection, social security and social advantages are important areas, they cannot be considered 'services' and are best dealt with elsewhere.
I welcome the general thrust of the proposal and share the aims which underpin it.
I believe that it will serve to reinforce values and norms which are already well established in many Member States.
Ireland, for example, adopted the 'Equal Status Act' in 2000, and our legislation outlaws direct and indirect discrimination, including discrimination on grounds of gender, marital status and family status.
This applies not only to the workplace and job market but also to access to, and supply of, goods and services.
In general the EU has made a very positive contribution to establishing gender equality right across a range of areas.
This is something that should be highlighted, particularly at election time.
There is too much criticism of EU regulation and the onus is on us legislators to demonstrate the host of valuable measures that have originated here which improve the status and condition of women.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mrs Prets on her report on the proposal for a Council directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services.
I support this report, especially as to the adoption of a proactive approach, in line with the approach already adopted in the Treaty.
Equality between men and women, which is a core value of European civil society, is a right that belongs to all European citizens.
It is therefore incumbent on EU institutions to protect that right in all fields.
We therefore urge the Commission to submit new proposals aimed at effectively combating discrimination based on sex and at ensuring genuine equality in areas other than work.
Â Â  . This directive on equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services has been in the pipeline for a long time â it was first included on the Commissionâs social policy agenda in June 2000.
It is worth stating that, fortunately, equality between men and women is, today, a reality that is legally enshrined and widely enjoyed, apart from a few specific problems that still need to be ironed out.
The aim of the proposal before us is to combat discrimination in areas such as private pensions and insurance.
Recent studies have shown that insurance companies calculate premiums differently according to sex.
With types of cover in which greater life expectancy works against the interests of the insurers, women are penalised for living longer.
Car insurance, however, functions in exactly the opposite way, as statistics show that women have fewer accidents.
I agree with the rapporteur that the use of gender â a factor that is beyond the control of individuals â as a criterion for calculation is wrong and, since it does not stand up to objective scrutiny, constitutes discrimination.
I abstained from the final vote, however, as I feel that many aspects have not been given due consideration and that the vote in plenary on the amendments did not enable ...
Â Â  Mr President, the long-distance transport of live animals is a barbaric practice, and it should stop.
Every year, three million animals are still being transported within Europe and to third countries.
If animals are to be slaughtered, this should be done as close to their place of rearing and fattening as possible.
Animals are not commodities that can simply be transported; meat, on the other hand, is a product, and it be.
The transport of animals that are not intended for slaughter must meet all animal welfare rules.
Although it may be necessary to provide for exemptions in sparsely populated and remote areas, the transport of slaughter animals over long distances must be banned.
Subsidies for transport of this kind, which currently still amount to EUR 60 million per annum, must be abolished.
Mr Maat's report is a praiseworthy attempt to regulate transport more effectively, but it fails to accommodate our principles and our expectations.
Â Â  Despite the efforts by MrÂ Maat, a Member of the European Parliament, to improve the Council position, I feel that the rejection of almost all of the amendments seeking to further strengthen the protection of animals during transportation justified my vote against the report.
Unfortunately, we have not achieved what I feel is correct and respectful transportation of animals.
Â Â  . I abstained in the vote on the proposal for a regulation on the protection of animals during transport because of the lack of integrity in the overall report.
On the one hand, I feel it was politically motivated rather than scientifically based.
It is unacceptable to legislate on the basis of making science fit regulation.
The welfare of our animals deserves regulation that is based on best scientific practice.
On the other hand, it has to be questionable whether a nine-hour cap on the transport of animals is legally possible in the single market.
Â Â  . I voted against the Maat report because it does not do enough to protect the welfare of animals.
It is a disgrace that animals are transported alive to be slaughtered.
Even if this is to happen journeys must be a maximum of eight hours and then it must be in properly maintained vehicles, with food and water.
This report as voted is a bitter disappointment, as is the Commission's original ill-prepared proposal.
Â Â  .
This regulation concerns animal welfare, but is underpinned by various economic and national interests, with the meat sector generating many millions of euros, and the Commissionâs apparent confusion and the changes in legislation are symptomatic of this.
Compulsory unloading for rest causes the animals stress and can spread diseases, such as foot-and-mouth.
Long journeys for animals must be reduced as far as possible, especially for transport to the slaughterhouse, for veterinary and animal welfare reasons, on the one hand, and for reasons of economic development, on the other.
It makes no sense to export or import live animals for slaughter, when the meat or the carcass could be exported, which would ensure that much of the added value would stay in the region in which they were reared, thereby generating jobs and improving product quality.
This policy has been undermined, both by the systematic closure of local slaughterhouses and their replacement by larger, centralised facilities, and by the lack of support for mobile abattoirs.
Travelling times to the slaughterhouse must be reduced as far as possible and international transport for slaughter must be banned completely.
We must also implement a harmonised framework, with travelling time limits for transporting animals for other purposes.
We are not satisfied with the report before us.
Â Â  . I voted against the Maat report and the majority of the amendments because I am against any excessive regulation that only spurs on the bureaucrats.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
Â Â  . Farm animals bred for human consumption have become the victim of the introduction of cheap, long-distance lorry transport.
Before fattening or slaughtering, injured, starving and dehydrated animals are transported from one country to another.
For years, such abuses were hardly open for discussion in this Parliament, despite the petitions that have been submitted about them.
It is a step forward that a regulation is now being accepted in which requirements are stipulated for the means of transport, duration of transport and treatment.
An upper limit of eight hours or 500 kilometres is backed as a standard by tens of thousands of signatures in the Netherlands, but, to many in North-Western Europe, myself included, it does not go far enough.
There are, however, organisations of those with economic interests that consider such standards to create too much work and expense.
This opinion is held not only by those on the Right, but also, unfortunately, those on the Left, in southern Europe, where national public opinion is not yet geared towards priority to better animal welfare.
Animal welfare organisations have a long way to go in order to convince the public and politicians over there.
My party, the Dutch Socialist Party, takes the view that economic benefit should be secondary to more important things, such as the decent treatment of animals.
I support all amendments which provide for the most far-reaching protection, even if today, regrettably, they do not yet receive a majority.
Â Â  . The MEPs of the VVD, the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, have voted in favour of the Maat report, even though the amendments that it regards as essential have only partly been adopted in the compromises.
We are of the opinion, though, that not only travelling times are determining factors in the quality of animal transport.
The quality of transport conditions is vital.
Longer transport times for slaughter animals must be possible if the quality of transport allows for this.
Certified hauliers must be given this option.
This position is partly reflected in Amendments Nos 64 and 81.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the BÃ¶sch report on the protection of the financial interests of the Communities because it makes a useful contribution to the fight against fraud at European level.
The report also shows that there is still a lot to do.
In 1999, the Commission came into office promising a policy of zero tolerance as regards fraud and corruption, but today it is bequeathing to its successors half-suppressed scandals (Eurostat) and âan unprecedented welter of sometimes contradictory rules and newly established units and bodies, making turf wars and mutual buck-passing inevitableâ (paragraph 2).
This is why I added my name to the proposed motion of censure on this matter which will, I hope, be put to the vote at the next part-session.
Moreover, the BÃ¶sch report points out the extraordinarily high number of live cattle exported in 2002 to Lebanon (121Â 027 tonnes) that benefited from financial export refunds.
Of course, all that smacks of fraud.
This is an opportunity to draw attention to the fact that export refunds have helped cause unfair criticism to be heaped onto the entire common agricultural policy, and that this rotten branch really should be cut off to save the rest.
Â Â  . The Commission has asked for 50% more money for the budget, but the richest Member States want to restrict expenditure to 1% of GNP.
Some of the money needed for solidarity with the poorest regions within the current EU and the future enlargement regions can be found by actually putting a stop to persistent fraud.
The Commission's annual report for 2002 reports irregularities and fraud cases amounting to EUR 2.12Â billion, only EUR 80.6 million of which could be claimed back.
In that selfsame year, OLAF, the anti-fraud office, completed 652 inquiries, involving a total loss of EUR 937 million.
The Eurostat fraud has been excluded from these inquiries, and the Commission has not learnt from past experience that it is preferable for the responsibility for budget and accounts on the one hand and financial inspection and fraud control on the other hand not to be in the hands of one and the same Commissioner.
Deceit is probably involved in the enormous subsidies â to the tune of EUR 52 million â paid for the export of live cattle to Lebanon.
OLAF is accusing journalists of having paid money in order to be able to publish secret fraud information, but cannot substantiate these accusations.
External advisory offices, in which former officials are involved, have received EUR 115 million.
Consequently, the theme of the 2004 elections will once again have to be the fight against the European Fraud Union.
Â Â  . This annual report follows up Article 280 of the Treaty, relating to the policy of preventing and fighting fraud in the EU.
Firstly, it is regrettable that the Eurostat affair was not included, which highlighted the risks inherent in the Commissionâs outsourcing policy and the fact that outsourcing should only be used as a last resort.
Secondly, the report shows that the number of cases of fraud and irregularities reported in 2002 has risen by 13% to over EURÂ two billion, most of these under the Structural Funds.
It should be noted that the year in question was an unusual year due to the conclusion of the programmes for the period 1994-1999.
Germany and the Netherlands accounted for almost two-thirds of irregularities, and for 55% of fraud and irregularities in traditional own resources, namely unpaid customs duties and unpaid duties on goods moving within the EU.
It is therefore essential that we implement measures effectively to coordinate the fight against smuggling, particularly of tobacco and alcohol.
Lastly, I agree with the rapporteur on the need for a Commissioner to be exclusively responsible for budgetary control and that the European Central Bank should report all cases of fraud since 1999 to OLAF.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote(1).
(2)
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the joint initiative for peace, stability and democracy throughout the Middle East.
Â Â  . Mr President, as we meet to discuss the situation throughout the Middle East today, tensions in the region are high â and understandably so.
The killing of the Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and seven other Palestinians by Israeli forces last week has resulted in outrage across the region.
The European Union condemned this extrajudicial killing as contrary to international law.
In an already inflamed situation, it is vital that all sides exercise restraint and refrain from acts of violence which will only lead to more deaths and which will put a peaceful settlement further beyond reach.
Against this backdrop, the Arab League Summit scheduled for this week in Tunis has been cancelled.
Now, more than ever before, there is a need for the countries of the region to choose the path of peace and to turn away from the path of violence and recrimination.
There is a need for governments to show leadership for peace, and to turn away from the politics of the last atrocity, which serve no oneâs interest.
Elsewhere in the region, in Iraq the security situation remains a cause of grave concern.
It is disturbing that recent attacks have aimed at maximising civilian casualties and have been intended to promote sectarian violence.
A secure, democratic and peaceful Iraq, within its present borders, can exert a positive influence for peace and stability across the entire region.
The European Union looks forward to the transition to a representative Iraqi administration and is committed to working with the people of Iraq in securing a peaceful and stable future for that country.
There is a pressing need for action to address the various problems and challenges to peace and prosperity throughout the Middle East.
I believe that the European Union is ideally placed to make a contribution in support of this objective.
Historically, the European Union has enjoyed a close relationship with the countries of the southern Mediterranean and the Middle East, built up through centuries of intertwined history, commerce and exchange.
We are not strangers to each other.
Indeed, through Euromed and the Barcelona Process, the Union has enjoyed a structured relationship with countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean for ten years.
The Barcelona framework is comprehensive in scope â covering political, economic, social and security issues of mutual interest.
It commits us to working towards a shared zone of peace, prosperity and progress.
In the economic sphere we are working towards the establishment of a free trade zone with a market of 700Â million people by 2010.
The possibilities offered by this vast market will lead to a growth in employment, prosperity and stability right across the partnership.
The Union has also concluded Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with all but one of the Euromed countries, and I hope that the negotiations with the remaining country will be concluded soon so that the grid of arrangements can be completed.
I would urge all partners to expedite ratification of these agreements, which are an important instrument in developing economic relationships between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries.
An important element of our engagement has also been to promote democracy, good governance and the rule of law.
This is in line with the conclusions drawn by the 2002 UNDP Arab Human Development Report.
Significant funding has already been made available by the Commission in support of programmes which promote these objectives.
The Union has also developed a framework of cooperation and dialogue with the countries of the Gulf through the Gulf Cooperation Council.
At present we are working with our partners in the GCC to achieve a free trade agreement.
Although negotiations have been long, and at times difficult, they are now moving in the right direction.
In addition we are considering ways to develop relationships with Yemen and Libya, and reflecting on our relationship with Iran.
It is clear that the Union already has a deep and close relationship with the countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.
It is one based on partnership and dialogue, and on a willingness to work together to address the challenges facing the region.
It is also a relationship that is based on the recognition of the strategic importance which each represents to the other.
We are their neighbours just as they are our neighbours, and it is in our shared interest to see a zone of security, prosperity and progress develop across the wider region.
In recognition of the importance of the region to Europe, the European Union is currently working to develop a Strategic Partnership with the Middle East and the Mediterranean following a mandate from the European Council in December 2003.
This is also a key objective of the European Security Strategy, again adopted in December 2003.
Security and stability is a shared interest of the countries of the region and of the European Union.
We need to do more to address the causes of instability which afflict the region â causes which include lack of economic development, under-developed educational opportunities and the need to promote open societies and economies.
Our primary objective is to promote the development, through partnership, of a common zone of peace, prosperity and progress across the Mediterranean and into the Middle East.
The goal is to enjoy close and cooperative relations with all the countries of the region, responding as far as possible to initiatives from within the region itself.
Resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict is a strategic priority.
However, reform in the region should not be conditional on progress in the Middle East Peace Process â or vice versa â but both objects should be pursued in tandem.
This is the context that informed the adoption of the interim report presented to last weekâs General Affairs and External Relations Council and endorsed by the European Council.
The interim report proposes an EU Strategic Partnership with the Mediterranean and the Middle East.
It sets out a series of shared understandings held by the members of the Union with regard to relations with the region, proposes key principles and objectives which might inform our strategic partnership and proposes these together with work programmes for the Mediterranean and the Gulf as a means to implement our partnership.
It is also essential that the impetus for reform comes from within.
There is already much being done, both at governmental level and by civil society. It is for the region itself to work out an appropriate way forward.
Equally, there can be no 'one-size-fits-all' solution to the challenges facing the region.
We are actively consulting with partners in the region who are our key interlocutors.
This will be an essential element in preparing our final report for the European Council in June.
In this spirit, the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, in his capacity as President of the European Council, had planned to address the Arab League Summit in Tunis yesterday, as a further step in our intensified consultations with the region.
But, as I have already noted, that meeting was cancelled.
Foreign Minister Cowen is currently in the region, holding a series of meetings with key interlocutors.
The presidency's commitment to consultation and dialogue remains absolute.
We will continue this process at the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Mid-Term Ministerial Meeting to be held in Dublin and at the Ministerial Meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
I have already commented on the need for progress in the Middle East Peace Process.
There can be no long-term solution in the region without the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict which has cost so many lives on all sides.
Implementation of the Quartet Roadmap remains the basis for reaching a lasting comprehensive settlement resulting in two viable, sovereign and independent states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.
As members of the Quartet, we will continue to work towards this end.
Acts of violence by either side cannot contribute to advancing the political process necessary to reach such a settlement, and such acts, therefore, must be rejected.
The countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East are facing a broad range of challenges politically, economically and socially.
Equally, those countries possess enormous potential which, if fulfilled, would result in benefits for all the peoples of the region.
Progress in all areas â economics, commerce, education, democracy and civil society â is essential if the conditions for lasting peace and stability across the region are to be achieved.
The European Union is committed to working as good neighbours with the governments and peoples of the region towards this end, which is in all our shared interests.
Â Â  . Mr President, may I first thank Parliament for making time for this debate.
There are so many other things which Parliament has to discuss, but it is exceptionally important that today we should have a chance to discuss the Mediterranean and the Middle East because the directions we set for our policies in this region in the coming months should be thoroughly discussed and debated here; they involve fundamental decisions on how we are going to develop our relationship with our neighbours; and they involve fundamental decisions which will affect the whole relationship for the first part of this century between Europe and the Islamic world.
My friend and colleague from the presidency has explained very clearly the principles in the interim report adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the European Union last week and he explained how, through a series of intensive consultations with the region, they will form the basis of a concrete work programme to be presented to the European Council in June.
I would like, however, to underline that we are not starting from scratch: rather, we are building on a comprehensive partnership with the Mediterranean countries and a set of bilateral relations with the countries east of Jordan.
We will continue to develop our partnership on the basis of these existing instruments.
I would add here that Europe is the most significant player in the region.
The Community now spends close to EUR 1 billion a year in the region in promoting economic reforms, sectoral reform, institutional and political reform and in supporting sustainable development across the region, including our specific funds for supporting the Palestinians and for the reconstruction of Iraq.
If one adds in the lending from the European Investment Bank, it makes a total of around EUR 2.5 billion a year.
Furthermore, the European Union is the biggest trading partner for every country in the region except Jordan.
So with this level of involvement, why has economic development and political reform been so slow to take off around the Mediterranean?
Why is the human development gap still so great?
The answer is two-fold: first of all, our approach is a long-term one which bears fruit incrementally, but I would venture that working on the basis of partnership, consultation and ownership of the reform process by reformers in the region will give us more solid and sustainable results than any attempts to impose democracy from the outside, whether through lectures or through the barrel of a gun.
But secondly, and crucially, it is important to remember that the Barcelona process was formulated in an atmosphere of optimism, in the aftermath of the Oslo agreements.
Stalemate in the peace process in the Middle East has time and again stymied progress on reform.
Recent events are another sad but powerful confirmation that, as our report put it, it will not be possible to build a common zone of peace, prosperity and progress unless a just and lasting settlement of the conflict is in place.
Once again â and I am afraid I have had to say this all too often in speeches in this Chamber â we stand before the smoking ruins of the peace process. And this at a time when we had some hope of movement: the cancelled Arab League Summit was expected to provide a positive impetus to the peace process by relaunching its Beirut peace initiative.
How, I wonder â and I expect this question comes to the minds of many honourable Members â has Sheikh Yassin's assassination helped to improve the security of the Israeli people?
How has it contributed to even the stated goal of a peaceful and consensual withdrawal from Gaza?
I thought, and I still hope, that we had already seen the worst of the atrocities carried out by suicide bombers.
But what we have witnessed lately is wickedness beyond imagination: for example, a frightened adolescent, explosives strapped to his body, is told that he will go to heaven and is sent out to kill himself and others at a military checkpoint.
It is despicable and it is cowardly.
What kind of world have we created when 12-year-olds are out on murder missions like that rather than playing football or doing their homework?
And what are the circumstances?
What is the environment that creates this culture of death and murderous recrimination?
My broader point is that if we are serious about wanting reform in the Arab World then, as the European Security Strategy states, resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict remains a strategic priority.
It is what philosophers would call a necessary but not sufficient condition.
Progress cannot be a pre-condition for confronting the challenges of reform, nor vice versa.
But to attempt one without the other is, in my view, only too likely to prove a recipe for failure on both counts.
I regret, then, that the Arab League summit could not take place as planned, not least because it was expected to adopt a common declaration on domestic reform which would have been an important staging post in developing our common agenda.
But working in this part of the world means, almost by definition, that one has to remain hopeful, so I hope that our Arab partners will be able to come together again soon.
We are certainly prepared to do what we can to help.
I also believe that we now have a European Union position which we can take into consultations with the region with some confidence of generating new momentum in our relations with our Mediterranean and Middle Eastern neighbours.
Insofar as that is true, we are very grateful to the Irish presidency for the creative work it has done, both intellectually and diplomatically.
I also hope that our friends across the Atlantic are recognising that our long-term, consensus-building approach has some value, based, as it is, on building common agendas that respect differences of approach in different countries and regions.
The Greater Middle East initiative from the United States generated controversy in the region, mainly because the objectives appeared to have been set without any real consultation process with the region.
In the furore surrounding this, few paid attention to the substance.
In content, what they are suggesting could involve the development of American policy towards the region based on the kind of comprehensive and long-term engagement which we have been advocating and trying to implement for many years.
We have much to talk about with officials in Washington if they are prepared to match this commitment with appropriate levels of resources.
Time will tell, but whatever the results, the European Union should focus on developing its own strategic partnership with the region.
If we are successful, I believe we can make a significant contribution to fighting terrorism in Europe and in the region, one that is as important as the proposals to strengthen the European Union's internal security that I know will be discussed by Parliament tomorrow.
It will take us another step down the road towards a central objective of the EUâs Security Strategy, namely: 'to promote a ring of well-governed countries âŠ on the borders of the Mediterranean with whom we can enjoy close and cooperative relations'.
I make one final point which builds on what I have just said.
We spent last Thursday and Friday in the Council discussing what this extraordinary circle of democracies in Europe can do to protect our way of life, our prosperity, our values, our belief in the rule of law and in civil liberties and the lives of our citizens; and what we can do in Europe to prevent more of the terrorist atrocities which have driven daggers into the hearts of many European families.
There are many things we have to do internally.
There are many things we have to do in the areas of police and judicial cooperation.
I have no doubt whatsoever that one of the most important things we have to do is to work more energetically, more creatively, day and night, to try to bring peace to the Middle East.
The conflict does not justify anything any terrorist ever does and a number of terrorists and those who support terrorists use the plight of Palestinians and use the position in the Middle East as a wicked justification for the misery and mayhem they create.
That is true.
It is also true that one should not appease terrorism. It is true that there are important security aspects involved.
But we all recognise as well that to bring peace to the Middle East would remove one of the causes of alienation in country after country which helps to provide a breeding ground for terrorism and for the murderous ideas that terrorists espouse.
So I hope that we will be able to work more enthusiastically and more successfully to bring peace to the Middle East, and that the beneficiaries of that peace will not only be the people of Israel and the people of Palestine, but the people of Europe and the wider world as well.
Â Â  It might be useful for me to point out to colleagues â as I did last week to the Conference of Presidents â that last week in Athens we successfully co-launched a partnership: the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
Indeed, it builds precisely on the long-term perspective mentioned in the last two speeches.
It is a partnership of 240 Members of Parliament: 120 from the partner states and the southern shore of the Mediterranean, 120 from the EU national parliaments and the European Parliament.
We have still to fill in the personnel, but we have established the outline of the bureaux and the composition of three working committees which will prepare future parliamentary assembly work â a Political Affairs Committee, an Economic Affairs Committee and a Social Affairs and Cultural Exchange Committee.
It is an important parliamentary aspect and a good platform to build on.
Unfortunately, the timing was such that both of the speakers here today â the Council and the Commission â were tied up with the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels preparing the summit meeting and were unable to participate.
Both institutions acknowledged the launch of this Assembly and both wished it well.
We need as a Parliament to ensure that future meetings are arranged at a time to enable the Council and the Commission to participate, because the parliamentary part is, and can be, an invaluable long-term development and communications platform.
Â Â  MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, last Monday 22 March, there took place in Athens the inaugural session of this Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, of whose future importance in relations on both sides of the Mediterranean PresidentÂ Cox just reminded us.
This session marked the culmination of the efforts made immediately after 11 September 2001 to reach, on both sides of the Mediterranean, a better mutual understanding and to dispel the spectre of war between civilisations, which is a potential consequence of the downward spiral of blood and vengeance into which the barbaric supporters of indiscriminate terrorism are attempting to drag us.
Still reeling from the shock of the images of 11 March in Madrid, it was on the morning of 22Â March that we learned, PresidentÂ Cox, of the assassination of SheikhÂ Yassin, with all the consequences this could have.
This gave us another reason to reiterate, in the presence of the official delegations from Israel and Palestine, the urgent need to find a fair and lasting solution to the conflict in which they are embroiled and to emphasise how important it is for the European Council, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, to launch that strategic partnership for a common future with the Middle East on the subject of which you have just addressed us.
Let us be aware on our side of the Mediterranean that our future and that of our children and grandchildren will depend on the way in which we have been able to extend to Africa in general and to the Middle East in particular, that area of peace and stability that our founding fathers were able to establish on our continent.
Let us therefore resolve to have more influence in the negotiations in progress within the Quartet, since we well know â as you said, CommissionerÂ Patten â that Europe can and must now play a decisive role there.
Whether or not we wanted it to be, the United States is considered, rightly or wrongly, to have taken Israelâs side.
Russia does not have the same interests as ourselves, stemming from our geographical proximity to the region, and the United Nations does not have our means to act.
If we Europeans were finally to speak with the powerful voice expected of us, there is no doubt it would be heard.
I am sure that the will to do so exists in our Parliament, as this debate will once again prove, quite simply because it reflects the will of a very large majority of our fellow European citizens.
MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Commissioner, can we begin to hope that this will might finally manifest itself other than through pious wishes?
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a grave hour at which we must work even harder to break the infernal spiral of violence in the Middle East.
Although Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was not one of our best friends, his assassination is a clear and flagrant violation of international law.
They could have arrested him and tried him.
I would also point out that we have created an International Criminal Court which must have a role to play, although it is not supported by some States, including Israel.
We roundly condemn the assassination of the Hamas leader and other Palestinians, on the direct orders of a government, the government of Israel.
We also roundly condemn the murders and terrorist acts aimed against the civilian populations of both parties to the conflict and I believe we must appeal to the Palestinians not to respond with a murderous increase in terrorist acts and more bloodshed.
This assassination has already had very grave consequences, including the suspension of the Arab League Summit.
In this regard, I would like to express my agreement with the severe judgment of Shimon Peres in the Knesset when he said that this action would bring even more serious consequences.
There must therefore be an end to this policy of continuing to build the wall within the occupied territories, of ordering extra-judicial executions and, furthermore, there must be a withdrawal from Gaza, to which the current Israeli Government has clearly committed itself.
I would like to say on behalf of my group that the repeated violations of human rights, non-compliance with the latest United Nations resolutions on the part of the Israeli Government and, above all, Ariel Sharonâs insistence on renewing executions outside the framework of international law, will leave us with no other option than to reiterate the positions adopted by this House in its Resolution of 10 April 2002 and to call on the Commission and the Council to strictly apply the second article of our Association Agreement.
We do not want to go that far, but we believe that we must issue a solemn and severe warning.
In this regard, I would like to make three requests: the first is to urge Israeli civil society, that vibrant Israeli society, and all its political parties, while defending its right to its own security, to demand that its government act in accordance with international law.
Secondly, I would call on the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to urge those Member States of the European Union which sit on the United Nations Security Council to immediately present a proposal to establish an international intervention force on the 1967 borders, with the mandate of protecting both sides.
Thirdly, that the Commission continue with its aid, with the European Unionâs aid, to assist the Palestinian National Authority to be strengthened and reformed, because a strong interlocutor is required if we are to argue that there must be a Palestinian State.
I believe that the whole of this process must come within the framework of the proposals being made to resolve the problem of the Middle East.
It is clear that in order to resolve such a bitter and profound conflict, it is better to propose peace than to begin new wars and increase the cycle of violence, above all in a situation in which the stability of those regimes which could contribute to supporting a process of reform is being broken.
I therefore believe that we must restart and reinforce a process in which the European Union, the United States â which also has a serious responsibility â the Arab League and all the countries of the region can continue along the lines of the statement on a common future for the Middle East recently proposed by the German Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Fischer, and in which the European Union, the regionâs main partner, as the Commissioner has said quite rightly, could contribute many elements in relation to peace treaties, security, arms control, disarmament, respect for human rights and democracy and economic cooperation.
I will end, Mr President, by saying that the European Parliament has done its bit with the creation, at last, of the Athens Parliamentary Assembly, and we have a duty, not only political but also moral, to continue the European Union's efforts in line with the Barcelona process in order to overcome such a bitter and profound crisis which calls on us to show political, economic and moral responsibility.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, the nightmare in the Middle East seems never to end.
Like everyone else, my group feels extremely frustrated and powerless at our not being able to do more to solve this bloody conflict that is the cause of so much suffering.
In the last few days, we have been talking a lot about terrorism and, clearly, nothing would mean more in the fight against terrorism than peace in the Middle East.
The situation there is the source of huge frustration and fanaticism, and it inculcates into young people a feeling of hopelessness and despair that creates a breeding ground for recruiting suicide bombers who are themselves also very young.
Two states â recognised by one another, democratic and existing side by side â would naturally have an enormously positive effect on stability throughout the region.
Plans, projects, conferences and new initiatives â it feels as though we have tried everything.
There is no lack of creativity when it comes to the Middle East.
We need no more initiatives.
We need political will, a desire really to sit down, negotiate and achieve peace.
Unfortunately, there is nothing to suggest that todayâs leaders, whether in Israel or Palestine, have this will.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party condemns the murder of Sheik Yassin.
It was contrary to international law.
Assassination may appear logical from a military point of view, but it is the worst of diplomatic means.
Yassin had odious crimes on his conscience.
He has never recognised Israelâs right to exist.
In all respects, he was a loathsome terrorist.
Nonetheless, we cannot accept this type of killing.
It must be possible to make higher demands of a democratic state such as Israel.
Hamas has now been given a new martyr and thousands of people burning with the desire for revenge.
The Palestinian leadership must therefore show unprecedented strength and leadership in order to prevent a new spiral of violence.
Arafat must emphasise that it is not Hamas that is setting the agenda.
The ELDR Group cannot be too emphatic in its condemnation of the suicide bombers.
This senseless killing of civilians, innocent children, women and men is paralysing the Israeli people and making the slightest errand or social excursion fraught with mortal danger.
The fact that ever younger teenagers and children are now being recruited as suicide bombers is the most repellent form of terrorism of all and can never ever be explained or excused.
Israel and Palestine must return to the negotiating table and to the Quartetâs Road Map.
I wish to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten for their work to bring this about.
We must obtain an end to the violence, and the Palestinian Authority must once and for all recognise Israelâs right to exist.
For its part, Israel must stop building the Security Wall, which is condemned by the whole world.
Walls can never be the solution.
The previously promised and announced withdrawal from Gaza must also begin.
Peace in the Middle East and a peaceful Iraq in which I hope that the UN can be given a greater role would be very great progress and would have huge significance for the process of reform throughout the region.
If, in the way that has been sketched out in the proposal now adopted, we succeed in incorporating these countries into a close and extensive network of trade and cooperation, it would constitute huge progress for the EU.
The collapse of the Arab League summit is tragic, but there is yet hope that reference will still be made to human rights and democracy, which are the places from which we have to begin.
Finally, MrÂ President, I just want to raise another issue about which the ELDR Group feels uneasy, and that is the riots in Syria in which hundreds of Kurds have recently been killed.
Many are imprisoned, and there are reports of members of this group being tortured following riots a week ago.
I hope that the Council and the Commission can step up the pressure on Syria to put a stop to this killing.
Â Â  â There is no doubt â and it is an obvious thing to say â that the conflicts in the Middle East are becoming more tragic by the day.
I truly believe, and I am not just copying what others have said, that we must have the courage to admit that much of the responsibility for these unresolved conflicts lies with the international community and, most of all, with the military policy of President Bush and anyone who has stood up for that policy alongside President Bush.
We cannot evade this problem, and I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council and with Commissioner Patten, that the Palestine-Israel question is central and essential to it.
I also think we should abandon our conformist position and stop saying that the Palestinians do not recognise the State of Israel: they recognised it in 1988.
It is not true that the Palestinian Authority does not want to negotiate: it is continually saying that it is prepared to negotiate.
The one who is rejecting negotiation, the one who really is following a different policy is Ariel Sharon.
I believe we should assess the matter objectively.
There is no doubt that the Palestinian Authority bears responsibility for its own inability to stop terrorist acts, but I also think we should clearly assess to what extent Ariel Sharonâs policy has brought on the growth in terrorism.
Mr Patten is right: it does not mean that terrorist acts in themselves, irrespective of the policies that are being implemented, should be condemned and suppressed.
Let us stop telling ourselves that they are all birds of a feather.
There are differences, and these differences are the ban on and the failure to implement any international rights for the Palestinians.
Let us now think about that great plan, rather than a working paper, that the United States has prepared for the G8 Summit in June.
In fact it is an arrogant, imperialist project and, although it provides for the development of democracy, democratic processes, preambles, aid and support, it does so without any discussion with anybody.
We cannot export democracy â apart from the fact that we should begin to think about our own democracies â since democracy is a continuous process in which we too are inadequate, in which we too sometimes have gaps and differences.
As it has been put forward, the Greater Middle East initiative is a plan that will certainly not help the growth of democracy.
It will probably help some accomplice or subservient regimes, but it will not contribute to the reconstruction of Arab countries that do in fact need to free themselves from oppressive regimes and really need democracy.
Not with arrogance and imperialism, however, please!
I think the European Unionâs decision to opt for the long term and not to aim for immediate results by cutting the Gordian knot of old is the right one.
We therefore need time to reflect and to build relationships.
In this sense, the Parliamentary Assembly organised in Athens is important: we have seen the differences and the diversity of the Arab world as well, and not just its weaknesses.
I should like to return for a moment to Ariel Sharonâs policy.
In 1973, when Winston Churchillâs grandson asked him what was to become of the Palestinians, he answered that there was no need to worry: âWeâll make a pastrami sandwich of them.â
He would crush them in a sandwich.
That is what he is doing by building the wall and preventing freedom of movement.
Sheikh Yassinâs assassination was not the first: there have been 250 extrajudicial executions, and the first victim was Tabet Tabet, an Al Fatah pacifist who was working with Peace Now.
Why, though, do we always have to keep repeating and reiterating these things?
I sometimes get tired of repeating myself and feeling that everyone bears the same responsibility.
There are various types of responsibility, and I think that, with this decision, Ariel Sharon did not just kill a leader, something that â for heavenâs sake â I as a woman regard as the utmost in evil, but his intention was in fact to transform a national conflict into a religious conflict.
That is what is so terrible.
Four days ago I was in the mountains of Kurdistan and saw demonstrations in Van for Sheikh Yassin.
That is the risk we are running; that is what President Bush has done.
Finally, I also agree with the proposals put forward by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo on Article 2 and the other items.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is of course only right that the European Council should condemn Israelâs unlawful execution of the Hamas leader, Sheik Yassin.
Why, as General Morillon said, are there, however, only words and pious wishes?
Why not back our words with action?
The EU has, of course, practical and unique opportunities to punish Israel through the Association Agreement.
As early as May 2002, we considered, here in the European Parliament, that it was the last straw when it came to Israeli human rights violations, and we demanded then that the Association Agreement be suspended.
Why does the Council not listen to Parliament?
Moreover, the European Commission has expressed itself along the same lines as Parliament.
At the most recent meeting of the Association Council, the Commission produced a long list of Israelâs infringements of human rights and of UN decisions.
At that time, the Commission warned that the EU would subsequently have to review its position if there were no improvement.
Moreover, we are concerned here with trade policy pure and simple.
In a memo aimed at all importers of Israeli goods to the EU, the Commission has observed that Israel is being fraudulent in identifying the origin of its goods, so that goods from illegal Jewish settlements on occupied Palestinian land are being sent to the EU with âIsraelâ stated on the certificate of origin.
Fraud of this kind, involving the rules of the trade agreement, is on its own enough to justify suspending the Association Agreement.
Why all these words?
Why no action?
What is more, we know that Israel has nuclear weapons and, according to the experts, probably still more weapons of mass destruction.
Clearly, Israel is allowed to have them but, when others acquire them too, they are bombed back into the Stone Age.
Why is action not taken against Israel?
How are we to have a peaceful world order, based upon law and justice, if tough punishment is meted out to certain lawbreakers â especially if they are Arab Muslims â while another lawbreaker, Israel, appears to be able to do whatever it likes, and all that occurs is that we repeat the same debate year after year after year without anything happening?
The least that can be asked is that we repeal and suspend the Association Agreement, just as the European Parliament has requested.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that what is currently happening in the Middle East is very different from what we might have thought until a few days ago.
In fact, I believe that the Middle East is gradually getting closer and is even right on our doorstep.
We can see this in speeches with which, in some cases, I could not disagree more, such as MrsÂ Morgantiniâs speech, but not just hers.
Indeed, I believe that the terrorist attacks that we are witnessing within Europe must be taken into account.
We cannot suddenly just consider the issue of the murder of Sheikh Yassin.
As a Catholic, I reject any idea of one day hitting someone: not killing them, but just hitting them.
In my opinion, this is not, however, the point.
I believe that if we want to guarantee our citizens peace, tranquillity and serenity in the future, we need to draw up a very different proposal and follow very different lines of thinking.
Europe, as such, cannot just be a mouthpiece for a message in terms of European funding for the Middle East area.
Europe must put forward a genuine and specific proposal.
I believe that this can be done, and in this case I appeal to Commissioner Patten and the Irish Council Presidency to call for an end to the conflicts.
I believe that this could once again give politics a real voice and not just an issue on which to speculate in this Chamber.
For those who, like me, have experienced terrorism â a different type of terrorism, âred terrorismâ â and have seen a bomb in the house and a brother get out through a window, political words meant nothing at the time, in the eighties.
The answer that we found â as a young person at the time â was unique and truly incredible: there was a unity in purpose to achieve a single objective: to combat terrorism.
I believe that this can only be done if we, as Europe, are aware of this and at the very least now compile a list of terrorist associations to be assessed at an international level.
I believe that everything else is just idle chitchat.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, what the Council has told us does not, in my opinion, add much that is new to a European position which, beyond endlessly recited hollow phrases such as âMediterranean cooperation with a view to peace and prosperity in the regionâ, is totally inconsistent.
In reality, the Union plays no role at all in the Middle East, apart from as a provider of funds and, more often than not, one acting in the dark, too.
Politically, we do nothing, however.
We could, however, play a role if we left behind our European divisions, something that is no doubt impossible, and if we had the courage clearly to take a side.
It is not a matter of taking one of the two obvious, and old, sides in the Middle East conflict, with the Israelis on the one hand and the Palestinians on the other.
This debate is outdated.
The choice we must make concerns the current real divide, which pits the moderates against the extremists on both sides.
The United States does not make this choice.
It even does the exact opposite and sides with the moderates and extremists by turns.
Furthermore, it very often sides with the extremists, whether they be the fundamentalist Muslims or Israeli religious extremists.
It does this in accordance with the interest it has in dividing the region in order to rule it better.
Now, Europeâs interest lies specifically in reuniting the region in order better to make a success of the forms of Mediterranean cooperation that will make the Mediterranean what it always was, that is to say the geopolitical centre of the world.
Franceâs policy is the exact opposite of that of the United States.
France resolutely sides with moderate Palestinians and Israelis on both sides.
This is why, alone in the face of the United States, it is the other major power present in the Middle East.
Alas, apart from France, Europe is too divided, so that we are reduced to the feeble words we have just heard from the Council.
It is a shame, but it is not surprising.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, the European Union has, then, rediscovered its âsacred unionâ by condemning the killing of Sheikh Yassin, and some have even presented him as a venerable old man and an almost saintly person.
Today, in this Parliament, we have heard the party chairman MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo authoritatively, and others I believe somewhat less authoritatively, remind us of the possibility of calling for ArticleÂ 2 to be applied, that is to say the suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel because of the death of Sheikh Yassin.
His death is certainly a violation of international legality; there is no doubt about it.
The European Council dedicated five paragraphs to condemning Israel for this, but I do not recall having read anything in the text about employing handicapped children for just a few euros to turn them into human bombs with 10Â kg of explosives.
We Radical Members have called for the suspension of the Association Agreements â as Commissioner Patten knows only too well â under Article 2, which unfortunately we have never, or almost never, put into practice, for scores of countries, many of them also in the region.
I believe that it is important not to lose sight of this fact.
If we consider it right to condemn Israel, a democratic countryÂ âÂ having awarded it, so to speak, the title of democratic countryÂ â which means we can expect it to respect international law, assuming, on the other hand, that it is pointless to ask for respect, for example, from the other Arab countries, we are making a huge mistake and we are continuing to rant on without having an effective role in the region.
As regards the issue of the Greater Middle East, for example, it is true that the Americans have been over-ingenuous, putting forward this proposal without allowing it to be scrutinised and assessed perhaps more attentively and being put first and foremost to the governments of the Middle East.
The idea in itself is a good one â not the idea of exporting democracy, which just makes the concept appear ridiculous and trivial, rather like the one that we too tried to develop, to some extent artificially, long before the US proposal, with the infamous Sanaâa Conference on Democracy and Human Rights in the Middle East.
Either we lay the foundations for political democracy or, as Europe, we go along with the American idea, independently, of course, but put forward a strong proposal in the months to come, in consultation with Arab countries, taking an approach that seeks to involve them â not just at a governmental level but also at a civil society levelÂ âÂ in a solid and strong proposal to promote the kind of societies and democracy called for by these countries in order to achieve development, as the UNDP told us.
This is, therefore, the way to resolve â or to include â the Israel-Palestine issue too in a more overall solution.
To conclude, I applaud the fact that the major leaders of the European left finally recognise, as we have been saying for 30 years, that the accession of Israel and Palestine to the European Union is another important path towards reaching a lasting solution to the Middle East issue.
Â Â  â It is perfectly fine by me, Mr President, for me to be the first to keep exactly to his allotted time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I do not think we should play the same narrow-minded game here at every sitting, raising again the supply of goods from the West Bank to the European Union.
There is nothing wrong in discussing the matter, and last time we had a full debate about it.
If those goods were supplied by the Palestinians, they would enjoy the same European Union preferences and it is therefore pointless to always encumber such a serious question as this conflict with such banalities.
Secondly, everyone in this Parliament condemns the illegal executions that Israel is carrying out.
They are incompatible with international law and there is no need at all to discuss the matter.
It is good that we as a European Union are making that absolutely clear.
Many Americans are also saying that it is wrong.
That is why we should not always be setting France against the USA in the matter.
Henry Kissinger, too, said that quite clearly at the weekend.
What we must do, however, is something that demands rather more: we must now engage in dialogue with the Arab world.
It is of course far from reassuring that the Arab summit has recently been cancelled, that it cannot take place because it has been impossible to agree on a declaration containing the words democracy, parliament and civil society and speaking of womenâs rights and democratic reform.
We must also be clearer in reminding our partners south of the Mediterranean of our fundamental convictions if we want to reach a comprehensive solution.
Those who are normally always very vociferous about these things in this House should also be vociferous in addressing the Arab world about them.
We do that with Israel.
It is a democracy.
We can expect a lot of it, and I believe we are right to do so.
We should, however, develop a broader perspective on the Middle East.
That also requires a dialogue with the Arab world about our fundamental principles.
Otherwise, we will never find a solution.
Â Â  Mr President, the most detailed and in-depth analysis of the limits to the development of democracy in the Arab world and of its consequences on development in those societies came from the first report of the United Nations Development Programme that was drawn up in 2002.
The second report was published recently and goes into more depth as regards the lack of education and training, the severe limits in terms of cultural production, technology and research.
The most revealing fact is that the team that is working on this project is made up entirelyÂ âÂ and I repeat, entirelyÂ âÂ of Arab researchers.
The strategy for the Greater Middle East, drawn up by the Bush administration, is based largely on these analyses, with a limitation that I would say is fatal: that of prescribing changes and reforms without establishing any relationship with the Arab and Islamic world.
There is the risk that this approach will fuel the notion that so-called Western civilisation thinks itself superior to all the religious and cultural traditions of the Arab world.
This notion lies at the root of the feeling of humiliation that is so widespread in these countries and which terrorist groups exploit, hoping in turn to fuel hatred towards the West.
The second comment that I would like to make concerns relations between the Bush administration and the Sharon government.
In the eyes of the Arab world, the principle of double standards is intolerable.
Can Sharonâs Israel still be defined as a country under the rule of law despite the extrajudicial executions, collective punishments, the construction of a wall in Palestinian territory, the settlements and the lack of access to fundamental resources such as water for the Palestinian people?
The US administration, so inflexible that it inflicted two wars on Iraq and ten years of embargo, today is not budging an inch on what was once again defined as a humanitarian disaster by the rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva yesterday.
The concern is that the method chosen by the US administration and its indifference to the Middle East conflict could have the opposite effect, that is to say for it to seem, in the eyes of the public in these countries, that even greater credit is given to non-democratic governments and political classes that are responsible for the unfair use of resources, for widespread corruption, for the lack of democracy and fundamental freedomsÂ of women for a startÂ âÂ and in short those responsible for the crisis and the decline of these societies.
Europe has a role and a responsibility in all of this, but also a solid history of relations in the Mediterranean area, based on a different method, that of partnership.
Recently this strategy was stepped up, as a response to enlargement to the East, with the neighbourhood policy.
Today is therefore not about challenging all this, but rather about establishing a relationship with the Bush administration, with the Arab League and in collaboration with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), which makes Europeâs point of view heard as an alternative to the initiatives from the US Administration.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Europe is strongly committed to peace but is deeply frustrated by the latest terrorist attacks.
For Europe, the Mediterranean is a crucial area, an historic challenge and until it is transformed into an area of peace, development, democracy and stability, Europe will not, I am sorry to say, be able to fulfil its potential.
Today the conflict between Israel and Palestine is erasing any glimmer of hope and the worsening of the conflict is certainly not helping to combat international terrorism, indeed in ideological terms it is fuelling it.
In order to ensure a future of peace in this area, however, greater responsibility is needed and all our efforts, our political authority and our financial and human resources must be used to ensure that we get back on the road to negotiations.
The Athens Forum was therefore an important step, but this is not about supporting one side or the other.
The route that we must take, even now that hopes for peace seem almost dead, remains that of working towards a clear objective: two states, one alongside the other, Israel and Palestine, that live in peace and security without discrimination and with respect for human rights.
To this end, Europe must hold constant and open dialogue with the whole of the Arab world.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as the whole world has affirmed, the assassination of Sheikh Yassin by the Israeli army is a totally irresponsible provocation.
Having participated in the establishment and development of Hamas with, at the time, the intention of weakening the PLO, the Israeli powers today seek to torpedo any idea of a peaceful solution.
This brute-force approach has but one aim: that of destroying any hope of a negotiated peace with, as a consequence, the construction of the Wall imposed as the only acceptable solution. This shameful wall imprisons an entire nation, goes on annexing its land and resources and is overwhelmingly condemned by world opinion, as witnessed to by the debates of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
Faced with this policy that is suicidal for both the Palestinians and the Israelis, the call by sixty key Palestinian figures to refrain from avenging the death of the Hamas leader is extremely dignified and courageous.
It is high time the European Union supported them by clearly identifying Sharon as the main obstacle to peace; by specifically entering into official talks with those opposed to this policy of adopting the worst possible line, notably the pioneers of the Geneva Accord; by officially requesting the immediate deployment of an international force to protect the population of the Palestinian territories; and by suspending the agreement with Israel, as demanded by our Parliament two years ago.
In short, by matching words with action in the interests of respect for international law.
Any other approach is bound to fail and cannot be taken seriously under any circumstances, especially by Arab countries.
While the American president continues to encourage Sharon, welcoming him in a few daysâ time, the Union can no longer hide behind words.
In a totally different spirit to the American plans for a Greater Middle East serving only their economic and strategic interests, Europe must finally take action if it wants to realise the ambition declared in Barcelona of bringing about a region of peace and prosperity.
The proven lies concerning the reasons for armed intervention in Iraq and the new boost given to terrorism extending also into Europe drive us to take initiatives much bolder than those implied by what the Council and the Commission have told us today.
An end to the occupation and the recognition of a sovereign and viable Palestinian State would also deprive the terrorists of a fertile breeding ground.
It is peace in the region and throughout the world that is at stake.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after Madrid, the threat of a clash between the Western and Islamic worlds is drawing nearer.
Will we simply let this happen?
Both in Israel and among the Palestinians, there are forces pursuing mutual destruction.
After all, what else can a so-called military solution amount to?
Sheikh Yassin did not want peace on the basis of negotiations, but does Sharon?
On several occasions, Sharon provoked Palestinian violence, most recently with the military occupation of Palestine, the erection of the wall and the assassination of Yassin.
This violence was continuously breeding more violence.
It is a source of frustration, so much so that the export of the conflict to other areas is moving ever closer and is becoming a threat to world peace and to safety in our cities.
That is why we are asking you to shift your peace efforts up a gear, to cancel the association agreement and not to delay starting the debate on an international peace force in Israel.
Only the right to self-determination can really provide a peaceful outcome.
Â Â  Mr President, the best conflict prevention measure is respect for human rights.
Unfortunately, Sharon does not even remotely live up to this respect.
It is detrimental to every peace effort that the international community is allowing Sharon constantly to violate international rules.
To condemn Israel is not enough: measures need to be taken.
The EU could begin by suspending the trade agreements.
Clearly Israel is entitled to protect its citizens against terror attacks, but Sharon's persisting violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings, are not protecting but endangering its citizens.
It is contrary to international law; it totally undermines the very concept of the rule of law, which is a key element in the fight against terrorism.
Israel could easily arrest suspected terrorists, instead of killing innocent passers-by, of whom many are women and children, using exactly the same despicable means as suicide bombers.
The Palestinian Authority cannot stop suicide bombings when Israel deliberately fuels everything that leads to them, thus sharing the responsibility for them.
In many cases, Israel has used extrajudicial killings against exactly those Palestinian leaders who have been strong advocates for peace and for stopping the suicide bombings.
Sharon's state terrorism is no substitute for political negotiations such as the Geneva Accord and the roadmap, which Israel is now abandoning.
Â Â  Mr President, the Middle East is the spiritual home of the three great revealed religions of the world, but sadly also the inspiration for those misguided few who invoke Islam as a justification for terrorist killings, invoking in particular the bloodthirsty traditions of Salafism and Wahhabism.
The Middle East is a source of vital oil supplies to the West and the location of one of the longest and bloodiest disputes between the Arab world and Israel.
It is also the location of some of the most ruthless regimes, ranging from the old Iraq of Saddam to the current government of Iran.
Saudi Arabia is also brutal in its decapitations for misdemeanours, like alcohol consumption.
The Middle East is a source of many of the EU's refugees, particularly from Kurdistan, and if we allow Turkey into the EU, the EU's borders will stretch into the Middle East to face Syria, Iraq and Iran directly.
Therefore stabilising this region in peace, democracy, good governance with the rule of law and respect for human rights is essential to the EU's interest, as well as the people there who have suffered under tyrannical governments for so long.
That is why I support the roadmap for peace, for a two-state solution in Israel and in Palestine, for a democratic Palestine alongside the State of Israel.
But I remain critical of the fact that EU money was given in direct budgetary assistance without adequate safeguards to prevent diversion of funds to corrupt practice and possibly even terrorism in a theatre of war and in a zone where such practice is commonplace: this, I believe, was wrong.
Tomorrow, Parliament's working group looking at this will regrettably be publishing two separate reports.
I have always supported and continue to support the liberation of Iraq from Ba'athist tyranny and remain optimistic that eventually we will see a new Iraq emerge which will serve as a catalyst for democratic change elsewhere in the region.
Lastly, I hope to see more dialogue between moderate Muslim leaders and the EU's political classes if we are to avoid the much feared clash of civilisations as a scenario.
Â Â  Mr President, referring to the Mediterranean and the Middle East, the Council has just indicated â and I quote â âthe Unionâs willingness to work with the United States for the purposes of cooperation in the regionâ.
It would be no bad thing, in my view, if Washington did the same and expressed its fervent desire to cooperate with the Union.
I believe that this would involve the following: a sensitive, rather than blunt and brutal, drawing up and presentation of its proposed plan for the democratisation of the Middle East.
It would also involve objectives in line with reality and common sense, bearing in mind, in my opinion, that excessive ambitions, since we are talking about an area from Morocco to Pakistan, may lead to looking foolish, firstly, and then failure.
And, above all, I believe the United States should accept that it is impossible to confront such a vast enterprise, without treating the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict as a priority and prior objective.
Israel rejected the Saudi peace proposal, ratified in Beirut by the plenum of the Arab League, and has blocked â and let there be no mistake, it has blocked â the road map and decided to continue along its own unilateral course, which includes extra-judicial assassinations.
In my opinion â I would insist â these circumstances, together with the assassination of Sheikh Yassin, have led to the suspension of the new Arab Summit, scheduled for yesterday in Tunisia, and I believe that no possible initiative for a so-called âGreater Middle Eastâ can succeed in any way in this context.
We simply have to look at what King Abdullah of Jordan, who we all know to be a clearly moderate leader, said the day before yesterday â and I quote, âthe assassination of Sheikh Yassin, a week before the Arab League Summit, demonstrates that the Israelis wanted the meeting to fail and for the Arabs not to be able to relaunch their dialogue initiative, because Israel does not want peaceâ.
If a moderate leader says what I have just quoted, the Union must take note of what this implies and take action as a consequence.
I will end, Mr President, by saying to Mr Laschet, who has just spoken â although I regret that he is not here â that I agree with him when he says that we must talk less about the extra-judicial assassinations violating international law, because we all condemn them.
The problem is that these assassinations take place, we all condemn them, but none of us act to put an end to them.
Â Â  Mr President, I have two points.
While legally debatable, the execution of Sheikh Yassin must not cause us to forget who he was: the instigator of the worst suicide attacks and the head of a movement whose charter still calls for the destruction of Israel and, beyond that â let us not forget â the physical elimination of Jews throughout the world.
Do we mourn this man?
Secondly, the American plan deserves some consideration since it invites us to move beyond the illusion in which European action is currently mired, the illusion whereby resolution of the conflict would precede the democratisation of the Middle East.
As we know, democracies do not wage war against each other, so there will be no lasting solution to the conflict without democratisation and modernisation of the Middle East.
Without such a Copernican revolution, MrÂ President, we will forever have the spectacle of a sententious but powerless Europe, which CommissionerÂ Patten embodies with the perfection of an old Shakespearean actor.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the day after the creation of the EMPA, the European Union has, as everyone has said, a duty to become involved in peace building within the logic of the Barcelona process.
The Union bears a historic and political responsibility, and it can no longer content itself only with issuing condemnations when the region is ablaze or weeping when terrorism strikes.
Now, the United States tells us that it has a plan for the Middle East.
How, though, can we talk in terms of plans when we know that Syria has a presence in Lebanon, when the occupation in Iraq is ongoing and when a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has still not been found?
This plan is, indeed, disputed and disputable.
It is disputed because the United States has not bothered to discuss it with the countries concerned.
This clearly reveals Americaâs mistrust and their unilateral practices, just as the pre-emptive war in Iraq did.
It also reflects the geopolitical ignorance of the United States and the generalisations it makes by including Maghreb in the Middle East, and Pakistan and Afghanistan among the Arab countries.
Finally, what does this plan advocate?
The fight against terrorism?
Yes, but with the installation of American bases in the region.
Has not this been the case since 1990-1991?
Resolution of the conflict?
Yes, but to be credible, it would be necessary to fight all forms of terrorism, including the state terrorism conducted by Israel, which is doggedly trying to exterminate the Palestinian people, yet with total impunity.
Lastly, democratic reforms?
Certainly, yes, they are inevitable and essential, because the people are today suffering an economic, political and democratic deficit.
These reforms are needed, but so is economic development.
Finally, and in conclusion, only by reducing the gap between the ruling classes and the people will these reforms be possible.
Civil society must be involved.
It is for this reason that we in Europe must support the forces of progress or internal forces for peace and strengthen dialogue in order to dispel fears, to finally put an end to this violence and to let our common values govern us.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, anyone who fails to recognise that the State of Israel has the duty to protect its citizens against terror loses their credibility.
Ever since the Palestinian leadership started the second , two and a half years ago, in order to achieve their goals by violent means, nearly one thousand Israeli men, women and children have been killed by poisoned minds with shrapnel grenades around their waists.
Where is the Europe-wide indignation about the Palestinian leaders, who drape bombs around their children and, if they are detained by soldiers, are prepared to blow them up in cold blood?
The biggest obstacle to peace in the Middle East is the Palestinians' unwillingness to recognise the State of Israel.
There is no other explanation for Arafat's refusal at Camp David.
The State of Israel accounts for only 0.6% of Arab territory.
For a long time, Arab nations thought they could drive the Jews into the sea by using the Palestinian refugees as a means of putting Israel under international pressure.
The Arab countries have never allowed their Palestinian brothers to lead a dignified existence.
The UN, too, kept the refugee status of the Palestinians artificially in place for 50 years.
King Abdullah's first reaction to a possible retreat of Israel from the Gaza was the fear that Palestinians would be looking for jobs in Jordan.
Peace is inextricably linked with justice, and that is where the problem lies.
On its own continent, Europe has placed democracy on a pedestal, but ignores democracy in Israel, in a region which consists of nothing but dictatorships â enlightened or not, as the case may be.
Â Â  Mr President, the assassination of the Hamas chief had one effect, which was that the Arab League summit, which was to have taken place yesterday and today, was cancelled.
That is a tragedy because the summit was to have considered a number of proposals for reform in the Arab region.
I want to focus on this question of reform because that is fundamental to our security in the European Union.
The Irish Foreign Minister spoke about the Arab-Israeli conflict.
He also spoke about the evolution of democracy and civil society in these lands.
My question is, what can do?
While Commissioner Patten spoke about the Barcelona process â a highly desirable process established a long time before the Americans' idea of a greater Middle East process â that process is not having the sort of effect that it should have.
As some of you may know, I have spent some time in the last few months, as rapporteur on the democracy initiative, going to the conference in Sana'a, Yemen, to Cairo, Alexandria, Damascus, to the Arab Parliamentary Union conference and to Athens last week with you, Mr President.
This sort of democratic odyssey is trying to establish one thing: the appetite of the peoples of the Arab countries for democracy, the rule of law, civil society and so on.
We know what our foreign policy priority is: we know it is human rights, it is democracy, the promotion of fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.
But in this arc of instability on our rim, while the EU is spending EUR 700 million plus in MEDA funds, only EUR 7 million of that is being spent on democracy.
I find myself caught between the Scylla of bureaucratic obstructionism in the Council and the Charybdis of bureaucratic obstructionism in the Commission.
We need a programme that works: we have the means to do it and we have the will to do it in this Parliament.
The question is, do the Commission and Council accept their political priorities?
I address my remarks to two senior politicians who both occupy positions of responsibility at a very sensitive time for Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, the negative spiral of violence in the Middle East does not seem to be going into reverse, and plunged to another depth last week, when the hatred-sowing Hamas leader Yassin was cold-bloodedly murdered at the behest of the Israeli Prime Minister Sharon.
I call on the Palestinians not to use violence to avenge Sharonâs illegal act.
Now is the time to break the cycle and opt for peaceful resistance in a dignified manner.
I would echo the appeal by a group of Palestinian academics not to commit any new suicide attacks.
Prime Minister Sharon violates human rights, ignores UN resolutions by building a wall in the Occupied Territories, by building new settlements and by the extrajudicial executions of Palestinians.
I would therefore call for a suspension of the EU's association agreement with Israel in accordance with Article 2, the human rights clause, until such time as the Israeli Government has withdrawn its call for attacks, which are in contravention of international law, and mean that the Sharon Government constitutes a threat to safety and to the constitutional state of Israel.
The Israeli-Palestinian situation is a seriously disturbing factor in the entire region.
What the Middle East needs is a broad democratic initiative for dialogue and cooperation between all countries in it, and Europe possesses the appropriate instruments to bring one about.
We must organise the partnerships between the EU and the Mediterranean countries in the framework of the Barcelona process, in which we strategically promote political and economic, but also social, reforms, in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
I am convinced that there is a great political need for this among the citizens of both Israel and Palestine.
Finally, I would call on the EU Member States in the UN Security Council to submit a proposal for a UN intervention force based on the boundaries of 1967, in a bid to protect the Israeli and Palestinian citizens against terrorist attacks.
Working for peace in the Middle East is a huge contribution in the fight against terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as regular as clockwork, we make high-flown statements and condemn the violence in the Middle East.
Is that really all we can manage to do?
Why can the European Union not play a more active role in this conflict?
Right now, there are various reasons why the European Union should be playing a pioneering role in the peace process.
Sadly, recent events have made a further radicalisation between Israel and the Palestinians more than likely.
The status of the United States as a good international negotiator has been dealt a few serious blows after Afghanistan and Iraq.
The implementation of the international step-by-step plan appears a long way off, so the European Union should act.
Peace and stability are entirely in its interest.
After all, we are the region's largest trading partner and the largest donor of humanitarian and financial aid.
When will our words at last be followed by deeds?
Â Â  Mr President, I recently attended a conference of Arab women in Beirut.
The women were from 22 different Arab countries.
What struck me was that they all speak a common language, which gave them a unity that perhaps we still aspire to here in Europe.
Regardless of what they spoke about at that conference â and they were all highly educated, sophisticated women â the issue of Palestine was mentioned by every single person.
Clearly, this issue is a hugely unifying factor throughout all the Arab countries.
We in Ireland have learned â tragically and dreadfully over a thirty-year period â what it is to live with terrorism.
We have also seen some of the bitterest enemies in the world take a leap of faith that led to peace in Northern Ireland â to the great relief of all of us.
Commissioner Patten clearly had a part in that as well.
I do not want to repeat many of the things colleagues have said here this afternoon, but we have to recognise that at the heart of the tragedy is another generation of little people living in those squalid camps in Palestine who are growing up, and the first game they play is throwing stones at soldiers â just as they did in Northern Ireland.
There is also another generation of children on the other side of the border who are too terrified to go to school in case the bus they are riding in is blown up.
These are the children who 20 years from now will be the leaders, or perhaps the victims, or the suicide bombers.
We all condemn unreservedly the dreadful events in both Palestine and Israel.
But there has to be that leap of faith, that moment in which, as a friend of mine said, we have to smile weakly and have a strong stomach and forget about the awful things we have done to each other and start to try and address the dreadful issues in the Middle East which are central to practically every single major political issue in the world today.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, there is talk these days of a new Middle East policy, of a greater Middle East.
If it is not all going to be hot air, then in my opinion two things in particular must remain at the heart of such a policy.
Firstly, resolution of the main conflict in the Middle East.
I wish the US would devote as much energy â by which I do not mean military manpower â to solving the actual Middle East problem as it is doing to Iraq.
I would also like Europe to expend as much energy solving the Middle East problem as some European Union Member States are doing in the case of Iraq, because there would then be fewer terrorist attacks and there would be fewer illegal killings like that of Sheikh Yassin.
As Commissioner Patten said, the culture of death must be defeated and destroyed.
Secondly, yes, the Arab world does indeed need reforms.
Unlike many of my fellow Members here, however, I have not seen much evidence of the Americans supporting the reform movements in Jordan, Egypt or Saudi Arabia in recent years.
I have not noticed them supporting democracy and human rights in those countries very much.
If the United States of America is now taking up that cause, I am very much in favour of joining them in supporting the reform efforts inside the Arab countries.
There are enough women who are dissatisfied with the continuing severe discrimination against women.
There are enough minorities who are dissatisfied with the discrimination against minorities.
There are enough people in the Arab countries who are dissatisfied with discrimination and disregard for human rights and the rights of minorities.
Not long ago, we welcomed to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy people who had recently written a report showing where the obstacles lie, obstacles to modernisation and democratisation recognised by the Arab countries themselves.
I believe the only practical way forward for a new Middle East policy is not to threaten outside military intervention but for Europe, in particular, to support the reform forces in the Arab countries.
We should be doing more, spending more money and of course also using much more energy to drive those important reforms in the Arab countries forward.
Â Â  Mr President, ten years after the Rabin/Arafat agreements, a neutral observer taking stock of the Blair/Gaddafi civilities would say that a miracle has taken place.
However, if he looked into it further, he would say that we have a greater tragedy.
Where is the balance?
The balance is quite clearly worse today than it was ten years ago when there were events and political choices.
When it became clear from various quarters that the official government line was to murder people, we did not react.
When the new wall of shame started to be built, again we did not react.
A particular peculiarity distinguishes the shape of our policy.
Yes! We are the biggest financiers of the area, but to finance someone without intervening politically is basically like pouring water into a pitcher full of holes, into a bucket full of holes, which cannot hold the water.
What are we doing now?
Quite clearly we have to take initiatives.
In a few days, as is our custom, the presiding country will meet the president of the United States of America in order to raise the imperative question of the joint approach to this issue.
It would, of course, be better if this meeting were held in Brussels at long last.
We are also talking about the Euro-Mediterranean conference and we all welcome the meeting in Athens at parliamentary level.
However, there must also be a corresponding initiative at government level.
In other words, if we cannot get to the heart of the problem, we must confine the problem.
It would not be a bad thing, for example, if we set up a special office in the area, based in Cyprus, to take account of all the irritations and take the corresponding initiatives.
Politics are not neutral.
Politics mean initiative, pro-action, proposals and results.
If the European Union wants to demonstrate its ability, including for its own interests, it is an area which has matured to the point at which it will have the general acceptance of mankind if it makes a positive contribution to resolving the Palestinian problem, which is the tip of a broader problem, but if the tip is solved, it will also be resolved at the base.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a sustainable peace in the Middle East can only be achieved through serious negotiations and by complying with international law.
Building walls and new settlements on occupied territory does not contribute to peace.
Peace is never achieved through terrorist acts, on the part either of Israel or of the Palestinians.
No terrorist acts can be approved.
The murder of Sheik Yassin, ordered by Israel, is an act of terrorism and a crime under international law.
It must be condemned.
It is obvious that Israel has broken the Association Agreement.
The EU must not accept this.
A solution to the conflict demands increased active participation by the EU and also by the UN in the form not only of peacekeeping forces and increased support for the Palestinian people but also in the form of a clear political line.
Sharon has made it clear that he intends to order executions of more Palestinian leaders.
If the Israeli Government does not immediately abandon such plans, the agreement with Israel must be cancelled.
Agreements must be complied with by both parties.
Further indulgence of Israel and the Israeli Government does not help Israel.
Â Â  Mr President, the assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and the seven other Palestinians was a clear breach of international law.
I totally condemn all terrorism, whatever its source, and I also call on Palestinians not to respond violently to this most recent provocation.
If we are to begin to bring an end to this spiral of violence, then someone has to take the first leap.
I abhor in particular the use of children as proxy bombers and the targeting of civilians by Palestinian terror groups.
The government of Ariel Sharon has once again adopted bully-boy tactics which can only block the peace process and obstruct any chance for constructive negotiations.
The continuing occupation of Palestinian territory and the construction of the so-called security wall, mostly on Palestinian territory, is ghettoising Palestinians, destroying their livelihoods, imprisoning and impoverishing them and driving them to despair.
The European Union, on the other hand, has all carrot and no stick.
It is not that the European Union does not have a stick, it simply refuses to even wave the stick, never mind use it.
I would call on the Commission and the Council to demand that Israel take immediate steps to comply with the human rights obligations it entered into in the association agreement.
It is not doing so and unless we take action to insist that they do, we will reap a terrible harvest in the future.
Â Â  Mr President, peace in the Middle East hinges on a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and on the entire European policy concerning strategic partnership.
When Cyprus joins on 1 May, Tel Aviv will be half an hour's flight away from the European Union, and we will be direct neighbours.
During the recent visit by Parliament's delegation, we noticed that many Israelis have high expectations of the European Union.
They are expecting us to take a leading role in the region.
Israel is being ruled by a man who rides roughshod over international law and who, in the present conflict, continues to pour oil upon the flames.
He is doing a great deal of damage to his country and gives international terrorists an excellent excuse for their actions.
According to the Council's declaration, the European Union is consistently opposed to extrajudicial executions.
In my view, the only consistent stance would be to review the trade relations and use our economic power as a carrot and a stick â but not only on Israel.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will be very brief.
I should like to thank the Members who have participated. This has been a useful discussion, and it has also made clear that there exists a fundamental consensus amongst us on the need for the European Union to exert maximum effort on the issues that have been raised.
We all agree that the European Union needs to raise the level of its engagement within the region.
I agree particularly with Members as to the importance of intensive consultation with the countries involved in the region.
The drive and the initiative to address these challenges and to implement the necessary reforms must come from the region itself.
It is easy to be in despair when you see, as we have seen, horror heaped on horror, misery on top of misery.
However, the reality is that the Union must be involved in pushing forward where it can to try and create at least a space in which peace can be created.
The Union must work in partnership with the region to this end, to help to meet all of these challenges.
A lasting and comprehensive settlement is set out in the roadmap, and the roadmap is the only way forward.
It was mentioned that the suspension of the Association Agreement is a way forward in the region.
I think that discussion and pressure would produce some progress.
In the interim report on the strategic partnership endorsed by the Council last week, the European Union has established a set of guiding principles for its engagement in the region.
The presidency is committed to developing the strategic partnership on the basis of partnership and dialogue with all the countries in the region.
Once again, I should like to thank Members for their thoughtful and incisive contributions.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Roche, despite the authoritative calls and the quotes from Shakespeare, Homer and Ulysses, Commissioner Patten has informed me that he does not intend to reply.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  . The murder by Israel of the spiritual leader of Hamas confirms once again the murderous/terrorist nature of the policy followed by the Sharon government in order to subjugate the heroic Palestinian people.
It comes in the wake of a cluster of similar murders, which some people are justifying in the name of protection from terrorism.
The Sharon government would not dare to commit crimes if it did not have direct support and encouragement from the USA.
For its part, the ÎU is continuing its policy of tolerance and support for Israel which puts the slaughterers and the slaughtered on an equal footing.
The summit in Brussels confined itself to expressing its opposition to âextra-judicial killingsâ (as it calls the murders), but recognised âIsraelâs right to protect its citizens against terrorist attacksâ.
The Communist Party of Greece has repeatedly expressed its solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people and its support for its just fight and its absolute condemnation of Israel's policy of genocide, its regret at the loss of life and its conviction that the source of all the violence is the occupation of the Palestinian territories.
It also expresses its support for the pacifist forces in Israel and for all those who refuse to serve in the army and the occupied territories.
There will be no peace in the area until the people of Palestine have a homeland.
Â Â  . The situation in the Middle East has been with us for decades.
We have shown solidarity, in various ways, with the Palestinian people, and with those individuals and groups in Israel who are fighting for peace in the region.
A joint initiative for peace, stability and democracy throughout the Middle East, in the words of the title of this Council and Commission declaration, would be worthy of our support if it were indeed a joint initiative for peace.
What we cannot accept is that fine titles or headings disguise the imbalances inherent in the situation and even suggest misleading interpretations of events.
Terrorism cannot be justified by attacks on terrorism; nor can terrorism be glossed over by giving it a euphemistic label such as âextra-judicial killingâ or something that uses a similar degree of linguistic imagination.
The assassination of the Hamas leader, irrespective of what we think of that organisation, has contributed nothing towards peace in the Middle East; quite the opposite, in fact.
Similarly, the fact that Ariel Sharonâs fascistic government is not being held to account for the escalation of violence and terror contributes nothing towards peace in the Middle East.
Parliament and the European Union must adopt clear and unequivocal positions to condemn terrorism, but such positions will only have credibility when they condemn the terrorist policies of the Israeli Government and when those positions lead to concrete political and diplomatic measures, such as suspending the association agreement with Israel.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Kosovo.
Â Â  . Mr President, we were all shocked at the eruption of ethnically motivated violence in Kosovo on 17 and 18 March.
The latest outbreak resulted in death and injury and the displacement of 3000 people. It also resulted in the destruction of places of worship, hospitals and schools which were deliberately targeted in an attack on our shared vision of a multi-ethnic Kosovo.
While the situation in Kosovo has stabilised since 18Â March, it remains very tense.
The KFOR international peacekeeping force has been strengthened significantly in response to the violence.
I pay tribute to the efforts of all who worked hard to stabilise the situation and to restore calm in Kosovo.
I would also like to offer my condolences and those of the Council to all who have once again suffered loss of life, injury and loss of loved ones.
The General Affairs and External Relations Council, on 22 March, and the European Council, on 26 March, condemned the violence, loss of life, the damage to property and the destruction of religious and cultural heritage in Kosovo.
The full commitment of the European Union to the development of a secure, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo, in line with UN Security Council ResolutionÂ 1244 has been reaffirmed once again.
The European Union strongly supports the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General in Kosovo, Harri Holkeri, the United Nations mission in Kosovo and KFOR in their determined efforts to stabilise the situation and to ensure the full implementation of Security Council resolutionÂ 1244.
I would like to underscore the strong support of the European Union for the United Nations policy of Standards before Status.
That policy, together with Security Council resolutionÂ 1244, remains the foundation of the international communityâs commitment to Kosovo.
The European Union is considering how it can strengthen its role in support of the UN Standards before Status policy.
The recent violent events have risked undermining the painstakingly achieved progress that has been made to date.
It is important now that we assert the primacy of politics in Kosovo and ensure that there is no further descent into ethnic violence.
The explosion of sectarianism would be to the detriment of all in Kosovo.
It is clear that the future of the people of that country lies in the eventual integration of the countries of the Western Balkans into the European Union structures, as agreed at the EU-Western Balkans summit in June 2003.
The implementation of the UN Standards before Status policy is the key to achieving that goal.
However, the issue of final status in Kosovo can only be addressed once sufficient progress has been made on the implementation and review of standards.
Despite the recent violence and the continuing tensions, this will have to include the resumption of the process of dialogue on practical matters between Belgrade and Pristina.
As this House is aware, at the request of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, High Representative Solana visited Kosovo on 24Â March.
Commissioner Patten accompanied him on the visit.
They took with them a clear message.
Political leaders in Kosovo, especially the Kosovo Albanian leadership, need to take responsibility for the situation and ensure that there is no repeat of ethnically motivated violence, or of threats of such violence.
Those responsible for the violence must be brought to justice.
Kosovoâs Provisional Institutions of Self-Government must demonstrate their commitment to a multi-ethnic Kosovo.
Last weekâs European Council called on them to take an immediate step in this direction by allocating resources for the urgent reconstruction of damaged property, including places of worship, to ensure that internally displaced persons can return safely to their homes.
I welcome the allocation by the Provisional Institutions of EUR 5 million to assist with reconstruction, and the unanimous declaration of the Kosovo Assembly on 26Â March to condemn the recent violence.
Welcome as they are, words are not enough.
It is time to see real efforts to reach across ethnic divisions so that a Kosovo in which all can live peaceably and in security is created.
To this end, political leaders in Kosovo must now work more closely with the United Nations mission in Kosovo and with KFOR for the protection of the rights of all sections of the population, including members of minority communities.
What has happened in Kosovo over the past few weeks is a reminder to us all of the importance of the role that the European Union plays, not just in Kosovo, but in the wider region.
The European Union has taken the lead role in working with the countries of the Western Balkans to consolidate peace and stability in the region, and to promote economic development and the respect for human rights and the rule of law.
European Union assistance in the region in support of those objectives will amount to EUR 4.65 billion over the period 2000-2006.
The Union, including its Member States, continues to be the most important source of funding for the international efforts in Kosovo.
Moreover, European Union Member States make the largest troop contributions to KFOR.
The development of ever closer relations with the Western Balkans is a priority for the European Union.
Since last yearâs Thessaloniki Summit, the European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans have a shared agenda for progress.
The objective of eventual integration will be pursued through the Stabilisation and Association Process and through implementation of the series of agreements which brought an end to the tragic conflicts of the past 13Â years.
In the case of Kosovo, the Stabilisation and Association Process tracking mechanism initiated by the European Commission in the spring of 2003 is designed to facilitate Kosovoâs progress within the Stabilisation and Association Process, bringing Kosovo within the embrace of the European family.
Our efforts to promote the European perspective of Kosovo and the United Nations policy of implementing standards are mutually reinforcing policies.
The Stabilisation and Association Process challenges the democratically elected governments of the region to adopt and implement difficult and wide-ranging economic and political reforms, and to continue to strengthen regional cooperation.
The rate of progress of the countries of the region towards European integration is to a great extent in their own hands, although the European Union will support them fully in this endeavour.
Both sides of the relationship made commitments at Thessaloniki which must be implemented fully.
Those responsible for the recent violence in Kosovo must be brought to justice.
There should be no wall of silence, there should be no culture of impunity.
It is time to move forward, away from the hurt and the anger which have blighted Kosovoâs politics for so long.
The path to take has been mapped out by the United Nations, in its Standards before Status policy.
I would like to repeat the Councilâs support for Special Representative Holkeri, for his United Nations colleagues, and for KFOR, in their determination to stabilise the situation and to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolutionÂ 1244 in full.
It is the responsibility of all, but particularly of Kosovoâs leaders, to support the work already in train to ensure a stable future for a secure, democratic, prosperous and multi-ethnic Kosovo, with its place in Europe.
The European Union is ready to help in the achievement of this goal.
It is up to the people in Kosovo now to take up the offers made.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am extremely glad to have the opportunity to speak to the House today about Kosovo.
As the presidency noted, I went with Mr Javier Solana to Kosovo last week, because of our concern about the recent upsurge in violence.
During those terrible days and nights, a very large number of homes were destroyed, together with schools, medical facilities and a large number of churches.
The latest reports suggest that 22 people were killed and more than 850 injured, including police and KFOR members.
There is little doubt that although there may have been an initial trigger for the violence, it quickly became organised.
I also have no doubt that elements within the main Albanian political parties were involved.
We should remember that Europe rightly took a stand against the disgraceful ethnic cleansing by Milosevic in 1999.
Since then, the international community has spent EUR 2 billion â not including defence costs â to try to rebuild Kosovo.
We did not do that in order to see Kosovar Serbs being ethnically cleansed in their turn.
Let me share with the House my reflections on my visit to Kosovo.
I have to say that the High Representative and I were extremely disappointed.
We saw at first hand the anger and upset of Serbs in a suburb of Pristina called Kosovo Polje.
We were looking for evidence that Kosovar Albanian leaders understood those feelings.
There was precious little sign of it.
On the contrary, there was an attempt to blame everyone but themselves for what had happened.
There was one exception to this.
The Prime Minister, MrÂ Rexhepi, rose to the occasion.
He showed considerable courage in visiting trouble spots to try to defuse tensions.
He also immediately understood the responsibility of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government to put right the terrible wrongs that were done to Kosovar Serbs.
Before we arrived, he had decided to set up a reconstruction fund with an initial budget of EUR 5 million.
He understood that it was the duty of his government to put things right, not the responsibility of the international community.
I did not go to Pristina to promise that European taxpayersâ money would be used instead.
That would be completely unacceptable.
Mr Rexhepi promised that rapid action would be taken to repair damaged property so that people could get back to their homes as quickly as possible.
Mr Solana and I promised to go back through the summer so that we could see for ourselves that progress on reconstruction is actually occurring.
What are the priorities now?
NATO has reacted swiftly to increase troop numbers in order to provide better security.
This has had an immediate effect on calming tensions in Kosovo, although we have to remain extremely vigilant about the situation.
Next, UNMIK police are trying as quickly as possible to identify those responsible for these attacks so that they can be taken out of circulation and punished.
It is incumbent on the leaders of the Albanian political parties to purge their ranks of such people.
Next, there needs to be an investigation of the role played by the Kosovo police service in the disturbances.
There were reports that some members of the police service did their duty well, but there have also been reports of police service members either taking no action to prevent these attacks or, worse still, participating in them.
UNMIK is determined to get to the bottom of what actually happened.
Next, we have to be quite clear that we stand fully behind UNMIK.
There were clear signs of organised attacks on UNMIK property and staff.
That is completely unacceptable.
The European Union strongly supports the UN as an institution.
We cannot tolerate attacks on the UN, whether in Kosovo or anywhere else.
We also need to work very closely with our United States partners.
Mr Solana and I had a very constructive meeting with Marcie Ries, the American Representative in Pristina.
We all agreed that we needed to make it absolutely clear to the Kosovars that we are at one in our reaction to these events.
Finally, it is absolutely essential that the political leaderships in Belgrade and Pristina refrain from provocative statements which can only serve to exacerbate tensions.
Final status discussions are for another day.
Last weekâs declaration by the Serbian Parliament insisting on permanent sovereignty for Serbia and a system of cantons inside Kosovo was extremely unhelpful, to say the least.
So were statements by Kosovar Albanian leaders in the immediate aftermath of the violence that they would not accept anything short of independence.
