Beware of rhetoric!
As you said last time â and it had to be said â the European interest must prevail over national interests, but the dangerÂ âÂ which is clear to seeÂ âÂ is that it is not even the protection of fundamental national interests that will prevail but the upholding of minor positions of interest.
Therefore, Mr Berlusconi, we fear that the analogy taken from Hemingway cited in this House by Mr Altiero Spinelli when his draft was being adopted and he was less than certain as to its fate, an analogy used again in recent days by Mr Amato, will become reality.
He said that the big fish we think we have caught with the draft Convention is in danger of being reduced to its backbone, for the sharks have taken away the meat.
We must do everything possible to stop this happening.
Â Â  I could not interrupt a Hemingway quotation, but I would urge colleagues to keep to their speaking time!
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, will the Italian Presidency succeed at this historic time for the Constitution and European integration?
My hope, right up to the last, will be that the fruits of the Convention mature and are harvested in the interests of Europe.
I would like to consult you on two political considerations as you approach the final two months of your presidency.
The first consideration is radical, practical and symbolic all at once: we expect the Italian Presidency, together with the Commission, to lay the foundations for genuine-level European financing, controls and sanctions in the field of immigration.
We expect more than just general intentions now; we expect progress to be made at last by one of the very countries which is most affected by the situation.
Mr President-in-Office, I also expect an initiative from the Council you head on the situation in Iraq.
The unanimous vote in the Security Council may lead to a new way forward.
The European members of the Security Council have, at last, come to an agreement, and now the Council has to turn that compromise into an initiative: there can and must be a return to multilateralism, we can work together in the field of reconstruction, the humanitarian crisis, security and the democratic transition to Iraqi sovereignty in Iraq under the mandate and guidance of the United Nations.
Mr President-in-Office, as a European, I cannot fail to express my deep concern at the way the Intergovernmental Conference is being conducted.
You have confirmed the intention to conclude the work before December, remaining as faithful as possible to the Conventionâs text without substantial compromises.
However, it would appear that, thus far, the Italian Presidency has limited itself to taking note of and recording the positive and negative opinions of the various delegations on the different issues, with the danger, not least, that debates will be reopened on matters which were considered settled.
Europe, however, as Mr Watson pointed out, does not need a Presidency which is content merely to rubber-stamp initiatives or act as a referee; it does not need pedantic lists of the different demands.
Now is the time for leadership which will provide farsighted, wise guidance.
President Prodi is right: an inflexible Constitution would inevitably fail.
I therefore hope that precisely Italy, which, in 1985, succeeded with the IGC that led to the Single Act in achieving the impossible, will, in 2003, live up to its Europeanist traditions and help to launch a constitutional text which is flexible enough to be workable and convincing enough to be a reference point for European development over the next 50 years.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, to be honest, I have to say that this debate is, quite frankly, schizophrenic.
The policies put forward by the President-in-Office of the Council can only be considered if we disregard the actual situation in Europe.
You talk of changes to the pension system in order to preserve social cohesion.
Mr President-in-Office, it is sufficient to look at your own country: a general strike of all the trades union has been called for the day after tomorrow in protest against your pensions policy, including the organisations which signed the Pact for Italy with you.
Does the fact that all the workers are opposed to a particular policy not tell you something?
Does this mean anything to you after the battles in France, after the battles in Spain, after the discontent in Germany, or does it mean nothing?
You announce pompously that a European Constitution is being launched.
Did you notice that two major European demonstrations were held on 4 October in Rome â one organised by the European trades union, the other organised by the anti-globalisation movement â strongly, vehemently criticising this Constitution for the irresolution and ambiguity of its provisions on peace, rights and employment?
Then, at the Perugia-Assisi peace march, crowds of people of different cultures, religions and political allegiance called for the structure of the Constitution to be changed radically, with rejection of war made its first provision.
However, the war continues in Iraq and is polluting the world.
GuantÃ¡namo and the Baghdad detainees have been mentioned today.
We might also look at the measures restricting freedom in the Arab countries in the face of terrorism and war.
You have not said how we are to escape from this tragic vicious circle.
You talk about Europeâs Christian roots, but if these roots exist, the tragedy of the Mediterranean, tantamount to a humanitarian disaster, is unworthy of them.
How can you fail to see that the quota policy, the immigration policy, has failed?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have spoken in a serious tone about this tragedy in the Chamber.
It would be indelicate of me to remind you that your government ministers have said that such immigrants should be kicked out and sent back to their own countries.
Rather, I would draw your attention to the failure of this policy, of the policy of control rather than receiving immigrants and creating a different development model.
You talk about an economic policy and you seem not to realise that Europeâs economy is actually in crisis and in decline.
You talk of measures and trans-European networks, yet you heard their quality criticised just now.
I ask you, however, above all, how you are planning to deal with an economic crisis in the face of the devaluation of the dollar, relentless competition from the United States of America and competition such as that emerging from China?
How do you plan to escape from this vice and how do you plan to stop the decline?
You continue to cling to the Maastricht policies, to the policies which the President of the Commission once astutely described as âstupidâ.
You can only give any real weight to your policy if you disregard reality.
Reality will be your downfall.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it appears from the large number of topics that were discussed at the Summit that the Council is well aware of its tasks.
The Council wants trans-European networks, but, in practice, Member States baulk at building the few kilometres of track that would make it a little easier for their neighbouring countries to export their own freight.
There is talk of the need to offer development opportunities to people in their own countries, but if sugar or cotton are involved, we always allow the economic interests of a small group, of our own population, to prevail over the opportunities of the many people who live in misery, who try to escape from it and then drown on our beaches.
For years, we have been talking about the right of the Palestinians to have their own state alongside that of Israel.
Where, though, is this effective and credible action on the part of the European Union?
Once again, one is forced to conclude that such action is required, but where is it?
The European Union needs more effective structures in order to act more effectively, without the Member States throwing a spanner in the works.
This is why we need this constitution.
We always hoped that Europe would become a house for all, not only for citizens and Member States, but also for those people who live in a region that, for some historical reason, has not become a Member State.
Why, though, do you not see Europe as a large patchwork of cultures, peoples and regions, where everyone should be offered chances for development?
We should take more control of our shared destiny and this should not be thwarted by the prestige politics or short-sightedness of a few Member States.
We want a European constitution that is truly a new treaty, which gives the European peoples a new and brighter future and which also grants the regions access to the Court of Justice if their rights are violated.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, the welcomes the Councilâs decision to adopt a defence policy, reinforcing a consolidated relationship of cooperation with NATO, and stresses, with regard to the work of the IGC, the need for each Member State to have a Commissioner with voting rights; if Europe is to meet the challenge of wiping out terrorism, it must be capable of protecting every part of its territories and every citizen of its peoples, but also of promoting peace, justice, freedom, democracy and development in countries in which violence and hunger force millions of people to despair and to become refugees.
The tragedies which have taken place along the coasts of Italy call for the Council to decide to give political refugees the right of asylum, a matter which has been at a standstill for too long, and to clearly condemn governments which do not respect human rights, do not invest in resources to combat hunger and fail to expose terrorist and fundamentalist organisations present on their territory.
Europe must make clearer efforts to resolve the Somali crisis, which, since 1991, has seen thousands of desperate refugees die, initially in the Indian Ocean, and now in the Sicilian Channel.
These were not just any immigrants: they were Somalis, Mr President-in-Office!
You must hold another Nairobi Conference, then, and conclude it with a federative pact between the Somali states heralding democracy and a fight against fundamentalism, terrorism and poverty.
Those whose names were on the lists of terrorist organisations issued after 11 September must not be consultative partners either for the individual states or for the Union.
The Council, whose decision to create an agency for the common management of borders we welcome, must promote a new cooperation model under which aid serves to benefit the people and those who deny human rights are condemned.
In addition, the Council must ask for mercy for those whom law has condemned to death, like the young Iranian woman who has been condemned to death for killing a man who was raping her.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, European summits are so high-level, they must take place in the stratosphere, because they appear to be light years away from the daily realities of Europe.
Mr Prodi, MrÂ Berlusconi, you are arguing over who should take credit for an initiative for growth, an initiative that is a hoary old chestnut of European politics, which has been trotted out for over twenty years and which will gradually lose all substance.
As per usual, it looks as though MrÂ Pasqua will be disappointed.
Although you have not said a word, I am talking about the Council, about what has stifled growth in Europe and which will prevent any recovery, primarily in the Euro zone: the incredible âpolicy mixâ, that incredibly stupid policy which condemns the euro zone to both monetary and budgetary rigour. We would have expected the Council to say something about the soaring value of the euro, which is killing our imports, thereby making Europe, the euro zone, the weak link in the world economy.
Are currency issues only to be discussed at the G8, with all the consequences that that entails?
As regards the Constitution, without prejudice to the results, I think that the IGC is causing Europe to indulge in institutional navel-gazing, without the public being able to understand the issues at stake, something that the Convention managed to avoid, whatever one might think about the outcome of its work.
Well, MrÂ Berlusconi, you who have managed to be inventive in your own country and revitalise political life by inventing please innovate at European level and come up with a European referendum for us because, whatever the relative influence of our governments, of Parliament and of the Commission on the future architecture of Europe, what is lacking, what could be called the missing link, are the citizens: the only way of involving them in this process of building Europe is to hold a referendum, even if some risk is involved.
I hope that the IGC will result in a more solid resolution on this matter than did the Convention.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Berlusconiâs statement on the tragic humanitarian situation in Lampedusa is, thank goodness, corroborated by fact.
I have called upon President Cox to send a European Parliament mission to Lampedusa.
Europe can come to Lampedusa and other places to see, for instance, the work carried out by Italian policemen, and coastguards, whom I have seen in their patrol boats sharing their ration of food and water and often giving it all to these poor wretches at sea, conveyed by foul traffickers to our borders.
As well as taking humanitarian measures, however, the States and the European Union have a duty to send a firm, clear, severe warning to the politicians of the immigrantsâ countries of provenance, who bear the heavy moral responsibility for not combating this trafficking of human flesh, as it is the duty of all civilised countries to do.
Yesterday, the High Representative of one of these African countries was our honoured guest, and we even applauded him.
He is the leader of one of the countries which has yet to ratify, has yet to conclude the readmission agreements which are so necessary and which are the real guarantee of a policy genuinely combating trafficking of illegal immigrants.
We warmly welcome the decision taken by the European Union to include biometric indicators, which are essential for identification, in visas, residence permits and passports.
Like you, therefore, we hope that the Justice and Home Affairs Council will adhere as far as is possible to the deadline of 2003 for reaching agreement on the Councilâs proposals on this very badly needed measure.
The activities of previous Italian left-wing governments have, I am afraid, been characterised by huge-scale, foul theft from the people of Africa.
I would reassure MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo that we will ensure that this kind of racism, which is so harmful and so deeply offensive to those peoples, ceases.
We will exercise the greatest transparency in giving aid to the developing world.
That aid must never again be usedÂ âÂ as, I am sad to say, has happened in the past, and we should be ashamed of itÂ âÂ for business or, even worse, as illegal funding for political parties in Italy or other countries, maybe, in Europe.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ President of the Commission, there are two issues on which I would like to comment briefly.
I believe that the Italian Presidency has so far done extraordinarily good work on the constitutional issue, and I would encourage it to carry the heart of the Convention into the final round of negotiations.
At the same time, we should not forget that such concepts as transparency, democracy and efficiency are not simply fine words; they also signify something tangible.
That is why the attempt must be made, as regards transparency and the Legislative Council, which the governments see as an irrelevance, but which is for us a significant issue, since the Council is our partner in the legislative process â to get this Legislative Council to really work in a way that brings things into the open and thus to ensure public control.
Whatever the difficulties involved, an open-ended form of words needs to be found for this so as not to exclude the possibility of future developments in this direction.
The efficiency issue is in fact about the Commission, and it would do no damage if it were possible to leave untouched the Conventionâs system as it stands today, with the possible addition of voting rights for all.
Whilst I fully understand the Polish and Spanish positions, I would ask you, in the Council, to leave decision-making in the Council just as the Convention has proposed it, but to find some appropriate way of compensating these states, so that sacrifices are not made only on one side.
Here too we must not lose sight of the need for efficiency.
Criticism of Nice in this House focused on the decision-making methods in the Council, and that is something that we should not forget.
Let me make a final comment on the Convention.
The United States of America has recently made it clear that they have problems with a European security and defence policy.
I think that the Convention has been very clear in its formulation to the effect that structural cooperation is open to all and is not intended to adversely affect membership of NATO.
This can, if need be, be enhanced, but if there is no structural cooperation in this area, if there is no advance guard to provide a solution to this, then, at some point, a defence union will be established on the continent of Europe, extraneous to the European Union and quite apart from our ties to NATO.
Let the Americans, the British and others bear in mind that the alternative would be far worse in terms of their interests, and that they should therefore support the Conventionâs approach to this.
We now have to talk not only about the constitution, but also about Europeâs borders.
I do not think that has so far been adequately discussed.
We have to clarify the point that an eastward-looking also means that we have to create a second option alongside full membership.
Only if we are able to set limits â which means, in terms of enlargement, that we should, by not enlarging the EU too far, prevent it from being overstretched â will we be able to advance the development of the EU as it is at present.
It is for that reason that the second option, in a multilateral form and alongside full Member State status, must be made available to those countries that are not going to join us in the next ten years, whether through lack of desire or capacity to do; this would be something along the lines of a âEuropean Economic Areaâ.
I would ask you to show some real initiative in this area over the coming months.
Â Â  Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, summits come and go and one is very much like the next.
The meetings of Heads of State or Government produce conclusions whose practical content is generally inversely proportional to their length.
The conclusions of the European Council are increasingly reminiscent of the pompous resolutions of the now fortunately defunct Supreme Soviet.
Three years ago, however, Europe did take a great leap forwards, in the shape of Lisbon, but the fine ambitions set there have evaporated, even though we still intone the mantra that Europe must become the most competitive knowledge-based society, blah blah blah.
The fact is that the Union does not provide itself with resources that match its ambitions.
How can we make our fellow citizens understand that we are in the process of building Europe with a Community budget that stands at around one measly per cent of gross domestic product?
The federal budget of the United States redistributes more than 30% of its national GDP.
Even the Swiss, who have the reputation of being relatively stingy, redistribute 15% of their GDP through the Confederal budget.
The budgets of the Member States cannot make up for an inadequate Community budget.
After three years of mild recession, almost all the States need to address the problem of dwindling resources.
They are faced with either getting into further debt or having to reduce expenditure on investment, sometimes both at once.
Public investments have fallen in the European Union to around one measly percentage point of GDP.
The United States manage 3%.
According to the Commissionâs own staff, 1% of investment brings with it growth of 0.6%.
The Unionâs Member States will not get back on track to achieve healthy growth by now limiting their spending on investment and by cutting European citizensâ purchasing power.
MrÂ Berlusconi has just referred to the need to stimulate growth and competitiveness in Europe.
In this context, we have just rediscovered trans-European networks, but where is the money to fund them?
MrÂ Berlusconi has spoken vaguely about cofinancing under the Community budget.
MrÂ Prodi spoke about a lever effect, thanks to the Union budget paying for 30% of cross-border transport costs.
The Commission document on the European growth initiative only refers, however, to redeploying existing appropriations and does not mention a single extra euro.
Since it is impossible to spend the same appropriations twice, using appropriations from the structural funds or even those from the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development to finance the TENs will not bring any additional growth.
This is a tragic waste.
Europe is neglecting future spending, which means spending on education, research and infrastructure.
The Brussels summit concluded with nothing more to show than pious wishes.
We are now told that concrete decisions will be taken on 12 and 13Â December.
My group, Mr President, will judge the Italian Presidency on these concrete decisions.
In order to assist the presidency, we suggest that it take a fresh look at the ideas of JacquesÂ Delors.
Why not fund the TENs through a major European loan?
The European Unionâs debt capacity remains intact.
The euro zone has become an internal market in which nearly 90% of trade is conducted between partner countries.
Why not be bold enough to launch a policy to stimulate growth that would not work in each country in isolation but which could achieve real results if implemented across Europe?
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in your report, you described a make-believe Europe which, if it were real, we would want too.
However, we can see that you are preparing for the adoption of a Constitution which will silence, weaken and condition Europeâs institutions.
Moreover, you are increasingly bending Europeâs will to US and Soviet .
On this occasion, at least, we would like you to set aside personal ambition for once in favour of the collective interest.
Give up the pleasure of, at all costs, signing your name at the bottom of the draft European Constitution which blocks the possibility of future amendment, gives the Commission a degrading role and provides for paralysing unanimous decision-making in the Council.
We would also like you, at least for as long as you are President-in-Office of the European Council, to refrain from underselling Europeâs role in upholding human rights, even when they are attacked by the Americans at GuantÃ¡namo or the Russians in Chechnya, for the sake of a weekend at Camp David with President Bush or a trip to Sardinia with President Putin.
Speak out on these issues if you have the courage, providing, of course, that you do not find you have a conflict of interests in those areas.
Â Â  Mr Berlusconi, four months have passed since the Thessaloniki Conference entrusted you with the draft Constitution, but, after four months, there is still no indication that there might be practical ways of overcoming the well-known differences on essential points, either as regards voting in the CouncilÂ âÂ whether it should be unanimous or notÂ âÂ or with regard to the composition of the Commission, or, still less, in relation to economic and social policy or foreign and defence policy, under which the European military forces would supplement NATOâs forces and, therefore, be subordinate to the United States rather than independent.
The Italian Presidency has been idle and, at all events, has proved incapable of achieving tangible results.
Its predominant silence regarding the tragic developments in international affairs, starting with the situation in the Middle East, is shameful.
There will be no peace, there will be no end to the terrorism that we all condemn for as long as Israel continues to occupy the Palestinian territories, for as long as the shameful dividing wall remains.
The UN is paralysed by US vetoes.
The Italian Presidency must take action.
Sermonising serves no purpose.
It is Europeâs duty to act with great determination, formally recognising the existence of the State of Palestine and promoting the presence of a peacekeeping force that can guarantee respect for the borders of the two States and the implementation of the peace agreements.
As regards Iraq, we must demand the immediate withdrawal of the occupying troops.
Â Â  â Mr Presidentâin-Office of the Council, it is said that the Union will be based on principles of modern democracy but, nevertheless, it is the governments of the States â in other words the European Council â who will decide on the content of the Constitutional Treaty.
Furthermore, this will be carried out by finding fault with the Convention, which was the nearest thing to a constitutive assembly and which in every way better represented the citizens.
According to democratic principles, sovereignty resides with the people and not with executive governments.
The antidemocratic nature of this Union does not stop there, however.
However much it is proposed to increase the legislative competences of the European Parliament, it will still be the governments of the States in the Councils who will give the go-ahead to European laws and regulations which will then be obligatory for everybody.
I would therefore ask that there not be a legislative Council of Ministers but rather a second European territorial Chamber, whose members will be appointed by the parliaments of the States and by legislative constitutional bodies.
That would really be a democratic Europe.
Furthermore, it seems to me incoherent to propose changing the current reference to peoples in Article 1 of the Treaty for a reference to citizens when the constitutions of the States enshrine their respective peoples and when Articles 5 and 8 call for respect for the identity of the Member States.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, most of the statements which have been made here are dominated by the undisputed political importance of the work of the current Intergovernmental Conference (IGC).
Among other things, however, it is also worth reiterating the references to the recovery of the European economy, which, benefiting from the tail end of an improvement in the world economic climate, has managed to implement a raft of key proposals falling under the European Growth Initiative, with the support of the European Investment Bank and the involvement of the private sector, as has already been mentioned here.
The emphasis given to the problem of managing the Unionâs common frontiers also deserves attention, with a view to enhancing the safety of its citizens.
This is indeed fundamental to defining policies for controlling migratory flows, and illegal immigration in particular.
By combating unauthorised immigration, one also combats the networks through which the traffic in human beings passes, as well as all the associated criminal activity.
At the same time, as you said, MrÂ President, one generates conditions under which legal immigrants can be generously welcomed and appropriately integrated into society in our countries.
The work of the IGC, however, dominates the agenda, and we therefore feel that this is a good opportunity to call to mind the huge political responsibility incumbent on the Italian Presidency and the governmental representatives who are currently working towards an agreement on revising the Treaties.
Without wanting to belittle the value of the work produced by the Convention â in which I had a hand, in any case â the fact is that the revision of the Treaties began, properly speaking, when the Intergovernmental Conference opened.
With these words in our minds and on our lips, we nevertheless respect the Treaties currently in force.
That is why the Thessaloniki Council treated the Convention as a good basis for discussion and not as a awaiting only the ministerial seal of approval.
In this connection, and by way of conclusion, what is expected of the IGC is that, on finishing its work, it should present the national parliaments and the citizens of the Member States with a revised treaty, one whose basic clauses maintain the principle of institutional balance which has from the beginning permitted the interests and equality of the Member States to remain compatible with the requirements of European integration.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Berlusconi emphasised, a short while ago, and I quote, âthe historic importance of the constitutional step we are in the process of takingâ.
And yet, the initial meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference give the impression that they are skirting around the subject.
They are discussing with great authority and wisdom issues of institutional arrangements, which are indeed complex but ultimately of lesser importance, whilst nothing has yet been said on the most crucial issue, the principle itself of a constitution for a supreme body, which closely resembles a super State, with its supranational decision-making procedures and the absolute primacy of European law.
The Heads of State or Government are consequently sidestepping the main issue, which is: why should we have a constitution?
Is it simply an operation designed to clarify the Treaties?
Or is it instead an almost final stage of building the European super-State?
Will this super-State meet the needs of an enlarged Europe?
Would variable geometry not be a more appropriate solution?
All of these crucial issues, which are hidden from public view, must be addressed one day, we hope at least in referendums on ratifying the constitution.
The further off that day is, however, MrÂ President, the harsher the awakening will be.
Â Â  Mr President, we British Conservatives note Mr Berlusconi's words on the need to re-launch the European economy.
President-in-Office, you mention competitiveness, economic growth and deregulation.
They are all welcome words but they are also well-worn words from past Council statements.
The question is whether on this occasion these words will turn into action.
Sadly, it seems again that Europe is more interested in rhetoric than the real reform that is needed to kick-start the Lisbon process.
The need for real and far-reaching structural economic reform is pressing.
What evidence is there of concrete actions from Member States to implement such reform?
The president has spoken of his commitment to implementation of the financial services action plan, but the reality is that progress on the investment services directive has been frustrated just recently by Member States under this presidency.
Low growth and unemployment remain critical issues for Europe: matters that can only be addressed fully by the application of a determined political will to act over the structural weakness of the European economy.
But Europe is yet again more comfortable in pressing ahead with constitutional and institutional reform rather than taking practical action which makes a real difference to the day-to-day lives of our constituents.
There surely was a message for all of us in the Swedish referendum vote.
Has it been heeded?
The message from Sweden instead appears to have led some Member States to a renewed determination that voters should not be allowed the chance to express their views on the great European issues.
Of course in Spain, in Portugal, in the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland, the electorate will have their say on the constitution in a referendum and I was pleased to note that the Prime Minister of France, Mr Raffarin, has said that it is necessary for a referendum to be held there.
That is why we were all a bit confused last week by the attitude of the British Government on the issue of a UK referendum.
Indeed, the government seems to be in complete disarray on the subject: senior civil servants briefing in the UK denying a referendum was untenable; a junior foreign office minister keeping the door open before it was firmly shut by Mr Blair.
Eighty per cent of British people want a say in a referendum on this Constitution.
Yesterday, my party in the UK launched a petition to our parliament demanding it.
The fundamental changes in the relationship between the Union and the citizens of Europe proposed in the draft Treaty will not have legitimacy without the consent of the people.
There is just one other issue that I think has been causing real concern in the UK in recent days: the future of European defence and the Transatlantic Alliance.
Our American allies have expressed genuine concerns about the draft Treaty's proposals on defence.
The US Ambassador to NATO has said recently that they constitute the most significant threat to NATO's future.
The British Prime Minister says the opposite, that he would do nothing to undermine NATO, but this is of course the Prime Minister who assured Britain that the Constitution was nothing more than a 'tidying up exercise'.
France and Belgium continue to want a separate military structure to be created with a new headquarters in Brussels.
We see this as a challenge to NATO's supremacy in European defence.
I want to make it clear, to put our position on the record clearly and unambiguously.
We believe in NATO as the bedrock of European defence and any initiative that seeks to create a parallel structure within the EU framework undermines that long-standing and proven alliance.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking both for myself and on behalf of our group, let me warmly welcome and emphatically endorse what the President-in-Office of the Council has said about the defence of the European Unionâs external borders, and his observations on the recent and lamentable loss of human life off the coast of Sicily.
I gained the impression that Mr Berlusconi was very sincere in what he said, and share his bewilderment.
I can also tell him that the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this House takes the view that the defence of the external borders and of refugeesâ human dignity is not a task for Italy, Spain, or Greece, but for Europe, and we Europeans, from whatever country, must be clear in our minds that Italy is also defending the borders of my own country and those of Ireland.
Italy thus has a responsibility to Europe, and we have an obligation of solidarity with Mr Berlusconiâs country.
If it is the case that we have this obligation of solidarity, and if this is a matter of our common European concern, then we can also manifestly rejoice that, within the Council Presidency, this task is in the hands of the acting chairman of the Council of Interior Ministers, MrÂ Pisanu, whose exemplary approach we very much welcome.
We rejoice that it is not in the hands of certain members of your government, who say that, when they see boats full of such refugees, they want to hear the cannons thunder.
We prefer the acting chairman of the Council of Interior Ministers.
Mr Berlusconi, you have again had little to say about the Councilâs conclusions on the outcomes of the discussions on judicial and police cooperation.
You kept to yourself your thoughts on the statement in Article 34 of the Conclusions that discussion was needed on specific operations to combat serious crime in Europe and on the need for cooperation in this area.
When I last spoke, I put two questions to you; I would like to put them again today, and I ask you to give me an answer, as our group regards what you will say in response as a matter of urgent concern.
So let me ask you, Mr President of the Council, what you contemplate doing about speeding up the introduction of a European public prosecution service.
What, in particular, are you thinking of doing about the introduction of the European arrest warrant?
Our intention in introducing a common arrest warrant was to combat the most serious criminal activity in Europe, and I am not repeating this question just for dramatic effect; rather, I want to remind this House that, just in case the European arrest warrant does not enter into force on 1 January, the European Convention on the mutual rendition of offenders expires on 31 December this year, so that the law will be in a weaker position in 2004.
As there is danger ahead, we want you to tell us what you are doing about speeding up the introduction of the European arrest warrant.
What gives my question ever more urgency is the appearance in todayâs edition of , a newspaper with which you, Mr Berlusconi, may be acquainted, of an article by Mrs Sabrina Cottone from Milan, who interviewed Mr Bossi, in the course of which interview he said, âif the European arrest warrant is adopted, it will be a step towards dictatorship, towards terrorâ.
Mr Bossi went on to say that the European arrest warrant is a crime in itselfâ.
I will repeat that quotation: âThe European arrest warrant is a crime in itself.
It would be crazy to adopt it, and if it is adopted, then I will be its first victimâ.
Well, opinions may differ about that.
What I would like to know is whether making the law less effective in the fight against organised crime is one of the EUâs objectives.
Ought it not rather, MrÂ Berlusconi, to be your task, firstly, to put Mr Bossi in his place, and secondly, to do everything possible to enable the arrest warrant to become effective on 1 January 2004?
I would be obliged to you if you could answer this question.
Â Â  â I barely have the courage to say this, but we agreed in 2000 to be the world's most competitive, knowledge-based economy by 2010.
After so many debates and so little progress, it seems to have turned into a bad joke.
This report by the Council demonstrates once again that we need to cut back on the administrative burden for industry.
Nobody will have a problem agreeing with this on paper, but do we really realise what this involves in practice?
In the Netherlands, the Finance Minister, Gerrit Jan Zalm, set up a website entitled, , which enables businesses to specify on there exactly what is hindering them in their business activities.
I call on you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to do the same in the European Union.
We must give victims the chance to speak out.
Only if we have a serious overview of administrative burdens, can we set to work.
Hence, www.stopeuropeanoverregulation.eu!
I should like to finish off by saying, Mr President, that from your previous visit to this Parliament, I gather that you like a joke, and I therefore assume that your promises to the Ukraine about EU membership are an expression of your original sense of humour.
Surely we should first make a success of the current enlargement, and only then can we think about making new promises.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst there are those who assert that Europeâs governments are steadily dismembering the compromise that the Convention laboriously put together on the constitution, others maintain the legitimacy of their modifying the Conventionâs draft.
For those who were there at Amsterdam and Nice, the Brussels summit is all about .
There is, in any case, no denying the fact that representatives of the national parliaments had a hand in the consensus that the Convent painstakingly hammered out.
The signals sent out from Brussels put me in a thoughtful frame of mind.
Europeâs governments may well not have made any headway, but they affirm that they are heading in the right direction.
The German Federal Chancellor, Mr SchrÃ¶der, allows the French President Chirac to represent him.
In Europe, we know that nothing can be done without Paris and Berlin, but was it really necessary to put on such a show of strength to deliver a rebuff to all those who warn of a Franco-German directorate?
Finally, there is the growth initiative, with a lot of paper and no action ever since the Essen resolution â as long ago, let me emphasise, as 1994.
What this means is that a Quick Start programme is to be put together in time for the December summit, listing the TEN projects that are to be completed.
It leaves open the question as to how much money the EU will be chipping in towards the TEN projects, as too, though, is the question of whether the Stability Pact supplants the Growth Pact or vice versa.
I would have thought that growth is impossible without stability, for, at the end of the day, todayâs debts are tomorrowâs taxes.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I want, in this speech, to focus in the main on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, which forms, indeed, the centrepiece of the Italian Presidency of the Council, and which we want to encourage the Italian Presidency to complete before the end of this year, that being the only way of ensuring that Europe will continue, post-enlargement, to be capable of taking action, transparent and acceptable to its citizens.
This is a big task for the Heads of State or Government to take upon themselves in Europeâs interests.
So I also want to ask you â and here I am appealing to the Council and to the Heads of State or Government as a whole â to be really aware of the European point of view and of their responsibility to Europe in the negotiations, and not to get tangled up in trivial national issues.
We saw at the last Intergovernmental Conference, in Nice, where that can lead, and that is not the European spirit that we desperately need.
People have high expectations, and the Council bears great responsibilities.
In its fashion, the Convention produced an astonishing good result.
I would like to state that it makes an outstanding basis for the deliberations that are now to take place at the Intergovernmental Conference.
I would like to point out, though, that a few critical comments do of course have to be made alongside all the positive aspects.
Firstly, I think it right and proper that we should find a place in the preamble of this Treaty for the Christian heritage that has shaped this continent like nothing else, the clasp that holds it together.
Let Mr Cohn-Bendit make as much noise as he likes about that, but his roots, too, are in this continentâs Christian heritage.
Your reacting in the way that you do proves me right.
Secondly, we will have to give some thought to whether the Convention, in part 3, has overshot the mark here in transferring certain tasks to the European level that have not been there before and should not be there now.
I would give services of general interest as being one example.
If we have a proper understanding of subsidiarity, the European level has no business dealing with services of general interest, nor with the coordination of social and economic policy.
I do not know what added value there is for Europe in this area, where a bit more subsidiarity and competition among the Member States is more likely to be of benefit to the internal market in terms of the Lisbon objectives being achieved.
The same is true of the rules on access to the national labour markets.
These are issues on which decisions are the Member Statesâ responsibility, and questions to which the public expect answers from the Member States rather than from the European level.
If we succeed in resolving these problems as well, we will end up with a Treaty that really does deserve to be supported by people throughout Europe.
The most honourable thing that the Council can do is to assume responsibility as representatives of the people of Europe.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is only right that the Conventionâs draft should come to the conclusion that we have too little Europe rather than too much.
That is why we need coordination not only of economic and financial policy, but also of social and employment policy as well.
I believe that the initiative for growth and investment, which we are discussing, makes clear how feeble are our conceptions of how growth and employment are to be organised.
That is why I would like to call on the Council and its President to speak in far more definite terms about the approaches we want to take.
It is, I think, a good thing that we are going back to the infrastructure modernisation measures and thinking about energy and the environment rather than just transport.
I think it right that we should give some thought to research and development, but we must, above all, get a skills offensive started in all Member States simultaneously, as we will not be able to increase growth without skilled people, nor will we be able to become a knowledge-based society in which everyone is able to participate.
That is why everything possible has to be done to give us functioning social services, which should, in particular, help to reconcile work and family life, for women are indispensable if we are to achieve the higher employment rate that we need.
Sweden, Denmark and Finland have shown the ways in which we can do this.
The European Union has no lack of sources of funds, and I am not thinking only of the EIB or of the other options available.
I cannot but consider the way in which, in this European Union, payment of VAT is evaded to the tune of an estimated EURÂ 100 billion a year, quite apart from other taxes.
That would be more than these EURÂ 220 billion for ten years, and would enable us to get something really up and running.
That is why it really is time for us not to do as your own country does and put our faith in tax amnesties, but to at last get round to coordinating mutual assistance by tax authorities as a means of dealing with the scandalous cross-border criminal activity involving fraudulent invoicing, the motor and mobile phone trades, and the use of VAT evasion as a means of funding other underhand activities; all of these things we must put the brakes on, halt them and put an end to them once and for all.
Â Â  Mr President, one cannot be truly surprised at the slow progress of the opening of this IGC phase.
One must simply trust that, as the prime ministers have had more time to reflect upon the outcome of the Convention and upon the poorer quality of their own proposals, they will be drawn closer to accepting the outcome of the Convention and selling it on to their publics.
One issue that concerns me especially is the absence of a clear schedule for consideration of Part III.
The IGC is surely a wonderful chance for us to refresh and modernise the policy chapters, some of which, like the CAP, are 50 years old.
If Part III cannot be properly reformed, the IGC must, at least in Part IV, seek to soften the future revision procedures for Part III.
Â Â  Mr President, at the Brussels European Council, Europeâs leaders quite clearly gave up on the idea of setting immigration quotas according to nationality.
This decision followed on from the statements by MrÂ Fini, favouring the right of foreigners to vote in Italy and those by MrÂ Prodi, seeking to pursue his commitment to integration by obtaining new civil and political rights, proves the complicity and the active participation of Europeâs current leaders in the process of opening up our borders to legal immigration and consequently to the eventual mass colonisation of Europe.
The consequences of these irresponsible policies will inevitably lead to the loss of our national identities, to the ethnic communitarisation of European societies and to the loss of national unity, which guarantees civil peace.
We do know, however, most fortunately, that this colonisation of Europe will not take place without the citizens reacting to it in a legitimate, sound and healthy way.
Â Â  â Mr President, the truth is that the Italian Presidency has not had an easy agenda.
I am going to refer to three points.
Firstly, the difficult birth of the Constitution.
We are impatiently awaiting the proposals which the Presidencyâin-Office is going to make in order to try to overcome the outstanding issues in the second half of November and we are glad that we have been told that these proposals will deal with the problem from a global perspective.
By global, Mr Presidentâin-Office of the Council, I mean a solution which can affect all the institutions, which can achieve the agreement of all the institutions, and also of all the Member States â some of which have announced that they are going to hold a referendum â and of all the new States â which have also held referendums within another context.
I believe, Mr President, that this is an aspect of the problem which should not be avoided.
The second difficulty faced by the Italian Presidency is how to recover the path of sustainable growth and job creation.
Mr President of the Commission, growth, yes, but also stability.
We are happy with the Commission's proposed growth initiative, according to which infrastructures must play a fundamental role, because it is usually said, Mr President, that when the Europe of infrastructures, the Europe of construction, goes well, the construction of Europe goes well.
There is a simple reason for this: the integration of the markets is not just a political or judicial notion but, above all and fundamentally, a physical notion.
Hence the fundamental importance of infrastructures, which â being inert systems â make accumulated delays irrecoverable.
Either Europe resolves the problem of infrastructures once and for all or it will have to abandon forever its aspirations to become the most competitive area by 2010.
The final difficulty I wanted to refer to in this speech is that of how to restore relations with the United States following the Iraq crisis and following the events of 11Â September.
I believe, Mr President, that we must place the emphasis on the fundamental rather than on the peripheral.
The fundamental thing is a shared history, common values which clash â as our President, MrÂ Poettering, and others have reminded us â on issues such as GuantÃ¡namo and the death penalty, and also our shared passion for freedom.
We now have a wonderful opportunity to express the united view of our European Union project at the coming Conference of Donors because â as I had the opportunity to say yesterday in the debate on the budget â the rehabilitation, reconstruction, pacification and democratisation of Iraq is not a responsibility which should fall exclusively to the United States, but to the international democratic community.
Mr President, I said at the beginning of my speech that the Italian Presidency did not have an easy agenda.
It is clear, however, Mr Presidentâin-Office of the Council, that without difficult goals no summit is worth climbing.
Therefore, Mr President, I would like to wish the Italian Presidency luck and success in the decisive months remaining to it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would firstly like to say that Catalonia, where I come from, together with Aragon, Roussillon and the neighbouring areas, are still suffering from the lack of will or ill-will demonstrated by the Spanish and French Governments and other authorities responsible for developing infrastructures which would allow the Pyrenean border to be eliminated.
It is an example â a further example â of stupidity and short-sightedness, since an even more dynamic and powerful European region in that area would benefit everybody.
I hope that President Prodi's announcement of an increase of 30% in the funding of cross-border sections of the European networks will help governments to act in accordance with the conclusions of the Council which they themselves sign.
The development of a free Europe without borders is one side of the coin; on the other side are the management of external borders and movement of people.
In this regard also there is identical stinginess and lack of ambition.
I am pleased that the Council is reiterating the global view of the phenomenon of migration adopted at the Thessaloniki European Council; that is important, but admission, residence, integration, border control and the creation of positive dynamics with regard to immigration for receiving countries and countries of origin were dealt with at the Tampere European Council.
A legislative programme and coherent and clear political action which make it more attractive to go to a consulate than to put out to sea have been on the table for years, just as we have a European programme for offering justice and security to European citizens on the basis of cooperation between Member States, the cornerstone of which is the European arrest warrant.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what do you talk about in the Councils?
How can you make generalised statements about fighting crime when what we are waiting for is for you to tell us how and when you are going to adopt the proposals we have on the table, and whether they are going to take effect by the expected date in all the Member States?
Â Â  President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, President of the Commission, it has been said that this summit too was full of so-called decisions.
I wonder what the people of Europe think of an organisation that, summit after summit, continues to take decisions with which the Heads of Government do not even get their own ministers to comply.
Is there any proportion between costs and outcome?
President Berlusconi, you had an opportunity to put a stop to these meaningless resolutions from the summits, and I regret that you did not take it.
I also wish to emphasise that I have criticised previous presidencies on the same account.
I believe it is important for the summits to be fundamentally reformed so that people regain their confidence in the EU and its institutions.
President Berlusconi, you emphasised Christian values in your speech.
One of the Christian values I believe that everyone, irrespective of their denomination, should profess is that of alleviating suffering as much as possible.
I am therefore concerned about the many ongoing attempts to halt new research in genetic engineering in which all types of stem cells are made use of.
To promote that research is to reduce suffering.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to address two messages to the Presidentâin-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission.
The first is that we cannot and must not end this debate without a serious and rigorous political commitment, in order to put an end once and for all to the deaths, exploitation and trafficking in human beings, in other words, to the terrible human tragedies which we see daily on the southern Mediterranean border.
Commitments rather than words.
To the wave of 528 immigrants who a few days ago landed on the Andalusian coasts and in the Canary Islands, we must also add the approximately 70 who, it appears, have died trying to reach the coasts of Sicily.
It is very possible, moreover, that today or tomorrow we will continue to add to this doleful list.
The second message is that the European Union, as such, cannot deal with common immigration and asylum policies unless the agreements which the Member States adopt, either in interesting meetings such as the one that took place in La Baule, which may lead to the beginning of strengthened cooperation in this field, or in the meetings of the Council of Ministers, are not then reflected in cooperative policies which lead to the burdens and responsibilities being shared, both from an economic point of view, and in terms of human and material resources.
I believe, therefore, that we need also to provide, for example, for the need to create a European fund for the repatriation of illegal immigrants.
There are some countries, such as my own, Spain, which face high costs in cases of repatriation.
Having said this, it is essential also that countries of origin and transit take a much more responsible attitude, and particularly those countries with whom we have association agreements, which should fulfil all the terms of those agreements and not just the economic ones.
Equally, within the framework of these agreements, the Commission and the Council should appeal firmly and insistently to countries which, as in the case of Morocco or Tunisia, are the origin of the tragic events I have referred to.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ Berlusconiâs appearances in this House are remarkable in many ways.
Today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have managed to speak for 19 minutes and 39 seconds, in which time you have had a great deal to say about economic growth, competitiveness, innovation, industrial policy, then back to increased competitiveness and to foreign policy.
All of these are things we can agree with.
Yet you did not manage, in these 19 minutes and 39 seconds, to say one word, not even one syllable, on the subject of environmental policy or sustainability.
We can be grateful to Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, for evidently thinking in what are evidently less simplistic ways and for having, moreover, a good memory, as he did indeed say that the European Unionâs policies must always be guided by the principle of sustainability, and he reminded us all of the Lisbon process, of which I am sure that you too have some recollection.
What the Lisbon process means is that the European Unionâs policies must, of course, enable it to compete, whilst always taking account of considerations of the environment and of sustainability.
You have managed to insert into the Council Conclusions a statement on industrial policy to the effect that the consequences of all proposed EU legislation on enterprises are to be taken into account by providing a comprehensive impact assessment, and have, by way of providing a good example, immediately proposed starting with chemicals policy, which you, surprisingly, want to have dealt with in the Competition Council rather than in the Environment Council.
This was a great surprise â certainly one of last weekâs surprising moments â not only for me, but also many of your fellow-members of the Council.
I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Berlusconi, whether you are aware that environmental policy is not just something that we do because we are good or perhaps because we want to try and do things in an ecological way; but rather that we do it because it makes our industry competitive and because it enables us to pass on our planet and our immediate environment to our children, and perhaps because it enables us to maintain the good living conditions that we enjoy.
When you last appeared before this House, I asked you whether you intended to apply your strength and somewhat more energy to advancing the European Unionâs environmental measures.
To that question you would not give an answer.
I hope that you will now give me an answer setting out your position on your policiesâ ecological aspects and how you personally would assess your resources and the progress you have made so far, precisely what you conceive of as success in ecological terms, and whether you have to date achieved any sort of success in the area of environmental policy.
Â Â  Mr President, it is always difficult, in two minutes, to sum up or evaluate a Council with a full agenda like the last one which took place in Brussels.
I am going to comment on the economic context, also with reference to many of this morningâs interventions.
It is a fact that there is something wrong in our analyses, something that is wrong somewhere.
We have come out of a global World Trade Organisation summit which has not provided the expected results at all, and the word âfailureâ is a realistic way to describe it; we have a multilateral approach to trade policies which are currently in deep crisis; we must begin once more to ascertain whether the Doha requirements still do not have a basis, or whether the evolution of Doha will lead us to assume other positions.
At the same time, we have a situation in Europe where inflation levels are essentially under control; the energy prices are, I would say, fairly stable and financial market conditions are not negative.
So the question is: why is there no recovery?
And economic recovery depends on series of factors which can only come into play in a European context.
It is true that we are reinterpreting a Keynesian model readjusted to present times, but in this Keynesian model we need to speed up structural reforms.
When we talk of structural reforms, we also have the political burden and task of leaving behind privileges of position which at this time are becoming onerous with respect to economic developments.
The Brussels proposals are tangible and interesting.
We have learned that politics is a job which must produce daily results, and that it is built on the basis of daily efforts and daily work.
On 12 and 13 December, I think that we will see much of what was considered at last weekâs Council become concrete proposals.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, you, MrÂ President of the Commission, spoke of âturning words into actionâ. Indeed â the implementation of what has been resolved upon rather than announcements, and a move from enlargement to integration.
Not only for the media, but also for many of us in this House, the summit was more about rhetoric than about substance.
I cannot deny that I attribute that to the date on which it was held.
Fourteen days after the gathering in Rome, what really new developments can one expect on the constitutional front?
What sort of response did the Commission expect to its Growth Initiative in view of its inadequate preparation and the fact that the EU has no policy on either industry or the economy?
Might it not be necessary to combine the Member Statesâ economic programmes and the Growth Initiative into a package with real financial capacity and to make a statement about who is to do what by when in Europe in order to achieve the objectives that we agreed together?
I spoke in terms of announcements giving way to the implementation of what has been resolved upon.
We do not need anything new.
We want Europe to be strong on the world stage and, internally, to be structured on subsidiary lines.
We want the Stability and Growth Pact; let us abide by it and implement it.
We have the concept of the internal market; let us at last make it a reality.
We have competition policy; let us see to it that barriers to competition are removed in every Member State.
We have the targets set at Lisbon, GÃ¶teborg, and Barcelona; what we need is operational programmes to implement what has been resolved upon, not new announcements.
Secondly, we have before us a balanced basis for decision on the constitution.
We all know what points remain to be resolved.
While services of general interest are subject to the subsidiarity principle, they form part of the European social model, and so they need a derogation from competition law.
Delays will do nothing to resolve these issues.
We can achieve the timetable because the issues are still on the table.
Thirdly we say both âyesâ and ânoâ to a referendum.
By that we mean a âyesâ or ânoâ to a national referendum on reform.
I will conclude by putting a question to you. Why, then, do we not start by rethinking this issue too?
I say âyesâ to a Europe-wide referendum, âyesâ to a Europe-wide information campaign, âyesâ to a Europe-wide result.
That means that the majority of the states and the majority of the votes decide instead of nationalising a European project.
Â Â  â Mr President, the report by the Council starts with a short paragraph on the Constitutional Treaty.
There is evidently little progress to report on that score.
What we hear is in any case not so positive in a few respects.
It appears difficult to enlarge first and only then to focus on depth.
We had anticipated this all along.
The increasing fixation on the ideal of what is termed national sovereignty and national interest sparks proposals that are mainly focused on the question as to how we can frustrate the decision-making process in Europe.
This is the central idea of most of the attempts to change the outcome of the Convention.
Some want to maintain veto rights, while others want to reduce the blocking minority and yet others want to structure the Commission in such a way that all objections related to the Council decision-making process return to the Commission.
This would render the Commission a weakened body of national prejudice.
Finally, with reference to what Mr Karas stated, we are facing all these national referendums which, together, form a very undemocratic decision-making tool, because one small majority in one country can cause the whole of Europe to grind to a halt.
If that is democracy, then I do not know.
All of this is at odds with the intentions of the founders of European integration.
They succeeded in starting this gigantic innovation because of a broad European vision.
Had they remained stuck in a mosaic of small-minded, national interests, then Europe would have remained a platform for power games, violent or not, as the case may be.
We must continue to call a spade a spade.
A Commissioner who fails to prioritise the European interest but represents his own national interests is a corrupt Commissioner who must be brought down.
Parliament should not be reduced to a collection of errand boys of Member State governments.
After all, we are the direct representatives of the European citizens.
It is unfortunate that in some new Member States, leading personalities do not, for demagogic reasons, distinguish between the roles of Brussels and of Soviet Moscow.
It is very obvious where the differences lie: participation, free will, and so on. When we were faced with the choice of a free trade zone, personalities of that ilk always emphatically rejected that alternative.
We hope that the enlargement, which for a long time was our fondest wish, will considerably reinforce the European idea, for that is its objective.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the new external borders are to be set wider, with consequent migratory pressures, leads me to welcome your setting as a priority the reinforcement of the area of freedom, security and justice.
I welcome your choice of a multidisciplinary approach to deal with this, taking in the securing of the external borders and accelerated asylum procedures, along with measures to deal with immigration, steering the legal and combating the illegal.
I would, though, like to make a number of specific comments, starting with one on the management of the external borders.
If we want to have a whole range of projects to manage the external borders in new ways, with very high standards enforced everywhere, then coordination is needed.
The Commission and the Council have now proposed the establishment of a new agency, but the question arises of where it is to be located.
I would not be in favour of our again devolving competences upon an agency over which we have no control; I would instead prefer it if a coordinating unit â which might as well be called an agency â were to be set up within the Commission, where it could function efficiently.
I would ask you, when evaluating the options, to give consideration to this one.
My second comment has to do with repatriation policy.
If you want to put together credible policies on asylum and legal immigration, you have to combat illegal immigration and the abuse of asylum, and so you need a common repatriation policy as well.
I would encourage you, then, in future, to conclude repatriation agreements not only with states like Macao, but also, in fact, with the states from which we can expect the most migrants.
That is what we expect, and we will support you in doing this.
We will also help you to work towards the provision of information at the grass roots in these countries, which is the best way of preventing the trafficking in human beings.
For my final point, I ask you to exert more pressure on the Member States to get them, at last, to implement the directives on refugee status and asylum procedures, so that we can, once and for all, ensure that decisions are taken and procedures completed speedily, and that refugees get help without delay.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I would like, very briefly, to say something about the President-in-Office of the Councilâs statements on foreign policy and also on the outcome from the Council.
One could hardly expect the Council to do other than give attention to the situation in the Middle East and lament the way in which this has deteriorated, which it has done, also calling on both sides to renounce violence and enjoining a policy of moderation upon them.
Today, Mr President of the Council, I would like to call upon you to do everything you possibly can, whether through official or unofficial channels, to give real support to all the peace initiatives, whether they be Palestinian or Israeli in origin.
Among other things, I am referring here to what are termed the Geneva Accords, a splendid initiative by people who really have been involved for years with the whole complex process.
Let me make an exception here, and quote from an author â Amos Oz, an Israel writer who has this to say in a commentary on these Geneva Accords: âEver since the Six Day War, we are as close to the Palestinians as a jailer is to the prisoner handcuffed to him.
A jailer cuffing his wrist to that of a prisoner for an hour or two is a matter of routine.
A jailer though who cuffs himself to his prisoner for thirty-six long years is himself no longer a free man.
The occupation has also robbed us of freedom.â
These words, I think, clearly express the need for the European Union, too, to contribute something towards putting a stop to this state of non-freedom, which this situation has caused to prevail in Israel itself, and the fact that the Geneva Accords provide us with a good example.
The last few days, though, have also shown that the conflict in Palestine and the situation in Iraq are even more closely connected than we, in this House, had repeatedly claimed them to be.
Although, Mr President of the Council, there is at present rejoicing at the unanimous adoption of the United Nations resolution, we must not abandon the objectives that this House has always pursued in relation to Iraq policy: a strong role for the United Nations and a progressive but speedy and clearly-defined transfer of power from the Americans, from the armed forces, to the Iraqis.
Iraq belongs to the Iraqi people, and it must be made apparent, unambiguously and relatively quickly, that the European Union wants to implement this principle and put it into practice.
I am not very happy about the way in which the agreement with Iran came about.
I would have preferred it if it had been reached by Mr Frattini, the President of the Foreign Affairs Council, in tandem with Mr Solana, the High Representative.
We should, though, be glad that the three European foreign ministers have managed to come to an agreement with Iran.
Agreements can be reached without war, they can be reached by peaceful means, they can be reached by negotiating with countries that put up resistance, and we should rejoice that this important agreement with Iran now appears to have been concluded.
Â Â  Mr President, during the Convention proceedings, the pessimists predicted a negative outcome, at best a delay which would have jeopardised the objective of giving the new Europe its first Constitution in a short space of time.
Instead, we all know the way things turned out: in the end politics prevailed, the sense of responsibility prevailed and ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, despite the initial criticisms, achieved the objective.
Today, in this Chamber, I have heard certain pessimists making predictions about the outcome of the IGC which are not positive.
Naturally, no one believes that the work of the Intergovernmental Conference will not come up against obstacles.
No one believes that it will all be easy, but I am convinced that in the end, as in the case of the Convention, the European interest will prevail.
This is why I am optimistic, this is why I am convinced that this Presidency will make Europe take significant steps forward.
It is impossible not to welcome with satisfaction the statement made by the Spanish Prime Minister, MrÂ Aznar, or to welcome with just as much satisfaction certain affirmations made by PresidentÂ Chirac?
Politics is mediation, not propaganda; it is the ability to attain the goal within the prearranged time.
I am convinced that this Presidency, therefore, will attain the objectives which it has set itself: Europe will have, before the next European elections, its first Constitutional Treaty, fruit of the valuable work of the Convention and also fruit of Parliamentâs work.
Parliamentâs active participation in the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference is an extremely positive result, and this choice is proof of the fact that the Italian Presidency has maintained its promises made in this Chamber.
I cannot fail to stress the importance of reference to our Judeo-Christian roots in the preamble to the Constitution.
It is not, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, a question of a monopoly, but quite the opposite; it is that we must not dismiss the contribution that Christianity has made to the moral and social growth and development of this continent.
I am referring to the values which Mother Teresa of Calcutta embodied and observed: values which we all, believers and non-believers, share.
Also when we talk about the major, difficult issue of immigration, Europe cannot fail to hear the cry of pain uttered by millions and millions of Africans.
Africa, with its tragedies, will constitute the emergency of the coming decades.
Your words, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, confirm that the approach to this great emergency is the right one.
Carry on!
As many fellow Members asserted today in this Chamber, Europe â the whole of Europe â has to take responsibility, in political and economic terms, for organising and protecting the borders.
The road embarked upon by the Italian Presidency, I repeat, is the right one.
This is why we should encourage and support it, just as it should be supported, MrÂ Bertinotti, in respect of development policy.
How can we consider increasing the competitiveness of our regions without putting in place major infrastructure in order to develop the internal market and to create new jobs?
Carry on with the decisions concerning Lisbon too: without a serious reform of welfare systems our young citizens will not be offered any hope.
Social-democratic Germany has embarked on this path, as has centre-right France.
These are not, therefore, choices made by one side or the other, but it is a question of political farsightedness.
The decision promoting research is also positive: it was a promise made in this Chamber in July, and has been kept; just as the fight against organised crime is a promise.
I am pleased to see that Mr Schulz reads Italian newspapers attentively.
Allow me to supplement his press review with some news.
It is well-known that, with regard to the European Prosecutor, the Italian Government and the current Union Presidency have decided to adhere to the text submitted to the European Union by the Convention.
With regard to the European arrest warrant, as is just as well known â it is in the Italian press â the draft law to modify Italian regulations in line with the prearranged framework-decision at European level has already been tabled to the Council of Ministers and will be discussed soon, before being submitted to Parliament for adoption by 31 December this year.
In conclusion, therefore, in my opinion, this House, despite a few deliberately provocative interventions related to political affiliation, is encouraging the Italian Presidency to move forward along the road on which it has embarked.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members who made observations.
We have made careful note of all the speeches; we will take them into account during the 50 working days which we still have before the European Council in mid-December.
There have been remarks from many quarters regarding the achievements and work of this Presidency.
I would simply like to point out that it really is difficult â and I personally have experienced this â to address all the issues involved in holding a Presidency, in the very short space of time available; all the more so for those holding the Presidency in the second half of the year, as this space of time is reduced, in practice, to just four months.
In July and August, we did try to hold meetings with Heads of State or Government, but it was virtually impossible and we confined ourselves to the possibility of bilateral talks.
Therefore, in terms of actual working time, for a Presidency with this mandate during the second half of the year, four months are left.
Then there is the Christmas period, with the last European Council being brought forward to 12 and 13 December as a result, and so there truly is very little time available.
This means that we must look closely at the proposal in the draft Constitutional Treaty which provides for presidencies lasting two and a half years, with the possibility of renewal.
The hope is that it will be possible to find an influential President, who can represent our Union on the international stage with authority, and who also has the necessary time, maybe, to manage the rotating systems according to which the European Council operates, which of course cannot be done in too short a space of time.
I would remind you, however, that during this period, the Italian Presidency has endeavoured to discharge its responsibilities.
Just to try to explain how many things a Presidency has to do, I will tell you what we have done: we have held over 42 meetings with government representatives of Community countries and candidate countries; we have ended several old disputes which no previous Presidency had resolved; we have chaired 26 Ministerial Council meetings, along with all the work also required from the President-in-Office personally in preparing for these European Councils in the various sectors and in coordinating the Councils themselves; we have adopted 17 regulations and directives; we have concluded three conciliation procedures with the European Parliament, which had been ongoing for some time; we have concluded or signed seven international agreements; we have begun the technical review of the texts adopted by the Convention â all of this involves numerous sittings, and almost always at night, what is more, for the President-in-Office; we have held eight Association and Cooperation Councils, including Armenia, Georgia, Jordan, Tunisia and so on; we have had 10 summits and troikas, and moreover, this very week I am going to China; we have held 30 COREPER meetings, along with all the preparatory meetings; we have had 15 working meetings with representatives of the United States, Russia, the Balkans, Latin America and other countries; lastly, we have held over 800 Council working group meetings.
The future Presidency of the European Union must therefore be highly structured and must be assigned to someone with the youth and energy to sustain this level of obligations.
I am too old, Mr Schulz, for this kind of thing; but thank you anyway.
With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, I would point out that it was opened 18 days ago.
The Presidency initiated a debate, which was open albeit brief, that could not and cannot be prevented.
In fact, I do not believe that it is conceivable in a college of Heads of State or Government, to refuse or deny each government the opportunity to set out the position of their country on a constitutional treaty.
The Presidencyâs task was to listen, to expand upon each topic of discussion and it will subsequently be to condense this all into a global proposal, which is exactly what we are preparing to do.
The issues which are still unresolved, as you know, mainly concern institutional questions: the double majority voting system, the composition of the Commission â as has been widely pointed out here â the review of the Constitutional Treaty with the possible extension of qualified majority voting to other areas.
I expect, within a few weeks, when we have completed the detailed â but, I repeat, open and transparent â examination of all the issues before us, to draw up a global proposal.
It will be my job to contact, on a bilateral basis, the relevant persons in the different countries in order to discuss it probably at an informal meeting of the European Council, between 15 and 30 November and, at last, have the final proposal ready in mid-December.
One thing, of course, is clear, and that is that Europe and its citizens expect a high quality Constitutional Treaty; that is, an end product equal to the challenges to which we will increasingly be required to respond.
We cannot accept compromises which reduce the European Unionâs ability to make decisions and to make them swiftly and efficiently; we therefore cannot conceive that the defence of individual national interests â which is, however, right and understandable â could stop us having a constituent result necessary to consolidate the integration of Europe which is enlarging and uniting with an ever growing number of new Member States.
In December, when the Presidencyâs global proposal has been considered, expanded on and discussed, the time to decide will come.
We will ask everyone to endorse, with clear and transparent responsibility, a complete constituent draft which, I repeat, must be high and noble.
Failing this, European citizens will be called to vote in June without any knowledge of the new institutions and the faith of these citizens in the European Union and its progressive integration would be lost or be greatly reduced.
This integration is a decisive factor in meeting the challenge of making Europe capable of taking a leading part on the international stage, capable of facing, with dignity, any other international power on equal terms, capable not only of strengthening the democracy, freedom, well-being and security of its citizens but also of disseminating these resources throughout the world.
It is worthwhile considering this very point because we have all made a commitment, again recently with the Millennium Declaration, to give food, water, heath and education to those in the world who do not have them.
These are important material resources but we know full well that, if they are not preceded by the first resource, that is freedom â which results in democracy as a form of government-Â then there is no possibility of providing and guaranteeing these resources in the long term to those citizens of the world who are still lacking them.
I believe that when assessing â as I have been doing during recent days and nights â the final articles of the Constitutional Treaty, we must be clear that this Treaty will be in force for our fellow citizens for the next 10, 20 years, and that it must give our Union, as the seat of the most ancient civilisation, as a group of states and citizens which identify with a common heritage of values, principles, cultures and civilisation, the chance to be a protagonist in the world, to carry out, together with other countries and not in conflict with other countries, the duty of exporting to the world precisely that important resource of freedom and democracy, which alone can guarantee well-being for the people, which alone can effectively guarantee a truly peaceful future for the whole world.
There are other more specific matters, which Mr Tajani has already answered in part, such as the European Prosecutor.
We shall abide by the draft Constitutional Treaty.
As far as the environmental dimension is concerned, I would point out that paragraph 24 of the Conclusions includes the environmental dimension in the growth process as a factor which will work as a catalyst for innovation and modernisation in key sectors such as energy and transport.
In conclusion, I would like to remind you that, in effect, we have already obtained tangible results, and this gives us hope for the further deliberations of the Intergovernmental Conference.
We have obtained results in an area where there were seemingly insurmountable divisions: European defence.
The work of this European Council â which will take tangible form in the Councilâs work in December â has given rise to the realisation by all the countries of the European Union, including the 10 new countries which are joining us, that there can be no true European Union foreign policy which carries weight, which is authoritative, if we are not backed up by an independent European defence force.
The system of enhanced cooperation â or structured cooperation, as the case may be â has also been accepted, a system which allows certain countries which have greater military capacity and have the possibility and intention of spending on defence, to join together, but on three very clear conditions.
Firstly, that this cooperation is open at all times to all Member States of the European Union which wish to participate in it; secondly, that the criteria and rules according to which this cooperation is set in motion do not stem from a decision made by the States which initially establish this cooperation, but are approved by the European Council.
It will be decided in December whether this approval must â and I hope not â be given by unanimous voting or by qualified majority voting.
The third condition is that European defence must not be seen as an alternative to NATO but as a complement to NATO itself, which we still consider to be one of the pillars that has ensured over half a century of peace and security in Europe.
I can only promise you all that we will approach these final 50 working days with the greatest dedication and, with regard to the Constitutional Treaty, with a clear idea in mind at all times.
We will not be able â just for the pride and satisfaction â to close the Intergovernmental Conference under the Italian Presidency.
Such a thing has never happened before, because the five Intergovernmental Conferences which preceded this latest one opened under one Presidency and always closed under other Presidencies.
We, too, even though we are trying to arrive at a conclusion and even though we know that the European citizens will be summoned to the polls next spring and that we must therefore do everything possible, or rather, more than everything possible, in order to let them know what the roles and overall ambit within which the Parliament whose Members they will be called upon to elect will have to operate, will never agree to go so far as signing a compromise, a Constitutional Treaty, which cannot assure Europe, and by extension its citizens, that it will perform what we all believe must be its duty in the coming years.
The Italian Presidency will therefore do all it can to complete the work by December, but will not allow this work to result in a watered-down Constitutional text, which favours the interests of individual States rather than defending the common interest of us all, which is, of course, the common good.
Â Â  . Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all for this debate, which has been extremely interesting and which has provided us with ideas for our future action.
I thank Mr Berlusconi for the desire he expressed to close the Intergovernmental Conference with a powerful, and not a watered-down text, and I also thank him for having stressed the need for a sense of continuity in the institutions, and the difficulty of this continuous, fast rotation.
The Commission is aware of its duty to ensure the continuity of the institutional work of politics: we have done so throughout recent years consistently, loyally and with dedication, and indeed, this very evening, I am going to Dublin for talks with the Irish Prime Minister, precisely to ensure this continuity and so that the work we are doing is not fragmented by the continual changes that take place.
Turning to the issues that we must touch on, I would like to make some very simple observations.
Many interventions referred to the question of the Commissionâs composition.
I would like to clarify once again that the draft Convention already includes one Commissioner per Member State.
What we do not accept is that half are working Commissioners and half are ghost Commissioners; but there is already one Commissioner per Member State.
We must make all Commissioners visible with the same powers and able to lay down European policy.
It is by no means the case that having one Commissioner from each Member State would mean that national interests are represented: already, in the present Commission, the Commissioners, I am glad to say, do not represent national interests but the common interest.
A second problem which has emerged and which is of great interest was mentioned by MrÂ Bonde.
I was a little surprised, I must say, when he came out in favour of a referendum in each Member State, because I thought that he agreed with the principle of subsidiarity, whereby each country chooses the method with which to adopt their Constitution.
If a referendum is necessary â as Mr Karas said a while ago â then we should have a European referendum.
You understand, then, that it would all take on a different significance: all we would need is the Constitution as decided here, approved by a European referendum, and it would assume infinitely greater significance, it would be something altogether different.
I really would ask you to reflect on this.
I know full well that it sounds too good to be true, but there are times in history when a decision of this kind is sufficient to change the face and life of our institutions.
The third issue: the quality of investments.
The quality of investments was raised, and I would like to clarify that the quick-start list is not going to create priorities and exclusions.
That is not what we intend; rather, we want to identify the projects which are the most mature, most transnational, most likely to mobilise resources and confidence rapidly.
Confidence, MrsÂ Frassoni, also and above all means social and environmental sustainability, in line with the policies of the Commission, which, over recent months, let us not forget, has sought to establish itself in the highly sensitive area of energy policy, dedicating a large part of our resources to research into hydrogen and alternative energies.
Moreover, the extremely sensitive question of the protection and health of the environment and the chemical industry was raised.
It may, indeed, be the case that we have had to make compromises, especially at a difficult time in terms of the economy: I do not rule that out, because we have to make compromises every day, but I want to assure MrsÂ Frassoni that we are at the forefront of the world â very much so â with the substantial costs that this entails.
However, we want to be, as we were for Kyoto, because we know full well that, as the European Union, we have to shoulder a responsibility which is distinct from the responsibility shouldered by the individual countries, the individual nations.
Similarly, as the European Union, we have to shoulder responsibility â and here I am looking at the candle, the large candle, still alight in front of MrÂ WatsonÂ âÂ with regard to the Guantanamo issue, on which I cannot fail to agree with the concerns expressed regarding the state of the prisoners.
Without making simplistic judgments, I can say that, if a case of this kind happened within the European Union, it would probably be considered under the scope of the procedure laid down by Article 7.
Today, however, we must also recognise that detainees in the Member States are detained precisely in the Member States, and we must make it clear in practical terms that we expect these citizensâ rights to be vigorously defended by the authority of their States.
Lastly, to conclude the foreign policy issues, MrÂ Wurtz made strong reference to the GenevaÂ Plan.
I was very pleased by this because it is the first time that a practical initiative has been put forward by the Palestinians and Israelis and not by theÂ âÂ albeit extremely valuable â initiatives of the Quartet and external bodies.
They will not be representatives of the governments of both sides, but they are representatives of enormous intellectual and moral stature.
I would like to remind the President of Parliament here of the skill with which the Speaker of the Knesset, AvrahamÂ Burg, led the Israeli Knesset at difficult times and the very real enthusiasm he generated with his speeches, his discussions and also his critical remarks.
They will make a contribution, which I hope will be decisive, to peace in Israel and we, I can assure the honourable Member, will be ready to seize it with the sensitivity necessary in these cases.
It is clear that this is a Palestinian and Israeli process, not a process conducted by the world powers relating to Israel and the Palestinians; it is from these quarters that we are awaiting a message that will enable us to achieve peace in the Middle East together.
With regard to immigration, MrÂ Brok referred to the European policy which he called âwider Europeâ; I prefer to call it the ring of friends policy, that is the policy of having around us â from Moscow, from Russia to Morocco â countries with which we have a close, solid relationship based on friendship.
This is the implementation of âsoft securityâ, of that security policy which Europe has entrusted to dialogue, to economic bonds, to cultural bonds.
It is in this context that we must place the issue of immigration.
We have already taken two major steps forward: cooperation on policing â which really is a step forward â and the agency to coordinate our action.
MrÂ Pirker raised some legitimate objections with regard to the agency and the danger of duplicating it.
However, we want to ensure, precisely, that this is a body at the service of the European institutions to coordinate our action.
This is the first part, but it is not enough, it is not enough!
This is a means of internal defence, but we need an initiative to manage and keep the immigrants in their countries of origin.
Clearly, therefore, we must make a twofold agreement with these countries, on the protection and the control of immigrants, giving them the possibility to interact and also to reap a legitimate benefit from this.
The quota policy, rejected by the Council, perhaps partly because the term âquotaâ is inappropriate, is absolutely essential.
I would call it an agreement with these countries to guarantee them a minimum emigration level so that they help us to protect our borders.
There is no alternative: if we live among friendly countries, we will succeed in resolving this tragic problem; if we do not live among friendly countries, they will continue, with a hostile approach, to send us emigrants, exploiting them, and we will no longer know what position to adopt or what decisions to take.
We should remember this: initially soft, passive defence, and then an active agreement with these countries.
Lastly, many of you rightly raised the question, the fear of falling into the clutches of economic decline.
This is a serious, disbursing problem, which combines with the concerns that the German, French and British Governments have, together, expressed over the risk of European deindustrialisation.
We must not forget that this is an extremely serious matter, upon which we will have to reflect and work in the future because we cannot accept protectionist solutions which would leave us even worse off.
Together, we must, by applying the lessons of Lisbon to this new situation, give Europe the impetus it needs.
The fundamentals of our economy are strong, and are much stronger than those of other economies which are currently lecturing us and telling us how to proceed.
Let us remember, however, that, although they are necessary, the structural reforms which MrÂ Fiori rightly mentioned in his speech do not suffice.
We need energy and coordination between us all, a sense of mission, of what everyone expects from European politics.
We are experiencing a highly absurd situation: all our governments and countries are expecting us to provide an industrial policy, a financial policy, a common and coordinated research policy to free us from those clutches of economic decline; the peoples are calling for this, the governments are calling for this, but then, when it comes to taking the necessary steps to resolve the crisis and achieve these objectives, that is when national interests, fears and conservatism prevent us taking action.
We have been experiencing this absurd situation for too long; we must find a way out, and Parliament and the Commission are being called on by the European peoples to overcome this very situation.
Together we have to do this.
Â Â  Mr President, we do not have the chance to come back on this debate, and I do not wish to trespass on the goodwill of those in the House.
I would simply ask the presidency and the Commission to explain why we should expect Europe's voters to vote for Europe if we do not have the solidarity and the commitment within the Commission and Council to stand up for the rights to which our continent has subscribed.
Â Â  I should like to thank everyone who has contributed to today's debate, which was a reflective, calm and good-tempered exchange of views.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The conclusions of the European Council of 16-17Â OctoberÂ 2003 reveal that the Heads of State or Government are persisting with the same neoliberal policy, showing complete indifference to socio-economic problems.
It is unacceptable to continue giving priority to enhancing the competitiveness of businesses on the basis of further liberalisation and privatisation, further pay cuts and flexibility, instead of solving the problems of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.
Even the so-called âEuropean Initiative for Growthâ will fail as long as the limitations imposed by monetary policy remain in place.
Those limitations also bring the risk that funding for large projects will come to depend on the whim of the financial markets.
The Stability Pact needs revising more than ever, in such a way as to take into account employment, education, training and sustainable development.
As for the Intergovernmental Conference, what was revealed there is worrying, especially the unacceptable financial blackmail practised by some Member States, who are threatening to block the Community budget so as to obtain an agreement based on the so-called European Constitution.
It is equally regrettable that the Council has not put in place the measures needed to bring an end to the occupation of Iraq, so as to ensure that the Iraqi people will be able to claim their inalienable right to determine their own future and exploit their rich resources.
Â Â  Colleagues, I should like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to Mr Olivier Kamitatu Etsu, the President of the transitional Parliament of the Democratic Republic of Congo who, together with a delegation of that parliament, has joined us in the official gallery.
I wish them a productive stay in Strasbourg.(1)
Â Â  I would like to inform you of something which our President said at the opening of proceedings this morning, when, however, not all the MEPs were present in the Chamber.
It is important and noteworthy: for the first time, during this sitting we have three new interpretersâ booths in operation.
For todayâs debate we have interpretation into three of the new languages, that is, Polish, Hungarian and Czech.
The channels are 12 for Czech, 13 for Hungarian and 14 for Polish.(1)
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am requesting the floor for a few minutes to ask for the assistance of the Presidency and to explain the clearly irregular situation which has arisen in this report.
An amendment by my group, voted for by the immense majority of the committee, has surprisingly disappeared from the text being voted on today.
That amendment called for the recognition of the right to asylum for women who suffer serious persecution and violations of their human rights.
For this reason, Mr President, and on behalf of my group, I would ask that we postpone the vote on the Smet report until the services of the House clarify this situation, which we believe to be immensely serious.
Â Â  .â Mr President, a correction to the text has been made after very lengthy negotiations.
I will read out this correction and would ask the Socialist MEPs whether it ultimately reflects what they have asked for.
If not, I agree that it should be sent back.
I will read out what the text of paragraph 13 should be, because there have indeed been a number of difficulties, partly because sections have been deleted from the text.
âCalls upon the Member States to take into account persecution and/or the fear of persecution which may be suffered by women on account of their sex.â
Â Â  Mr President, in support of MrsÂ Valencianoâs intervention, and in view of the fact that this really was a significant procedural violation, I would like to support her proposal, which does not entail referring the report to the committee but simply delaying the vote so that matters can be clarified.
We support MrsÂ Valencianoâs position, which, in procedural terms, is absolutely right.
Â Â  I shall put to the vote Mrs Valencianoâs request to postpone the vote.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, further down the voting list there is a vote on several resolutions on the oral question on the liberal professions.
I would like to ask that this be removed from the agenda and deferred until the next part-session in Brussels.
This has also been agreed with the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
We want to try to find a compromise resolution rather than vote on these contradictory resolutions.
Â Â  I shall put to the vote the request to postpone the vote.
Â Â  . Recent food scandals clearly illustrate that food safety is at risk, especially given that an obsession with profit, combined with a lack of controls and, very often, permissive legislation, seem to take precedence over public health concerns.
Food additives, the âE numbersâ we often see on the labels of food products, come into the equation via the agri-foodstuffs industry.
From preservatives to colourings, they serve specific purposes and should be effectively controlled in order to assess the risk they pose to public health.
Framework DirectiveÂ 89/107/EEC, on food additives, provides for the adoption of specific directives with a view to harmonising the use of different categories of additives in foodstuffs.
It is in this context that amendments have been tabled to DirectiveÂ 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs.
I therefore support the European Parliamentâs two main proposals.
The first of these prohibits trade in and use of sweeteners not conforming with the revised Community legislation until stocks are exhausted, while the second withdraws the Commissionâs power to decide whether or not a substance is a sweetener until such time as the framework legislation is revised.
Â Â  . The aim of this report is to update the terms of use of certain products, in light of the scientific studies available on the undesirable side effects which these substances may have on humans and the acceptable daily intakes fixed by the Scientific Committee for Food.
Like the rapporteur, I fail to see why the Commission should have responsibility for deciding whether or not a substance is a sweetener until such time as Framework Directive 89/107/EC on food additives is revised.
I agree that the Commissionâs powers in this area may be extended only when the aforementioned Framework Decision is revised, as the Commission has stated it will be in the course of this year.
The proposal that the Commission draw up a report outlining the progress made in the re-evaluations of all additives within two years of the entry into force of this Directive should be welcomed, as should the measure designed to avoid the abuse of temporary exemptions for products which do not comply with this legislation.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . I should like to take advantage of the vote to point out the following:
First, my agreement with the European Parliament proposals for higher compensation margins.
Secondly, this requirement should not result in higher premiums for citizens, given that insurance companies have a great deal of room for manoeuvre, in conjunction with the measures being proposed by the Italian Presidency to improve road safety and reduce road traffic accidents.
Î€hirdly, the importance of the insured's having a priority claim over creditors in the event of the bankruptcy of an insurance company.
Â Â  . This Directive aims to modernise previous directives on motor vehicle insurance.
The proposal seeks not only to harmonise at Community level the different provisions of national legislation, but also to encourage the free circulation of goods and persons.
Previous directives put in place a requirement for all Community vehicles to be insured against civil liability, for valid insurance certificates to be awarded in all the Member States, for compulsory cover for all vehicle passengers, the establishment of guarantee funds, and the famous Green Card.
Since I come from a country which, unfortunately, suffers from one of the worst road safety records, one of the lowest levels of cover and of damages arising from compulsory motor vehicle insurance, I welcome any initiative aiming to enhance the protection afforded motor accident victims by compulsory insurance through swifter procedures and higher levels of minimum cover, providing Member Statesâ ability to go further is not threatened.
While I support the rapporteurâs original proposals to increase the amount of the minimum sum insured to EURÂ 10Â million per accident for personal injury, and to EURÂ 5Â million per accident for damage to property, I regret the fact that that this position has been replaced by a compromise involving smaller amounts.
Â Â  . Mr Rothley is a remarkable kind of Social Democrat.
He always does the opposite of what you would expect a member of his group to do.
In June, his major achievement was that he provided for a considerably higher salary for all MEPs other than the already excessively paid Germans and Italians.
Years previous to that, he had claimed that his intention in doing this was to enhance Parliament's dignity.
Now, as rapporteur, he is proposing in his Amendment No 15 to exclude pedestrians and cyclists from bodily injury cover in the drivers' legal liability insurance, irrespective of whether the driver is at fault.
His motive is now that this concerns a delicate and very controversial problem, one that is better regulated in a separate legal instrument.
If this separate legal instrument were to come into being at the same time as this directive, then there would be nothing wrong with his argument.
However, Mr Rothley knows very well that this House has no right of initiative.
If we were to reject this component, we would need to wait and see whether the Commission were ever to table this separate proposal.
If this proposal were to be tabled, Mr Rothley anticipates possible further problems.
In that way, the weakest party is put at a disadvantage.
That is why I reject this proposal.
Â Â  . I voted in favour.
This new proposal for a fifth Directive on motor vehicle insurance aims to amend the existing directives by plugging gaps and solving the practical problems facing the citizens of the Member States.
Indeed, insurance premiums covering temporary stays in another Member State and short-term insurance covering vehicles bought outside their ownersâ Member State of residence are legal mechanisms which the Community did not tackle in the past, as were the updating of existing provisions on the amount of minimum cover which motorists should enjoy and increased protection for pedestrians and cyclists involved in accidents.
On another matter, one of the most important aspects of this report concerns resetting the minimum levels of guarantees for personal injury and damage to property, in the context of the wider trend to promote victimsâ rights.
The recognition of every Member Stateâs right to demand that drivers of certain types of vehicles (trailers, agricultural machinery, and so forth) produce valid proof of insurance cover while driving such a vehicle on their territory also deserves my support.
Â Â  Unlike the Commission, the European Parliament pronounces itself in favour of compensation based upon each accident rather than upon each injured person.
As a result, the level of compensation per person would only be half as high in the case of an accident in which two people were injured.
It would be as if there had only been one injured person.
I find that odd, in fact downright absurd.
For that reason, I have voted against the European Parliamentâs position and, instead, supported the Commissionâs line.
Â Â  . Conservative MEPs accord a very great importance to issues of parental responsibility and the protection of children.
It is, unfortunately, an unavoidable fact that the European Community is working towards the establishment of a common judicial area.
However, we believe that parental responsibility should remain the right of a parent within the competence of individual Member States and, as such, cannot support a report which gives the Council the right to instruct Member States to hand over their autonomy in this area.
Â Â  .
I welcome the political agreement reached by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on the draft regulation on recognition and enforcement in the Community of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, based on common rules on jurisdiction, especially with regard to issues relating to the return of the child, emphasising that the childâs best interests must be the primary consideration in all judicial decisions relating to children.
The formal adoption of this regulation can only take place, however, when a decision is adopted authorising the Member States to ratify the Hague Convention of 1996, in the interest of the Community.
That is the background to the initiative we have debated today, and its urgent nature.
Its aim is to authorise the Member States to ratify or accede to that Convention in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children (the Community cannot become a party to the Hague Convention).
It is incumbent on the Member States, therefore, to take the necessary steps to enable the Community to become a member.
That will make a real contribution to strengthening Community law on child protection.
In doing so, we will bring the European Union closer to the citizens, and above all to those unfortunate enough to experience the heartbreak of separation or divorce, which are enough of a tragedy already without making matters worse by affecting the rights and welfare of children.
Â Â  . I agree with the rapporteurâs view that the Member Statesâ ratifying or acceding to the Hague Convention of 1996 will help to provide better protection for the rights of children in respect of parental responsibility, so that, as the rapporteur says, âin all decisions relating to children, the childâs best interests remain a primary considerationâ.
I welcome the proposals intended to ensure that the Convention enters into force as early as possible.
I do not, however, have any truck with the federalist thinking underpinning this report.
In particular, I must highlight how ironic and inexplicable it is to suggest that the Member States need Council authorisation in order to ratify or accede to this Convention.
Â Â  . I am with the rapporteur when she states that establishing a harmonised and standardised judicial area is a vitally important element in the advancement of European integration in the sphere of parental responsibility.
This proposal is an interesting step in that direction.
In fact, it aims to authorise the Member States to ratify or accede to the Hague Convention in the interest of the European Union, thereby overcoming the technical problem that only sovereign states may be parties to that Convention.
The significance of this is that the Hague Convention relates to jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children, and has already been the main inspiration for the future Council regulation on parental responsibility, which the Council is still debating.
I disagree with the rapporteur, however, when she seeks to base her arguments on ArticleÂ 24(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Consideration of the childâs best interests should be invoked for its intrinsically high value, not because it is called for in a text which, in any case, lacks any legal value at present.
Nevertheless, since this is a matter of ensuring that, in all judicial decisions relating to children, the childâs best interests remain a primary consideration, I support the rapporteurâs proposals.
Â Â  .
The Hague Convention entered into force on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2002 and concerns Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children.
It is, therefore, now crucial that the Member States do everything that is needed to ensure that the Union complies with the Convention.
The European Union is working towards establishing a common judicial area founded on the principle of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions.
We must ensure that every judicial decision prioritises the interests of the child.
We have a duty to protect our children, who are tomorrowâs adult citizens.
Our society can only move forwards for the good of everyone if we are able to watch over the way our children are brought up, and over their physical and psychological development.
Working for childrenâs rights means working for human rights, protecting them against violence, institutional violence in particular, and this will prepare them for a world of peace.
Â Â  . I should like to take advantage of the vote to point out the following:
First, my concern about the positions taken at the Council meeting in Rome on 21 October by the United Kingdom, Holland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, who are in favour of reducing regional subsidies.
Secondly, the need for enlargement not to work against the development potential of the regions of the existing 15 Member States of the Union.
Thirdly, the importance of the Aegean islands' acquiring the same privileges as the remote regions of the Union.
Â Â  We welcome more efficient administration of the Structural Funds.
At the same time, we believe it would be risky to administer the resources in a single fund, as recommended in Mr Pittellaâs report, because it could lead to smaller projects disappearing.
Instead, priority should be given to a harmonisation of the rules concerning the use of the funds.
Â Â  . I congratulate MrÂ Pittella on the report he has produced.
This makes a contribution to the complex debate on the Structural Funds.
I would nevertheless like to draw attention to two points on which the rapporteurâs approach differs from mine, and which led me to table two draft amendments for which I request the support of this House.
The amendments are:
- Amendment to paragraphÂ 23 of the motion for a resolution: I would like to reiterate the great importance of mentioning the principle of legitimate expectation, in relation to the eligibility of advances granted by Member States to final beneficiaries and their inclusion in reimbursement claims received before 31Â DecemberÂ 2002.
The principles of solidarity, flexibility and effectiveness complement rather than compete with each other.
- Amendment to paragraphÂ 35(b) of the motion for a resolution: in accordance with the principle of simplification, and on the basis of one of the aims of improving the utilisation of the funds, I propose that provisions be made for an opportunity to analyse whether combining the funds and centralising the way they are managed would help to improve their efficiency.
This will all depend on the course events actually take, which will allow us to decide at a later date whether such an analysis is appropriate.
Â Â  . This report conducts a thorough and worrying examination of various questions linked to the implementation of the Structural Funds.
These funds constitute a system for the redistribution of wealth via the Community budget with a view to reducing the disparities in development among the Member States and increasing economic and social cohesion.
Over the years, they have made visible progress towards those aims.
Nonetheless, it is clear that the delay in implementing the Funds and the corresponding instruments and initiatives is becoming progressively worse.
This is due, in large part, to two factors.
On the one hand, the Funds very often do not effectively become available until the next programming period is already under way, while, on the other, the procedures are long and complicated.
The European Commission, therefore, needs to deal with these matters more thoroughly and consider making more ambitious changes to procedures, combating the late approval and implementation of the programmes and the unreliable nature of the financial forecasts.
In accordance with the aims of the Lisbon strategy of 2000, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds must be enhanced, and, in particular, coordination between the various departments of the Community, national and regional administrations must be improved.
As proposed in the report, it is very important to find a balance between desirable simplification measures and the controls required in order to achieve economic and social cohesion, bearing in mind the current challenge of enlargement as well.
Hence my vote in favour.
Â Â  . I could not agree more with the proposals of both the Committee of Independent Experts and the European Parliament that, in each Member State, a single directorate-general should be entirely responsible for the implementation of the Structural Funds.
This would improve coordination between the various departments of the Community, national and regional administrations involved.
I would also like to point up the need to concentrate more funding on project quality and on the real impact of the Structural Funds in the regions concerned.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
(2)
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0348/2003) by MrÂ Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of CFSP, including the financial implications for the general budget of the European Communities â 2002 (7038/2003 â C5-0423/2003 â 2003/2141(INI)).
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a number of comments by way of an introduction to this annual report on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
It takes as its starting point the dramatic events of the Iraq war and the effect that had on the European Unionâs internal cohesion, on transatlantic relations and also on the state of affairs within the United Nations and NATO, as well as on the international order as a whole.
What now matters, in our view, is that we see the crisis associated with the war in Iraq as an opportunity, and accept the challenge of establishing Europe, once and for all, as a foreign policy actor of substance.
Europe must cease to be an observer in global policy matters and become a participant.
The constitutional convention created the institutional framework within which it can do so by creating the position of European Foreign Minister, by making enhanced cooperation possible in the defence sphere and also by establishing the European armaments agency.
These proposals represent an absolute minimum, and the Intergovernmental Conference must not now be allowed to water them down.
We expected much more when it comes to the Councilâs voting procedures and Parliamentâs right to be informed and consulted, and so, in the light of a proactive policy of crisis prevention, we believe it to be necessary for us, in future, to be informed and involved as early as the early-warning and planning stages of crisis operations under the ESDP.
Both the CFSP and the ESDP need an efficient institutional framework, but that will not be enough; it must have political content added to it.
This is what the European security doctrine put forward by Mr Solana is for, and this report gives four reasons for endorsing his approach.
The first is that Europe must find its way to a clear prioritisation of its foreign and security policy interests and objectives, jointly define them and also designate them geographically, as we have done under item 8.
The second is that a European security strategy must counterpose to the narrowly military focus in current thinking by the American administration a comprehensive approach to security that includes political, economic, social and inter-cultural efforts to mitigate and resolve conflicts.
Thirdly, a European security doctrine can be developed only on the basis of effective multilateralism and within the UN system, this being in line with the historic experiences and political interests of its Member States.
Fourthly, even though the prevention and resolution of conflicts by non-military means will always be at the heart of any security strategy adopted by the European Union, the credibility of the European Foreign and Security Policy is, in the final analysis, dependent on the quality of its military capabilities and on the political willingness to deploy them in the event of any conflict.
What, in the context of a European concept of security, are our foreign policy priorities?
Although transatlantic relations still have pride of place among them, Europe will carry equal weight as a partner for the USA only as and when the Member States summon up the political will to make their own specifically national interests subject to those of the Community.
We will also be able to strengthen such organisations as the UN or NATO only if Europe and the USA speak with one voice.
New life must be breathed into the strategic debate between Europe and the USA; that is another reason why Mr Solanaâs paper is so important.
It will cover such topics as the stabilisation, reconstruction and state building in Iraq, a common strategy on Iran and, generally speaking, possible ways of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the tactics to be adopted when dealing with repressive and dictatorial regimes and dysfunctional states.
One primary task that remains is that of bringing peace to the Middle East as part of the Quartet, where it has to be clear to us that the Quartet, rather than merely being present on paper, should perhaps work together in the region.
There is no doubt that Europe will continue to be committed to the Western Balkans and in Afghanistan, whatever the many problems that are evident in both of them, and even though we cannot but be openly pessimistic about our chances of success when it comes to properly building an acceptable state in the latter.
Much more attention needs to be given to the Southern Caucasus, which is becoming one of the EUâs least stable neighbouring regions, and in this, relations with Russia will have a large part to play.
With enlargement, the Unionâs external borders are being drawn ever closer to the crisis areas to the east and south-east.
It is of the utmost importance that security zones be established around Europe, and that an effective neighbourhood policy be developed; our deliberations should therefore focus much more on such ideas as a âEuropean Economic Area Plusâ and others of the kind, as well as on consideration of the particular ways in which the Mediterranean region can be further stabilised.
Finally, I would like to explain our criticisms of the Councilâs annual report.
Anyone picking up this 200-page volume will observe that it more resembles a shopâs inventory than an annual political review.
Things used not to be as bad as that.
Such a report is no use when it comes to conducting dialogue between Parliament and the Council.
It must become more political, as it once was, with clear evaluations and the setting of objectives.
It is for that reason that we ask that the High Representative should continue, in future, to provide us with a written report on the progress made in putting Europeâs security principles into practice.
Let me finish by saying something about the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
This annual report will be the last in the life of this current Parliament.
It shows the positions of the political groups coinciding to a remarkable degree, in a way that they have not done since this Parliament was elected.
That is another fruit of the constructive collaboration in this committee, for which I wish to express my gratitude to the committeeâs members and its staff.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened to Mr Brok's comments just now with great interest and very much appreciate what he said.
Let me start with this point: MrBrok is quite right in saying that a new situation has recently emerged with regard to the Iraq crisis, which has had such an enormous and unprecedented impact on our common foreign policy that some observers believe it casts doubt on the very survival of the CFSP.
Against this backdrop, I wish to say that I totally disagree with the notion that Iraq has destroyed our Common Foreign and Security Policy.
Quite the opposite, in fact: the ill ease felt by Member States about the divisions created by the Iraq crisis and the commitment that we have made to overcoming the existing deadlock have demonstrated, if anything, the extent to which all of us in Europe are firmly committed to a common foreign policy.
My second point is that the Common Foreign and Security Policy now faces a real systemic challenge in the form of enlargement, or, as we like to put it, the reunification of the European Union.
If we are unable to find institutional solutions, there is a risk that the deadlock situations we have experienced will recur.
My third point concerns the role of the Union on the world stage.
There is no denying that the Union has global interests, which are certainly not limited to economic interests, and that it should be willing to defend the values which inspire and are at the heart of our peoples' lives and rules of life.
My question, however, is this: is the Union able and willing to be considered a global power?
I believe that, even if we have limited resources at our disposal and should, therefore, be selective about where we intervene, it is, nevertheless, in Europe's wider interest to adopt a global approach as regards both our analysis and our foreign policy endeavour.
What conclusions can we draw from our awareness of these three problems, which undeniably exist?
It is important to recognise that the Union's record in the field of foreign policy is a positive one, and theÂ Brok report confirms this.
I shall restrict myself to mentioning the progress made in establishing a European military capacity and our initial experiences with this both in conjunction with NATO â an example of this being the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia â and also acting on our own, as in the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I would also like to mention the Unionâs contribution to stabilising the Balkans and to the process of both economic and democratic reconstruction of the countries in that region.
I would further remind you about the support given to the United Nations at a point when the role of that organisation was being called into question.
We, as Europeans, have reiterated the validity of a multilateral approach to crisis resolution, and, as a more ambitious objective, the implementation of effective multilateralism as a means of preventing, and, if necessary, opposing breaches of international law.
I would also like to mention the significant action taken by the Union and its Member States in response to the global challenges we face today: combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
I have just mentioned a few important areas by way of example, to demonstrate that we have, in a number of cases, succeeded in following words and commitments with deeds.
Of course, and I agree with MrÂ Brok's report on this point, this is not enough to satisfy the demands that the citizens of Europe and the third countries are making of us.
The Council of Ministers is aware of this, and we are working towards solutions in two areas: institutional effectiveness and the clear, precise setting of strategic priorities.
As regards institutional effectiveness â which President Berlusconi has already talked about here in this Chamber today â I can confirm that, in the Intergovernmental Conference, we will be defending the framework presented by the Convention, without any backsliding, as a good basis for the work of the IGC.
With regard to the second area, strategy, as you know, the European Council scheduled for December 2003 will be called upon to adopt a document that will include the Union's security strategy.
It is an ambitious text that will provide a framework for all the interest and commitment invested in our Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The strategy will outline the threats currently facing the European Union, but it also needs to identify those areas on whose stability our security depends.
This strategy will be able to guide us in identifying the resources needed for us to become producers of security, as we like to say, and no longer just consumers of security.
That is why the Italian Presidency is anxious to foster fruitful cooperation between our common foreign policy and the activities of international organisations active in the field of security.
I have in mind, first and foremost, NATO and the OSCE, but what is absolutely vital for us is the role of the United Nations.
On 24Â September, the Italian Presidency and the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, signed a UN-EU joint declaration in New York as a basis for cooperation in both military and civilian areas of crisis management.
I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that everyone should now recognise that there is a need to take pre-emptive action, rather than just repairing the damage resulting from a crisis that has already exploded.
Prevention is therefore becoming a key component in the Union's external relations.
This derives from and is characterised by the coordinated use of both the resources of the Member States, which are made available in the common interest, and the Union's own resources, which are managed by the European Commission.
We accordingly need to take advantage of the full range of resources that the Union can harness in crisis situations.
We have instruments that enable us to exert cultural, economic, political and, now, also military influence.
More than any other international organisation, the Union can and should commit itself to tackling the underlying causes of conflicts by helping to eliminate them through pre-emptive action.
We are adopting a policy based on influence and incentivation in order to try and encourage progress in regional integration and to overcome situations caused by lack of understanding and by instability.
This is the successful model on which we have built the European Union, and it is for this reason that we are convinced it is a model worth recommending to our external partners.
In particular, I would like to mention the Western Balkans, a sensitive region that deserves special attention.
We are endeavouring to step up our cooperation activities in respect of that region, and also in respect of the southern shore of the Mediterranean, and, let me remind you, in respect of the Latin American subcontinent.
On the same subject, I would like to point out that the benefit of establishing treaty relations with the European Union is, in fact, one of the main incentives for regional groupings.
Our security policy therefore dovetails with our policy on development aid in terms of goals, but we should certainly not imagine that it can be a substitute for development aid policy or be allowed to drain resources away from it.
As we know, MrÂ Brok's report stresses that the Union's interest should focus on its neighbouring regions.
Although I have mentioned the Balkans and the Mediterranean region, I wish to emphasise that the difficulties still prevailing in the Middle East have not weakened our resolve: the Union can and must make an important contribution to identifying a peaceful solution and to international guarantees for peace.
The Presidency, the High Representative and the Commission are constantly striving to achieve this outcome, and they were encouraged by the final conclusions of last week's European Council.
The Council also confirmed the Union's stance on two other international issues currently of vital importance: Iraq, where the Union is committed to contributing to the reconstruction effort, and Iran, which we have very actively encouraged to take the decisive step of complying with all the International Atomic Energy Agency's requirements.
Just yesterday, the Republic of Iran took the very positive step of accepting these commitments, with the full support of the presidency.
This is obviously something that we have encouraged and welcome.
Another area of interest for the enlarged Europe is its eastern borders.
I have in mind our good-neighbour policy towards Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and slightly further east, the Russian Federation, which I shall return to this afternoon when we discuss the forthcoming Rome Summit on 6 November.
I would like to conclude my comments by referring to a strategic relationship that is still of fundamental importance for us in Europe: the transatlantic relationship.
It is evident that all the Member States continue to attach great importance to relations with the United States.
I, personally, also believe that we can overcome the recent breakdowns in understanding.
The renewal of this relationship has been confirmed by the recent, hard-won decisions taken within the United Nations.
I am convinced this is the case, because Euro-Atlantic relations are nourished by a common history, by an enormous indebtedness in terms of liberation and liberty â particularly for us Italians â and also by shared values and ideals and by common action reflected in the CFSP.
Our common commitment in the Balkans, combating terrorism and combating proliferation: these are examples and evidence of common action.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Brok has drawn up proposals for future work.
I would like to thank him once again, and I agree with his suggestions and proposals.
The building of Europe is unprecedented in history, both as regards its political ambition and its institutional mechanisms.
I would like to conclude my speech by saying that there are essentially four areas in which we can work, which, for the sake of brevity I shall simply identify.
The first area is to develop the political will to achieve integration, the hallmark of which will increasingly be foreign policy and the common European defence policy.
In this area, the parliamentarians of the Member States will have an essential role to play, and I therefore hope that this Chamber will continue to provide encouragement and drive.
The second area is a strategy for the Union's external activities, to be based on the document we shall be presenting by December.
The third area relates to appropriate and effective decision-making mechanisms.
We will be going into that in depth at the Intergovernmental Conference.
The fourth and final area is that of resources.
Although I have left it until last, it is crucial.
We must provide ourselves with the necessary resources to achieve the foreign policy we need.
The alternative, which I do not like, would be to scale down our ambitions.
We have limited budgetary provisions for financing the CFSP, and although we had a small increase in 2003, we certainly need to do a great deal more.
The Italian Presidency understands and supports the European Parliament's request that it should be given punctual and timely, if not absolutely pre-emptive, information about activities that the European Council is preparing to embark upon.
I remain committed to supporting you on this.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report which he knows I have much enjoyed reading.
I do not want in the five minutes that I have to repeat all the points that have been made with such eloquence and comprehensiveness by the Italian Presidency but I agree with all that the Minister said.
Perhaps I can just focus on four points very briefly and try to stick to my five minutes.
First of all I want to say something about the institutional arrangements.
We all know that the present institutional arrangements supporting and providing the infrastructure for CFSP are, to use a common term of art in the European Union, 'sub-optimal'.
And we all know that changes in institutional arrangements, the sort of changes proposed in the Convention and being discussed in the IGC, can help to create political will to make things happen more effectively.
But changes in institutions can never be a substitute for political will.
We did not have disagreements over Iraq because we lacked the adequate institutional arrangements.
We had disagreements over Iraq because of a lack of sufficient political will.
It is also fair to say that however much we improve the institutional arrangements â and this was a point touched on by the presidency â we cannot pay the bills with institutional arrangements.
If we want to have a more effective international impact, if we want to be seen by the United States as people who are pulling our weight in the security field, we have to face up to the fact that we need to do more and we need to spend more.
All the opinion polls show â and this is an interesting reflection of the current debate in Europe â that most of our voters in Europe want there to be a louder European voice politically on the international stage.
But unfortunately there is hardly any country where voters are prepared to spend more money on our security in order to help sustain that larger European role.
Therefore we have to tackle the present gap between the discussion on institutional arrangements and the discussion both on political will and on resources.
Second, I should like to mention security and the definition of security.
We all know that security needs to be defined in much broader terms than has been conventional in foreign policy debate.
One of the great bonuses of the draft security strategy which the High Representative has brought forward is that it demonstrates that security is about more than precision-guided munitions and airlift capacity.
It is about issues from public health and disease to terrorism, to organised crime, all the issues where we in the European Union actually have the competence to develop a more coherent, comprehensive external relations policy than is possible in a lot of Member States and in a lot of nation-states.
It is very important in my view, therefore, that when we come to construct a joint external service, we make sure that we combine the strengths of both Pillar I and Pillar II in the management and implementation of CFSP.
It would be a great mistake if, on the one hand, we cut off the Foreign Minister from the Commission, or on the other hand, if we did the sort of things which would make people suspicious of the Commission being too involved in CFSP issues.
So, we have to make sure that, as we design the joint external service, we use the strength of both the Council and the Commission to have the widest possible impact on external problems.
The third point I want to make is about the importance of the transatlantic partnership.
We know that in the run-up to the military intervention in Iraq, Europe was bitterly divided.
I have said before that I am not wholly surprised about that since the issues that we were facing in Iraq were extremely difficult and extremely serious.
We also know that despite those divisions, by and large, most of the things we want to achieve as Europeans are more achievable if we work with the United States and it has to be said, most of the things the United States wants to achieve are more manageable if it works with the European Union.
I hope we will see that now in Iraq with reconstruction.
I will be going from this Chamber to Madrid for the Iraq Reconstruction Conference, as will the presidency.
We will there, I think, see the presidency able to announce a commitment from the European Union for the first year of reconstruction in Iraq which will be larger than the pledge that we were able to make for Afghanistan at Tokyo.
I think we will be committing over the next months more in Iraq than we did on that occasion.
We will be committing EUR 200 million from the European budget on top of the EUR 100 million that we have already pledged for humanitarian assistance.
I think the figure that we are proposing from the budget is a responsible figure: I think it is a serious figure.
It has not obliged us to use up all our flexibility next year or to take money from other important programmes.
I think it is far more important for us to be going to Madrid supporting the efforts of reconstruction with a serious contribution rather than a contribution which is merely a political reaction.
The fourth thing I want to say is that we often talk about effective multilateralism and sometimes we are asked to define it.
I think what we have seen happen in the last 24 hours in Iran is a good example of effective multilateralism.
We have embarked on a policy in Iran of tough-minded but constructive engagement.
Engagement does not mean abandoning principle.
We have strong views about the human rights situation in Iraq.
We have strong views about terrorism.
We have strong views about nuclear weapons.
But we have been prepared to hold out a hand of friendship to Iran, recognising that it is a great pre-Islamic civilisation.
We also recognise â this is certainly my view â that demography in Iran is on the side of democracy, giving Iran the opportunity to be drawn into the international community and not isolated from it.
So yesterday's visit seems to me to be an excellent example of how much we can achieve in Europe when we work together and I think it is particularly important to recognise that France, Germany and Britain as well as the other Member States have to give a lead in working together.
I hope that we will see this sort of combined effort more often, using both the resources that can be provided by Member States and the resources that we have agreed to share in common and the competencies that we have agreed to share.
I hope that we will see that sort of effective cooperation.
I hope that we will not see too much institutional warfare.
I certainly think that the issues that we have to deal with on the international stage are far too serious for that, as is made clear in this excellent report.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to follow on from Commissioner Pattenâs opening remarks in which he thought aloud about such things as Interinstitutional Agreements and political will and underlined their importance.
Whilst we should, in this House, debate matters in greater depth, I do also think that Interinstitutional Agreements can help to unite political will and enable it to achieve a result.
This is why the opinion of the Committee on Budgets reflected its particular interest in the question that the President-in-Office of the Council raised at the end of his speech, that of how we handle the European Unionâs budget, and of how things stand as regards Parliamentâs right to be informed â not as a purely technical question, but because we need these debates on political priorities.
We can have such debates only if we get at a very early stage all the information in the Councilâs possession, which is to be discussed in the Councilâs working parties and from which a result is to emerge in the course of many stages, rather than having to wait until the Council has taken its decision and all that remains to be done is to rubber-stamp it.
I am grateful to you for your undertaking to make these items of information available to Parliament.
We deal with different partners depending on the matter in hand, and this is an issue on which Parliament and the Commission very often work together.
In matters of external relations, Parliament, as an institution, always tends to support the Commission in its work, and also tends to be willing to provide more money.
In the Budget procedure as elsewhere, the Council sometimes slows things down, and so I believe that this is where a new triangular relationship can be achieved.
You then referred to the subject of the United Nations, and the Commission used to take a very technical approach to this and supported its projects, but there were no policy debates.
Indeed, the Commission even managed to produce a document on the European Unionâs relationship with the United Nations that made no reference whatever to Parliament as the budgetary authority.
I think that we have now reached a new stage of dialogue with Commissioner Patten.
In our relations with the United Nations, too, we need to set political priorities, and these need to be discussed by the Council and Parliament in their respective budget procedures.
That is why this annual report, along with the High Representativeâs statements, represents a good step forward.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I think that MrÂ Brok's report is not so much a report as a manifesto â a manifesto for the shape the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy ought to take, and a manifesto that also touches upon the other major issues faced by the Union, such as delineating its final borders.
This is a very topical subject, now that, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said, with the return of 10 countries into the European fold the Union is being enlarged in a way that was inconceivable and unhoped for just a few years ago.
Of the many countries that are hoping to join the Union, I would like to highlight here the importance of Ukraine, a country balanced between two worlds, the European world and the Slav world, which it would be in our interest to admit to the European Union.
I am not just saying that because I have visited that country as a member of a European Parliament delegation.
The Brok report â as my colleague has just said â provides an excellent assessment of the Council's annual report, which contains nothing more than a simple balance sheet devoid of any in-depth political analysis and scarcely identifies any priorities.
If, however, in the short time available to me, I may add something, no matter how slight, to the Brok report, then I would like to support the proposal made by MrÂ Wuori in an amendment that East Africa should be added to the priority areas listed in the report.
We cannot overlook the important and incisive part played by mediation in the Ethiopian-Eritrean, Somali and Sudanese conflicts, a part which involved enormous sacrifices and difficulties on the part of Italy, whose authority was duly recognised.
Italy has encouraged the increasing involvement of the European Union in managing such crises, and I believe that it is both right and necessary to include East Africa in the priority areas for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including, specifically, in paragraphÂ 8 of the Brok report.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to start by extending my groupâs congratulations to MrÂ Brok on his report, which is, as always, very balanced and â like his chairmanship of the committee â very circumspect, while carrying a clear message.
That is certainly an art, but Mr Brok proves his mastery of it over and over again.
Today, however, I would like to start in a slightly different way, as I would like to stress that our primary purpose is to promote Europeâs interests, and that this is not in any way something to be concealed.
The only issue is to what extent our interests coincide with those of others, and how often they are in parallel.
Particularly in security maters, but also in many other areas, we can see that Europeâs interests parallel those of other regions.
If we use the security concept that Commissioner Patten has again put before us today â which would be only right and proper â we will see how we are well able to take other regionsâ aspirations into account when properly defending our interests.
One of the things that were discussed and highlighted as long ago as the debate on the presidency was the refugee issue.
I hope that what was said will be backed up by actions, by which I mean that we will take action in those countries where people feel â or actually are â forced to flee, and help to prevent refugees flooding into Europe to the extent that they do.
That is in our interests but also in the interests of these people, in that we are giving them the chance of a prosperous life in their own country, from which they will not need to escape.
To be sure, we need partners in this policy.
The Americans are, of course, our privileged partners, but we still need to strengthen and develop our relations with other regions such as Russia, China, and India, if we are to cultivate this partnership in an appropriate way.
This is pre-eminently the case as regards one issue on which our debates will focus during the coming months, and on which Mr Laschet is completing a report, namely reform of the United Nations.
Anyone who â like our group as a whole â wants the United Nations to come into its own, anyone who fully supports the multilateral approach, must also press for the United Nations to be reformed in such a way as to make it more effective whilst remaining representative.
All those in this group who opposed the USAâs intervention in Iraq must nevertheless acknowledge that it was also â and I emphasise also â due to the failure by the whole structure of the modern-day United Nations that things got to such a pass, and that we did not make a multilateral attempt at regime change in Iraq at an earlier stage, which would have been the right time to do it.
Whatever criticisms might be levelled at our own foreign and security policy, we do, as I said earlier, have grounds for pride.
Reference has been made to Iran.
Although, institutionally speaking, things could have been better, that was a fine achievement, but it is success that counts, so let us stand by this one.
I would particularly like to extend warm thanks to the Commissioner for the policy in the Balkans.
When we consider what we have achieved in the Balkans in recent years, and how we have managed to bring peace, that is a very positive sign.
It also means, however, that Europe has to take up its own responsibilities.
If we are prepared to take up our own responsibilities in our own back yard, then we can achieve success.
Â Â  MrÂ President, todayâs good news is that the UN General Assembly has, by a very large majority, adopted a resolution demanding that Israel stop erecting the so-called security wall.
The resolution even demands that those parts of the wall that have already been built should be torn down.
Todayâs bad news is that, in spite of the UN decision, Israel is continuing to build the wall.
In the report we are debating, the European Parliament regards the bringing of peace to the Middle East as the most important task to be shared with the United States, together with Russia and the UN.
We reiterate, moreover, our unqualified support, with which the UN decision is splendidly in keeping, for the implementation of the road map.
Today, we are also able, together with Commissioner Patten, to be delighted that the hierocracy in Iran is to allow comprehensive inspections and to refrain from producing uranium for use in nuclear weapons.
The final Iranian acceptance of nuclear inspections followed a visit by the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Great Britain â an international agreement for which the EU can take credit.
We are today debating a sound report, and that is something for which I should also like to thank Mr Brok.
It is a very concise report, but not a short one, and I only have a short time in which to mention some of the points I think important.
The US-NATO relationship is quite fundamental to the European security structure, and we must support the development of reinforced cooperation in the defence area.
Asia, and China in particular, has not been given as much attention in the report as might perhaps have been wished.
The increased tensions in relations between China and North Korea is cause for concern, but what is more worrying is, of course, the fact that North Korea will not phase out its nuclear weapons programme.
We regard this as a considerable threat to stability in Asia.
The Taiwan issue must also be mentioned in this context.
In a democratic institution such as this, we must regret the lack of progress on this matter.
Taiwan is both democratic and peaceful, but the Taiwanese cannot live in the same manner as people in other free, democratic countries, given the way its neighbour is behaving.
I should like to call for a new dialogue between China and Taiwan and for the EU to do more in pressing for a solution to the conflict.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, there is no doubt that Mr Brok, in his report, has very carefully summarised the opinion of the majority in this House as regards the problem of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
I just have to say something that will surprise nobody, that being that my group is not numbered among that majority.
I would like to clarify, though, that I do think it necessary for the European Union to really pursue a common foreign policy â in parts, indeed, a foreign policy along Community lines.
Without one, as the example adduced by Mr Andreasen shows, we will find it difficult or impossible to get the world to give us a hearing.
I would like to stress that one good thing about this report, in my view, is that it defines as a real alternative a new approach to security and puts the emphasis on multilateralism.
Its actual tendency, though, does not have the rigour that it needs to distinguish itself from something that I regard as giving cause for concern.
I would like to highlight two examples.
Firstly, I regret the committeeâs inability to tackle the problem of the maintenance, defence and further development of the weapons monitoring and disarmament system.
How are we to put a stop to the continuing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction if our own draft constitution obliges us to build up our own military capacities or potential, the like of which is to be found in no constitution in the world and never has been?
We are, in effect, committing ourselves to rearmament instead of setting ourselves targets for disarmament.
The American attitude towards the control of biological and chemical weapons, the Test Ban Treaty and their threat to withdraw from the Outer Space Treaty make this a very live issue.
The second problem is that the report explicitly highlights the need to build up military capabilities, despite the European concentration on civil approaches to conflict prevention.
In Europe, we can currently see positive examples of how conflicts have not escalated into warfare, one example being the Caucasus.
Why not analyse these experiences and apply them generally?
That we are at last making a start on a serious debate about the European Unionâs security strategy is something that I very much welcome, but it is lamentable that this debate is still, on the whole, an internal affair in which the general public are not involved.
I call upon the Council and the Commission to involve Parliament in the debate more than it has been so far, rather than confronting us with ready-made concepts.
Â Â  Mr President, according to my group, a crucial element in the Brok report is the realisation that the European Union is, and should be, an important player on the world stage.
However, if that is what the European Union does, it should do so in a way that is different from the United States.
The European Union should not try to be a military superpower, but, I would say, a civil superpower.
These points are hammered home in the report, and rightly.
Our strengths should lie in diplomacy, trade and conflict prevention.
These are, and remain, the core elements of common foreign policy.
And let there be no misunderstanding about this: a military capacity forms part of this.
The European Union should be capable of doing more than it is doing at the moment, but it should be capable of doing something other than the United States.
This means, for example, that the first priority should be, as is stated in the report, to build our own rapid intervention force and not to focus on a NATO Rapid Response Force.
This also means â and on that score I do not see eye to eye with the Commissioner â that more effective spending of what we are paying out on defence at the moment should be Priority Number One.
I cannot explain to my electors that we need to spend more on defence if they know that current spending is so very inefficient.
Anyone following the discussion in the media could be forgiven for thinking that the essence of the discussion between the EU and NATO was about headquarters.
Let us be quite clear about this: it is not about headquarters.
The United States is frightened that the European Union will develop its own, alternative view, and will come up with an alternative analysis of what security is â an analysis and a strategy that will deviate from those of the United States.
I urge you not to be deterred by this resistance from the other side of the ocean.
The United States does not benefit from having an obedient follower.
It does, however, benefit from having a confident partner with its own vision.
This means that parliamentary democratic control should form part of this vision.
We can talk as much as we like about any vision whatsoever, but, if there is no Parliamentary monitoring in place, and if finances are the only concern from start to finish, then this vision will not become reality.
Â Â  Mr President, in my country, you sometimes hear the useful warning never to throw out your old shoes until you have replaced them with new ones.
This common admonition seems to be very relevant in the case of Europe's security.
I urge you not to trade NATO for such uncertain military aspirations cherished by a number of EU Member States.
Meanwhile, this defence ambition on this side of the ocean causes renewed internal European division, as well as fresh transatlantic tension.
I fully share America's great concern about NATO's cohesion and future, given the autonomous military course taken by President Chirac and Chancellor SchrÃ¶der.
The ambivalent ideas about security in Paris and Berlin are entirely reflected in the Brok report: the EU as a complementary security organisation of NATO no less!
The Brok report is honest enough to recognise that the EU's current military capacities are inadequate for peace operations.
In short, I would prefer NATO to look after our security in Europe, and â within the NATO context â to let the EU Member States finally show what they are worth as loyal allies.
Â Â  Mr President, following the collapse of Communist dictatorships in the former Eastern bloc, the world has not exactly become a safer place.
As Samuel Huntington has pointed out, we progressed, after the Cold War, from a bipolar to a multipolar world, and more than ever before, what matters is to identify friend and foe and, hence, also the threats that face us.
As has rightly been pointed out, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and badly governed states are Europe's three most important threats.
I should also like to add the demographic pressure of an uncontrollable and encroaching Islam to this list.
Europe must therefore provide an efficient and well-developed security and defence system.
This will require political will, as well as investments.
In that respect, we have to conclude with some sense of shame that the average outgoings for each soldier in Belgium are three times lower than in the other European Member States.
The Belgian Government has already announced that it will not be increasing the defence budget during this term in office, which has, in fact, only just started.
It is therefore a sign of some hypocrisy on the part of the Belgian Government if it wants to take the lead in the development of a defence system at European level on the one hand, while refusing to accept the consequences and obligations that this entails.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Brok very warmly for his astute and very balanced report.
I am glad of one thing that he makes clear in it, namely that it is not enough for us to produce a European security strategy as a constructive response to that of the United States; on the contrary, we must also show how it is to be achieved.
That is why we need a two-stage plan of the kind proposed in the Brok report, with, as its first step, the formation of a European crisis intervention force for evacuation operations and humanitarian tasks.
What worries us at present is our relationship with the United States and especially their reaction to these proposals and to those made by the Convention, which has put forward the idea of a mutual defence commitment for the countries of Europe.
This causes concern to the United States, which take a critical attitude towards it, as they do â vehemently â towards the proposal for enhanced cooperation between a number of European countries.
Then the proposal was made for a European armaments agency to combine our capacities, and our friends and allies on the other side of the Atlantic objected to that.
There is one thing that we have to make clear here: on the one hand, our friends demand that we should develop our capacities and abilities to play a greater global security role and to make our contribution in this area.
If we want to do that, we have to combine our capacities, and that, after all, is what these proposals are all about.
We must, then, be clear in our own minds, and make it clear to the Americans, that if we combine our capacities in Europe, that is not being done only for Europeâs benefit, but also for that of the United States.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to thank MrÂ Brok for his balanced approach, which has now become legendary.
His report bears witness to how much the world situation has changed since last year.
At that time, terrorist attacks were uppermost in our minds, whereas now the focus is on the invasion of Iraq.
The rapporteur reminds us of the chasms that have been thrown up between the Member States of the European Union, which have severely strained transatlantic relations and which have affected different NATO members to varying degrees.
MrÂ Brok believes that it is, however, now necessary to redefine Europe's role and, perhaps, to take advantage of the political crisis sparked by the war to make the Union a credible and powerful political actor on the foreign policy stage.
Of course, the means of achieving this objective are still relatively ill-defined: some new Member States and their neighbours have, yet again, discovered America and its promises of political and economic guarantees.
For this reason, it is advisable not to forget Member States' duty to refrain from intervening in international affairs on the basis of unilateral national positions until the European Union has had an opportunity to define a common European position.
I do not, of course, have time to go into all this in greater depth, but the future of our foreign policy is linked to the European Constitution; the veto can wreck the most ambitious peace plans, as we have heard this morning.
The European Union's common foreign and security policy objectives depend, not least, on its ability to equip itself with military resources, with the result that we can only envisage relatively low-cost operations.
Perhaps we shall have to content ourselves with that, even though, ultimately, I do not believe we can.
The Franco-German Brigade alone, a core Rapid Reaction Force, might well have been enough to stop the Balkan crisis in 1991, as MrÂ Frattini has also said today.
We must insist: in addition to the small steps forward achieved âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, the Brok report is well timed in view of fact that the debate on European defence has gained momentum over the past few months.
What used to fall within the exclusive remit of NATO or was a matter of national sovereignty is increasingly appertaining to the European Union.
At the end of 2000 in Nice, reinforced cooperation in the area of defence was still kept at bay, but today, there is ever growing consensus in this area.
EU operations in Bosnia, Macedonia and eastern Africa have shown that Europe has a geopolitical responsibility.
As the Brok report also clearly indicates, our own European headquarters are a for independent and efficient European defence.
It appears to me to be of major importance for more Member States, current and future ones, to join the European defence project of Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and France.
Only in that way can a European force of this kind put an end to the useless duplication of defence efforts among Member States.
Only then can we shatter the image of Europe as an economic giant, but a political dwarf and a worm in military terms.
Â Â  I am convinced that this is the EUâs big chance to play a positive role in promoting world peace and to give up trying to be a poor manâs United States, with its militarism and philosophy of violence.
Instead, the EU should develop an alternative non-violent peace policy.
Unfortunately, the Brok report is permeated by traditional over-confidence in military interventions as the only way of bringing about peace.
