We are assessing this question as part of our ongoing public consultation on retail financial services.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply; however, I should like to insist on my question following this morning's debate and the huge Equitable Life scandal, with millions of victims calling for fair compensation on the grounds of the poor administration of the insurance company.
Perhaps this example alone is enough to convince the Commission to liberalise the car insurance market and the way in which citizens themselves choose what is in their best interest, in which case they would be wholly and personally responsible for their choices.
Buying residential property represents a difficult and time-consuming challenge for consumers.
Legal and fiscal matters are big challenges, even in one's own Member State.
These challenges are only exacerbated when consumers are purchasing a residential property outside their Member State: procedures often are completely different from the ones in place 'at home'.
While the Commission is fully aware of these facts, there is no simple answer.
Taxation and property laws that lie at the origin of the complexity fall largely outside the scope of Community competence.
Nevertheless, the Commission supports initiatives that promote transparency in European housing and mortgage-lending markets.
Transparency is particularly important for consumers, especially where rules vary from one country to the next.
Consumers need full and accurate information to be able to make an informed choice when buying a property in another Member State.
The request for an information leaflet for consumers purchasing property has also been made within our ongoing review of the European mortgage credit markets, where stakeholders suggested that the Commission create and maintain an online guide to the main legal and other issues relating to cross-border lending.
I am in favour of such initiatives.
Buying property across borders is a natural consequence of the freedoms that constitute the essence of the Single Market.
Where consumers face practical problems or lack of information, we must try to help them, for example by pointing out what problems they may encounter and by pointing them in the direction of the relevant bodies and authorities that can assist them.
The Commission will look into these issues and see what is feasible.
But let me be honest: this is not an easy task.
The Commission does not necessarily have access to all the information that would be required, nor would we necessarily have the means to verify that such information is accurate or up to date.
Before moving ahead, we must be certain that we can overcome this challenge.
Working together with third parties may also be an option.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response.
I suppose in this area, as in all other areas, the clause caveat emptor should always apply first and foremost.
However, there are complexities, as you rightly said, and I welcome the fact that you have looked at what the European mortgage providers are considering.
However, there is another aspect - the need to have a second will.
If you own a property outside your country of residence, it is necessary to have a second will to cover the execution of your estate in that scenario.
So, even though there are differences across the 27 Member States, and further complexities within them, there are certain core values which could be put up on the Commission website, as you rightly say.
I would encourage you to work further towards that goal, highlighting at the same time that caveat emptor should always apply first and foremost.
I certainly agree with the honourable Member.
As I said, it could be quite a difficult task to undertake this body of work.
As Mr Crowley mentioned, the underlying principle must always be caveat emptor.
In all these areas, whether you are buying property or financial products, it is something that everybody must be aware of.
As I said earlier today, when someone comes along offering you a deal that seems too good to be true, it usually is too good to be true.
That is something we must bear in mind.
Mr Crowley mentioned the question of having a second will.
Only last weekend I read an article in a professional magazine that was advising people who have properties in Spain, for example, that it was essential to make a will there covering that particular property and how to go about it.
By the way, I do not have a property in Spain as of now, but many Irish people I know do, and are not aware of this requirement.
This article was in a magazine that would only be read by people working in accountancy.
What Mr Crowley says is very important.
Only a very small percentage of Irish people who have homes in that very nice country of Spain would be aware of this information.
One of the 48 recommendations set out by the expert group was for there to be an information leaflet.
It will be a bit of a task to determine what we can cover adequately within the leaflet, but we will certainly have an attempt at it.
The danger is that, since we will not be able to cover everything, we may face the moral hazard of not supplying all the information, but let us see what we can achieve.
If we are trying to have a single market for all areas, the logical thing then is to provide the information that goes across these particular fronts.
It would also help improve the image of the European Union if ordinary people were to say that was something very worthwhile had come from the European Union.
We will make an attempt at it.
How successful we will be, I do not know.
(LT) Mr President, Commissioner, I agree that this question is complicated.
I myself have written a book on how to establish a business in the 15 old European Union countries, including the purchase of real estate, taxes and other considerations.
You mentioned that there are compendiums of information.
Could you specify which compendiums of information there are?
If they are not complete, they need to be updated so that people circulating freely within the European Union could have all the information they need about these conditions, including the purchase of real estate.
For fear there has been a mistake they do not exist yet.
Mr Crowley's question was whether we could consider preparing an information leaflet and this action was also recommended by the Expert Group on Mortgage Credit.
We are examining this and will attempt to see what we can do in terms of having a proper information leaflet, subject to the various caveats I myself entered about how this would be produced.
I congratulate the Member for her initiative in tackling this in an obviously professional capacity I imagine it was a considerable amount of work.
However, as I said in my former reply, we might endeavour to marry the expertise that is available out there among private organisations who might agree to having some type of joint approach, using what is already there rather then starting afresh ourselves.
So perhaps the honourable Member would be willing to give some of the information she has to my departments and we might exploit her obvious talents in this matter.
The external dimension of EU migration policy and Commission action in this area has developed a lot over the last few years due to the needs regarding migration, in particular for the definition but also the implementation of a global approach to migration.
We think this is important for the future and we are trying to do what we can to come to a global approach.
In the context of this global approach, we are developing various initiatives relating to all aspects of migration.
That means including legal migration, but particularly the fight against illegal migration, readmission and readmission agreements, return, reintegration, asylum, migration and development, and migration and integration.
From the outset, I have personally committed myself to the 3% target in the Neighbourhood Policy Instrument.
I am already beginning to give definite form to the commitment as regards the countries under my responsibility.
Together with Mr Frattini and Mr Michel, I have just presented to the Commission for adoption the 2007-2010 thematic strategy for the thematic programme on cooperation with third countries in the areas of migration and asylum.
The programme provides for an indicative amount of more than EUR 380 million over the period 2007-2013 for cooperation with third countries in the areas of migration and asylum, including on labour migration and reintegration of returnees.
The Commission delegations play a key role in the implementation of this ambitious agenda, both at political but also at operational level, and Brussels-based Commission departments systematically inform the Commission delegations of, and involve them in, new developments related to migration.
Political dialogue with third countries is conducted jointly by the delegations and Brussels-based departments.
At operational level, delegations are also responsible, for instance, for identifying needs and constraints, to ensure that actions financed with Community external assistance are properly implemented.
In addition, delegations in countries where migration has emerged as an important new topic in the context of Community external assistance are also assisted by the departments in Brussels through training measures, thematic networks at operational level and support missions.
Through these measures, we in the Commission ensure that the delegations are able to interact with the Member States but also with third countries, and to implement migration-related Community assistance.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, over recent months I have listened to the statements by you and by Commissioners Michel and Frattini, and I have found the commitments that you have made very encouraging.
My concern is that we in the European Union often express excessive amounts of will, we make statements but then they are not followed up by actions because we lack resources.
For example, the Frontex system has faced immense difficulties controlling illegal immigration.
The commitments made by the three Commissioners would require the establishment of a European Union external service of a new kind, not economic or political, but rather of a social and work nature, something similar to the work and social organisations that all of the Member States currently have.
Does the Commissioner believe that that kind of external service can be established?
Do you have sufficient resources?
What can Parliament do to help the Commissioner to establish this new role?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, Mr Papadimoulis, the Commission is completing its analysis of Greece's revised GDP and GNP figures.
It has used the same procedure for that analysis as for all of the other Member States.
The procedure and timetable employed are as follows:
On 22 September last year, Greece presented the Commission with the revised figures on its gross domestic product and its gross national product.
These figures represented a revision upwards of approximately 26%.
At the end of October last year, therefore, a month after having received that information, Eurostat communicated those figures for an initial analysis by the Member States' GNI-Committee.
The committee then issued a statement to the effect that it did not have sufficient information on the revised data and the changes in methodology communicated by Greece.
The committee also pointed to the urgent need for Greece to cooperate fully with Eurostat and to provide a completely revised inventory of its GDP and its GNP, explaining in detail the new sources and methods used by Greece for its national accounts, in order to enable Eurostat to carry out a complete verification of the new data and inform the committee of the results of that verification.
Greece presented the inventory to Eurostat on 6 February of this year, in the form of a 460-page document in Greek.
Following the relevant translation, Eurostat is completing the analysis of that documentation and it will send a mission to Greece by the end of this month.
Like those carried out in other countries, experts from other Member States take part in that mission, in order to ensure the necessary degree of transparency.
The results of the mission will be analysed with Greece firstly and then any comments made within that context will be taken into account in the final wording of the report assessing the revised figures for Greek GDP and GNP.
Eurostat will present this report to the committee for an in-depth debate.
It is hoped that it will be presented no later than October 2007.
With regard to the second part of your question: according to our spring forecasts, carried out on the basis of the non-revised Greek GDP figures, the public deficit for this year is expected to fall to 2.4%, compared to last year's 2.6 %.
For 2008, on the assumption that current policies are not changed, the Commission foresees a slight increase in public deficit, from 2.4% to 2.7%.
All of this is on the basis of the GDP figures prior to the revision.
With regard to the level of indebtedness, it is calculated that it will continue to fall, from the 104.5% of GDP in 2006 to around 100.7% in 2007 and 97.5% in 2008.
In view of these figures, on 16 May of this year the Commission recommended to the Council that the excessive deficit procedure, which had been opened up two years earlier, be ended, and on 5 June of this year the Ecofin Council adopted the decision to close the procedure, in accordance with the Commission's proposal.
Furthermore, on 27 February of this year, on the recommendation of the Commission, the Ecofin Council approved its opinion on Greece's updated stability programme for 2006-2009 and in that opinion Ecofin recommends that Greece take advantage of the favourable economic situation to progress towards the mid-term objective - which is budgetary balance - in order to continue improving the budgetary process, increasing its transparency and defining a budgetary strategy within a longer-term perspective which effectively applies mechanisms intended for the supervision and control of primary spending.
Furthermore, and in view of the high indebtedness and the expected increase as a result of ageing, it is recommended that the Greek authorities as soon as possible draw up future forecasts for spending linked to ageing and improve the long-term sustainability of the public accounts, providing the resources necessary to achieve the mid-term objective.
On 20 April, following the meeting of the Eurogroup in Berlin, the Greek Minister for the Economy and Finance formally and publicly announced that the government had decided to bring forward from 2012 to 2010 the time limit for achieving that medium-term budgetary objective.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your detailed reply.
In a statement after 5 June, you expressed the Commission's concern about the large deficit in the balance of payments of the Greek economy and recommended strict measures in order to achieve a sustainable and constant reduction in the deficit and the debt.
My question therefore is: have you discussed the measures proposed by the Commission with the Greek Government?
Do you have replies and commitments from the Greek Government for the measures that you consider necessary?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the provisions of the euro zone's single monetary policy, Sweden is currently one of the Member States that are subject to an exception.
At the moment there are 13 Member States subject to that exception and, furthermore, we have the case of the United Kingdom, which has the famous 'opt-out' clause and which is not therefore included amongst the States with exceptions.
With the exception of Denmark, all of the other Member States with exceptions, that is to say, 12 Member States must adopt the euro as their currency, to which end they must seek to meet the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty.
Nevertheless, the Treaty does not set explicit time limits for the Member States to comply with that obligation.
Our last convergence report, which covers the States with exceptions, was published in December 2006, and in it the Commission concluded that Sweden met the price stability criterion, the criterion relating to the public budget situation and the criterion on the convergence of long-term interest rates.
Nevertheless, according to that same convergence report, Sweden did not meet the exchange rate criterion, which requires the Member State in question to have remained within the normal margins of fluctuation laid down in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) without any serious tensions for at least two years prior to the assessment.
Furthermore, in last December's convergence report, the Commission pointed out that the Swedish legislation was not fully compatible with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty with regard to the regulation of the Central Bank and its integration into the European system of central banks.
In view of this assessment, the Commission concluded that there was no need to modify Sweden's status as a Member State with an exception in this area.
In accordance with the Treaty, the Commission and the European Central Bank will publish the next convergence report in 2008, in principle in May 2008.
With regard to the final part of your question, which relates, by way of comparison, to the security of energy supply, the provisions of the Treaties in force have already led the European Parliament and the Council to adopt directives relating, on the one hand, to the security of natural gas supply, and, on the other, to safeguarding the security of electricity supply in investment in infrastructures.
These directives must be transposed into national legislation, and in the case of the latter directive, it must be transposed by 1 December of this year.
We are not therefore in two completely identical situations from a legal point of view.
With regard to the obligation to join the euro, the Treaty does not stipulate any maximum time limit, nor the rules for implementation, but leaves it to the convergence assessment that is carried out every two years.
In the case that you give as an example, however, that of energy security, there are directives that must be applied by the Member States, and in the event of non-compliance the relevant infringement procedures are applied.
(LT) Commissioner, I am not happy with your answer because in Sweden's accession agreement it is clearly stated that Sweden must implement all agreements in force at that time.
In other words, on the principle of closer cooperation, no exceptions are possible.
Now the Swedes have decided, four years after a referendum on the subject, to again vote against the introduction of the euro.
Does this mean that countries may choose which parts of the accession agreement to honour and which parts not to honour?
I have in mind the Lithuanian nuclear electricity generation plant at Ignalina, which is safe and which the Lithuanians do not want to close.
Should we perhaps just refrain from closing the plant without bothering to consult anyone?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, Sweden must apply the Treaties, of course.
The fact that a referendum has been held does not excuse Sweden from its obligation to apply the Treaties.
The Commission also has to apply the Treaty, and what it has done, and what it is going to continue to do, is analyse every two years, as the Treaty demands, whether or not the Member State in question in this case Sweden - fulfils the required conditions for entering the euro.
For the time being it does not do so.
Sweden has a problem because its currency is not included in the exchange rate mechanism and, therefore, it does not fulfil the exchange rate stability criterion, it does not conform to the criterion on bringing its legislation into line with the rules laid down in the articles of the Treaty that I referred to earlier, and we point that out.
What all Member States must do is try to prepare for that moment.
As the honourable Member knows, and as you all know, the results of the referendum held in Sweden in 2003 are not going to remain in force forever.
We have well-known cases of referendums that delivered a certain position in a particular country, but that position changed over time because the will of its citizens, expressed by means of elections or new referendums, changed.
I would insist that, from the point of view of the type of legal obligations laid down in the Treaty, the situation is not comparable if we analyse, on the one hand, the need to move towards Economic and Monetary Union and, on the other, the need to comply with the energy security rules that are included amongst our fundamental rules.
We shall now proceed to supplementary questions.
I have received more questions than I can accept.
Consequently, I can only give two MEPs the opportunity to speak.
I must comply with the provisions laid down in Rule 109 and Annex II of the Rules of Procedure, which cover the conduct of Questions to the Commission.
I have chosen Mr Lundgren and Mrs Kauppi.
(SV) Mr President, notwithstanding the Rules of Procedure, there is good reason for considering how this whole issue of Swedish membership of the currency union has been dealt with.
When the referendum on Swedish membership of the European Union was organised in 1994, it was made clear that we were not obliged to join the currency union if we voted in favour of EU membership.
That was an issue about which we had negotiated and on which we could decide later.
That is the political background to this matter.
I agree with the Commissioner that Sweden cannot be forced into ERM II as long as we do not fulfil the requirements for participation in it.
What I would point out, however, is this: is it really imaginable - and this is my question to the Commissioner - that a country that has joined ERM II can ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, I am not sure whether Mr Lundgren has actually asked a question, but in any event he and I agree that there is at least that point that you mentioned in your speech, Mr Lundgren, and there are also the legal incompatibilities which make it impossible at the moment to say that Sweden fulfils the criteria for joining the euro.
I would say once again that at no point does the Treaty lay down maximum or minimum time limits.
It lays down a general obligation to prepare, to seek to fulfil the conditions, but it does not stipulate a specific timetable.
The Treaty must therefore be interpreted with the same flexibility that was employed when it was drawn up, not according to criteria that are different to those laid down in the Treaty.
In any event, I would say that we need to apply common sense, as we so often have to do in politics.
If the Swedish citizens said no four years ago, we will have to ask them when they decide to change their minds, should they decide to do so.
I do not believe that any country can be obliged to join a currency against its will.
I would like to ask three direct questions.
The first is a purely technical issue: is the Accession Treaty clause for the Swedish Accession Treaty completely identical to those of the 12 Member States which joined after 2004?
Secondly, I understand that Mrs Budreikaitis not as much interested in the euro as she is in the former interpretations of the Accession Treaties.
If there is no deadline for implementing something in primary legislation, is it possible to postpone it forever?
Thirdly, do you think that the referendum is relevant to the debate?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr Czarnecki, being a Member State of the European Union, as we have just discussed in the last reply, brings with it the obligation to adopt the euro, except in the case of Denmark and the United Kingdom, which negotiated an 'opt-out' clause.
The Member States that are not yet members of the euro zone are committed to adopting the single currency once they fulfil the conditions necessary in order to do so and to try to prepare for fulfilling them.
When the Commission confirms, on the basis of its own assessment (the convergence report), and the European Central Bank does the same, that Poland meets all of the conditions laid down in Article 121(1) of the Treaty, Poland's exception can be removed, in accordance with Article 122(2), and the zloty can be introduced into the euro.
For the time being, Poland does not entirely fulfil the convergence criteria with regard to the situation of public finances - because the Polish public deficit is higher than 3% - and nor does it fulfil the criterion with regard to the stability of exchange rates insofar as the zloty does not belong to the exchange rate mechanism.
Furthermore, the legislation regulating the Central Bank in Poland does not yet conform to the Treaty's requirements, according to the analysis included in our latest convergence report of December 2006.
The Commission does not make predictions concerning when the Member States will or may fulfil the required conditions, but it certainly encourages all of them to gear their policies towards achieving macroeconomic stability and to promote productivity growth.
These policies promote sustainable economic convergence, which is the best basis for preparing the countries that wish to enter the euro and for enjoying all the benefits of belonging to the single currency once they are in the euro zone.
(PL) Commissioner, thank you for your speech.
However, I would like to say that we are obviously aware of the conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to join the Eurozone.
My country has clearly stated that this is still not the right moment in economic terms, and that a decision will certainly be taken in a few years.
I am very aware of the fact that the European Commission cannot discuss dates, but could we broadly state that 2012 would be a more or less suitable date for both sides?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, I would insist that it does not fall to the Commission to reply to that question.
I believe that it is a question that should be addressed, and that I sometimes address, to the Polish authorities.
When I meet with the Polish authorities, I ask them: have your intentions, timetable and objectives for joining the euro been established yet?
And I do not ask out of mere curiosity, but because I am convinced that, for an economy such as the Polish economy - and for many other economies of Member States of the European Union that do not yet belong to the single currency - it would be extremely useful to set that target date in order to guide macroeconomic policies and structural reforms in a consistent and coherent manner towards compliance with the conditions in order to prepare an economy to take the best possible advantage of the benefits of belonging to the euro.
Since the enlargement, we have experienced some very positive times in terms of the behaviour of the currency markets and of the financial markets, but that is not always going to be the case, and the financial markets, the rating agencies, the investors, are also going to put those questions to the Polish authorities.
Not only are you, the Members of the European Parliament, and we, the Commissioners, going to ask them, but the economic agents, observers and investors are asking them and will continue to do so with increasing insistence.
I therefore believe that it is good for everybody that the countries that are going to join the euro, not just through obligation, but above all through conviction, and which are undergoing a process of convergence, growth and modernisation, through a very significant reform effort, clarify this element of the strategy; above all, because it is good for them and for their own interests.
Would the Commissioner be willing to answer the same question again but in relation to the United Kingdom?
As you pointed out earlier, the UK has no obligation to join the euro but it has the right to do so, provided it meets the conditions.
How close is the UK to actually meeting the conditions?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, it is true that the situation in the United Kingdom - as I have already said, and as you have repeated - is not the same.
The United Kingdom has an 'opt-out' clause, and, therefore, the comments I made earlier with regard to the 12 countries that do not have that clause do not apply to it.
Even with that clause, however, the day will come - and I hope that you and I will see it soon - when the British authorities, regardless of that clause, decide to prepare for joining the euro because they believe that it is positive for the British economy.
When will that day come?
If you ask me whether I believe it will be this year, I shall say no, I do not believe that it will be this year.
My impression is that, in the current phase of the economic cycle of the British economy and of the euro zone economy, the arguments in favour are not going to increase over the coming months or in the immediate future.
I always respond to that question with a particular observation, however.
I believe that the time will come when the circumstances that the British, being the good pragmatists they are, analyse each month with regard to the pros and cons of joining the euro will change, and will show the British citizens, British politicians and the City of London, to name three significant parties in this regard, that it will be good for the British economy to enter the euro at a particular time.
I am sure that that time will come, but, to be frank, I believe that it will come after the next crisis.
(LT) Honourable Commissioner, I also would like to link the last two issues and ask you a specific question.
I personally do not doubt the advantages of the euro; however, in some countries, which do not yet have the euro, public opinion is different.
How would the situation be affected by, for example, referendums in Poland or Lithuania, or Hungary or the Czech Republic, in which people voted against the introduction of the euro?
How it would affect the moral climate is clear, but what about the legal and practical situation?
Mr President, Baroness Ludford, according to EU law, it is up to the UK authorities to carry out impact assessments of infrastructure projects and to ensure that all applicable environmental standards are complied with before, during and after the realisation of these projects.
Nevertheless, the Commission is closely monitoring the United Kingdom's implementation of the relevant provisions in Community law.
The plans for the sustainable development of Heathrow involve an undertaking by the UK government not to build a third runway without prior public consultation and only to do so if noise and air quality conditions are strictly adhered to.
A complete environmental impact assessment has therefore begun, which must comply with the provisions of the 1985 directive covering assessments of this nature, and with the provisions of the 2001 Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive.
According to the 1996 Directive on the Management and Quality of Ambient Air and directives arising from it, air quality plans must, where necessary, be implemented in order that the set limit values are complied with.
The impact of Heathrow Airport is covered by the air quality plan of the London metropolitan area.
In 2005, however, air quality levels in the area often exceeded the limit values laid down for PM10 particles.
Moreover, pursuant to the 2002 Directive on environmental noise, Heathrow must, before the end of this month, draw up a strategic noise map that includes an analysis of possible eventualities.
A year after this map has been drawn up, an appropriate action plan must be drawn up following a process of public consultation.
To sum up, the Commission is following the development of the EU's biggest airport with interest and is monitoring the implementation of the relevant provisions in Community law.
However, the specific provisions on the extension of the airport, for example the provision relating to the building of a third runway, rests with the British authorities in this particular case.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer.
This will reassure Londoners that the Commission is indeed keeping a watchful eye, though, as you say, the main responsibility lies with the UK Government.
However, an extra runway at Heathrow would allow an extra 500 flights a day to pass over London.
The UK Government's optimistic claim that air pollution can be kept within EU legal limits appears to rest on hopes of cleaner planes and controls on vehicle traffic around the airport.
Aviation already accounts for one third of all London's carbon emissions.
Therefore, we would ask the Commission to keep that close watch on what is going to happen.
We are expecting the consultation soon, but it needs the Commission to keep a very close eye to make sure that Londoners are protected.
While it is easy to lambaste plans for new runways, is the Commission aware that last week, as an indication of just how essential a third runway is at Heathrow, the Chief Executive of British Airways said that without it there is no prospect of restoring BA flights between my constituency in Belfast and the capital city of my country, London?
Thus, should those who would jump to oppose progress not pause to reflect on the prejudice and the hardship which they would impose on citizens of the UK and elsewhere who need the modern, efficient flight connections that projects such as this would provide?
Mr President, Baroness Ludford, I must reiterate what I said in my reply to Baroness Ludford's question.
The Commission must monitor compliance with Community law.
As I mentioned, there are a number of applicable directives, and monitoring their effective implementation is our responsibility.
In the particular case raised in Baroness Ludford's question, that is to say, the third runway at Heathrow, let me repeat that responsibility lies with the British authorities and, pursuant to the subsidiarity principle, the Commission may not interfere in issues for which responsibility lies with a particular Member State.
Mr President, Mr Papastamkos, since it published its White Paper in 2001, the Commission has always stressed the importance it attaches to the quality of governance in its actions, in order to ensure that the European institutions function effectively and democratically, in fruitful cooperation with civil society.
Governance is an issue that cuts across all policy areas, not only the environment.
We must acknowledge, however, that the citizens and NGOs place special emphasis on the quality of their environment and that civil society wants to be kept informed and to be involved as regards environmental issues.
The 1998 Aarhus Convention is of particular importance in this connection, as it provides for access to information, public involvement in the decision-making process and justice when it comes to environmental issues.
This Convention, to which the Community and the Member States are party, reinforces the commitments mentioned in the White Paper on European Governance.
The Commission has applied principles of governance fully in its initiatives.
As regards the issues raised by Mr Papastamkos in his question, I should like to point out to him that all important measures that the Commission is planning to present to other institutions are included in its annual work programme.
This programme is presented to the other institutions - including, of course, Parliament, which debates it every year - and is accessible to the public.
Most environmental measures are based on the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
Furthermore, all of the Commission's proposals fully reflect the undertakings made by the Community in international agreements, including those relating to trade policy and the environment.
Lastly, the Commission is playing an active role in the debate on improving international environmental governance.
The EU has put forward a practical proposal to set up a UN environmental organisation, on the basis of a UN environmental programme.
This body would have authority and clear legal functions as regards the early detection, monitoring and recovery of data, and would work on a consolidated scientific basis, thereby improving decision-making and the adoption of policies based on scientific evidence.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the environmental acquis contains approximately 400 texts of secondary law and international conventions and they are, of course, used and applied by governments, local authorities, enterprises and the civil society.
What has this famous 'better regulation' strategy yielded to date?
Two years ago I proposed here in this Chamber the need to establish an international environmental organisation.
What is the Commission's position?
The environment, as we all know, is a public commodity and, as such, has no borders.
What is the Commission's position on the establishment of an international environmental court?
Mr President, Mr Martin, the Commission bases EU climate policy and its scientific analysis of climate change on the most robust, up-to-date information available.
The Commission is aware that, according to recent research, with greenhouse gases stabilising at 550 parts per million (ppm) CO2 equivalent, the chances of meeting the objective of limiting global warming to two degrees are dwindling.
Accordingly, in its Communication entitled 'Limiting global warming to 2Â°c' adopted this year, the Commission stated that in order to ensure that there is a 50% chance of not exceeding the 2Â°c limit, it will be necessary to keep greenhouse gas concentrations at substantially less than 550ppm CO2 equivalent in the decades ahead.
It also stated that emissions must then go down in order to achieve stabilisation at around 450ppm.
This means that between now and 2050, worldwide greenhouse gas emissions must go down by at least 50% in relation to 1990 levels.
The Commission's analysis demonstrated that this objective is technically feasible and economically viable if those mainly responsible for emissions take action quickly.
This technical feasibility was confirmed recently by the report issued by Working Group 3 of the International Panel on Climate Change.
The scientific studies carried out by Mr Meinhausen mentioned by Mr Martin in his question also underpin this ambitious objective.
In order to limit climate change to 2Â°c, to a 2Â°c increase, developed countries must take the initiative of collectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 30% in relation to 1990 levels by 2020, which is the objective we set in the proposals we adopted in January of this year in the Commission, and that subsequently received the Council's support.
At the same time, emissions from developing countries must reach their maximum targets between 2020 and 2025.
We are facing a global challenge, and the EU, which is responsible for 14% of the total greenhouse gas emissions on the planet, is ready to take the lead on the issue on the international stage.
The EU is sure that the UN Conference on Climate Change to be held in Bali later this year will provide the impetus for negotiations on future international cooperation on climate change after 2012, which will lead to - or, rather, should lead to - an agreement on what must be done to achieve a global reduction in emissions.
I should like to add that, on the basis of the conclusions of the last G8 Summit - taking account of both the progress and the limitations of those conclusions - we feel that significant progress was made on this agreement a few days ago in Heiligendamm.
Firstly, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very detailed and, in some ways, encouraging reply.
However, he has acknowledged in that reply that the 550 ppm target is unlikely to achieve his objectives.
Will the Commission, in the run-up to Bali, put forward the idea of Europe taking a lead and going for a 400 ppm target as a way of setting a good example to the rest of the world?
I also accept his point that Europe acting alone will be insufficient.
Mr President, as Europeans we are convinced that, as I said in my first answer to Mr Martin, enormous progress needs to be made and that the EU must play a leading role on the world stage.
By moving forward together we can achieve much more ambitious goals, the likes of which others responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions are not prepared to undertake, at the end-of-year Conference on the post-Kyoto era, and Europe will find itself alone in making such commitments.
Europe alone, as we said in our January proposals, must move forward in setting ambitious objectives.
It will not be possible, however, to make the kind of commitments we wish to unless the other participants at the Conference do likewise.
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, Mr Posselt, the European Union applies strict legislation to transfers of waste between Member Status and to transfers to third countries.
Community legislation on the transfer of waste is aimed at preventing the illegal transportation of waste, including cases in which waste is transported illegally from one Member State to another in what is known, and what you have described in your question, as 'waste tourism'.
The transport of waste is only authorised when subsequent recovery or elimination operations conform to the environmental protection requirements laid down in European and Member State legislation.
European legislation lays down the strictest possible requirements with regard to the transport of dangerous goods and waste intended for elimination.
According to this legislation, it is illegal to transport this kind of waste to another Member State unless there has been prior written notification to the competent authority of the originating country.
Furthermore, in order to be able to carry out the transfer, authorisations must have been received from the competent authorities of the countries of origin, destination and transit.
The Commission's main priorities include ensuring that Member States correctly apply European legislation on the transfer of waste, as well as preventing and reducing illegal transfers. The Commission has adopted a series of measures for achieving these objectives.
This year awareness-raising events and meetings have been organised with the Member States, with a view to improving implementation and compliance with the rules on the transfer of waste in the Member States.
Another important step will be the Commission's adoption of a proposal for a directive on environmental protection by means of criminal legislation.
We cannot accept the illegal transport of waste from Germany to the Czech Republic or the illegal dumping of waste at the final destination.
We are aware that similar situations may exist in other Member States, in addition to the one you raise in your question.
The Commission will monitor the situation closely with a view to ensuring the correct application of European environmental legislation.
Both the Commission and the Member States share the responsibility for guaranteeing the effective application of this legislation.
The Member States must provide for inspections and controls of waste transfers on the ground and effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions in the event of infringements.
(DE) I am much obliged to the Commissioner for that good, exhaustive reply.
I now have two supplementary questions.
Firstly, in the Commissioner's opinion, is enough being done to combat illegal waste tourism?
Secondly, is it true that the phenomenon is only shifting to the new external borders of the EU: for example to Ukraine or South-East Europe?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, I am no expert in this field, but I can tell you that when it comes to this kind of action, and given that both you in your question and I in my reply note that illegal transportation exists, anything that can be done in addition to what is already being done will be welcome, and this is applicable both to our own responsibilities for ensuring compliance with European law and - as I said in my initial reply - to the actions of the Member States, which have the monitoring and inspection instruments on the ground.
With regard to the places in which this kind of illegal activity is taking place, according to the information available - as I pointed out in my reply - transfers of this type do not just take place between Germany and the Czech Republic, but also between Germany and certain other new Member States.
And this transit may also exist beyond the borders of the European Union.
In any event, with regard to transfers, to transport between Member States, it is particularly useful that this debate should confirm the intention and commitment of the European institutions to carry out our duties as vigorously as possible and call upon the politicians in the Member States to do likewise.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Member for the question, even though I have to be honest and say that I wish he was tabling it six months from now, because we are currently in the process of preparing our report on exactly this matter, i.e. the implementation of the Council recommendation, and we expect to have the report adopted by the end of this year.
So we expect to have a discussion on the report, mainly under the Slovenian Presidency in the first half of next year.
This report will provide information on the implementation and possible impact of the recommendation in the Member States, in the European Economic Area states and candidate countries.
Additionally, wherever possible, the degree of national implementation will be reported in relation to the existing European screening benchmarks in breast and cervical cancer.
We expect to derive the facts from two main sources: the Member States, which will be directly contacted by the Commission, and the European Cancer Network, which is responsible for obtaining evidence on the impact and the degree of implementation from independent experts in the field.
I would like to take the opportunity, additionally, to inform you that we are also collecting cancer epidemiological data through the European Union Network for Information on Cancer that was established in 2005, which is co-funded by the Commission and managed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
The aim is to compile information relevant to monitoring the cancer burden in European populations.
The end of this project is scheduled for the end of August 2007 - two months from now.
All the data, therefore, will in principle be available from that date.
I asked the Commissioner the question because I was aware that on the horizon there are some very good activities planned, and I wish to thank him for that.
I asked the question because I have been talking to doctors, consultants and oncologists in my own city of London, and in the United Kingdom we have a disproportionate number of cancer cases for what is a prosperous Member State.
The question I want to ask you is: when I go back to those oncologists, what will I tell them?
Will I tell them that you will make every effort to ensure that the Council recommendation is implemented and that the Commission will take seriously the disproportionate figures we see from Member State to Member State, and that you will make a comparative example of Member States so that we can do something about some of these rates, which are far too high?
I can assure you that I will do my utmost to have the screening recommendations fulfilled and implemented as much as possible.
They are recommendations, nevertheless, and we have to acknowledge this weakness in the European system.
Therefore, in the end, it is up to each Member State to apply and implement them as effectively as possible.
Perhaps the report will put some pressure on the Member States.
However, the fact is that, from the information we already have, there is still great diversity between Member States as to implementation of their screening guidelines and, unfortunately, the worst situation is in many of the new Member States.
Based on the report, there will be a discussion under the Slovenian Presidency which they will announce soon to Parliament.
Cancer will be the main health theme during the Presidency.
Therefore, I am sure we will have more opportunities to discuss this issue.
From my part, I will do everything to have these guidelines and recommendations applied as effectively and as faithfully as possible.
(DE) Screening is important, but prevention is better.
In recent months, a vaccine against cervical cancer has been developed: a cancer that is always particularly problematic in young women.
Member States have adopted completely different practices: some make it available on the national health service, whilst in others it is only available privately. This makes it very expensive and it becomes a social issue.
Does the Commission envisage any prospect of putting pressure on Member States to give as many young women and girls as possible access to this vaccine?
Yes, I know about that, and in fact we had an opportunity to discuss this issue at the Informal Health Council in Aachen in April.
We have now asked the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which is working on this issue, to produce guidelines and give advice on this subject.
Of course, what is covered and what is not covered by the health system is, as you know, the responsibility of the Member States, but I believe that, based on the ECDC's guidance, we can discuss the issue further with the Member States and offer science.
However, the final decision on finances will be left to the Member States.
One of the great strengths of the European Union in the field of health is the ability to spread best practices.
Apart from examining the outcome of the screening recommendations, will the Commission take as an example the country that comes out best in terms of screening, treatment and low mortality rates and analyse not just how they got there, but how this could be applied to other Member States?
There is no point in just gathering statistics and saying 'These countries are doing it well' or 'these countries are doing it badly'.
We also need to know why the best countries are succeeding and how we might transpose that into other healthcare systems across the Community.
Îember of the Commission.
(EL) Mr President, the European Commission does indeed plan to approve a new strategy on health for 2007 and this strategy will be a general framework with quantifiable targets which take an integrated approach to all initiatives in the health sector at European level.
I agree with what I might call the inference in the honourable Member's question that children and young people are a special priority for the European Commission.
The strategy will refer to issues such as the importance of a healthy way of life and the need to combat obesity, smoking and alcoholism, but will also make special reference to sectors that affect children and young people.
Of course, as I said in the previous question, our initiative on high-calibre health and safety services will be approved shortly and account will be taken within this framework of all the common fundamental values adopted by the Ministers of Health a year ago which support the European Union's health care systems.
The values referred to in the decision by the Ministers include equality, universality and equal access to health services for everyone - and of course that includes children - regardless of their financial circumstances and these values will be taken into account in all the relevant initiatives by the European Commission.
Of course, the provision of health services comes within the competence of the Member States, but the Commission will support the Member States in this endeavour and these values will also be taken into account in our initiatives wherever and whenever they refer to the health sector.
We believe that all this will form a useful point of reference for all Community action in the health sector.
(EL) Mr President, for children especially, as the strategy on children's rights is being debated and the competent commission has not expressed an opinion in the health sector, I wish to ask if provision has been made to introduce certain regular examinations throughout Europe, in order to safeguard the standard of health and the early diagnosis of illnesses.
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, it goes without saying that this comes within the competence of the Member States but, under the various strategies which will be adopted and within the framework of the exchange of best practices in various sectors, of course the question of the best method of prevention will also be discussed and prompt examination is clearly an important preventive method.
However, we assume that this will be addressed in each sector separately.
I do not expect there to be a horizontal provision especially for children; however, in every health sector and in every health problem that can be avoided, the strategy and the initiative will refer specifically to children and to prevention.
(DE) Mr President, the Commissioner raised the issue of alcoholism.
In Austria, a rare - or not so rare - phenomenon has emerged among young people, namely that of 'binge drinking'.
The aim seems to be to drink oneself unconscious in as little time as possible.
In the Commissioner's experience, is this an exclusively Austrian phenomenon, or is there a trend towards this throughout Europe?
If it is a European trend, does he already have some measures in mind to counter such extreme drinking and prevent it in the long term?
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, this problem of excessive consumption of alcohol may indeed have started as a problem in the north or northwestern Member States of the European Union, but it is now extending to the more southern countries.
We already know that this problem is being faced by Spain and I have had frequent opportunity to discuss this issue with the Minister of Health.
This issue is addressed in the strategy to combat the harmful effects of the excessive consumption of alcohol adopted last year and supported by the Member States.
We are in fact waiting for the European Parliament's position on this issue, but the question of young people and combating this form of excessive consumption of alcohol in general are among the strategy's main objectives.
However, to a very great extent, and I must repeat again something I said earlier, the competence lies with the Member States.
However, we believe that, through efforts to exchange best practices and transfer experience from one Member State to another and cooperation with all the agencies involved, we shall be able to achieve positive results.
That is precisely why, last week, we had the first meeting of the European Alcohol and Health Forum and, of course, the problem raised by the honourable Member was one of the items addressed by the European Alcohol and Health Forum.
(DE) The aim is to live a long, healthy life.
Does the Commission have any suggestions as to how the existing EU programmes, such as the Seventh Research Framework Programme or the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, could be used to achieve these objectives, and what are the Commission's plans for the period up to 2013?
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, of course in the health sector in general, the basic strategy of the European Commission for this period is prevention.
That is precisely why we are focusing on numerous efforts concerned with negative repercussions on the health sector, as I said earlier, such as alcohol, smoking, obesity, mental health and all these issues.
However, this too will be part of the strategy; the approach will apply to all European policies in all sectors, especially the research sector you referred to, and to other sectors of the European Union, such as the agricultural, transport and regional policy sectors.
In the research sector in particular, I work in close collaboration with my colleague and much of it is devoted to health research, such as research into cancer, research into avian influenza and in other health sectors, because we consider that it is one of the basic priorities and that is also acknowledged in the seventh financing protocol.
On these health services, as I said earlier, we had the opportunity to discuss this in May during the debate on the report by Mrs Vergnaud, which was very helpful to us.
I can inform Parliament that we are now in the process of drafting a proposal.
After a few ministerial discussions this was endorsed by the Health Ministers in the latest Council, which expressed its expectation for the Commission to present the proposal in exactly the same way as the Parliament.
So we expect to do this as soon as possible, definitely before the end of the year.
We previously had a broad public consultation and the input from that will also be taken into account, but the basic outcome is that there is added value for initiative at European level.
An important part of it will of course be the issue of information, and we would like this to be done in the most accurate and objective way.
Our intention is to find solutions that add real value for patients, health professionals and healthcare providers, without creating new bureaucratic barriers, and respecting the principle of subsidiarity.
We will ensure coherence between the proposals on health services and the ongoing parallel Commission initiatives on social services of general interest, the wider issue of services of general interest, and the ongoing modernisation and simplification of the regulations on the coordination of social security systems.
As I said earlier, information to citizens is an important part, so there will be efforts to access information; some have already been taken and have already been put in place with a recently launched website on meeting the costs for healthcare abroad.
This website, which is already available in French, English and German, will be available in all official languages very soon.
We will of course inform Parliament of forthcoming proposals as soon as they are finalised within the Commission, but I can broadly describe the main issues the proposals will address: improved information to patients, in particular about cross-border healthcare; the issue of the general quality and safety of health services; the rights of the patients to redress when they suffer harm; respect for privacy; procedural guarantees for patients in relation to cross-border healthcare; collection of data on cross-border health services; and support for European cooperation on issues such as European reference networks, developing quality and safety guidelines or developing comparable data and indicators.
. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to know whether the Commission has annual statistics yet indicating the number of citizens of each Member State who wish to avail themselves of health care in another state and, if so, for what main reasons.
In the absence of such statistics, does the Commission have the number of complaints that may have been filed by citizens of a Member State who have been refused authorisation to receive health care in another Member State?
One of the problems is that we do not have sufficient statistics on this issue.
But we know from the evidence we have in front of us is that it is at least 1% of healthcare, so this will increase expectations.
The main reason so far is the issue of the lack of information.
People are not aware they have this right, and the more they become aware of this the more they will seek treatment abroad.
This is an opportunity for us to regulate before it becomes too big an issue, before it is too late.
I am afraid I do not have any indication of the complaints from people not being granted authorisation.
As you know, we have had cases before the European Court of Justice where citizens were dissatisfied with a negative decision but, at the same time, the patients' lack of knowledge that they can seek redress at European level does not give us an accurate and clear picture either.
That is why, when I was answering you question earlier, I only had in front of me the collection of data and cross-border health service which will be one of the priorities of the upcoming initiative.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Derogations from internal market rules for defence procurement on the basis of Article 296 TEC (debate)
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on derogations from internal market rules for defence procurement on the basis of Article 296 TEC, by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - B6-0122/2007).
author. - Mr President, I am sorry Mr Booth has gone because I would like to tell him that I am a music lover and perhaps next time he could perform a Euro-rap when my report is up!
As the Commissioner is aware, the defence procurement market accounts for a large share of EU public procurement, estimated at about EUR 80 billion out of a combined Member State defence budget of EUR 170 billion, and that is why we are tabling this question today: defence procurement is still being awarded within mostly fragmented national markets.
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, therefore, takes note of the Commission's interpretative communication on the application of Article 296 of the Treaty in the field of defence procurement, adopted on 7 December 2006.
This helped clarify the existing legal framework. However, we also further note efforts by the Commission to propose new legislation, which should substantially contribute to creating a more competitive environment for the European defence industry and its suppliers.
Therefore, we want to ask the Commissioner the following questions.
What progress is being made on the draft directive on the procurement of defence equipment not subject to the derogations of Article 296?
What are the subsequent steps planned by the Commission in this area?
How does the Commission evaluate, from the perspective of a fair and efficient working of the internal market, the situation within the European defence industry, where in different Member States a significant number of highly skilled jobs appear to be at risk?
What impact does it expect the directive to have on the sector, and what is the Commission's strategy to induce Member States to cooperate more closely on defence procurement issues, to improve transparency and gradually open up their national defence procurement markets in order to establish a well-performing and competitive environment for this sensitive sector?
We should also like to know what conclusions can be drawn from the code of conduct that was established in 2006, and how the Commission understands the future relationship between a potential directive and the code of conduct.
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy.
I would like to remind you that rap music and the Greek hendecasyllabic metre have the same rhythm.
You and Mr Booth are closer than you think.
Mr President, four years ago the Commission announced its intention to develop a European security and defence policy.
Since then, we have been striving to establish a more open and fair European defence market through a number of initiatives.
The new procurement directive for defence equipment is a crucial element of this overall strategy and is one of the Commission's strategic priorities for this year.
At present, the vast majority of defence equipment tenders are conducted outside Community rules.
Member States rely upon the derogation from the Treaty under Article 296.
In the Commission's view, this derogation should be limited to the exceptional cases.
We gave some guidance on the matter last December.
Nevertheless, the derogation is still the rule more than the exception. Most defence procurement has therefore remained outside of the internal market principles.
This means that all 27 Member States procure defence equipment in accordance with their own national regulations, often resulting in non-transparent and sometimes discriminatory practices.
We recognise that current public procurement rules are really suited to the particular needs of the defence procurement. But we believe we can achieve important economic gains if we open up national defence markets, which represent 0.8% of the European Union's GDP and one quarter of public procurement at state level.
Member States and industry widely acknowledge these advantages.
Fair and transparent conditions would allow companies, especially SMEs, to tender more easily in other Member States and thus widen their access to business opportunities in a much larger home market.
Longer production runs would allow economies of scale. This in turn would help to reduce costs and lead to lower prices.
The final beneficiary of that would be the taxpayer.
Our proposal would adapt certain Community procurement rules to the specific nature of defence and give awarding authorities greater flexibility for sensitive procurement procedures.
This will also make it easier for Member States to use the derogation under Article 296 of the Treaty only in exceptional cases.
As is the case under the other procurement directives, Member States will continue exchanging views on defence procurement issues via the Advisory Committee on Public Procurement, once the directive has been implemented.
I wish to emphasise that the new directive will implement the code of conduct of the European Defence Agency.
The code of conduct applies only to contracts which are exempted from the Community rules on the basis of Article 296, while the future directive will apply to contracts which are not exempted from Community rules.
Together the code of conduct and the new directive will enhance transparency and fair competition on defence partners in the European Union.
I am pleased to indicate that work on the proposal for a defence directive is well advanced.
My services are currently finalising the impact assessment which will tell us more about the expected impact of the initiative on the market, including social issues.
In parallel we are working closely with Member States via the Advisory Committee on Public Procurement and via the European Defence Agency.
Industry is also involved in the impact assessment.
The Commission is planning to adopt a proposal in the autumn.
At this stage we aim to present it as part of a package, together with a proposal for a regulation on intra-Community transfers of military equipment and a communication on defence industries.
Since we started the reference in the field of defence procurement, Parliament has always been one of our strongest supporters.
This is clearly reflected in Parliament's resolution of 2005.
I wish to thank you for this and hope that our fruitful cooperation will continue in the future.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming the Commissioner's clear commitment to producing the new directive as soon as possible and by thanking him for outlining a number of important measures on which he and his departments are already working.
Clearly, this is a particularly sensitive area because of both its strategic nature and some of the industrial policy issues surrounding the whole defence sector.
I should like to raise two particular points, to which the Commissioner could perhaps respond in his winding-up statement.
Firstly, it is clear that in many areas of defence equipment procurement there are very complex contractual arrangements, in many cases also involving a significant amount of product development.
In other words, the specification of the equipment may involve new technology evolutions.
These arrangements will be very different in many cases from conventional buying contracts, although, as I indicated in my response to Mrs McCarthy's report, there is increasing interest in more transparent conditions for these types of contracts.
I wonder whether the Commissioner could indicate or confirm that he will be taking these specific strategic needs into account.
The second point, which is a difficult one, is that in many cases defence procurement agreements also have some form of offset agreement attached to them.
For instance, the procuring countries may be looking for some form of local investment, involving local firms in assembling the equipment.
Or, in some cases, there is a completely different sort of financial offset in terms of an agreement to buy products from a company in another market.
These arrangements seem to raise difficult issues in the context of both competition and procurement law, and I should be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm that he will be looking at these in the review of the directive he has promised.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not only a tricky subject but, astonishingly, also an area in which Member States are persistently infringing European law.
The Green Paper was discussed in 2004, Parliament tabled a motion for a resolution in 2006, and now we have a new interpretation - yet, in reality, hardly anything has changed.
Member States are continuing to do as they please.
Has the CFSP failed in this respect?
I can see no real improvement since 2004.
Member States and members of national parliaments seem to be completely unaware of Article 296 of the EC Treaty - as, indeed, it describes an exceptional situation rather than the rule.
In addition, the European Court of Justice has found once again that this is not a case of a general automatic derogation.
Yet there is no improvement to be seen, even though - and this, too, may still be worth mentioning - the group concerned consists of just six Member States.
There, too, I do not currently see any improvement.
To put it clearly, I do not want any increase in the defence budget; above all, my group wants to see savings by means of cooperation and the use of synergies.
Parliament has made some recommendations in this regard, for example on the components the new Code of Conduct should have.
Perhaps the Commissioner could add something in this regard?
We have also requested better cooperation from the Commission - and not only the Commission, but also the European Defence Agency.
I cannot see much evidence of this in reality.
I should like to reiterate that we have made suggestions on the mechanisms for the competitive award of contracts the Commission still needs to change for us to finally achieve what everyone in this House wants.
After all, we agree with the Commission that a genuine European defence market is necessary to reduce military expenditure costs and to make production more efficient in the interests of the taxpayer and the public.
Mr President, Commissioner, Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for his speech clarifying the current position of the Commission on this subject.
He pointed out that Parliament is a good ally of the Commission's, and indeed we do support his view that a more transparent, effective and open European defence market is an important objective, with a view both to strengthening the sector in Europe and to further objectives.
I believe that what I have just said goes for all my fellow Members: I would point to the broad consensus we achieved on our resolution on the Green Paper.
We learn with interest that the work on the Directive on the procurement of defence equipment is well advanced and that the Commission intends to present a proposal in autumn.
Mrs Weiler has just pointed out that defence markets are still largely national in character.
The State is the only relevant bidder for defence equipment, and it is true that, in the case of many award decisions, recourse is still taken to legal bases that are questionable, to say the least.
However, I agree with Mrs Weiler: there is little support for increasing the defence budget.
I believe that this draft Directive takes exactly the right course, namely increasing the efficiency reserve in the European armaments industry, ending the fragmentation of the market, and really improving efficiency and achieving economies of scale.
That is why we welcome the Commissioner's remarks on expected growth and on increased competitiveness on the European defence equipment market.
I believe that this will also have a positive effect on the trained labour market.
We need a clear definition of the equipment covered by the derogation.
The existing regulations are indeed insufficient to meet the particular needs of the defence equipment market.
Therefore, we also welcome the Commission's initiative to adapt the rules to the state of affairs on the defence equipment market and to strive for greater flexibility in this regard.
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could tell us why he decided to adapt general public procurement law instead of presenting a separate directive.
This may well be appropriate, but I should like him to say a few words about this.
The bottom line is that we agree with the Commissioner when he says that the opening-up of this market will increase transparency and competition and thus ultimately reduce the burden on taxpayers.
Finally, I should like to emphasise that, as I see it, this draft Directive is far more important than any considerations of industrial or internal-market policy.
It will contribute to the development of European security and defence policy, thus bringing about progress in what is traditionally a core domain of national sovereignty.
The Directive will bring about progress that may not be revolutionary, but is hopefully measurable, towards a European Security and Defence Policy truly deserving of the name.
I would like to add that I would be obliged if, in future, such debates were held in Brussels and not in Strasbourg.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, each year, around EUR 180 billion are spent on defence within the borders of the European Union's common market.
Almost half of this amount is not subject to the public procurement legislation currently in force.
We need to analyse this situation, which has resulted from the application of Article 296 of the Treaty in relation to public procurement in the field of defence.
The Communication has partly clarified the issue.
In view of the specific nature of the arms manufacturing industry and the need to integrate it into the defence policies of specific Member States of the European Union and NATO, we need to ensure the technical compatibility of the equipment and communication systems, as well as the proper compatibility of equipment and appliances.
We need greater cooperation between individual countries, a properly functioning defence industry and well organised supplies.
The objective of our activities should be to draw up a directive on public procurement in the defence sector.
A stable arms market and stability with respect to the procurement procedures used will have a positive effect on the sector, in terms of employment and efficiency.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the basis for today's debate is the report by our former colleague Mr WÃŒrmeling.
It was on this basis that the Commission issued its communication at the end of last year, which was intended to clarify the application of Article 296 but in fact had little effect.
After all, it was initially geared exclusively towards non-military goods, and thus the majority of military procurements inevitably fell within the scope of this derogation.
Therefore, it is really up to the Commission to ensure that, firstly, the rules on public procurement in the defence sector really support the work of the European Defence Agency and, secondly, that they take account of the fact that, as many of the previous speakers have said, this is a sector that exhibits peculiarities.
I have three questions for Commissioner McCreevy, therefore.
Firstly, does a directive in this field not have the flaw from the outset that it is based on a communication that was originally intended to cover only non-military goods, and is consequently unable to achieve what we expect of it as regards the common security policy?
Secondly, would it not be possible to update the 1958 list, which sets out the derogations relatively clearly but is now out of date?
Has the Commission abandoned the task of updating this for good?
Thirdly, the Commissioner rightly said that normal public procurement law is not suited to the defence sector.
Following on from Mr Lambsdorff's question, I would be very interested to hear how the Commissioner intends to take account of the peculiarities of the defence sector in a directive.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, each year, the 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 170 billion on defence.
These 27 Member States have two million soldiers, 10 000 tanks and 3 000 fighter aircraft.
In spite of this, they could not end the bloodshed in the Balkan conflict; we needed our American friends to do it for us.
Why was that?
At that time there were not yet any common decision-making structures in the EU to enable the implementation of such operations.
Another of the main reasons for the inefficiency of European defence is the lack of a common defence market.
One of the reasons for this is Article 296.
I am convinced that this Article will be retained in future.
The reason that no common European defence market has developed is the excessive application of this Article in the past.
First of all, the Commission issued its communication clarifying what is and what is not covered by Article 296: I think this communication is helpful.
Then the European Defence Agency took action: in my opinion, the Code of Conduct it adopted was an important step in the right direction.
We now also need EU legislation in this field, however - which is why I welcome the fact that this Directive is now envisaged.
As MEPs, we keep hearing a great deal of criticism of the EU rules on the award of public contracts, particularly from local authorities.
Therefore, we MEPs shall take very great care that the rules established here are indeed tailored towards the defence field, and that they improve rather than worsen the situation in that field.
Our assent will be conditional on this.
In addition, we keep hearing that we Europeans are spending too little on defence.
If we continue working on this field and create a common market, we shall at least achieve more security for the same money.
Mr President, in response to comments by Mr Harbour, Mr Lambsdorff and Mr Schwab, I can confirm that the very aim of a dedicated directive on defence procurement is to take account of the specificity of the defence market.
We recognise that the existing framework is ill-adapted to the defence market.
Clearly, the fundamental principles of public procurement rules will have to apply, but defence presents specific requirements in terms of security of supply, security of information or the need to have negotiated procedure.
Mr Harbour also raised the question about offsets, which is a very complex issue.
Offsets are economic compensations, which most Member States require from non-national suppliers when they buy military equipment abroad.
They are legally problematic, politically controversial and economically questionable.
Direct offsets are directly related to the subject of the procurement contract, they can sometimes be covered by Article 296, if the procurement contract itself is exempted on the basis of that article.
However, the huge majority of offsets are indirect and non-military in nature.
From the Commission's viewpoint, these offsets are not covered by Article 296.
They must respect Community law, even if they are related to defence contracts exempted on the basis of Article 296.
In other words, offsets are a problem in themselves, even in the area covered by Article 296.
Addressing this problem via the Defence Directive would only cover the Community part of the defence market and would leave indirect offsets for contracts exempted on the basis of Article 296 untouched.
In conclusion, as I said earlier, the opening-up of national defence markets will lead to important economic gains and will ultimately benefit all taxpayers.
In order to achieve this we need to create a new legal framework, which adapts certain Community procurement rules to the specificities of defence.
This new directive will give national authorities greater flexibility when they make sensitive procurements.
The debate is closed.
The banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury (debate)
The next item is the report by Dimitrios Papadimoulis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury - C6-0363/2006 -.
Mr President, I am pleased to open this debate on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury.
I should like to thank the draftsman and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their efforts so far.
I should also like to thank the Committee on International Trade and its rapporteur, Mr Holm, for their contribution to this file.
Mercury is internationally recognised as highly toxic to humans, ecosystems and wildlife.
Initially seen as an acute local problem, mercury pollution is now also understood to be global, diffuse and chronic.
High doses can be fatal to humans and even relatively low doses can have serious adverse neuro-developmental impacts.
Against this background, the Commission developed a comprehensive Community strategy concerning mercury, which was adopted in January 2005.
Its key aim is to reduce mercury levels in the environment and human exposure through a number of actions that address all aspects of the mercury lifecycle.
The European Parliament welcomed the strategy and its overall approach in the resolution adopted in March 2006.
The proposal that is now before you implements two key actions identified in the strategy, namely Action 5 (by banning the export of metallic mercury from the Community) and Action 9 (by requiring the safe storage of mercury that is no longer needed in the chlor-alkali industry).
The primary production of mercury came to an end within the Community four years ago when the last active mine in AlmadÃ©n in Spain stopped its activities.
The environmentally desirable phasing-out of mercury-cell technology into chlor-alkali industry results, however, in a new source of mercury supplies: some 12 000 tonnes of surplus mercury will come out of the sector over the next number of years until its transition to mercury-free technologies is completed.
Most mercury is currently exported from the Community, and exports of up to 800 tonnes per year end up, at least partly, in unregulated and uncontrolled uses like artisanal gold mining.
This is how EU mercury is adding to global mercury exposure.
The basic aim of the proposed regulation is to stop these exports and to ensure that mercury no longer used in the chlor-alkali industry is safely stored and cannot re-enter the environment.
On the basis of the impact assessment, the Commission also proposes to apply the safe storage requirement to two other industrial sources of mercury - natural gas cleaning and mercury resulting as a byproduct of non-ferrous metal mining.
The storage obligation is a logical development from the export ban, as the small remaining internal market for mercury will be unable to absorb the quantities at stake.
Recycling and recovery will ensure that mercury is still available for remaining legitimate uses.
Storage operations will fall under the legal framework of the Waste Landfill Directive, with additional safety requirements reflecting the specific properties of metallic mercury.
The Commission aimed at proposing a straightforward, simple legislative proposal that is backed by a sound knowledge base and avoids, in line with the principles of better regulation, any excessive administrative burden for industry or for public administration.
The proposal refrains from taking legislative action in fields where the impact assessment did not provide any solid justification for such action or any clear view on its possible impact.
I should also like to underline that the industry concerned, namely the chlor-alkali sector, signalled its support for this proposal and is willing to sign up to a voluntary commitment.
This commitment engages industry to select highly qualified storage operators and ensures that key data on mercury flows will be made available.
The Commission intends to acknowledge this commitment, in line with the principles and procedures set out in the communication on the environmental agreements adopted in 2002.
It is not the purpose of the proposal to implement the whole of the mercury strategy: its scope is deliberately more concise.
Work on other actions of the strategy is ongoing.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic substances.
Even in low doses, they have an adverse impact on our cardiovascular, immune and reproductive systems.
In the environment, mercury can change into methylmercury and concentrate in the food chain, especially in the aquatic environment.
In the city of Mina-Mata in Japan in 1956, 8 000 people died because they ate fish with a high mercury content.
Mercury is a global problem and needs coordinated international action to resolve it.
The European Union cannot argue persuasively for a reduction in the supply and demand of mercury and, at the same time, continue to be one of the main suppliers in the world.
The Commission proposal for a regulation is a unique opportunity to break the cycle of exports of this dangerous substance.
I am extremely satisfied that both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Legal Affairs rejected the double legal basis and opted for Article 175 as the only basis, given that the objective of the regulation is to protect the environment and public health.
As far as the starting date for banning exports is concerned, I am calling for something fair and simple: we in the European Parliament need to remain consistent with the resolution we ourselves adopted by a very large majority in March 2006 on the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury.
That is why I call on you to vote in favour of Amendment 43, so that we are consistent with these stated positions of the European Parliament.
I think that the compounds and mercury products already subject to restricted use and marketing in the European Union should also be included in the export ban, as we agreed in March last year.
What message are we sending to third countries if we export to them the mercury products banned in the European Union because they are dangerous?
Will we remember the well-known phrase 'bon pour l'orient'?
As far as the ban on mercury imports is concerned, there is no sense in storing mercury from the European Union on the one hand and in importing mercury for use within the European Union on the other.
We are calling for common sense.
Besides, supply currently exceeds demand, according to the Commission figures, and this situation looks likely to continue in the future.
As regards the storage obligation for metallic mercury no longer used in the chlor-alkali industry, again my views are based on the resolution adopted by the European Parliament.
I am calling, until such time as there are appropriate techniques for the final disposal of mercury, preferably in solidified form, for temporary storage in a recoverable form, either in underground salt mines or in surface installations used exclusively and equipped for temporary storage.
Otherwise, the storage site for this toxic substance will be the human body itself.
Anyway, we are not talking about millions of tonnes.
In all, the surplus quantities of mercury in the chlor-alkali industry are estimated at approximately 12 000 tonnes, the volume of which - due to its high density - is approximately 1 000 cubic metres.
At the same time, I am calling for the adoption of a basic framework of preconditions for storage ensuring continuous monitoring, safety specifications, regular reporting, exchange of information and penalties in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle in the event of non-compliance.
Responsibility during temporary storage should remain with the owner of the storage installation, while the Member States should assume administrative and financial responsibility for safe final disposal.
I am therefore calling on the Member States to create a fund on the basis of financial contributions from the chlor-alkali industry which will provide the necessary resources.
I am also calling for a register of buyers, sellers and traders of mercury to allow regular monitoring of movements of imports and exports.
Let us stand against a watered down regulation which will not provide the level of protection of public health and the environment wanted by the citizens.
The call for a ban on exports and the problem of storage must be addressed on the basis of these criteria.
The relative cost - for such an investment in the future - is comparatively very low in the face of the exponential benefits it will generate.
The European Union, the European Parliament can and must stand at the vanguard of global efforts to withdraw mercury.
I hope that our decisions tomorrow will contribute towards this.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (SV) It is high time that we took this important decision concerning a ban on exports of metallic mercury.
There are probably not many people who are aware of this, but the EU is in actual fact the world's largest exporter of the substance.
More than 1 000 metric tons are exported each year from the EU to other countries. That is almost a third of the entire world trade in metallic mercury.
Mercury, which is dangerous, ends up almost exclusively in developing countries, where it causes a very great deal of harm.
I am pleased to adopt a position on a well thought-out report by my colleague, Mr Papadimoulis.
This report is not only about banning exports of metallic mercury.
It is also about obtaining safe storage of this dangerous substance, something that I think is very positive.
I am particularly pleased that Mr Papadimoulis has contributed a number of considerable improvements to the Commission's proposal.
These improvements include the following:
extension of this regulation to include products and mercury compounds,
extension of the ban to include imports,
entry into force of the ban on a date earlier than that desired by the Commission, that is to say 2010 instead of 2011,
setting up of a tracking system for the mercury trade in order to obtain increased monitoring of mercury,
support for developing countries as they convert to modern, mercury-free technology.
These changes are precisely in line with what I proposed as draftsman of the Committee on International Trade, and I am very grateful for them.
All that worries me is the demand by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for a split vote. A split vote would threaten to undermine important parts of this otherwise excellent report.
Stick, therefore, to the rapporteur's approach designed to safeguard the environment and public health and do not adopt the ALDE Group's market-based approach.
Tomorrow the EU shall, then, assume its responsibilities and stop dumping lethal mercury in developing countries.
It is really high time it did so.
With our changes and improvements, the EU will also assume its historic responsibility to support countries in the South as they change over from using mercury to using cleaner technologies.
This will safeguard the health of thousands of people and of our common environment.
That would be no bad thing.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (ES) Mr President, we had no difficulty in the Committee on Legal Affairs in dealing with the issue of the legal basis, because the aim of this measure is not the implementation of commercial policy - and Article 133 is not therefore applicable - but the protection of health - and Article 175 is therefore applicable.
The Committee on Legal Affairs has therefore proposed that the sole legal basis be Article 175, with all of the consequences of that from a procedural point of view.
Having said that, Mr President, as an MEP from a country that has very close historical links to mercury activities, I would like to point out that Mr Callanan's Amendment 40 on the storage of mercury is much more precise than the text that the Commission had proposed with regard to Article 3(1a).
Having proposed this legal basis, therefore, Mr President, I would also call for support for Mr Callanan's Amendment 40.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, as this House is well aware, this proposed regulation on the banning of exports and storage of metallic mercury is in line with the commitments contained in the Mercury Strategy which we passed in March 2006.
The PPE-DE Group supports the broad aims of the regulation.
Mercury must be disposed of and stored safely in order to protect human health and the environment.
Mercury cell technology is being gradually replaced by the environmentally superior and energy efficient membrane cell technology and this conversion is releasing surplus mercury across the European Union.
The aim of this regulation is to prevent this decommissioned mercury from entering the world market.
In my view the Commission's proposal is broadly acceptable and the most workable approach.
With regard to the date for the entry into force of the export ban, amendments have been tabled to bring that date forward.
We do not support those amendments.
The timing of the ban was debated at length prior to the Environmental Council in June 2005, and the 2011 date was agreed in the Council conclusions as contained in the Commission's proposal.
In my view, nothing has changed since the Council took that decision and I would not wish to have those very difficult decisions reopened.
This could only delay the introduction of the ban, especially if it encouraged the re-examination of whether an export ban is in fact the best way to achieve the EU's aims.
The date that has been chosen is the date that appears to gain the most support from a majority of Member States and of course, equally importantly, from the many other stakeholders involved.
That date has been set by the Commission with the agreement of the Spanish authorities and Minas de AlmadÃ©n in order to leave enough time to reorganise and restructure that company, and I think it deserves all of our support.
I am not in favour of the proposals to introduce a ban on the import of mercury and mercury compounds.
Given the quantities of mercury rising from the decommissioned chlor-alkali plants within the Community, there would appear to be absolutely no commercial incentive for imports and thus no necessity for including an import ban at this stage.
The market is quite capable of regulating itself.
Similarly, we are also not in favour of extending the scope of the export ban.
We accept the Commission's view that metallic mercury is by far the most relevant substance in terms of quantity, as compared to mercury compounds and products containing mercury, and that extending the export ban would be very premature at this stage.
Furthermore, companies would simply relocate and continue producing.
Is it really up to us to regulate what other countries in the world get up to?
I personally think not.
Both extensions to the Commission's proposal require deeper analysis of better regulation principles and the cost and impact of existing business.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for you, mercury is just a toxic metal which we need to get rid of and which you have only seen in thermometers when you have had a fever.
To me, mercury also brings to mind a place in my province, AlmadÃ©n, whose mines were one of the birthplaces of the workers' movement in Spain.
Mercury brings to mind thousands of men and women who lived from it for centuries, hundreds of names and faces, friends with whom I have worked as a Socialist Member of Parliament over the last 30 years, explaining to them, persuading them and supporting them with alternatives in order to overcome the paradox that human progress, which was getting rid of mercury, appeared to be heralding their disappearance.
These people have appreciated our efforts and just the other day confirmed their faith in us by voting for Socialist Party candidates in their local councils.
Today, thinking of those friends and re-stating my commitment to them, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their understanding, enshrined in the text approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and which we will improve tomorrow by means of certain amendments.
There are three favourable pieces of information which will be received in AlmadÃ©n with gratitude, interest and hope.
Firstly, it is recommended that specific Community economic compensation be granted for the socio-economic progress of AlmadÃ©n and its surrounding area.
Secondly, it is recommended that we prioritise the study of AlmadÃ©n as the location for the mercury store intended for the safe storage of all of the metal in existence in Europe.
Thirdly, given the existing experience and familiarity in AlmadÃ©n with treating mercury, common sense dictates that the store should be located where more than 80% of the European Union's mercury is already being stored in complete safety.
Someone from my region told me that taking mercury from AlmadÃ©n to anywhere else would be like taking the piano to the piano stool rather than taking the stool to the piano in order to play a concert.
Finally, we are grateful for the consistency of those people who propose that exporting and other operations with mercury should be able to be carried out - as we had stated in the Matsakis report - until 2010, and indicating the date of 1 December, thereby allowing mercury to be in circulation for rather longer.
I am sure that, with the resolution that we will approve tomorrow, Parliament will be in a good position to take on its codecision duties within the relevant negotiation with the Council.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to express my sincere congratulations to Mr Papadimoulis for his excellent report, and I wish to thank him for cooperating with the shadow rapporteurs.
In general terms, the rapporteur has sought to make the Commission's proposal somewhat more strict, rightly so in some aspects.
However, in two areas, such a position seems neither entirely wise nor realistic.
The first area relates to bringing the proposed deadline date forward to 2009.
In our view, this is impractical and unobtainable.
We feel that we should keep to the 1 January 2010 deadline, as we previously decided in the Mercury Strategy.
The second area is more controversial, that of the storage of metallic mercury.
In my view, the controversy arises largely because of the confusion as to what temporary and permanent storage really mean in practice.
The line I support is that if storage can be achieved in local salt mines or other approved suitable places, under strict conditions with complete monitoring and safety guarantees for thousands of years, then this is good enough for me.
There is no need to specifically stipulate in this piece of legislation the obligation to retrieve this mercury and transport it across Europe to a new, more permanent storage facility.
If the legislators of the future take into consideration any new technological advancements which make it safe for stored mercury to be treated in a particular way or moved to a new location, then I am sure this can and will be done whatever we put in this legislation now.
In conclusion, let us use common sense and keep things simple and in perspective.
Until recently, mercury was and, in many cases, still is in every household and in every doctor's and dentist's surgery, as well as in every hospital in the form of thermometers, barometers, sphygmomanometers, tooth fillings, etc. We need to get rid of mercury, but it is neither a highly contagious lethal virus nor a nerve gas compound which is deadly on near touch.
Therefore, in dealing with the amendments to this report, let us try not to exaggerate and not to go over the top with our demands.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Parliament and Council regulation on the banning of exports and the safe storage of mercury is a document that restricts the occurrence of mercury in the environment and its effect on people and animals.
Between 1990 and 2000, the countries of the European Union reduced global mercury emissions by 60%.
In the meantime, these emissions have risen by 20% across the world.
In the 1940s, my friends and I found some mercury and were pleased when the coins we dipped in it became a silvery colour.
Today, society's attitude towards mercury has changed dramatically, and the industrial sector is moving away from processes that use mercury due to its toxicity.
Although I find this draft regulation to be positive, I do have a few comments to make.
First of all, permanent storage facilities should be found for mercury waste as soon as possible, thus limiting temporary storage.
Secondly, the storage facilities should be as close as possible to avoid transporting mercury waste around Europe.
Thirdly, we cannot introduce new ways of using mercury waste without properly planning and testing them.
We should be aware that, in view of the dangers of mercury, the industrial sector itself is trying to move away from processes that involve mercury.
Amendments 11, 12, 15, 23-27 to the Commission's proposal are not justified.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Metallic mercury is a danger to public health and to the environment, and we now have 12 000 metric tons of mercury that have to be stored.
Perhaps that sounds a lot, but it is a volume that could easily fit into half of this Chamber.
It would therefore be odd if we were to send this mercury here, there and everywhere and store it in a host of different places and in stores that were unsafe.
That is why I am opposed to the attempt by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to get rid of mercury, because it would only be a temporary solution.
A permanent solution needs to be completely safe.
The only completely safe solution is to stabilise the mercury once and for all.
Mercury sulphide is almost completely insoluble, which means that it can be stored safely.
If it is not stabilised, we cannot have a whole lot of different, badly supervised stores.
I am therefore opposed to Amendment 40, because it would undermine safety at work.
It is important for us to agree on one and the same date: 1 January 2010, as stated in Amendment 43, proposed by my group.
This prohibits both imports and exports of all products containing mercury, so creating a holistic view of the matter.
Anything else would amount to the cynical export of mercury.
We know that the chlor-alkali industry must cease exports.
If it gets the chance to continue exporting one year after the ban enters into force, it will empty its stores of metallic mercury and be paid for doing so.
The mercury will then be used by gold-washers in the Amazon basin and destroy huge river areas by contaminating them with mercury.
It is important for the ban to be introduced on 1 January 2010.
Otherwise, we would undermine the whole idea of the export ban.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, mercury is considered a heavy metal, and is very dangerous in the food chain.
A number of other heavy metals, such as chrome, nickel, uranium and plutonium can also be classified in the same category.
It is true that not only heavy metals but also a number of lighter elements in the periodic table can, in large quantities, be harmful to health.
For example, beryllium is known to cause berylliosis.
Mercury is not just a metal that can cause serious harm after consumption in its metallic state, it is also an important substance in the field of technology.
In the past, electrolysis, dentistry and jewellery could not do without it.
The instrumental method of chemical analysis using mercury drop electrodes is well known, and in 1959, the Czech academic HeyrovskÃœ won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for this process, which he termed polarography.
One important issue revolves around the potential uses of mercury and its compounds in industry, although this must, of course, involve the highest environmental standards.
I am not sure whether storing mercury and its compounds in one place is the best solution.
The same goes for how long the transitional period should be before the regulation enters into force.
It is my impression that for some Member States the period laid down in Amendment 8 is too short.
This is why I have reservations about the proposal, although in most Member States mercury and its compounds, including stockpiles, are strictly monitored by the relevant state bodies.
I feel it is unacceptable to enshrine the role of unspecified NGOs in the regulation, regardless of any issues of tolerance and openness to the public, this does not belong in a regulation on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury.
The involvement of citizens in monitoring activities is covered in other areas of EU legislation.
I fail to understand why salt mines or the mines in AlmadÃ©n in Spain would be the best place to store mercury and its compounds.
It is obvious that the end of operations in any given mine leads to social problems for the miners.
In the Czech Republic and other Member States of Central and Eastern Europe, dozens of large mines have been shut down, without anyone drawing up EU regulations to deal with the massive unemployment that that has caused.
It strikes me that the bottom of mineral mines might be a better storage place than salt mines.
I strongly support the solution of addressing the issue of substances with less than 5% mercury content.
Furthermore, heavy metals in rocks throughout Europe are at normal levels, and in the course of weathering, they - including mercury - find their way into European water supplies.
This is why, for example, in the River Elbe concentrations of mercury and other heavy metals are always detected.
This is of course a natural occurrence.
There is also the issue of water from old mines, the extraction of mercury from old dumps and waste sludge, which is a potentially massive source of environmental pollution.
This regulation cannot, however, cover this issue, of course.
To conclude, I should like to thank all those who contributed to drawing up this regulation, a process that was conducted in a positive atmosphere of cooperation.
Mercury and its compounds have a future in science and technology, as this regulation shows, and that is why we support it.
(SK) First of all, allow me to thank the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, for highlighting in the report the need for banning exports of mercury, mercury compounds and mercury-containing products.
This is very important to us in the European Union, since the EU is one of the world's biggest mercury exporters.
Since this substance is extremely toxic, especially for children, we should take an interest in protection not only in connection with mercury production or use, but also during the storage or handling of mercury waste.
High mercury doses are lethal to humans; smaller amounts of mercury accumulated in the body may cause severe diseases of the immune, cardiovascular and reproductive systems.
Industry generates excessive quantities of mercury, for example, in the form of by-products in the chemical industry, in connection with the cleaning of natural gas, or in the extraction of non-ferrous metals and smelting in the metallurgical industry.
One should consider whether, by exporting surplus mercury to third, notably developing, countries, which are the main mercury consumers, we will indeed dispose of mercury.
Many developing countries lack funds to deploy modern environmentally friendly technologies, and their supervision is less stringent.
I agree with the rapporteur and support his stance that the European Union should not be using double standards - that is, a product which may not be used in the European Union should not be exported to countries which have no legislation on the use of mercury.
We should bear this in mind not only because of the need for environmental protection and nature conservation; we should also remember that this mercury might return in the form of residues in food or by way of polluted rivers, not to mention the risk of exposure for local workers and populations.
With regard to mercury and mercury-containing products, the European Union must ensure that mercury supplies are consistent with needs and demand.
Surplus mercury must be disposed of in an environmentally sustainable way in accordance with the Hazardous Waste Directive which we have adopted.
At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen monitoring and to penalise strictly any instances of non-compliance.
I agree with the rapporteur that manufacturers who produce mercury in the production process should be responsible for its safe storage or environmentally sustainable disposal.
This is also important in ensuring continued growth in the industry and encouraging transition to new alternative technologies that are not dependent on mercury.
As part of our aid to developing countries, we should put more emphasis on implementing such technologies where the environment has been devastated by this hazardous chemical.
(FI) Mr President, the regulation before us is part of a whole based on the Community's strategy concerning mercury.
EU environmental legislation has been brought up-to-date in line with that strategy this session.
I am satisfied that we have now reached a stage where our attitudes towards the export of mercury are being reviewed.
The EU is, after all, the world's biggest exporter of the substance.
It is undisputable that mercury and its many compounds are toxic to humans and environment, and the cost to society for public health and environmental damage is much higher than had previously been thought.
The bans under the regulation and the criteria for storage will also be a clear message to the world outside the EU.
We are taking responsibility for this damage.
Crucial to environmental legislation is the notion that the means selected are not only environmentally effective, but also socially sustainable.
Environmental considerations mean the export ban on mercury should take effect quickly, as Mr Papadimoulis rightly says.
We cannot, however, rush, in the light of other realities.
The danger is, actually, that a solution made over here creates a set of new problems over there.
The export ban in the Community should take effect at a time which is in harmony with other international measures on restrictions being sought.
As it may still take several years to reach international agreement, it seems right to support the Commission in the scheduling of the export ban.
The export of mercury, according to that, would be banned as from 1 July 2011.
This has had the support of virtually every Member State.
The same goes for the proposal to include mercury compounds in the export ban.
We can ask the Commission for a proposal to extend its scope, when we know enough about its wide-ranging effects. It is at present unnecessary to force a move.
Let us continue with the policy we have chosen and solve one problem at a time relating to mercury.
Mr President, mercury is not only a metal but also an ancient part of our culture and civilisation.
People have always admired it and believed in its magic powers.
For many centuries, mercury had a crucial role in alchemy and the secret sciences.
Mercury, the only liquid metal, is a beautiful material, and one can admire it as a unique piece of nature.
However, according to new information, mercury is also a dangerous material and we should protect ourselves and future generations against its toxic effects.
The workers in the traditional mercury mines, mostly in Spain, lead a hard and honest life but know that their former profession is over.
We should respect the miners' traditions, but the need for a ban must be understood.
The European Union has already banned the use of mercury and materials containing mercury on its territory.
Now we want to ban the export of mercury as well.
We do so because we also care about the health of other countries and continents.
Hopefully, our decision will encourage other countries to reduce their use of mercury as well.
As the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group, I had consultations with our Spanish colleagues in the spirit of solidarity.
Their understanding was crucial for me.
My other guideline was Parliament's resolution of March 2006.
Our decision should balance environmental concerns and the interests of the industry.
As far as the date of the ban is concerned, different proposals were tabled: 2011 by the Commission, 2009 by the rapporteur and 2008 by the NGOs.
I decided to suggest 1 December 2010 as an acceptable compromise, in accordance with Parliament's resolution of last year.
Other dates and deadlines should correspond with this basic date.
If we voluntarily ban the export of mercury, it is more than logical to ban its import as well.
As far as storage is concerned, there were different proposals: AlmadÃ©n by Spain, a salt mine by Germany and solidification by others.
As we have not yet settled on a solution, we should not support amendments excluding specific potential solutions.
We should support our Spanish Socialist colleagues' proposal calling for compensation for AlmadÃ©n, the largest European mercury mine.
The scope of the ban should cover every material with a mercury concentration of 5% or more.
We have to close loopholes, as it is very cheap to convert mercury into calomel.
It is very important to each of us to aid agreement by means of a simplified compromise package, otherwise we will run into chaos and, most probably, there will be no regulation before the next Parliamentary elections.
As shadow rapporteur, I worked for a compromise.
A good compromise serves our citizens better than postponed debates that do not lead to any kind of regulation.
(DE) Mr President, mercury must be banned comprehensively and quickly.
It is nothing short of cynical to take hazardous products out of circulation here but continue to permit their export to other countries.
We know that mercury spreads worldwide via water and air.
Ultimately, the mercury would also end up and harm people here.
It is nothing short of absurd for us to issue warnings, as the Commission has done, that pregnant women and children should eat no more than 100 grams of tuna per week since it is so contaminated with mercury.
We know - and a study published in The Lancet has demonstrated this once more - that heavy metals cause damage to the nervous system and also lasting, irreparable brain damage, particularly in children.
It must be our primary objective to enforce this export ban, therefore, as we would lose credibility in the eyes of the international community if we were to say: we want to protect ourselves, but exports are allowed.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mercury is everywhere: for example, it crosses the placental barrier.
Mercury is a metal that is liquid at room temperature and readily evaporates.
The limit value for metallic, inorganic mercury in blood is 25 micrograms, and that for organic mercury compounds is 100 micrograms.
I shall not go into the effects of mercury poisoning here.
I am sure you are all familiar with Minamoto in Japan.
The issue here is not only the economic pros and cons for our Community, therefore, but also the protection of the health of our fellow citizens and the protection of an intact environment.
The report by Mr Papadimoulis, whom I thank for this work, will mean that there is an end to the export of mercury compounds from Europe and that the EU starts work on the safe storage of the existing material.
At the same time, it makes sense for all mercury compounds to be covered by the export ban where a substitute is available, which is the case for almost all uses.
In addition, as far as we know, we as exporters of a hazardous substance are not able - and, pursuant to our WTO commitments, not entitled - to demand that the recipients make the mercury traceable, which means that the whereabouts of the mercury are unclear and that there is a very definite possibility that it could return to the Community.
I consider Article 175 of the common treaties applicable to this Regulation.
The tightening of the rules, the shortening of the deadlines and the inclusion of mercury compounds in the export and import provisions are both appropriate and toxicologically consistent.
I am sure there is still room for negotiation to reach agreement on the deadlines.
With regard to the final storage of mercury, attention is being paid to research, as it has not proved possible thus far to find a reliable storage method for this in use on an industrial scale anywhere in the world.
The quantities involved run into the thousands of tonnes.
I endorse the report in the original version presented by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
(SV) I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, for his excellent work.
Last autumn I took part in a study in which a sample of my hair was taken and investigated for its mercury content.
Amazingly enough, I in actual fact had a relatively high quantity of mercury in my body, a state of affairs that is extremely worrying.
I am pregnant and have high mercury levels which are now in danger of harming the child I am carrying and which may lead to the child having difficulty concentrating as an adult.
The high mercury levels are also worrying because I come from a country that has come a very long way when it comes to abolishing mercury.
We no longer use thermometers containing mercury, and amalgam is generally not used for repairing our teeth.
Nonetheless, I have high mercury levels in my body.
There are alternatives to mercury.
In view of the serious health effects of mercury, we could phase it out, and not only here in Europe but also globally.
This very evening, we are concerned with imposing an export ban and finding ways of storing used mercury safely, so ensuring that we do not contribute to spreading mercury around the world.
So that the export ban cannot be circumvented, my efforts have been directed at ensuring that it enters into force as quickly as possible and that it is extended to include other mercury products.
They have also been directed towards our not today committing ourselves irrevocably to any particular form of terminal storage, because we do not in actual fact know at present what is the optimum technology for terminal storage.
In the present situation, mercury should, then, be stored in safe but temporary stores.
I particularly hope that, in the future, it will be possible for all women throughout the world to eat fish from the water close to them, without being in danger of damaging their children's development.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, this is a battle that should have all of us rallying to the flag.
It is a matter of public health and even of public safety.
We know the dangers, the ravages of mercury on the health of those who come into contact with it.
Since the start of the industrial age, the problems have only worsened to assume alarming proportions.
Since Minamata and the chain of horrors emanating from that disastrous saga of industrial pollution, we have been even more clearly aware that mercury is dreadfully dangerous.
Nevertheless, we have carried on regardless, almost as if nothing had ever happened.
Throughout the intervening period, the God Mercury has continued to exact a heavy tribute from native populations in gold-washing areas, such as French Guyana, and the same applies to those on the other side of the globe who, in unimaginable conditions, recycle our industrial, electronic and other waste, not to mention the workers in Europe who operate in battery-recycling plants.
Yes, it is high time we got rid of this poison, and the only solution is a pure and simple ban here in Europe and throughout the rest of the world, because this poison is everywhere, even in the organs of polar bears, for example, which live where it is neither produced nor used.
I regret that my group's proposals for a more rapid prohibition were not adopted and that underground storage was not rejected.
Be that as it may, this is no longer the time for regrets but for securing the largest possible majority in support of a definitive ban on this dangerous metal.
(ES) Mr President, this proposal for a Regulation proposes banning exports of metallic mercury from 1 July 2011 at the latest, and in parallel includes provisions on the safe storage of the surpluses of mercury that are going to be produced above all as a result of the withdrawal of mercury cells from chlor-alkali factories; it is calculated that, throughout Europe, these cells contain approximately 12 000 tonnes of mercury.
Bringing forward the time limit for the ban on metallic mercury exports goes against the consensus achieved both by Parliament when we debated the Community strategy on mercury and by the agreement that the Commission has signed with Euro Chlor, the European Federation of Chlor-Alkali Producers.
The latter has accepted putting an end to mercury exports from 1 July 2011, and I believe that these agreements must be respected and under no circumstances must the date for banning mercury exports be brought forward.
The surpluses from the chlor-alkali industry must be stored, because that storage is necessary.
The resolution on the Community strategy on mercury, approved in March 2006, states that 'consideration should be given to the possibility of using AlmadÃ©n for the safe storage of the existing metallic mercury stocks or metallic mercury sub-produced by industry all over Europe but not mercury-containing articles that have become waste, thus making use of the infrastructures, local manpower and technological expertise existing there'.
I would also like to point out that the text of the Community strategy clearly acknowledges the historic importance of mercury to AlmadÃ©n and the need for it to be compensated for all of this.
I would like to end by saying that I am against the amendments that propose that only solid, rather than liquid, mercury should be stored.
Given the current state of research, we are not in a position to solidify mercury, and liquid mercury will therefore have to be stored.
Furthermore, it can be stored very safely, without creating any vapour, the vapour being the pollutant.
Mr President, let me now turn to some of the key amendments in detail.
Amendments 1, 7, 8, 9, 20, 21, 22 and 44 imply a significant extension of the scope of the proposal through the introduction of an export ban for cinnabar ore, calomel, mercury compounds and some mercury-containing products, as well as through the addition of an import ban.
The Commission considers these amendments to be either unnecessary or not sufficiently justified.
In the absence of mercury mining activities in the Community, there is no need for an export ban on cinnabar ore.
In a similar way, the Community has been a massive exporter of mercury, but not an importer.
The impact assessment concluded that secondary sources of mercury - recycling and recovery - will cover the remaining demand within the Community.
As mercury compounds and mercury-containing products are concerned, we would need a much more developed information base to justify such an extension.
For the time being, it is not possible to estimate in a reliable way the possible impact of such a measure on industry and society, within the Community as well as in third countries.
Using legislation to prevent a hypothetical problem would not be considered good practice in terms of better regulation.
Several amendments - numbers 12, 25, 27, 28, 29 and 45 - exclude the long-term storage or final disposal of metallic mercury, allowing for temporary storage only.
It is worth noting that no environmentally and economically sound solution for the stabilisation of mercury prior to its disposal exists at present.
Amendments 6, 24 and 36 imply that preference should be given to the former mining site of AlmadÃ©n for the storage of mercury.
The Commission is well aware of the economic and social implications of the mine closure and the end of trading activities on the site. It does not, however, want to prescribe a single storage site to economic operators.
Amendments 8, 10, 13, 30 and 32 increase the administrative burden for industry, as well as for Member States and the Commission.
The Commission has strong doubts about the potential effectiveness and benefits of these very detailed requirements as compared to their costs.
As regards the legal basis referred to in Amendment 2, the Commission proposal follows the line given by the European Court of Justice in its judgments in cases C-94/03 and C-178/03 concerning the Rotterdam Convention on prior informed consent for imports of chemicals.
Our proposal is very similar in character, as it proposes trade-related measures as an environmental policy instrument.
We cannot, therefore, support the amendment to the legal basis.
Amendments 17 and 34 calling for the introduction of an article on penalties are, however, acceptable to the Commission.
In summary, the Commission can support eight of the proposed 50 amendments fully, in part, or in principle.
I shall give Parliament's secretariat a list detailing the Commission's position on the amendments.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - It is clear that mercury is a substance that needs to be dealt with in a cautious and secure manner.
This report deals with the important broad issue of handling mercury in import, export and the storage of the substance, while giving a timeline for export and import bans.
I support the Commission's proposals for regulation on this issue and believe, broadly-speaking, that it is a good thing.
I would like to echo the Commission's comment that this report follows the Mercury Strategy which was passed in March of last year, and want to encourage the Commission in its ongoing work on the Mercury Strategy.
This is only one report of many that will deal with other issues such as the use of small amounts of mercury in the dental industry.
I am sure work on other strategic issues is ongoing.

Improving the method for consulting Parliament in procedures relating to enlargement of the euro area - Adoption by Cyprus of the single currency on 1 January 2008 - Adoption by Malta of the single currency on 1 January 2008 (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the Council and Commission statements on improving the method for consulting Parliament in procedures relating to enlargement of the euro area,
the report by Werner Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision in accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Cyprus of the single currency on 1 January 2008 - C6-0151/2007 -, and
the report by Werner Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision in accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Malta of the single currency on 1 January 2008 - C6-0150/2007 -.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we begin this debate, which is about procedural issues, we should firstly not forget the pleasing conclusions of the Convergence Reports published by the Commission and the European Central Bank on Cyprus and Malta.
The Presidency is delighted that the Commission was able to establish that Cyprus and Malta have reached a high level of durable convergence and that, on this basis, it has been able to table proposals for the euro to be introduced in these two countries.
At the meeting of the Economic and Financial Council on 5 June 2007, ministers endorsed the Commission's assessment that Cyprus and Malta meet the conditions for the euro to be introduced.
The Presidency would therefore be very glad if Cyprus and Malta's success were not overshadowed by procedural issues and if the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council could reach an amicable solution.
It is in all of our interests to avoid delaying or creating any uncertainty about the technical and legal preparations that Cyprus and Malta need to make for the introduction of the euro.
I should particularly like to thank the European Parliament for its willingness to cooperate.
The Presidency has sympathy for the European Parliament's concerns and understands why it wants to have more time to examine the Convergence Reports and the Commission's proposals for Council decisions on the introduction of the euro.
However, the Council and the Presidency are bound by the procedure laid down in the EC Treaty.
The timetable is essentially determined by the rules laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact, including the Maastricht reporting regulation.
The Council's obligation to consult the European Parliament on proposals for the euro to be introduced in Member States is laid down in Article 122(2) of the EC Treaty.
The Presidency believes that the Council has respected this provision of the EC Treaty in the cases of Cyprus and Malta.
The Council received both Commission proposals for Council decisions on 21 and 22 May 2007, each in three language versions.
The remaining language versions were transmitted to the Council in the course of the subsequent two weeks.
On 25 May the Council consulted the European Parliament on the two Commission proposals.
In its request for consultation, the Council referred to the fact that it would be helpful if the European Parliament could adopt its opinions on the Commission proposals at its plenary session from 18 to 21 June.
These opinions could then be made available to the Council, meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government, on 21 June 2007.
Although it is not a legal requirement, the Presidency would be pleased if the discussion of the Heads of State or Government could also take into account the European Parliament's position.
In any case, the Council cannot adopt its two decisions on the introduction of the euro until the European Parliament's opinions have been provided.
In principle, the Presidency supports the proposals made by President Barroso in his letter of 13 June 2007 in response to President PÃ¶ttering's letter.
The Presidency believes - as the Council President, Mrs Angela Merkel, explained in a letter to the President of the European Parliament on 19 June - that this matter primarily concerns the Commission and the European Parliament.
Member of the Commission. (ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking this Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the speed with which they have examined the convergence reports on Cyprus and Malta approved on 16 May by the European Commission and by the European Central Bank.
Tomorrow in Brussels, the European Council will debate the enlargement of the euro zone to these two countries and we all trust that on 10 July, following the positive agreement of the European Council tomorrow, Ecofin will take the final legal decision to enlarge the euro zone to these two countries.
Both this Parliament and the Ecofin Council of 5 June agree with the analysis of the Commission and the Central Bank with regard to Cyprus and Malta's compliance with the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty.
At the meeting held with the coordinators of Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 7 June, I had the opportunity to explain to you that we in the Commission have been provided with full and reliable information on these two countries for the purposes of drawing up the convergence reports.
There is confusion in certain documents accompanying the draft resolution between data relating to the quarterly financial accounts and the data that is notified twice a year by the countries under the excessive deficit procedure, data relating to deficit and to debt.
I must say once again to this plenary of Parliament that, with regard to the information necessary in order to take decisions on excessive deficit procedures, the Commission has no reservations in terms of the quality of the data provided by Malta and Cyprus.
No reservations of any kind.
With regard to Malta, the Commission issued an opinion on the criterion on the sustainability of public finances, conditional upon the Ecofin Council's approval of the abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure which had been opened up for this country in 2004 and the Ecofin of 5 June has confirmed this point, bringing an end to the excessive deficit procedure with regard to Malta.
There are also precedents with regard to an approval in the convergence report conditional upon fulfilling conditions, either in terms of the stability of the exchange rate or the declaration of excessive deficit.
With regard to Malta's compliance with this criterion, therefore, there is no kind of particular situation or exception.
The general procedure applied has been the one applied in many other previous cases to many other countries.
Over the coming weeks and once the Council's positive decision has been confirmed with regard to the enlargement of the euro zone to Cyprus and Malta, the Commission will issue the two reports on each country's state of preparedness for joining the euro.
I am also aware of certain honourable Members' concerns in this regard.
That report on the degree of preparedness for the change of notes and coins is not the same as the convergence reports.
It is not a convergence criterion and the Commission regularly publishes, as we will do over the coming weeks, reports and communications focussing on this issue.
Under these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, we are able to predict that on 1 January 2008 the euro zone will have fifteen Member States with the accession of Cyprus and Malta.
This is an extremely positive step for those two countries, for the euro zone and for the whole of the European Union.
The euro is undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements of European integration and the greater the number of citizens enjoying its advantages, the more the Union's capacity to offer all of its citizens greater guarantees of prosperity and social wellbeing will be recognised.
Ladies and gentlemen, with this debate on Cyprus and Malta's request to join the euro zone, this is the fourth time that the European institutions have given their opinion on the membership of the zone.
The first of them took place in 1998 and it was aimed at identifying which countries would initially make up the euro zone on 1 January 1999.
On that occasion it was decided that eleven Member States would join the zone.
Two years later, in 2000, Greece's request was analysed and it was agreed that Greece could join the euro zone from 1 January 2001.
Last year, all of the European institutions debated and agreed that Slovenia would join the euro zone on 1 January 2007.
Finally, we have this request from Cyprus and Malta, which I hope will be definitively approved by the European Council and Ecofin on 10 July.
In no way can it be said, therefore, that the euro zone is a closed club, as has sometimes been claimed.
It is a club that is entirely open to all members that wish to join it and which are prepared and fulfil the conditions for reaching that stage.
Following these four procedures for setting up and enlarging the euro zone, from next year it will have fifteen Member States, another two have an opt-out clause (the United Kingdom and Denmark) and a further ten Member States do not yet belong to the zone and I hope that they will join over the next few years.
Without making any prediction as to when all of the conditions for joining the euro zone may be met, I believe that over the next few years, practically every year we European institutions are going to have to give our opinion on new memberships of the zone in accordance with the Treaty, which declares the euro the official currency of the Member States of the Union.
In Articles 121 and 122 the Treaty also stipulates which criteria determine whether a Member State meets the conditions for adopting the single currency and establishes the procedure to be followed by the European institutions.
With regard to the motion for a resolution that the honourable Members have prepared on these procedures for consulting Parliament with a view to the enlargement of the zone, I would like to refer to this aspect in the second part of my speech.
According to the Treaty, the procedure must involve five actors: the Commission, the European Central Bank, Parliament, the European Council and the Ecofin Council.
However, the Treaty does not contain any specific provision regarding the time limits for each of the institutions to issue their opinion.
On the four occasions on which we have given our opinion, a similar timetable has been followed: firstly, the request for entry into the zone by the Member State or States, which is usually presented at the beginning of the year prior to the year in which they wish to join the euro zone; secondly, the Commission and the European Central Bank's assessment of whether or not the conditions are met, which is carried out in spring; thirdly, the Council's definitive decision, which takes account of the opinion of Parliament and the debate in the European Council, which normally takes place in the middle of the year prior to the introduction; and finally the adoption of the euro by the Member State or States on 1 January of the following year.
There are a series of determining factors in these steps, and I would like to refer to them because they affect all of the institutions.
Firstly, why is the euro introduced on 1 January?
In view of the enormous legal, economic, fiscal, accounting and practical implications of changing currency it would be extremely unwise to consider a date other than 1 January to adopt the euro and I believe that there is general agreement amongst everybody on that.
Secondly, the Member State should be allowed a period of time to carry out the preparations for joining the euro in an orderly and effective manner and, on the basis of our experience of previous enlargements, we can state that, in the interest of the citizens of the country in question, who would suffer most from the consequences of a badly-prepared adoption of the euro, it is desirable for the process of decision-making by the European institutions to be completed several months in advance of the 1 January on which notes and coins are introduced and the irrevocable exchange rate in the country joining the euro takes effect.
These are the determining factors in practice and neither of them are in the hands of the Commission, of course.
What does fall to the Commission, however, in cooperation with the European Central Bank, is the adoption of the convergence report on whether or not the criteria have been fulfilled.
The date on which the Commission must adopt the convergence report is determined, firstly, by when the Member State presents its request - the Commission cannot decide when a Member State is to present that request - and, secondly, by when the Commission has the reliable and rigorous data that it needs in order to carry out an appropriate, rigorous and accurate assessment of whether or not the convergence criteria have been fulfilled.
The date of the Commission's convergence report therefore depends, on the one hand, on when the Member State presents the request and, on the other, on when the Commission can be provided with the appropriate, rigorous and accurate data required in order to carry out the assessment.
In 1998 and 2000, the Commission generally adopted the convergence reports at the beginning of May.
In 2006 and 2007, the approval took place in the middle of May because, since 2005, the time limit for the Member States to communicate the data on their budgetary situation has been put back by a month, from 1 March to 1 April.
This has been done in order to acquire accurate and rigorous information on the budgetary execution for the previous year of the Member State applying to join the euro zone.
Experience indicated that the notifications of 1 March did not include all of the accurate data required in order to provide a sufficient picture of how the previous budgetary year had been concluded.
Under these circumstances, if we bear in mind that Cyprus and Malta fulfilled the exchange rate stability criterion on 2 May of this year, the Commission has had two weeks, as happened last year in the case of Slovenia, to draw up and adopt the convergence reports.
The point I wish to make through this perhaps overly detailed explanation, is that all of the institutions have tight deadlines within which to take decisions in this procedure.
The time limit available to Parliament is determined, on the one hand, by the approval of the convergence report by the Commission and the Central Bank, but also, on the other, by the dates decided upon by the Council for its decision-making procedure, both in the European Council and in the meeting of the Ecofin Council, and that is clearly not in the hands of the Commission.
In any event, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has written a letter to President Poettering indicating that the Commission is willing to explore ways for each institution to be able to exercise the competences assigned to it by the Treaty in the best possible way within this procedure, and the Commission and I personally would like to say to you once again, in response to this Parliament's motion for a resolution, that we are willing to seek an agreement amongst the three institutions on a procedure that will improve the way in which we work, in view of the objective limitations we face when making decisions in this area.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is perfectly aware, and all of you should be aware, that the Commission and myself are of course entirely at your service when it comes to providing any information available before these time periods elapse - with regard to the economic situation of the candidate countries and the degree of compliance with the convergence criteria - even before the Member States present their requests.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Minister of State, Commissioner, before I turn to Malta, Cyprus and the procedure, I should like with your permission to make a few preliminary remarks about the euro.
There is no doubt that the euro is a very successful project.
It is stable internally and externally.
We should not forget this in today's debate.
Internally, we have low inflation rates; externally, the euro has become the second most important currency in the world and is very stable against the dollar.
None of this has happened by accident.
It is the result of a construction in which the Member States and the Commission bear the main responsibility: the Maastricht criteria in the Stability and Growth Pact - which has of course already been watered down under Commissioner Almunia's leadership - the deficit procedure, the clear statistical data and the independence of the European Central Bank.
Only if all of these factors coincide will the euro remain a stable currency in the long term.
I am saying this as a preliminary remark, because I still need to address the procedure.
Of course the Treaty is clear, but the Treaty also states that the European Parliament has to be listened to.
Commissioner, I will be quite frank: we will not allow our role to be reduced to that of an optional extra!
The Commission - so I have just heard - has done everything to the letter, and Parliament has to create its own window.
If that is the case - and that is what we say in the motion - then, should an interinstitutional agreement not be concluded containing the points that we will subsequently be adopting by a large majority, next time we will break off our consultations, as we also do for agriculture policy.
We will not adopt these opinions as quickly as we have been asked to do so now for the third time.
Let me make it quite clear: Parliament will not be treated as an optional extra, not by anyone!
I will now turn to Cyprus and Malta.
I am glad that we can support an enlargement from 13 to 15 participating countries.
In February, Malta and Cyprus requested a Convergence Report pursuant to Article 121 with the aim of obtaining membership.
Examination of the data available - the Commissioner has described the undeniable problems in this respect - tells us the following: Cyprus has participated in ERM II for a long time; as of 5 May it meets the requirements in respect of long-term interest rates; per-capita GDP is good, at 85% of the EU average, and its economy shows substantial convergence.
Nevertheless, it had a problem with the data, and specifically with the quarterly financial accounts.
This was also discussed on 3 May.
We should also examine the clarity of the data from the point of view of the Commission's responsibility.
It is not enough for the Commission to say that we are dependent on the data and that the Member States have to supply it.
The Commission is also responsible for these data being correct.
We saw this in the case of Greece, where the Commission did not carry out a sufficiently thorough examination and six months' later we had a nasty surprise.
Cyprus meets the conditions and Cyprus - and it had been criticised on this score - has also brought its Central Bank law into line, although it only did so some time after requesting the Convergence Report, namely on 15 March, that is over a month later.
However, the law has now been amended, inflation is low, and although government debt is still over 60% it is heading in the right direction.
We can therefore say today that we unreservedly support Cyprus's accession to the euro zone. I am sure that the European Parliament will do so.
In Malta's case the picture is similar, but with one exception.
We support Malta's accession.
On Monday, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted in favour of the accession of both States by a large majority, almost unanimously - for Malta with 39 votes in favour and for Cyprus with 38 votes in favour and one abstention.
With Malta, however, we had the problem that at the time that the Convergence Report was tabled the deficit procedure had not yet been closed.
The Commission therefore tabled a Convergence Report that did not comply with Article 2 of the Protocol on the Convergence Criteria.
This states that at the time of the examination the deficit procedure must be closed.
That is a fact.
We accepted the report nonetheless, but the Commission should not say here that it has done everything to the letter and that it is just this interfering Parliament that is disrupting its consultations with the Council.
Turning finally to our motion for a resolution, we have received the reports and letters from the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and Angela Merkel.
Mrs Merkel has a difficult procedure to complete, as she has to listen to all 26 other Member States.
Mr Barroso only needs one Commission decision.
I agree that we should take a decision, despite the fact that many of our requests have not been met, but that is why we are now calling for an interinstitutional agreement.
In this agreement, which should be adopted by the end of 2007, we call on the Council and the Commission to be more accommodating on the timing.
Otherwise next time round - and it will probably be Slovakia - we will insist on our right to a period of at least two months for consultation.
Next time we will not tolerate the schedule that we have gone along with now for the third time.
With this in mind we welcome the fact that Cyprus and Malta can become Members, but we demand reasonable consultation conditions from the Commission and the Council for the European Parliament.
on behalf of PPE-DE. - (MT) Mr President, I cannot begin without first expressing my appreciation towards the Maltese and Gozitan population for the great strides they have managed to take in these three years since Malta became a member of the European Union.
These were three difficult years that presented numerous challenges.
In these three years the Maltese have shown themselves capable of adjusting to the future.
It has been an extremely interesting time for my country, and I can say outright that the results have begun to show.
The introduction of the euro this January confirms this.
Malta has clearly shown itself capable of fulfilling all the necessary criteria so as to ensure that this important transition occurs smoothly.
This transition will strengthen the country's economy and, in turn, competitiveness.
Change is never easy.
However, I believe that Malta is fully prepared to face up to this new challenge in January.
We must keep in mind that Malta was given a restricted time period in which to conform to, and adopt, the measures required for this changeover to take place.
In less than three years, Malta has reduced its inflation rate to 2.2%, and the ratio of national debt compared to the Gross Domestic Product is decreasing towards the reference rate of 60%.
There has been a sustainable reduction in the budget deficit, which now stands at less than 3%, and one must also consider the fact that, as from Malta's entry into the ERM2 programme, the Maltese lira did not undergo any devaluation and at no point was there ever an air of uncertainty in the country.
As Commissioner Almunia said, Malta has achieved a high level of sustainability and convergence.
Malta and the Maltese are used to facing and overcoming their challenges, challenges that, in the past, were far from small and that nonetheless led to a string of successes throughout history.
This is an historical moment for the European Union because it will lead to a larger eurozone, one that incorporates more countries and more people.
It is also an historical moment for Malta because it will contribute to the further integration of its citizens with the European Union.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work in this area, which proved to be very useful.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that I welcome the fact that, on 1 January 2008, the eurozone will have two new members, namely Cyprus and Malta.
Both countries have fulfilled the convergence criteria stipulated in the Treaty.
I would like to warmly congratulate our Cypriot and Maltese colleagues.
Expanding the eurozone is an important process which fosters deeper integration in the European Union.
This process also has a positive effect on candidate countries and the eurozone's economic position.
Countries preparing to join the eurozone are developing at a much faster rate than those in the zone.
Their macroeconomic situation is also better, especially in terms of public debt and budget deficits.
The new members will strengthen the whole zone and the single currency.
At the same time, I would also like to state that I do not welcome the fact that a great deal of time pressure is being placed on Parliament in its work to assess these new countries' eurozone membership.
Our current work schedule does not allow Parliament to properly prepare an opinion.
This is why the resolution which I hope we will adopt today, aims to initiate a debate on an interinstitutional agreement which will, in the future, facilitate the efficient and effective analysis of convergence reports.
I welcome the open and constructive position that President Barroso and Commissioner Almunia have just declared, on behalf of the Commission.
Minister Gloser, I hope that the Council's position will also be constructive.
I am counting on the creation of an efficient mechanism for a problem-free expansion of the eurozone in the future.
In the debate on the expansion of the eurozone, it should be stressed that certain compulsory Maastricht convergence criteria do not apply to the current situation.
This is particularly the case for inflation.
First of all, it does not seem appropriate for the eurozone membership criteria to be defined according to the average inflation rate in countries which do not belong to the eurozone.
