We should not be under any illusions, particularly when it comes to the role which the European Union could play in the Middle-East peace process.
I regret that both reports run the risk of not being taken seriously due to unrealistic goals.
Indeed, the European Union could very well be of significance, especially in the economic sense, but also when it comes to the problem of refugees.
We should only concern ourselves with matters where the European Union can provide added value and can really be of significance.
Being modest as to in our abilities will enhance the quality of the European Union' s external relations.
Mr President, as the representative of a country that once had direct access to the Mediterranean, I would like to convey my express support for fostering better relations between the EU and the Mediterranean region, and accordingly, for this report.
It is not just a political, but also a historical commitment we must make.
Needless to say, the EU' s activities with regard to securing peace in the Mediterranean, especially in relation to the centre of conflict in the Middle East, constitute a special responsibility, which, sadly, the representatives and members of the European Union, and particularly their foreign policy representatives, have been unequal to in the past.
However, the pursuit of an autonomous and active European peace policy must remain one of the EU' s goals.
That said, there are also other reasons besides the security aspects, as to why it is important for the EU to play a more active role in the Mediterranean region.
The EU cannot, nor should it, spare any expense in the social and cultural spheres, in supporting democratic developments, in intervening in the event of human rights violations, in promoting economic development, and in improving dialogue and cooperation in as many areas as possible, if it wants to see discernible progress.
If we are to avoid all these proposals, as detailed in the report, remaining no more than declarations of intent, we will need to work on the list of priorities, which has also been called for in this House, and which sets out in precise terms the order in which these intentions are to be carried out and the financing thereof.
Incidentally, my tone was not one of regret when I mentioned our former access to the Mediterranean.
Mr President, as we can deduce from the speeches by the rapporteurs, and at this stage it is hardly necessary to repeat it, the Mediterranean region must be one of the European Union' s highest priorities, because the problems of the southern Mediterranean - the political upheavals, the economic stagnation, the population growth - affect us, directly or indirectly, as Europeans.
Examples of this are the migration flows in our direction, the deterioration of our environment and the dangers presented to our society by radical fundamentalism.
In summary, balance on our southern border is essential to our stability.
It is therefore important that we share the view that the Union' s natural desire for enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe must not lead to a deterioration of its policy towards the Mediterranean.
Therefore, while in 1995 my group supported and strongly promoted the open process in Barcelona which, at last, after almost 40 years, drew up a global strategy for the Community countries in relation to the Mediterranean countries, it now supports the objective contained in the reports which we are debating today to strengthen the Barcelona Process.
In particular, in relation to Mr NaÃ¯r' s report, we have tried to improve it in committee by means of various contributions and I would like to thank the rapporteur for being receptive towards them.
We have insisted on the importance of strengthening interparliamentary dialogue, which must be consolidated as one of the key elements in boosting the Barcelona Process.
We would like to point out that we should promote the liberalisation of the economic systems of our Mediterranean partners and carry out the structural changes necessary to compete in more open markets.
We have proposed the creation of a monitoring centre for migration flows, responsible amongst other things for creating mechanisms to combat, in a coordinated fashion, the mafias which profit from illegal immigration.
We would like to point out that relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries are based on a global strategy, one of the elements of which is undoubtedly fishing, and therefore we trust that the Moroccan Government will adopt an attitude which reflects the current urgency in the negotiations which are taking place.
Finally we would like to point out to the Commission that, within the framework of the reforms taking place in its external service, the human resources dedicated to the Mediterranean association need to be reinforced, a specific structure needs to be established in the Commission, and progress needs to be made on the devolution and decentralisation of aid.
In summary, my group is in favour of the European Union playing a broader role in the Mediterranean and we hope that human and material resources are provided that are a match for the challenges facing us.
Mr President, the idea that the Mediterranean is the number one priority of European Union external policy stems from the conviction that, although the Mediterranean is no longer the centre of the world, each and every one of the great contradictions and challenges of the twenty-first century are concentrated there.
The Mediterranean provides a dramatic example of the issue of war and peace.
The issue of North-South relations is spectacularly alive in the Mediterranean.
The very fashionable issue of the clash of cultures or dialogue between cultures is symbolised by the Mediterranean.
The emergence of xenophobia and racism, or tolerance and multiculturalism, is most intensely illustrated in the Mediterranean.
The question of democracy and human rights or authoritarianism is alive in the Mediterranean and will continue to be so in the coming years.
The issue of regional responses to the challenges of globalisation is being raised in the Mediterranean.
The issue of women' s emancipation or repression is also at its most intense in the Mediterranean region.
There is no need to insist therefore that this is our fundamental priority, because the prospects for its future remain completely open, while enlargement will take time, it will have its costs and its problems, but the only reasonable outcome that anyone can imagine is that it will eventually take place.
In the Mediterranean, a 'sandbelt' or a 'slumbelt' may be created in the twenty-first century, and both issues are dramatically highlighted.
The two contributions presented here today, in the European Parliament, are contributions to the relaunch of the Euro-Mediterranean policy.
I believe that Mr Patten and Mr Solana would do very well to read these reports, and in particular, the report by my friend and teacher, Sami NaÃ¯r, because it makes a very coherent and well put together list of themes, which calls for a political proposal.
This policy was well defined in Barcelona five years ago but today it needs not only a new expression of will but also the ability to implement initiatives.
We must achieve - above all in the Mediterranean, and we Mediterraneans know this - something very important: things need to be explained.
Nevertheless, if anything is lacking today, it is symbolic specific action, a strong signal that the Union, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, are truly interested in this relaunch, which goes beyond words and speeches.
In this regard, I would like to draw attention to an aspect of Sami NaÃ¯r' s report: the need to create strong initiatives in the fields of South-South trade and for subregional integration or integration in the southern Mediterranean region.
We need something strong. I do not know exactly what it may be, but it must truly win over public opinion in the South so that people can see that the European Union clearly has, as well as a well drawn-up policy, the will to create banking and financial instruments, railways that lead to subregional integration in the South or networks of roads and motorways.
This message must make a genuine contribution to this renewal of the will for integration which, above all in the Maghreb, is a cause for hope at the moment and which must count on an ambitious and also generous contribution from the Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly endorse the line taken by Mrs Muscardini and Mr NaÃ¯r's reports, and their content, but there is a need to focus on certain factors which are not dealt with.
It is important to start from this consideration: the European Union's strategy for the Mediterranean, developed at Feira, in addition to failing to provide practical recommendations, does not take into account certain developments which have taken place in recent years in the Mediterranean Basin. After centuries of struggling and marginalisation it has resumed a key position in world trade again, which, after the discovery of America, had been dominated by the Atlantic routes.
Thanks also to the new production boost in Asia, Europe now trades more with Asia than with America.
For these trade routes between America and Asia, the Mediterranean provides a valuable centre for unloading goods for northern Europe, which means that carriers do not have to make detours.
This is thus a new development which the European Union cannot ignore and which has already yielded the first, astonishing results.
And it is towards this integrated, well-structured system that we must endeavour to direct our funds, a system which is already equipped with transport intermodality in the form of aircraft, railways and motorways.
Without this practical step, the funds will frequently not be exploited, as is the case at present.
Mr President, I believe that the great merit of these reports is that they tone down the optimism of the Commission' s communication regarding what it calls the progress made since Barcelona, and that they open the way to ambitious and fairer paths for the partnership to take.
What were the objectives of that partnership? They are, once again, the creation of an area of peace, the improvement of mutual understanding amongst the peoples of the region and the creation of an area of shared prosperity.
The first two goals have not been achieved, as Mr NaÃ¯r has said.
Unfortunately, this is true.
We have not created an area of shared prosperity either, only the very beginnings of a free-trade area involving some of the countries, established on European terms, because the main beneficiaries of these are the industrial products in which we have a competitive advantage.
I am continually surprised, moreover, that those who are the quickest to call for an extension of a free-trade area, imposing the liberal model on terms that are extremely unfavourable for the countries of the South, are also the first to speak of interference, even neo-colonialism, with regard to human rights issues.
In Barcelona, the vital contribution of civil society to the development of partnerships was recognised for the first time in a text to which the European Union and 15 countries of the southern Mediterranean subscribed.
We must admit that we have failed spectacularly on this issue.
We have been unable to support the dynamic efforts of citizens and democratic projects, in the face of the hard line adopted by most governments, but is this from lack of any real will to do so?
How can we use the association agreements and the MEDA programme to support them? What sort of effective strategy and what set of relevant measures can we create in order to avoid this schizoid situation where what we say and what we do are two quite different things?
Do we really wish to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process, or would we rather condemn ourselves to the Europe of the Fifteen' s continuing to pursue relations in the same traditional mould as some self-styled 'realistic' states?
Mr President, the European Union's policy towards the countries of the Mediterranean is a far cry from the Barcelona Process and an even farther cry from the real needs of the people in these countries.
As Mr NaÃ¯r rightly said, the European Union only appears to be interested in the Mediterranean for reasons of security and only intervenes economically in order to gain a foothold on the markets in the southern countries.
The new common strategy goes even further in the same direction; it even tries to involve the Mediterranean countries in the aggressive CFSP.
Euro-Mediterranean collaboration is the main vehicle for interference in the internal affairs of the Mediterranean countries, and, ostensibly, all this is being done in the name of common prosperity, democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
At the same time, the European Union remains resolutely indifferent to the tragedy of the Palestinian people and the murder of Palestinians by the state of Israel on a daily basis.
The Communist Party of Greece defends collaboration between people on equal terms and without one country's interfering in the internal affairs of another.
In particular, we would point out that it is the developed capitalist countries which are responsible for the current state of the underdeveloped countries. That is yet another reason why the developed countries are duty bound to help these countries develop their productive base and raise the standard of living of their inhabitants.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly greatly welcomed Mr NaÃ¯r's report, which does not contain any fabrication but gives an unbiased description of a problem which needs to be resolved, first and foremost at political level, and also Mrs Muscardini's report, which is in-depth and gives just as true a picture.
It is, of course, no longer necessary to remind the House of the role, the function and the importance of the Mediterranean in the very origins of European culture and the way that it is both the cradle and the vehicle of our civilisation.
However, we cannot ignore the fact that, thus far, our joint action in this major geographical area has not been effective and has certainly not been exhaustive.
Poorly managed programmes, maladministration, even a certain lack of clear thinking and political timeliness have prevented us from making what is - I am sure - the will of our institutions a practical reality, that is from achieving the three objectives focused on at Barcelona: an area of peace and stability, an area of shared prosperity through free trade and greater understanding between peoples.
As a Member of the Committee on Budgets, I can only hope that the Commission will be willing to change the way it runs the MEDA programme and the very structure of the programme, in the manner indicated by Mr Bourlanges, that is, basing its approach on radical streamlining of the cycle of procedures, greater recourse to macrofinancial support, and less complex commitology.
The Commission, which is already presenting the initial draft budget, also needs to endeavour to be more transparent by producing an annual document highlighting the expenditure commitments which can be made for each country.
This is an area we must tackle if we genuinely want to implement our policy.
Mr President, the Barcelona Process is a splendid idea, only strictly speaking it is 2000 years overdue.
A system based on partnership with the same rights and obligations is supposed to emerge from a colonial and a post-colonial system.
Seen from a historical perspective, the ruling structures were always constructed in such a way as to produce a North-South divide, and now it is only right that Europe, whose countries - or rather, certain European States from within this system - were almost always the beneficiaries, should also take responsibility for rapprochement and parity, and should promote these aspects too.
The goal of the Barcelona Process is undisputed.
Its success depends not only on formal negotiated outcomes, but also on the extent to which we are able to dispel the prejudices we ourselves harbour towards the Mediterranean States and their inhabitants.
There can be no doubt that the realisation of the Barcelona objectives will prove decisive to a peace strategy of the twenty-first century.
Equally, it is important to ensure that no Mediterranean country is excluded.
Libya, the country that lies almost exactly at the heart of the Mediterranean States, goes unmentioned in the Barcelona paper.
The process of rapprochement will not work unless the EU endeavours to invite Libya to take part in it.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are all familiar with the catalogue of problems affecting the Euro-Mediterranean region and their causes: they are basically the same as in 1995 when the Barcelona Process was launched.
They have already been mentioned in the debate: from illegal immigration to droughts, from external debt to the failure to respect human rights, and terrorism, which ruthlessly destroys the lives of innocent human beings and families, as we are seeing in Spain, in Algeria and in the Middle East itself.
Today more than ever we must make the statement that only cooperation, dialogue, economic and cultural exchanges, solidarity and mutual understanding can turn the two sides of the Mediterranean into a prosperous and peaceful area.
Neither the European Union nor the Maghreb or Mashreq countries can afford not to take advantage of the human and cultural resources that enrich the region.
The problem is that we are not doing that properly.
The association agreements are dead letters in many respects.
The financial instruments are not being used as they should and the political, economic and social development of those countries is not keeping up with the pace of horizontal cooperation, which is very necessary, nor with the modernity required today by a world which, technologically speaking, is taking giant steps forward.
It is time to move from contemplation to action, to demand performance and effectiveness in the efforts to implement the strategy which has been drawn up and, in this respect, I would like to emphasise the demand for human resources to be strengthened, as indicated by Mr Galeote.
Mr President, today we are debating two reports which are political reports par excellence and with which I fully concur.
That being the case, instead of elaborating on these two reports, I should like to say a few words to corroborate the arguments behind them.
A few months ago, we had a entire debate because the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, said that European history dates from the time of Charlemagne.
The very name Europe which, as Europeans, we all bear, derives from the name Europa, the daughter of Libya and Poseidon, the God of the Sea.
Europa was Zeus's wife, the mother of Minos, Sarpedon and Radamanthe.
Why am I telling you all this?
Because mythology itself, which is a narrative record of history, highlights the relations which exist between Europe and North Africa.
The Mediterranean is, to all intents and purposes, the only European sea, and as long as we, in our plans and policies, look down on the other side of the Mediterranean from on high, then we shall get nowhere.
We need to get a few things straight.
If, in the twenty-first century, we try and base policies on the attempt by certain European countries to find traces of the recent colonialism to lean on then, politically, Europe will get nowhere.
We must realise that the starting point for today's debate, based on the two reports, based on the decisions taken in Barcelona, is to see the other side of the Mediterranean as part of Europe.
The European Union itself must take initiatives - development, cultural and, most importantly, peace initiatives - so that the two sides of Europe can stand opposite each other without our again hearing echoes of "Hannibal ante portas" or "Delenda est Carthago" or a modern version of Scipio.
There are Europeans on the other side of the Mediterranean and we would do well to remember that.
Mr President, the Barcelona Process was not lacking in good intentions or financial resources.
Despite this, the outcome was meagre, which is very disappointing.
There was too much gesture politics going on and too little capacity to carry out the plans.
Three quarters of the committed funding never left the kitty.
Instead of a reduction in the means, this will now lead to an increase, which is a little bizarre, to say the least.
It makes no sense to budget for even higher amounts if the absorption capacity remains restricted and the Commission delegations are understaffed.
It would be far more preferable if the European Union were to show its solidarity with the Mediterranean countries by opening up its markets more, not only for products from industry, but also for those from agriculture and horticulture.
We have a very long way to go before a free-trade area is established.
The economies of the partner countries are still very vulnerable.
Their mutual trade is still being restricted and has protectionism written all over it.
Additionally, the political distrust which exists between the partners must first be dispelled.
The Barcelona Process can only succeed if the Mediterranean partners continue to work on democratisation.
The human rights clauses in the Association Agreements should not remain hollow phrases.
Any violations should be penalised by a drop in financial support.
But if we reduce the amounts which cannot be spent anyway, then this will not make any impact whatsoever.
We must bring our ambitions into line with the degree to which they can be implemented.
The question is whether the report' s many sound wishes can all be realised at the same time.
It is better to do one thing which is slightly inferior than to do a great deal of things which are downright inferior.
Fine words and fine budgets are not enough to guarantee stability and welfare.
It is about the willingness to carry out true political reform, and this is what the Barcelona Process still lacks.
Mr President, the Mediterranean is the cradle of European civilisation.
The legacy of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome shaped our culture, our literature, our very understanding of the common European heritage.
Around the Mediterranean the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, Islam - were founded and fostered and spread throughout the known world.
Our debt to the Mediterranean is not only historical and cultural, it informs our common interest today in enlargement.
It is true that covers mainly countries from Central and Eastern Europe, but the candidate countries include the two famous Mediterranean island peoples: the Maltese and the Cypriots.
I very much hope that the Mediterranean programme and the enlargement process may be seen as complementary and not conflicting.
It is suitable that today the presidency should be manned by Mr Danielsson from Nordic Europe.
An example of North-South solidarity was when Prime Minister Aznar attended the Gdansk commemoration celebrating the foundation of the Solidarnosc movement.
I hope that improved relations between the EU and North Africa may result from the Mediterranean programme.
Today we wait for the outcome of the Lockerbie trial from a Scottish court in the Netherlands, but I understand it is the intention of the British to foster, in future, better diplomatic and other relations with, for example, Libya.
I have a question for the Council.
Could Mr Danielsson confirm that the EU' s Mediterranean programme is coordinated with the enlargement process to which the presidency attaches so much importance?
I wonder if it might be possible for the Commissioner in his reply to dwell on the criticisms of underspending sometimes levelled at the MEDA programme.
Is it the case that the Commission stands ready when necessary to give administrative support in the formulation of suitable programmes, as they did in the past when I wrote a report on the Alfama and Mouraria areas of Lisbon?
Is it the case that, if there were to be underspending, the money could be relocated?
Finally, concerning paragraph 54 of the NaÃ¯r report, could the Commissioner also confirm that the two Mediterranean candidate countries might be able to participate in the Euromed Heritage programme.
Commissioner, last November, you yourself said in the French press that the objective of the Barcelona Process was both simple and ambitious, i.e. an area at peace, enjoying shared prosperity, promoting the emergence of civil society while respecting human rights and ensuring the mutual understanding of different civilisations.
These three points should guide us in our relations with our Mediterranean partners.
It was in this spirit that the Group of the Party of European Socialists collaborated with the rapporteurs, Mrs Morgantini and our friend, Mr NaÃ¯r.
For we must now set priorities that have genuine measurable objectives and we must allocate adequate resources to achieving them.
We know that these priorities are, first of all, to make progress along the difficult road that is the Charter for Peace and Stability.
The French Presidency tried to do this against an extremely complicated background and the Swedish Presidency, I am sure, will continue along this route.
We would hope so and we shall all keep an eye on this.
The Barcelona Process should not be held hostage to the Middle East peace process.
Quite the opposite; the continuing tensions and the state of war between the Israeli and Palestinian people serve only to highlight the current need to improve dialogue between the countries bordering the Mediterranean.
We should also step up the negotiation, ratification and implementation of the association agreements, since this contract formalises the commitments of both parties and ensures an effective partnership. We are delighted to learn that an agreement has just been signed with Egypt.
Furthermore, we cannot continue investing just one euro in the South for every 10 we invest in the East.
This imbalance becomes more explosive with every passing day.
Firstly, of course, we must bring the reform of the MEDA financial instrument to a successful conclusion so as to improve the quality and speed of its implementation.
Finally, we call for decentralised cooperation to be relaunched on new bases, so that we can fulfil the hopes and respond to the profusion of initiatives from civil society, both European and Mediterranean, because the partnership will be worth nothing if it is not a partnership of peoples.
Indeed, I was interested to note that the Swedish Presidency intends to focus on the cultural, social and human aspects of the Mediterranean partnership.
Commissioner, our relationship with the South needs the input of more than just words and political symbols.
Our partners are expecting practical steps to be taken, as Mr NaÃ¯r stressed in his report, which I thought was particularly valuable.
Mr President, only a year ago, the eastwards enlargement policy was considered to be a possible line of development for Europe. Today, it is undeniably a fundamental part of European policy.
I hope that the same will become true of Mediterranean policy as of today, not only because the Middle East is one of the most insecure areas on our borders or because the southern side of the Mediterranean is the greatest source of migration towards Europe, but also, I am glad to say, because, as President Prodi recently stated, having already discovered America we have now discovered Asia, and the Mediterranean has resumed its key position in world trade and exchange which must be exploited on both northern and southern sides.
In my opinion, if this is true the performance of the MEDA programme cannot be taken as the benchmark, although I am convinced that careful evaluation of its results would shed a different light on things, but there are three lines to be explored: firstly, increasing mutual understanding through decentralised cooperation, which can be strongly encouraged; secondly, a training programme for the ruling classes of the Mediterranean, which Europe must involve in order to guarantee itself a better future; thirdly, defining sustainable sea transport policies in the Mediterranean, which will become a central point either of danger or of major development for both northern and southern sides of the Basin.
Mr President, we all stressed, both today and yesterday, the importance that we attach to Mediterranean policy and to the need to urgently reinvigorate the Barcelona Process, which is all too often disregarded.
The past year has not lived up to these expectations.
Admittedly, it was possible to hold another Euro-Mediterranean conference during the French Presidency, but this meeting produced few decisions and, above all, no genuine strategy.
Furthermore, I believe that it is time to give our Mediterranean strategy a firm foundation and to dissociate it from the vicissitudes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
I sincerely hope that the European Union will achieve its goal of strengthening economic, political and cultural ties with the countries of the Mediterranean Basin.
We shall soon be discussing the partnership agreement between the European Union and Egypt. I am delighted that this agreement was finally signed last week.
As the rapporteur on Egypt, I sincerely hope that we can take this opportunity to encourage the other partners who have not yet signed up to an agreement to do so as soon as possible.
It is also worth considering the European Parliament' s role in this process, which is still too limited. Then perhaps we might be able to shape the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum on the model of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, which meets twice yearly and can set up working parties and initiate fact-finding missions.
We could also, perhaps, improve the organisation of Parliament' s regular participation in ministerial meetings between the Barcelona Process members.
To sum up, Mr President, I would like to ask the Council and the Commission to explicitly recognise the role of towns and large cities, and I should like to thank Mr NaÃ¯r, the rapporteur, for agreeing to table an amendment that I made to his excellent report.
The Mediterranean countries should be encouraged to develop their relations and to share their experiences on specific urban issues.
The problems of modern times are most serious within towns and large cities.
Mr President, this joint debate is tackling issues which will shortly be at the centre of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum.
We are all convinced that the future of the Union's Mediterranean strategy depends largely on the success of the Middle East peace policy, which we must be more zealous in supporting even though it is the United States which is at the forefront of this political initiative.
The success of the Euro-Mediterranean project and the concrete results of economic cooperation between the European Union and the countries of the area should benefit the peace policy.
Moreover, eastwards enlargement, which received fresh impetus from the Nice Summit, must go hand in hand with an equally strong boost for the Mediterranean strategy, which has to evolve.
Another boost, including financial support, is therefore needed for the Barcelona Process and the MEDA programmes, particularly the programmes targeting professional training, university exchanges, projects promoting cooperation with the Union's research centres and technology parks, and especially with the cities and regions of Mediterranean Europe.
Economic and social progress must also lead to the consolidation of the areas of democracy, but, as has already been stressed, we must not lose sight of the fact that full respect for human rights is essential if the partnership is genuinely to succeed.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mrs Muscardini and Mr NaÃ¯r, on the excellent work they have done on an issue as sensitive as the conflict in this part of the world.
I would also like to start my speech by informing Parliament - I believe this is good news - about the MEDA programme, with which perhaps some of you are already familiar.
On 12 December the Council approved a budgetary contribution in this regard, which represents an increase of 10% on the annual investment for the MEDA programme.
This means that, compared to the EUR 684 million used during the previous period, that annual contribution will now total EUR 764 million per year.
I believe that this demonstrates the goodwill that dominates relations between Parliament, the Commission and the Council in this field.
On the other hand - and unfortunately - we must note, however, that sufficient means are not being made available to find an appropriate destination for this aid, since, in the period 1995-1999, almost 30% of the budgeted aid was not implemented.
This is disappointing management.
I do not know what the problem is, but there is a problem.
Furthermore, I would like to refer to the social, cultural and human dimension of these 15 North African countries, to which our various societies must move closer, and with whom we must promote comprehension and improve mutual understanding.
It also requires a special effort in terms of the teaching and training of young people, which must be based on tolerance, since young people are the future of these nations.
Neither must we forget dialogue, as well as the promotion of fundamental rights.
Finally, I would like to say one thing: we have an obligation to do this well, because if we do not do it out of love, we will have to do it out of fear, because what is at stake is the security of southern Europe.
Mr President, it is very appropriate that we are debating these two very good reports only a few days before the Euro-Med Forum, which is due to sit next week.
Various speakers have mentioned the importance of that forum, which must be raised over the coming years if we are to get the Barcelona Process back on track and expanding.
I would like to speak mainly on the funding for the Euro-Med programme, for MEDA, and say I am disappointed at the very low take-up.
The report mentions that is due to poor administration and procedures within the Commission.
A former colleague of mine, Mr Patten, is doing his best to make sure that we do get spending in the right sort of areas - efficiently, effectively, and to meet the needs of the various countries.
I am first Vice-Chairman of the delegation for Malta.
They are not allowed to bid for as much work as they want.
We need more transparency in the spending that is agreed upon.
We need to know where the money is going and - very importantly indeed - we need a better audit trail of where the money has gone because a lot of talk in the media is about misuse and money going down the wrong avenues for the wrong reasons.
That is an abuse of the position that we hold here.
I expect to see a better relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the interest of all the countries in the southern Mediterranean area.
There is a great deal of work to be done, it can be done and, indeed, it must be done.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mediterranean cooperation has been exposed to critical and constructive examination in today' s debate, as well as in the two reports that have been submitted.
I welcome this debate.
I have listened carefully to the points of view presented and noted that the criticisms made on a number of points are justified.
I think that dialogue with the partner countries is extremely important.
The real potential of the Barcelona Process can only be realised if all participants feel that they really own the process and that they are responsible for its different parts.
Allow me to comment briefly on some of the interesting contributions to this debate.
Mr Beazley discusses the issue of whether the enlargement process and Mediterranean cooperation are coordinated processes.
The obvious answer from the presidency is yes; they must be coordinated.
Just like Mr Esteve, we too, as holders of the presidency, see no conflict between, on the one hand, enlargement and, on the other hand, Mediterranean cooperation.
We shall, and must, be able to devote all our energies to these two areas.
I am very pleased that a number of MEPs, particularly Mrs Carlotti and Mr Martin, discuss the importance of association agreements between the EU and the partner countries.
We see these agreements as necessary building blocks for establishing a free-trade area in the region.
The aim is for these agreements to be ready by 2010.
That is why, in the Council' s view, it is important for this process to be speeded up.
I note with satisfaction that it was possible to countersign the association agreement with Egypt a few days ago.
We hope that, during the Swedish Presidency, we shall be able to hold an initial association council with Jordan.
It is also promising that the association negotiations with Algeria, Syria and Lebanon are proceeding at a good pace.
We believe, then, that these association agreements are not only of great importance to trade and economic integration but are also an important political platform.
They form the basis for a regular, deeper and extended political dialogue.
In today' s debate, quite a lot of criticism has been directed against the EU' s aid to the Mediterranean.
The Council hopes that the revised mediation arrangement adopted last autumn may provide the opportunity for a more efficient and more strategic method of working.
Mr Martin spoke of the importance of the cities' role in Mediterranean cooperation.
I can only concur with what Mr Martin said.
It is important to give due weight to the significance of the urban regions and their potential in Mediterranean cooperation.
The Council therefore sees this as an aspect we should like to try to cultivate further.
Mr Gemelli spoke about what I think is a very important issue, namely the dialogue with Islamic society.
At the social and cultural level, the presidency sees just such a dialogue between cultures and civilisations as one of our most important priorities - an area in which, as luck would have it, Sweden has been able to play quite a leading role for a long time.
Mention might be made, for example, of the so-called Euro-Islam project and the so-called Stockholm Conclusions from 1998, which provide guidelines for continued work in a long list of areas within this dialogue.
Mrs Napoletano discussed the incredibly important cooperation taking place in the legal sphere.
The Swedish Presidency wishes to promote cooperation in this area.
We shall be organising a high-level meeting and a seminar.
Both will be designed to contribute to the Commission' s new regional programmes in the legal and domestic policy areas.
Questions relating to migration, to which several MEPs have referred in today' s debate, are an important part of this complex of issues.
I think it is important for these migration issues to be seen in an overall perspective in which we have to take account of social, economic and cultural aspects.
The phase we are now entering into must be focused upon implementing what everyone within the Barcelona Process has already agreed about.
I believe it was Mr Obiols I GermÃ  who talked about the lack of symbolic specific action.
Mrs Carlotti touched upon the same subject.
I now believe that the EU, together with the partner countries around the Mediterranean, must ensure that the intentions and commitments of the Barcelona Declaration are 'clothed' in action for, like any other activity, the Barcelona Process will be judged not according to what it promises but according to what it achieves.
Mr President, it gives me very great pleasure to participate in this debate on the Mediterranean today.
I am particularly grateful to the two rapporteurs, Mrs Muscardini and Mr NaÃ¯r, for the excellent work that they have done in preparing their two reports.
It has been an extremely good debate.
It is personally rather a disappointment that many of those who were able to find time in their busy diaries to take part in the debate were not able to find time to hear very much of the debate or even to wait until the end to hear the responses.
It is, I guess, a sort of discourtesy on my part to reply to people who ask serious questions but who are not able to stay to hear the response, so I will not do that.
I will just respond to people who have been able to stay until the end, which in fact gives the debate some meaning.
The Mediterranean is our near abroad, on our southern flank, so it should enjoy a very special place in our external relations.
The objectives agreed at Barcelona remain fundamentally valid and they are increasingly relevant: working together for peace and stability, creating shared prosperity through establishing free trade, providing the economic and financial assistance to meet the challenges which that implies, and helping to improve mutual understanding and tolerance among peoples of different cultures and different traditions.
As the House will know, I had long believed that the time had come to see how we could improve the delivery of the Barcelona objectives.
We therefore worked very hard on a Commission communication on reinvigorating the Barcelona Process, which in turn provided the main input for the Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers' meeting in Marseilles last November where our ideas were overwhelmingly endorsed.
That document was on the table, that document was the principle agenda for that meeting.
I should like now to give you my assessment of where we stand and where we should go from here.
With the permission of the House, I will address points arising from both reports in this context rather than dealing with each report separately.
First, let me look at the political situation in the region, which we are going to debate in a few moments' time.
Both reports note the considerable significance of the Middle East peace process for European Union policy in the Mediterranean.
I note the calls in both reports for the European Union to play a more active role in the peace process.
Let us not underestimate our contribution.
We are, for example, and it is not an unreasonable point to make, the major donor to the Palestinian Authority.
Last year EUR 155.6 million was earmarked from the Community budget, which included EUR 90 million for a special cash facility that I made available at the end of the year to help preserve the institutional framework of the Palestinian Authority, which we have helped to create and fund.
I would like, without reservation, to thank the House - to thank this part of the budgetary authority - and also to thank the Council for their assistance in ensuring that we could make that cash facility available before Christmas.
As events have sadly proved, it is going to be all too necessary.
At the meeting in Marseilles, ministers decided, rightly in my view, not to seek agreement on the proposed Charter for Peace and Stability.
This was clearly not the right moment.
Nevertheless, in substance a good deal of progress had been made towards agreement on this instrument.
We should make sure that we can capitalise on that progress when the time is right, so that it becomes a genuinely meaningful document, reflecting the European Union' s active commitment to maintaining regional peace and stability.
In the meantime - and here I also echo comments made in both the reports that we are considering - we should not wait for the charter to be in force to make more efforts to promote respect for human rights and democratic freedoms in the region.
Our communication is unequivocal on this subject.
The European Union should use all appropriate fora to press for progress on these issues.
The MEDA democracy programme should continue to be used to fund positive actions and MEDA allocations themselves should be more dependent on adequate progress.
I very much welcome Parliament' s backing on this and I hope that the Council will also react positively.
Economic and financial matters are, of course, at the heart of the partnership though they are not, as several speakers pointed out, anything like the whole of that partnership.
In Marseilles there was a high level of consensus on our proposals for reinvigorating it and I would like to highlight the following: we must speed up the negotiation, signature and ratification of the association agreements.
I am happy to confirm that we are achieving considerable progress on this.
On Friday last week we managed, at last, to initial the agreement with Egypt and we are encouraged by the progress we are making with Algeria, with Lebanon and with Syria.
I want to see negotiations with Algeria, Lebanon and Syria pursued vigorously this year, however the ratification process in the Member States is lamentably slow.
The agreement with Jordan was signed three years ago, but it is still not in force.
Help from the European Parliament in this respect would be most welcome.
I do hope that, as well as making speeches in the Chamber, honourable Members will get on to their own parliaments and governments to ensure that when we reach agreement on one of these associations agreements it can be ratified rapidly.
There are two states which still have not ratified the Jordan agreement - no names, as they say, no pack drill - but I very much hope that Belgian and French MEPs - I hope I have not given the game away - will get on to their parliaments to press for ratification as soon as possible.
In due course we also need to tackle the issue of agricultural trade.
The credibility of our partnership lies in being able to deal with sensitive matters like that and we need to have a genuine discussion.
We must develop South-South trade and cooperation, including on a subregional basis.
We want all countries signing an association agreement with us to conclude free-trade agreements among themselves within five years.
This is the only manner to prepare our already agreed objective of an overall European-Union-Mediterranean free-trade area by 2010.
The development of subregional trade needs to be accompanied by greater subregional cooperation.
Trading opportunities will not be used unless the infrastructure is there.
We must introduce accumulation of origin for all partners establishing free trade between themselves and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.
We must harmonise measures relating to the single market.
We want a timetable to be in place by next year for priority sectors - such as rules of origin, customs, norms and standards, and intellectual property protection - for implementation starting in 2004, both between the partners and the Union and among the partners themselves.
All this, together with the support we give to our partners under MEDA, will increase the attractiveness of the region to investors.
A decompartmentalised and open market with a sound and predictable legal and administrative environment is the best way to ensure that the very low levels of local, European and world-wide investment will increase.
Both reports rightly pay much attention to the need to improve MEDA, which one or two of the speakers who are still present in the Chamber mentioned during their remarks.
Indeed, MEDA has an excellent record on commitments but is much less good on payments.
Last year the record on commitments was maintained: the provisional figures show that EUR 879 million or 98% of available commitments were executed and the record on payments improved to EUR 335 million or 95% of available appropriations.
I am happy to say that the control of the overhang of payments required to execute the commitments has begun to improve.
As an average over the last five years, we have now paid 30% of existing commitments, compared to 26% one year ago, but there is still a long way to go.
We are in the process of implementing two reforms, the revised MEDA regulation and the internal Commission reform.
Taken together, I am confident that they will bring about serious improvements in the years to come.
Mr honourable friend, Mr Beazley, who I am delighted to say is still in his place, spoke about that and asked a specific question about Cyprus and Malta and their participation in regional programmes.
I am delighted to answer "yes" - in the affirmative.
It is a positive "yes" rather than negative or equivocal "yes" .
I note the opinion that the amount made available for the period 2000 to 2006 is insufficient.
I was not surprised to see that mentioned in the report.
It is certainly true that the EUR 5.35 billion agreed by the Council - I give away no secrets - is less than the Commission had proposed.
Nevertheless, together with EIB lending, this means that nearly EUR 13 billion will be available over that period, which is not an insignificant amount of money.
The important thing now is to see that this money is used effectively in terms both of the quality of our actions in relation to the policy objectives and of actual payments on the ground.
The Commission has proposed that, for the future, MEDA allocation should be more closely linked to the association process and the implementation of economic reforms.
I make no apology for this and I am glad to note support for this line in one of the reports.
I have noted the calls to increase the numbers of Commission staff available to work on this sector.
I recognise that the staff concerned are extremely hard pressed, but any decisions will have to be taken in the context of the evolution of Commission staffing levels overall and here again I would be delighted for concrete help from Parliament.
We will also be working this year on a programme to take account of the social effects of economic transition.
This will promote education and training, the enhancement of the role of women and social security systems as well as actions on health.
I was not surprised that both reports called for increased support for civil society.
I fully agree with these.
The question is how best to go about it.
I fear that financing micro-projects is not the answer.
These are not cost-effective and they are wasteful of staff resources.
Decentralised cooperation is to be welcomed, but not in the sense of relaunching the old Mediterranean decentralised cooperation programmes.
However worthy their objectives, they were seriously criticised by the Court of Auditors and indeed they were seriously criticised by this Parliament.
Rather we need to explain more clearly to civil society - whether NGOs, local authorities or other groups - that our programmes are open to their participation and they only need to organise themselves to respond to our calls for proposals.
Good examples of this already exist in our sectoral regional cooperation programmes, for example on the environment, the cultural heritage and MEDA democracy.
I propose to make a concerted effort in this sense and to try to generalise the approach.
In the longer term, we could look at other ways of supporting civil society and I should certainly be prepared to consider any concrete proposals which Parliament may put forward.
Finally, I am glad to note the agreement all round on the need to raise the visibility of the partnership.
I warmly welcome Parliament' s activities in this respect through international contacts at all levels.
I am only sorry that I will not be able to attend the forum on 8 and 9 February, but I am on a troika visit on those two days.
I hope Parliament will understand.
We shall be supplementing our existing activities through the introduction of a dedicated programme using all the modern techniques at our disposal to ensure that the value of what we are doing is appreciated as widely as possible both in the European Union and among the Mediterranean partners.
One speaker, Mr Obiols i GermÃ , who I am delighted to see in his place, said that we must not just give lip service to our objectives in the Barcelona Process.
Someone else, who I am afraid is not here, said we should give evidence of tangible action.
That is what we are trying to do.
That is what the document that we put on the table in Marseilles attempts to do: a serious effort to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process with concrete proposals for action.
So, as far as we are concerned in the Commission, we do not want to make the same old speeches, we do not want to go on the same old roundabouts of meetings and summits and conferences and bilateral agreements.
We want to complete all the association agreements and get them ratified and we have a good chance of completing at least another two association agreements this year; I would hope for the lot.
We must deal with issues like South-South trade and accumulation, we must deal with regional cooperation, we have to speed up delivery under MEDA.
This is not a virtual policy.
It is a real policy that we want to make work in real time.
I hope that in future debates in Parliament - as well attended from beginning to end as this one has been, at least in part - we will be able to chart our progress in what must be one of the priorities for the external actions of the European Union.
Situation in the Middle East
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East.
I would like to welcome Mr Danielsson, President-in-Office of the Council, and, without further ado, I shall give him the floor on behalf of the Council.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the Israeli election for prime minister on 6 February, the peace process in the Middle East is at an uncertain stage.
During the negotiations in Taba, the parties came closer than ever before to a negotiated solution.
At the same time, the violence in the Palestinian areas and the large number of dead and injured has meant a serious reduction in trust between the negotiating parties.
The Israeli Government faces change, irrespective of the outcome of the election for prime minister on 6 February but, at the same time, there should hopefully be a strong desire for peace on the part of both the Israeli and Palestinian populations.
The Israeli election for prime minister and the forthcoming formation of a government will be important factors in determining the future direction of the peace process.
Despite the difficulties, the parties have not wanted to forfeit the progress achieved in spite of everything.
In Taba, the parties negotiated directly with each other and without any third party present.
The atmosphere on that occasion was serious and results-oriented, and both parties declared themselves optimistic about the opportunities for achieving a final settlement.
However, time did not permit any such final settlement to be reached in Taba, but the parties agreed upon a joint concluding statement on 28 January which may constitute a platform to build upon further whenever the negotiations for a final settlement are resumed.
I would draw the honourable Members' and Parliament' s attention to the fact that this statement particularly emphasises the European Union' s role in the continued work for peace.
The presidency is not alone in receiving requests from many quarters to see a strengthening of the European Union' s already major commitment to the whole Middle East issue.
The EU has an important role to play in as much as we are the most important trading partner of practically all the countries in the area, as well as the largest donor of public aid to the Palestinian areas.
Through its Special Envoy, Mr Moratinos, who has been present the whole time, the EU has of course been able to follow the negotiations in Taba.
The very fact that Mr Moratinos has been able to participate and show the European Union' s support for the negotiations and its readiness to assist the parties has been of great value to the Union.
I also want to emphasise that, in recent weeks, the presidency has had regular contacts at the highest level with both the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships.
A recurrent theme for the presidency in these contacts has been the European Union' s desire to assist the parties in whatever way they wish.
Throughout, these contacts have taken place in close collaboration with the High Representative and the General Secretary of the UN.
I also want to emphasise the significance of the fact that the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Solana, is part of the international commission under the leadership of Senator Mitchell which is investigating the current violence in the Palestinian areas and which, hopefully, will eventually submit proposals to prevent a recurrence of this violence.
The ever lengthening crisis has presented the Palestinian population with severe economic and humanitarian problems.
The Palestinian Authority has also been grappling with major budgetary problems since the Israeli Government stopped the transfers of tax funds it is obliged to make in accordance with the 'Paris Protocol' .
In a statement of 22 January, the General Affairs Council called upon Israel to resume these transfers.
On the initiative of Commissioner Patten, the European Union has also used extra appropriations in order to make funds temporarily available to the Palestinian Authority.
The human rights situation continues to give cause for concern.
The European Union has intervened with the Palestinian Authority in connection with the death sentences recently carried out.
The Union has also intervened in Israel to condemn the extra-judicial executions of Palestinians, corroborated by military sources.
We shall continue to monitor these issues.
Unfortunately, there is no new information about initiatives or progress in the peace negotiations between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon.
In dialogue with the parties and also in close collaboration with the new American administration, the European Union will continue to do what it can to bring all aspects of the peace process to a successful conclusion.
Madam President, I would like very briefly to try to add some more specific elements, from a political point of view, to the speech which the presidency has just made.
I believe that today' s debate is crucial given the time at which it is taking place.
I believe that we should focus the debate on at least three questions.
The first is what will the political scene in Israel be like after the elections on 6 February?
The second, which the presidency also mentioned, is how can this cycle of violence that we have witnessed over recent months be brought to an end?
And the third, and perhaps most important, is what direction must we give to the peace process in 2001?
The year 2000 was a year of hope. It began with the idea that a definitive solution could perhaps be reached.
Certain significant measures were adopted in relation to Syria.
Unfortunately, however, 2000 ended without us being able to achieve peace.
Let us do everything possible so that 2001 might truly be the year in which we do achieve it.
The current situation is, of course, still very fluid.
I must tell you that I spent this very morning in Stockholm holding a meeting with the Swedish prime minister and President-in-Office of the Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
We were talking practically until lunchtime when I took the plane to come here and be with you this afternoon.
Many initiatives are taking place at the moment; initiatives which we hope will bring success, with the possibility of a final and definitive summit before the elections of 6 February.
I believe that there is still the possibility that this summit will take place, and also the possibility that it may take place in Europe.
As the presidency has clearly pointed out, we have seen some truly significant activity since 23 December of last year, and we have all been involved in an enormously active sense.
So much so that, if you will allow me, Madam President, I will tell you that I spent the first day of the year in Israel, together with Mr Barak and Mr Arafat, and we made significant progress.
I believe that the meetings which took place in Taba, as the presidency has said, have been without doubt - according to all the participants - the most substantial negotiations we have ever had.
Progress has been made in all areas.
On the issue of land, we are very close to potentially reaching an agreement - if there is actual time to conclude it - on very nearly a hundred per cent of the land, involving some land exchanges.
From the security point of view, I believe that a good agreement can be reached, accepting that there can be three early warning stations and that, along the Jordan Valley, international forces can be deployed to guarantee stability.
On the issue of Jerusalem, as you know, talks are continuing, with some progress, on the problem of how to define the Wailing Wall and the Western Wall.
There has still been no precise decision on this.
However, there is still a desire to make progress and to reach a definitive solution on Jerusalem.
At the Taba meetings, progress has also been made on the issue of the refugees, and progress has been made on specific and practical issues.
The sub-committee set up for this purpose has made considerable progress on all issues relating to the refugees, although it has had to postpone, for the time being, the crucial aspect of the right to return.
They have postponed that issue in order to find specific and practical solutions to specific and practical problems, such as international committees, how to find resources in the different countries to help in that direction, etc.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, there is still reason to be hopeful that we may either reach a definitive agreement - a faint hope, to be honest, since there is little chance of reaching a definitive agreement by Sunday - or that we may gain an explicit commitment from both sides on a range of parameters so that, whatever the situation in Israel and the territories after 6 February, there will always be a range of commitments that have been agreed on, accepted by both sides, which means that we will not have to start the next negotiations practically from scratch.
I can tell you that, on the part of the European Union, all the successive Presidencies, with no doubt whatsoever, are going to maintain a commitment which is not only political but also personal.
Prime Minister GÃ¶ran Persson is personally completely committed - and I have witnessed this during the hours we have spent together on the telephone holding the negotiations necessary to reach a solution - and, on our part, please do not have the slightest doubt that we will remain physically, psychologically and politically involved in it, because, as you know, a resolution to this conflict in the Middle East is in our interests, very much in our interests.
It is also important to highlight the constructive behaviour of the countries in the region.
Both Jordan and Egypt continue to maintain a firm and determined commitment to trying to find a negotiated and definitive solution.
There are going to be difficult moments, without doubt, after the elections; there will be uncertainties and we will need to continue to have - as we Europeans have always had - the determination to continue supporting this peace process.
From other points of view - from the economic point of view - the presidency has already explained what we are doing.
I am sure the Commission will also do so.
We will continue the generosity that the European Union has always shown.
I would like to say a few words also about the committee of enquiry, the committee which arose from the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting.
The committee has worked well for some time but, as of a week ago, the Israeli Government decided to break contact with it until after the elections.
Therefore, although there is still a team from the committee still deployed on the ground, we members of the committee as such will not go to the territories until 16 February.
That is what I can tell you at the moment.
Finally, I would like to repeat that we will continue to work over the remaining days with energy and determination and, if eventually a summit is held, the European representation will attend it and will do everything possible to push this process in the right direction.
Madam President, I am very grateful for this opportunity to speak briefly in this debate.
I do not intend to repeat any of the things I said in the last debate nor do I intend to repeat what the President and the High Representative have just said, not because it is not important, but because repetition would insult the intelligence of the House.
Naturally, we all hope for progress in the peace talks.
Naturally, we all believe it would be foolish to speculate on the post-election scenario in Israel.
It is for the people of Israel to make their democratic choice and then for the rest of us to deal with the consequences.
Naturally, we are all seriously concerned about the loss of life on both sides.
There have already been a high number of victims because of an excessive use of force and we are deeply worried about the extra-judicial killings perpetrated by Israeli security forces.
Not only does this undermine the prospects of achieving a negotiated settlement, it is also unacceptable for a democratic nation to resort to such means in grave violation of human rights and the rule of law.
Let me be equally clear, we are also deeply concerned by the killing of Israeli civilians by Palestinians and by the recent executions of Palestinians.
This too is unacceptable, especially given the Palestinian authorities' earlier commitment to a moratorium on the death penalty.
We also remain concerned about the humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza.
The remaining closures by Israel are having devastating effects on the Palestinian economy and therefore, not surprisingly, on political stability.
They are even affecting the import of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territories.
For example, the Palestinian Authority has notified the Commission' s representative in Jerusalem that the official inauguration of the Gaza Hospital - a hospital with which this Parliament is perhaps all too familiar - originally foreseen for mid-January, has had to be postponed until further notice.
The situation has deteriorated further, and staff and patients are prevented from even reaching the hospital.
Similarly equipment and supplies, such as oxygen, medicines and fuel, cannot reach the hospital and further building work has had to be suspended.
In its preliminary implementation report following the December emergency appeal, UNWRA also raises concern about serious difficulties in the delivery of food, the delivery of construction material, medical items and other essential supplies.
The security of staff engaged in humanitarian assistance has been severely compromised.
I very much regret that the situation has continued to deteriorate.
However, we have continued to make our position crystal clear.
We have demanded that the remaining closures on the Palestinian economy should be lifted.
We have asked Israel to end immediately the withholding of revenue payments due to the Palestinian Authority and we have reacted promptly to the crisis by addressing both the humanitarian situation and the precarious budgetary situation of the Palestinian Authority.
In December the Commission provided EUR 15 million in emergency aid, EUR 14.5 million alone to UNWRA in response to its emergency appeal.
In addition, we disbursed a EUR 27.5 million special cash facility in the belief that it was in the interest of both sides not to undermine the Palestinian Authority' s ability to pay salaries.
In the same spirit, the Commission set up the new cash facility of EUR 90 million which the presidency referred to.
I am very grateful to Parliament and the Council for making that prudential transfer possible before Christmas.
Last week I dispersed a first tranche of EUR 30 million to the Palestinian Authority.
We need to look at the likely situation for the rest of this year.
As our resources are limited, we need to examine carefully how to proceed further.
If we continue drawing monthly payments from the special cash facility in order to meet the current administrative needs of the Palestinian Authority, including payment of civil servants' salaries, education, health and other public services, funds will very soon run out.
The Palestinian Authority is now facing an ongoing fall in revenue and a rising deficit.
They will need to adjust their policies.
Instead of just baling out month-to-month we need to look at how to help over the longer term.
Indeed the European Union and the wider international community have an interest in preserving the economic and institutional framework of the Palestinian Authority, which we have helped to create and which we have helped to fund more generously than any one else.
If the Palestinian Authority collapsed, it would be a very severe blow to prospects for peace in the region, Israeli security would be threatened and our efforts to promote cooperation and stability in the Middle East would be undermined.
That is why both the Palestinian Authority and the international community at large must look beyond the immediate crisis and consider how to deal with the steadily widening gap in Palestinian finances.
There is one other point I should make and I make it with all due delicacy, but I do not think that it is contrary to the experience of honourable Members of this House who have recently been in the region.
Whatever the appalling problems faced by the Palestinian Authority, with which I strongly sympathise, nothing would justify practices that fall below the level of probity that we have the right to expect from any recipient of our funds and that citizens in any community have every right to expect from their governing agencies.
I believe I am right in saying, as I mentioned a moment or two ago, that some honourable Members who have recently been in the area have strong views on this subject.
We wish to play our part in sustaining the Palestinian Authority, but if we are to do that then we have to be able to assure the budgetary authority of the European Union, which has to answer to Europe' s taxpayers, that the money we make available is being well spent and properly spent.
I repeat what I said just now, that we want to do what we can to assist the Palestinian Authority.
I hope very much that the authorities in Israel will end the economic and financial blockade of Palestinian areas because, in the short, the medium and the long term, this will increase instability and sustain the violence.
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking both the Council and the Commission for their information and comments and by saying that my group is also moderately optimistic - let us hope furthermore that the data indicated by the High Representative proves to be right - at this very sensitive time just a few days before the elections in Israel, and in the midst of a transfer of government in the United States, which will have to rebuild its policy in the region.
However, we must not forget that, up until today, there have been more than 400 deaths as a result of the Intifada, which has taken us back to a situation which we thought we would never see again.
My group also sees the increased European presence in the region over recent months as something to be greatly welcomed.
As the presidency mentioned, it is true that the participation of Mr Solana in Sharm el-Sheikh and the committee of enquiry, and the presence of the European Union in Taba through its permanent representative, Ambassador Moratinos, have enabled us to make effective contributions to the peace process.
We believe that we have to intensify this quest for political presence in the region on the part of the European Union, which we believe is compatible with the fundamental role which the United States Government must continue to play in this whole process.
In Taba, both sides acknowledged that they have never been so close to a final agreement, but we must be aware that the apparent euphoria must not make us blind to the real situation.
The Israelis and the Palestinians must be aware that they share a common enemy, the extremism to which fundamentalism of one kind or another leads, which is the main danger to the peace process and to stability and prosperity in the region, and which also poses an undeniable threat to the whole of the Mediterranean region.
On the other hand, I believe that we must be aware that we are faced with a national conflict, handed down from history, which has impregnated the education systems of some countries and has promoted hate amongst the younger generations, which means that we clearly cannot expect a magic solution and that we must confront the problem with perseverance.
I think it is highly appropriate to link the debates on the Middle East peace process to the new impetus which the European Union is endeavouring to give to the Barcelona Process, as we are doing this afternoon and as Commissioner Patten has done, because surely the greatest contribution Europe can make at the moment to the peace process is to keep alive the spirit of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, strengthening its vitality and maintaining its development in the face of political pressures.
Both Israelis and Palestinians have come to realise recently that it is crucial to end the violence and re-establish a climate of security in the region, but they have also worked together on the development of creative formulas to solve the problems dividing them: Jerusalem, the definitive mapping of borders, the refugees and the settlements which Mr Solana referred to.
The European Union has the particular responsibility of consolidating these foundations despite the internal political changes of recent days.
We must support both sides in their journey towards a solution to the conflict, based on the peaceful resolution of differences, on tolerance, on respect for human rights and the consolidation of peace.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, from your speech a few minutes ago, it seems that you deserve another title: high representative for hope.
Let us hope that you are right!
Unfortunately I do not share your optimism, even though it is cautious, but I admit that your words have, to some extent, allayed my concerns.
Ladies and gentlemen, although the peace process may have run out of steam, the underlying principles still apply and are indisputable.
Firstly, the Oslo fundamental agreements still exist and continue to be in force.
No one, Mr Sharon included, can cast doubt on their validity, in moral terms and under international law.
I expressly refer to the 'Land for Peace' principle, among others, which has formed the basis for rapprochement and negotiations since Madrid.
Secondly, the Security Council Resolutions Nos 242, 338, and needless to say, also No 194 on refugees, must be fulfilled, so as to create the foundation for a just and lasting peace.
Thirdly, I come to the crucial problems that we must solve if peace is to be restored, as you yourself said Mr Solana: the return of all occupied territories and demolition of all settlements on these territories, Palestinians to have rights to parts of Jerusalem, the possibility of the return of Palestinian refugees, which perhaps causes the biggest headache of all.
I shall close by repeating something that has been said and given due emphasis before in this House. The European Union has a huge moral duty, and it is vital for reasons of self-interest, to play a political role in this peace process, which is in keeping with its political commitment.
The division of labour of the past, according to which the USA made policy and the European Union paid for it, is no longer acceptable. Nor has it yielded any worthwhile result to date.
It is not a case of the EU stepping into the shoes of the USA in the peace process, rather, what we want is for the European Union to join forces with the USA in a bid to find a just solution.
Now that would be what I would call a new peace process.
With your presence, Mr Solana, and that of the UN Secretary-General, Sharm al-Sheikh created a new framework for peace negotiations.
We would like to think that this new model will be retained and will deliver better results than its predecessor.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Sakellariou.
Parliament is amazed at how elegantly you surf between languages, so much so all we can hear is the wash!
Mr President, the EU is the key donor to the Palestinian territories.
According to the UN, since the closures, more than one million Palestinians have been living under the poverty line of two dollars a day.
The human effect of the closures is possibly even worse.
Commissioner Patten stated it a moment ago: sick people cannot even get to the European hospital in Gaza because even ambulances cannot get through the barricades.
It is therefore of key importance that we continue providing aid.
I am delighted that the Council and Commission share our view.
I returned from the Palestinian territories last Sunday together with a delegation from Parliament.
We are all agreed on one thing: it is important to give money, but we are not giving enough.
The Union must also assume its political responsibility.
It is only managing to play a valuable role in the peace process in very small steps.
That is due not least to the dissension within the Union.
I would therefore like to hear from Mr Solana what he intends to do in order to bring the Union to sing from the same songsheet.
Once detailed maps of Jerusalem are available, as well as plans for the settlements, and a scheme for the return of and compensation for refugees, I wonder whether the Union will have the in-house expertise it takes to adopt an intelligent position of its own, or will we leave this to the Americans?
We must make sure this discussion does not become black and white.
By maintaining a certain degree of neutrality, Europe could, in fact, make a valuable contribution.
Both sides of this conflict are violating agreements.
We must call them both to task about this.
Killing people is unacceptable under any circumstances, whether this is in the form of executions carried out by the Palestinian Authority or the Israeli army' s assassination policy.
But, Mr Danielsson, Europe will lay itself open to the criticism that it is applying double standards if it takes four and a half months to call the Israelis to account, whilst this is done promptly in the case of Palestinians.
This Parliament too, with its secondary delegations, one for Israel and one for the Palestinian territories, is running the risk of sending out the wrong message.
We must now work on unanimity and understanding of the legitimate concerns on both sides.
Mr President, if nothing else, last week' s visit of the parliamentary delegation to the Palestinian territories illustrated that over the past four months, the situation has taken a bad turn for the worse.
During my most recent visit at the start of the Intifada, it was evident that economically, there was a future for a separate Palestinian state.
If you now walk around in Bethlehem or Jerusalem, it is painful to see that the economy has completely bottomed out. This is as a result of the tourist trade drying up completely and of the policy of closures by the Israeli government, which is preventing tens of thousands of workers from commuting into work.
The political situation too has deteriorated dramatically due to the no-compromise rhetoric. This is now prevalent on the Palestinian side, and given the liquidations carried out by the Israeli government, this is a very understandable reaction.
The European Union was right to condemn this policy, all be it a little belatedly. In short, my impression after last week' s visit, if I am being honest, is a very negative one.
In all truthfulness, I am not holding out too much hope for the future either.
In that sense, I share the view of Mr Sakellariou.
My expectation is that the peace process will grind to a halt as a result of the wait-and-see attitude of the Bush administration and the fact that I think that the Sharon government - which I am certain will soon be a reality - will initially keep reasonably calm in the face of international pressure.
But this standstill could be a blessing in disguise if the European Union were to use that time to its own advantage.
This is possible and would be possible if it were to use its role as key donor to the Palestinians and as Israel' s key trading partner in an effective manner.
With regard to the Palestinians, I believe that the European Union should act as follows.
It should use its role as key donor to urge the Palestinians to end the widespread corruption, which many people protest against and are indignant about at regional level.
Additionally, the Palestinian authorities should respect human rights to a much higher degree, not only in terms of executions but also, for example, in its treatment of prisoners.
It would be unacceptable, with regard to respecting human rights, for the European Union to finance police training if in practice nothing were to change.
Finally, I would like to comment on the Palestinians.
Local elections are required in order to enhance the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority.
As for Israel, I believe that the European Union should leave Israel in no doubt that if, after the forthcoming elections, repression increases, if the settlement policy does not change and if there is no movement in their willingness to reach an agreement, then we cannot proceed in a business-as-usual manner.
We cannot continue to deal with a partner who refuses to do what we have been asking for for years.
We should have the nerve to draw the necessary conclusions, to refer to the rules in the Association Agreement and dare to take measures.
If the European Union uses this economic position to its advantage, it could well play a political role in future, a political role which does justice to the demands of the region and the interests of the Union itself.
Mr President, in Davos, President Arafat reiterated the need for peace and gave an honest account of the shameful, tragic living conditions of the Palestinian people, who are subjected to violations of human rights by the Israeli army.
The media interpreted this as greater inflexibility on Arafat's part with regard to peace and criticised Peres for not standing up to him.
The truth of the matter is that Peres knows that what Arafat is saying is true.
The visit of our parliamentary delegation to the area also served to confirm this.
The Palestinian people are forced to live in an open-air prison, the roads leading into and out of the villages are under military occupation and closed off, countless check points on the main roads prevent the Palestinians from reaching their places of work and collective punishments are enforced.
This is just one example: Sabrine was born on 24 January at a check point. At the next check point her umbilical cord was cut.
The mother had left the village of Antis at 5 p.m. and arrived at Ramallah hospital at 8.30 p.m. The journey should have taken 40 minutes.
Her epic ordeal was recorded in the Israeli newspaper Ha' aretz.
People who are seriously ill are turned back and medical staff beaten up.
In Gaza, we saw hundreds of metres of land where enormous palm trees and olive and orange trees had been uprooted and destroyed, and houses demolished. It had become desert land.
Was there something wrong with the trees?
Only in that they could have served as cover for any Palestinian attacks against the settlers who are overrunning the country and treating it as theirs, destroying Palestinian houses and crops.
Meanwhile, the number of settlers and settlements is increasing every day in what ought to be the State of Palestine, the territories which have been occupied since 1967.
The Palestinian Legislative Council cannot function properly. The members of the different districts are unable to move about or to meet.
Arafat himself said that his movements are hampered.
Others have spoken of the tragic stifling of the economy.
Imports and exports are blocked, and the European Union is witness to that: every day, the Commission in Jerusalem receives notification of the various violations; even civil structures and schools provided by the European Union have been bombed.
These are economic disasters whose effects will be felt for years to come.
All this is well-known, and none of us, particularly those in responsible political positions, can say that they were unaware of the facts.
Our diplomats send back clear reports on the Israeli settlement policy and also clear reports - as we told all the Palestinian leaders we met - of the violations performed by the National Palestinian Authority.
But they all asked us - from Arafat to the men and women in the refugee camps - why Europe does not intervene in an active, political way.
"We have confidence in Europe," they said, "and a political partnership with the Middle and Near East would benefit Europe."
This is our view as well: Europe must be able to develop an effective foreign policy which is in line with the fundamental values which we always claim to hold: respect for international laws and human rights. In terms of Palestine, that means upholding the UN Resolutions.
There is a pragmatic strain in the Palestinians; we have witnessed it and it was evident at Taba as well: they are pragmatic in implementation but resolute when it comes to principles and rights. We, too, should have realised this, for we are always discussing it.
Mr Solana is right: Europe is now playing a larger role but it must do much more.
The United States has failed: our task is not to replace it but to become equal partners in the negotiations.
It is not enough for us to provide economic aid: what we are being asked for - and our responsibility...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, representatives of the Council Presidency and the Commission, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I have, of course, listened to all the speeches and I have also read the reports.
In my view, the real nature of the problem, illustrated and interpreted against the backdrop of the Treaties establishing the European Union themselves, from the Treaty of Rome onwards, and against history and European law, has been wiped from all your minds, except for the odd refrain, muttered like a prayer, of human rights and so on and so forth.
The present situation places us in the same condition of complicity with the worst of the worst, with the murderers and torturers, those that abused the right to life and attempted to destroy the law, as we witnessed from 1985 onwards in what was to become the former Yugoslavia.
There is no strategy, no awareness of the institutional objectives of our Union in our approach today, at least in terms of the abstract goals set forth in the human rights charters and in the charters of the rights of European citizens and others.
There is none of this in what the High Representative, Mr Solana, happily, courageously and, most importantly, sincerely recommended as an EU foreign policy, a bureaucratic, ineffective operation with no added value in terms of practical implementation or foresight.
This is our problem: there you are, Mrs Morgantini and company, falling over yourselves to tell us about the woes and tragedies of the Palestinians, of Palestinian men and women, of Arab men and women, of the Middle East. You are so relentless, so implacable, with such clear, diligent consciences; you only acknowledge Arab or Palestinian men and women if they are on the wrong end of an Israeli bullet, in which case you give them the honour of a burial, the honour of your recognition.
In the face of the Palestinian, Arab or Middle Eastern citizens, who die every day, assassinated by their Saudi or fundamentalist right- or left-wing regimes, assassinated by the firm, historic alliance of Sheikhs and Middle Eastern rulers, who are allied with the great oil multinationals and with you, the more or less communist left; in the face of the situation of the Kurds, which is not just a Turkish problem but also an Iraqi problem and the problem of others as well; in the face of the everyday lives of the Saudi and Palestinian men and women, you are only concerned with them if Israel is involved, and it may have done them some serious damage.
You only acknowledge the existence of the Palestinian people when they further your condemnation of your current permanent enemy, be it the United States of America, Israel or the European Union, which is acting to protect certain values, as it did in the case of Belgrade and Milosevic, as it did throughout the crisis in Yugoslavia.
Therefore, Mr President, this is the truth of the matter: the greatest threat to peace is Israel's real weakness.
Israel might be prepared to take a risk - and this is why the Israeli people appear, surprisingly, to prefer the old warrior Sharon to the wise, sensible, courageous Barak - but it feels that any concession could turn out to be excessive compared to the peace to be gained.
This is the problem: when there are 100, 150 kilometres of territory to cross, one more kilometre conceded might, in effect, represent one more trench to fight from in a war sparked off by an unfair peace agreement.
This is what they fear.
But who fears, exactly?
The Israeli democracy is afraid of this, but you could not care less!
For heaven's sake! What sort of Europe is this?
If anything, the right to national and personal independence is not to have 60% of your money spent on the armies of the local dictator, on consolidating corruption and class, bureaucratic, military and extreme right-wing control of men and women everywhere!
Where is it laid down that the European Union must be the guarantor of the national states, of their independence and self-determination?
Nowhere in our hearts and culture does the nineteenth century right to the national state exist today: civil, political and human rights with regard to any state, central or centralised authority do exist, and you are unaware of all this!
Israel must become part of the European Union, one of our borders.
Israel does not realise either that it cannot continue to defend itself as a national State, a small bridgehead of democracy but forced for 50 years, more so with each passing day, to risk its own life and peace and the peace of others.
Therefore this, Mr President, is our hope: we are preparing a written statement, which has already been signed by 30 Members, calling for the full inclusion of Israel in our Union. A battle will have to be fought in Brussels and in Tel Aviv but it is an urgent matter.
As radicals, this is our aim and we will make every effort to achieve it, for it is a wise course of action which will lead to freedom.
Mr President, I was interested to read the conclusions which the General Council reached early last week regarding the Middle East peace process.
The intention to work in close cooperation with the new American Bush administration within this diplomatic minefield deserves the support of the European Parliament.
This view bears witness to an understanding of the political constraints of the European Union in the Middle East.
This realism was expressed very aptly by the High Representative of the CFSP, Mr Solana, in a recent interview with the SÃŒddeutsche Zeitung: "We can be persuasive, exert pressure, and grant financial aid, but we also know our limits.
The only country which can provide credible security guarantees for both sides is the United States."
In its conclusions, the General Council also particularly urges Israelis and Palestinians to make every effort to bring the current negotiations in Taba to a successful end.
According to spokespeople from both camps, these have now been concluded, and not without hope for the future.
However, how, in this specific context, have the Council and Commission taken the harsh accusations which the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Arafat, levelled at the state of Israel and its armed forces, in Davos at the beginning of this week?
Against the backdrop of the Israeli presidency elections to be held on 6 February, this verbal attack thwarted conclusively the plan for a meeting between the Israeli Prime Minister Barak and Arafat in Stockholm today.
Mr President, I would therefore like to hear the view of the Council and Commission on Mr Arafat' s international stance, which was anything but constructive.
At the end of its conclusions, the General Council lectures Israel on its economic and financial policy vis-Ã -vis the Palestinian Authority.
However, an equally critical tone on the public execution of two so-called 'collaborators' by the same Palestinian Authority is missing from this document.
Why is this?
After all, the Palestinian human rights organisations dared lodge a protest against a highly deficient judicial process which was challenged with good reason.
I take it that the Council and Commission are not applying their own standards of democratic rule of law on a case-by-case basis.
Mr President, the clear stance taken by the Swedish Presidency and Commissioner Patten in this debate have not betrayed my confidence.
Mr President, the European Union can no longer confine itself to observing from afar what is happening on the other side of the Mediterranean and clear its conscience by making mainly generous donations of funds, the use of which it has not always been able to regulate, as Commissioner Patten has just reminded us in so timely a fashion.
The European Union must accept its due responsibilities, alongside our American counterparts.
This is what you are striving to achieve, Mr Solana, in close collaboration with Mr Moratinos and many of us welcome the work that you have undertaken to this end.
Whilst waiting for the results of the changes taking place in Washington and those which will inevitably follow the results of the forthcoming elections in Israel, we understand that you are bound to be cautious and that it is difficult for you to make any sort of forecast at this time, Mr Solana, even if we might have detected a note of optimism in your speech, something we should be only too delighted to share.
The view of the Group of the European People' s Party, one I am sure is shared by many of the Members in other political groups, is that, through your work, the European Union should be involved, perfectly impartially, in the current Conciliation Procedure in order to enable the expected appeasement that comes before the hoped-for reconciliation to be reached.
The European Union can put itself forward as mediator only on condition that it is impartial. It cannot be neutral, as if it were not already directly involved.
Yet, unfortunately, this is not the impression that was recently given by the European Union, when it showed that it was divided in its opinion in the vote within the United Nations General Assembly of 20 October 2000.
Mr Solana, if you are to speak on behalf of the European Union, we must show a united front. So what is the state of affairs?
I direct the question to you as well as to the Council representative.
In your work with the governments of the Member States, have you noticed any commitment to harmonising our points of view?
That is my first question.
My second question is directed to both the Council and the Commission. It is the same question that I asked you in the previous debate, Mr Solana, when you could not find the time to give an answer.
Do you not think that the time has come for the European Union to take some intelligent action on the status of Jerusalem?
As I recall, we heard the Speaker of the Knesset and his Palestinian counterpart make some courageous proposals at Strasbourg.
Mr Solana, can we count on you to make it clear to your fellow negotiators, in the necessary diplomatic and firm manner, that Jerusalem is not just a city sacred to Judaism and Islam but also to all forms of Christianity?
Mr President, this debate is one more lesson that teaches us that the word peace means nothing if it is not accompanied by a political gesture, if it is not accompanied by the willingness to take the risk of making a decision.
Peace is a dangerous word if the European Union is required to use it but is not able to follow it up with action.
The action called for is political action, the full, direct assumption of political responsibility in the Middle East peace process.
The European Union, Mr President, must be fully involved in the peace process as more than merely a trading partner or a major contributing country, or it will not be involved at all.
I would remind you of the context which a number of other Members have already illustrated clearly: on the one hand, three United Nations resolutions on territories and displaced persons, disregarded by Israel even in terms of the affirmation of the principles they contain; and, on the other hand, a permanent state of emergency in the Palestinian territories: 120 thousand workers prevented from working, three billion dollars worth of damage already done, salaries only paid to government officials and administrators thanks to the intervention of European Union ready cash, half the civilian population under 18 years old killed.
Mr President, I do not care which side fires the bullets: whether they are fired by Israelis, Iraquis or Turks, it is the duty of the European Union to condemn the killing of children.
Lastly, Mr President, I am extremely concerned about apartheid, a word which should have no place in a discussion on the Middle East or Palestinian issues but which, I regret to say, applies to the situation we have to focus on.
My impression is that a system exists in the region whereby an Arab life and an Israeli life have different values, particularly in terms of humiliation and submission to the situation.
In the face of all this, it is impossible to preserve a neutral stance.
We must uphold rules and principles, especially if the Bush government is going to prove incapable of guaranteeing the affirmation of these rules and principles or unwilling to do so.
It is true - as Mr Solana said - that the negotiations are advancing, but, alongside the negotiations, the Israeli government is also proceeding with the establishment of fresh settlements.
This is why we cannot fully share Mr Solana's optimism.
Commissioner Patten tells us that we must look beyond the immediate crisis.
We agree.
Today our political duty is to achieve a peace agreement; tomorrow it will be to ensure that the agreement and international law are respected: the Middle East is relying on Europe, Mr President, because it has confidence in Europe.
If we do not believe in Europe ourselves, then their confidence will be of no avail.
Mr President, as some speakers have already said, the timing of this debate is critical, not just for the parties involved but for the European Union too.
It is critical, first of all, because the election of the Israeli prime minister is imminent.
This week, all sense of time has been suspended, pending the election results.
The talks at Taba were also suspended, at least officially, even though they did manage to make progress in terms of setting up committees on matters such as borders, Jerusalem, and Palestinian refugees.
Finally, although I picked up on Mr Solana' s optimism, the possibility of holding a summit this week in Stockholm has been put off too, following Mr Arafat' s statement made at Davos on Sunday, which was aggressive, or to put it more diplomatically, was unhelpful, to say the very least.
It is a critical time too, as I was saying, because of the transition in the United States. Bill Clinton is no longer in office.
President Clinton had made the peace process one of the priorities on his agenda.
Only time will tell how George Bush and Colin Powell now see their role in the Middle East.
At any rate, this is the first time for years, as Mr Danielsson said, that high level talks have taken place, as they did most recently at Taba, without American officials present, but with Mr Moratinos, our EU peace envoy.
This may be Europe' s opportunity to make progress and to play a more prominent political role in this matter, to gain recognition for its voice and its know-how, since we are keen to do more than just bankroll the region.
We know that our aid is vitally necessary for the Palestinians whose economic situation is desperate, but we would like to export much more than just euros.
We would like to export our values, such as democracy, respect for human rights, education and tolerance.
At this point, I welcome Mr Patten' s commitment to transparency in the use of European aid.
In the words of Albert Einstein, "Peace cannot be kept by force but can be achieved by understanding."
Let us work together from now on so that the European Union can be a factor in spreading this understanding.
Mr President, I would like to counsel, if I may, Mr Solana and my very good friend Commissioner Patten to exercise caution in relation to the Middle East at this present time.
I say that, not because I am scarcely an enthusiast for a European foreign policy, but because I believe that at this present time in Israel we are in a very difficult situation.
We have an election and I must remind the House that the State of Israel is the only democracy that exists in the region and that is something that is worth noting.
We have an election for a prime minister which will be crucial in relation to the future of the peace process so we must take care not to be seen as interventionist or interfering.
I remind the House, because I gather there is much fear that Mr Sharon may be elected prime minister, that the peace process in the Middle East, from the Israeli point of view, has always advanced under the Israeli right and it was Menachem Begin who started the rapprochement with Egypt.
I ask the House and I ask the Commission and the Council to proceed with caution.
I ask the European Union to do what it does best.
It has an influence over the Palestinians and it should exercise that influence.
It should be asking Chairman Arafat, for example, why the Palestinians permit in their textbooks the sort of anti-semitism which I hoped we had long put to one side in this world.
We should be asking Chairman Arafat to ensure that the aid that goes to the Palestinians goes to those who really need it.
So, in small measures and not in large - because the United States must take the lead in these matters - the European Union can play a role, but it should not exaggerate its importance.
The role is with the parties themselves, assisted by the great republic across the Atlantic.
Mr President, in this long peace process in the Middle East, we feel as if we are on a kind of roller coaster.
Time and time again we feel as if we are slowly and painfully climbing a slope and then, when it seems as if we are about to touch the sky, we plummet sharply back to square one.
This is a hellish and never-ending rise and fall - and it is also a bit like the legend of Sisyphus - which threatens to sap the strength and even the hope of almost everyone.
At the current time - and despite having heard optimistic words - one has the impression that we are once again at the bottom of the curve, with an Oslo Process which has been forsaken by many, with the conflict on the ground at an impasse and with elections in Israel which promise to offer an outcome which is far from favourable to peace.
Nevertheless, it is now that we have to recharge the batteries of our confidence and increase our efforts.
Today this process can be summed up in two affirmations: firstly, we cannot lose sight of our inescapable objective, which is peace in the region, a peace which must be established and consolidated on the basis of an acceptance by all sides of the rules of international law and decisions of the UN Security Council: and, secondly, Europe must once and for all, in attempting to resolve this conflict, assume the responsibility that befits our political influence, our values and our interests.
It is neither dignified nor coherent to continue to renounce the leading role which we should play, restricting ourselves to being, rather than negotiators, mere spectators to what the United States does or does not do.
We are, unfortunately, still in the old situation of 'paying but not playing' .
The actions of Ambassador Moratinos have been magnificent but, in order to be more effective, he needs political support which, unfortunately, he is not being given.
I believe that the Union should no longer delay in taking a leading role, and it is not enough to make statements but it should be precisely defined and filled with content including firm economic and political commitments.
Mr President, we have reached yet another crossroads in the peace process.
A great deal will depend on the forthcoming elections in Israel.
Whatever the outcome, we must call for the new government - whoever the winner may be - to continue the peace negotiations without delay and to do so with renewed energy and, if possible, intensify these negotiations.
It is a unique moment for the European Union to gain influence and importance during these talks, given the current situation in the United States, where the new administration has probably not been fully established.
It is our duty as the European Union to reinforce our position in the peace talks, in view of the exceptional interests - mainly humanitarian - which are at stake, in view of our geo-strategic position vis-Ã -vis that region and in view of our important mutual trade relations.
The most recent wave of violence and terror must be condemned in any event.
The demand for repatriation of the 3.7 million migrants will definitely not make the peace talks easier, nor will the distribution by the Palestinian authorities of schoolbooks which, instead of preaching the language of reconciliation, preach the language of hatred and animosity, or Arafat' s tough stance in Davos, for that matter.
Despite this, I would express the hope that peace and stability in that region can as yet be achieved in the relatively short term, but I would add at the same time that it would be extremely regrettable if the European Union had not contributed to this in a major way.
It is a test of our credibility at international level.
Mr President, I spent last week with a delegation from the European Parliament seeing the situation on the ground at the flash points of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, i.e. in Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron, Ramallah, Gaza and in refugee camps.
I am still reeling from the shock.
I travelled there believing myself to be well prepared through radio, TV, press and Commission documents as well as personal conversations I had had beforehand, but the reality was altogether different.
The living conditions were dreadful and shocking.
The situation was explosive to an unimaginable degree.
The concept of a state of war best describes the situation.
The situation of the people in the occupied areas, particularly in the refugee camps, some of which have existed for over thirty years, can be described as unfit for human habitation.
Neither human rights nor fundamental values such as dignity, freedom or democracy, not even the rights to freedom from bodily harm and hygiene are guaranteed and observed.
In the country I come from, people tread extremely carefully when it comes to criticising Israel.
There, it is far easier to portray the terrorism and executions committed by Palestinians, along with the claim that Palestinian children are sent into battle.
But consider this: those who have lived for over 35 years in a refugee camp of tin sheds, with sacking over windows and doors and no form of infrastructure, will have little faith in negotiations, especially when these same negotiations have dragged on for seven years now to no avail, and not even UN resolutions are recognised.
Incidentally, gatherings of people are dispersed by Israeli soldiers often enough.
We experienced this at first hand because our group came under fire.
Fortunately no one was injured.
What we found was an explosive atmosphere generated by fanatical people who are incapable of reaching compromises and for whom principles rule the day. They are there on both sides, I might add, although there appear to be more of them amongst the fundamentalist settlers, many of whom are still fairly new to the country.
Mr President, we often use the word 'tragedy' as if we were talking about a natural disaster, such as an earthquake.
To use the word 'tragedy' for situations such as the spread of mad cow disease - which is certainly heading towards disastrous proportions - or for the situation in Palestine is, in my view, inappropriate because, in both cases, specific people are responsible.
The horrific earthquakes that have struck El Salvador or India cannot be compared with the situation of frustration and humiliation suffered by the Palestinians at the moment.
This situation was absurdly aggravated by specific and identifiable people on 29 September on the terraces of the mosques in Jerusalem.
I am a friend of Palestine and I am not an enemy of Israel.
I believe that the provocation by Ariel Sharon in September, which was permitted by the people who could have prevented it, and the hundreds of Palestinian deaths since then, have created a climate in Palestinian society which makes it difficult for President Arafat to accept late - although maybe reasonable - peace proposals which, had they been presented earlier, would, in my view, have lead to an agreement.
Hence, a thorny issue, such as the right to return of the Palestinian refugees, could have been presented by the Palestinian Authority to its own constituents as an issue involving sensitive details which had to be dealt with in conjunction with the Israeli Government on the proviso, of course, that that government agreed, in time, to Palestinian demands that were easier to accept.
It remains to be seen whether, on the international stage, the new United States administration will adopt more of an isolationist approach than the previous one.
However, I believe that the departure of Clinton has meant that, for the moment, United States diplomacy in the region will be less active.
With all due respect and consideration for our American friends, I believe that this is an additional reason for the European Union to make an even greater effort to truly promote its role in the region.
Finally, I would like to make a couple of points.
Firstly, let us hope that the High Representative, Mr Solana, is right to predict that an agreement may be possible before 6 February - Inshallah - but let us not forget that Sharon is still casting his shadow.
Secondly, I have just returned from a visit by the European Parliament delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council and I would like to encourage all of those who are able to do so to go to Palestine, to go to Gaza and the West Bank, to go there, to have meetings, to look people in the eye and listen.
Perhaps they would come to understand better.
Mr President, Members who have been elected to this House have been elected by people of Europe to speak for Europe, to determine what role Europe can play on the international scene.
I am encouraged by the statement of Mr Danielsson, the confidence of Mr Solana and the excellent analysis of Commissioner Patten of the situation on the ground.
I was horrified to witness in the delegation last week the extent to which Palestine is a military occupation.
People of Europe have no idea of this.
It is unbelievable that there is a situation where the Palestinian Legislative Council cannot even meet.
Mayors of towns like Hebron were not able to escort us to places that our ambassador had arranged for us to see.
There is wrong on both sides, of course there is.
What I am against is the 33 years of negotiations which have led to nowhere, no solution, no peace.
Therefore, I believe that we in the European Union should take a more active role: supportive - not to replace the Americans in the peace process - but to support and give confidence to both sides that we are a fair, just, impartial broker.
We should also support the United Nations and the resolutions, because if UN resolutions are to be respected by countries like Iraq and Cuba, then they must also be respected by Israel and the Palestinians.
That is something that I hope Mr Solana and the Council will impress on both sides: if there are international agreements where there is international law, then both sides should abide by them.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one honourable Member - he is no longer present in the Chamber - said today that he felt the "role is with the parties themselves" .
If that were to be the case, and it was solely down to the warring parties, then I ask myself where is peace to be found?
Where have they managed to secure peace, and maintain it too?
No, I believe there is a need for mediation - and I would agree with all those who have made this point - especially with robust European participation.
Because unfortunately, hatred, coercion and attempts to put the partner under pressure using these methods, have regained the upper hand.
I do not feel, as has been said here, that we can expect to see the situation improve after the elections in Israel, particularly if Sharon takes over, bearing in mind what happened under Menachem Begin.
The point being that Mr Sharon has done nothing recently that could lead us to conclude that he is prepared to agree a peace deal.
On the contrary, his road to power is paved with various measures that prove the opposite to be true.
I completely agree with Commissioner Patten.
During all attempts to engage in talks - with both parties, of course - and indeed, that is the only way to perform a mediation role, we must make it crystal clear that we cannot tolerate a situation where the resources we deploy in the Middle East cannot be used productively because Israel, in particular, is putting Palestine under such pressure and cutting it off.
I have already come across this several times before in Parliament - the more Israel endeavours to cut off Palestine' s lifeline, the more aid Europe will send, which means that Israel can save on financial input to the peace process to a certain extent, and Europe alone then has to pick up the tab.
This is completely unacceptable.
If we must shoulder this financial burden - and I, for one, truly feel that we must - then obviously there must also be strong political engagement.
Notwithstanding all the pessimism, which unfortunately, I myself share, I hope that the High Representative will ultimately prove justified in his optimism, and that he will be able to strengthen Europe' s role.
If the US were to withdraw from the process or keep more in the background, clearly this would be Europe' s big chance to play a fitting political role in the Middle East.
Mr President, the situation in the Middle East currently presents us with a paradox.
On the one hand, some of the participants in the peace talks believe that both parties have never been so close to reaching an agreement.
The High Representative also seems to share this optimistic point of view.
On the other hand, one of the candidates in the Israeli elections declared the Oslo peace process to be dead in the water.
The fact is that we are, once again, at a crossroads where the European Union should send out a message and a warning.
I address my comments to the Council and to the Commission.
The message should be that it will not be possible to not reach a fair and lasting solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine without reference to international law, such as that laid down by the United Nations Security Council resolutions.
The requirements that Israel must evacuate the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees must have the right of return, Israel must have the right to live in peace within secure and recognised borders and Palestinians must have the right to their own sovereign, viable and undivided state, whose international borders are open and which is not under military control, are inextricably linked and all these rights must be fulfilled at the same time.
Jerusalem is an historic city and, as it were, part of the heritage of the entire human race. It must again become an open city again, to which everyone has access.
The world community, particularly the European Union, would not allow the fair balance to be upset, putting either party at an advantage or at a disadvantage.
Under these circumstances, the warning could be formulated thus: that the European Union formally calls for an end to violence and for talks to go ahead but, at the same time, as commercial partner and financial sponsor, it will take the necessary action against any parties who believe they can pull out of the talks and abandon the attempt to find a global and definitive compromise that is universally acceptable.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like just briefly to comment following this very interesting debate on the important and difficult issue of the situation in the Middle East.
The recurrent theme of the contributions from the majority of the honourable Members is that the European Union must play a greater political role.
The major role we already play in terms of economic cooperation with this conflict-stricken region must be supplemented by a greater political role.
In all humility, I should like to state that, right now, the European Union is playing a greater political role than it has ever done before.
Why do I say this?
Partly in response to Mr Morillon.
I believe there is today a greater desire than in the past for what Mr Morillon calls a harmonisation of policy vis-Ã -vis the Middle East.
True enough, there may still be differences of degree in the way this is felt.
Nonetheless, there is a very strong common desire, noted by the presidency in its contacts with all the other Member States, to work together for a peaceful solution.
I should like to say that, during the first 30 days of the Swedish Presidency of the European Union' s Council, no issue has occupied the Swedish prime minister, as President of the Council, more than that of the situation in the Middle East.
Nor has there been any issue that has occupied the Swedish Foreign Minister, as President of the General Affairs Council, more than the situation in the Middle East.
I believe the same applies to the High Representative, who can certainly answer that question for himself.
The European Union is, then, also engaged in the political process in the most intimate way possible, but we are still awaiting the practical results.
I share the High Representative' s, Mr Solana' s, cautious optimism, but we have to remember, of course, that what we are dealing with in the Middle East is a basically very difficult political conflict.
If we are to be able to achieve any kind of progress, it is genuinely necessary for the European Union to be closely coordinated internally, to cooperate closely with the United Nations and its General Secretary and to cooperate closely with the United States, which has been indefatigable in its attempts to solve this conflict.
If this happens, then I believe our optimism may also be rewarded with practical results.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I only wish to clarify certain issues, without getting into a great historical debate, since I do not believe that this is the moment to do so nor is it the moment for us to all to start discussing problems that are not germane.
Ladies and gentlemen, some of you have recently visited the region.
I must tell you that I have been visiting it since 1991, more or less continuously.
We have seen an enormous amount of suffering.
Those of us who have seen so much suffering want to try to reach a peaceful and lasting situation.
That is the commitment that those of us who are involved in trying to find a solution at the moment wish to achieve.
I would like to say that it is not advisable at the moment to appeal for frenzied optimism.
It would not be sensible to do so, but I honestly believe that the connotations of the problem have never been so well defined and we are therefore in a better position to move towards a solution.
Why do I say this?
We all know that, in order to find a solution to this immensely serious problem, we must define the territory and be prepared to talk about it, we must define the security conditions and be prepared to talk about them, we must define the future of Jerusalem and be prepared to negotiate it, and we must negotiate the issue of refugees and be prepared to do so.
For the first time the four or five most important parameters have now been defined, and both sides have accepted them as the important parameters to be defined and accepted, and they have begun to negotiate them seriously and in depth.
This is an historic step forward.
The problem that leads me to be less than hopeful is that, unfortunately, time has not been well managed.
If we had had a rather longer period of political calm, I sincerely believe that we could be optimistic at this time.
But now I am not so optimistic because time unfortunately depends on the electoral and political calendar and there is little we can do about it.
But anybody who wants to negotiate, in this case with the European Union, must accept the challenge of reaching agreements on the basis that there will be two states in the region, which are capable of defining the four parameters which I have mentioned: territories, security, the capital and the refugees.
The European Union has proposed possible solutions to these four issues.
Please do not imagine, ladies and gentlemen, that the people involved in the various presidencies, in this case the Swedish Presidency, have not put forward suggestions and ideas for making progress.
The problem is that the proposal does not always miraculously coincide with the exact solution necessary at any particular moment.
However, Mr Morillon, with regard to Jerusalem, you must believe me when I say that many suggestions have been put forward.
These suggestions cannot perform miracles, they cannot fall outside a particular framework with which we are all familiar, and you have clearly indicated what this must be.
I will also say that, with regard to the settlements, the European Union has taken a brilliant and generous position.
This position indicates that a policy of settlements such as the current one is not acceptable.
We have said so, we will continue to say so and I can assure you that, for my part, I will always condemn the current policy.
There will be no definitive solution without a solution also to this issue of the settlements.
We know this and anybody who has been involved in this horrific conflict knows this.
The concern which I do have and the cause of the deep sadness which I also feel is that, as some of you have said, the Oslo Process is beginning to lose the political support of both sides, which it had a few years ago.
It is true that the Oslo Process - not peace - is not accepted as intensely and in the same way by all the parties as it was a few years ago.
For some, it has not offered the security that they wanted, and for others it has not brought the change that they expected and wanted in their everyday lives.
Hence the frustration of some and the lack of security of others.
And that, to a large extent, explains why the current debate is experiencing such difficulties.
I would like to say that, on the part of the European Union, we will do everything possible, with your support, and with the support of the governments and parliaments, to continue making progress, but it is true that there is a limit to what all of us can do to promote the process.
It is the parties directly involved which have to reach an agreement, and the rest of us can only try to put in place the economic, social and political conditions for that agreement to be reached.
My own experience over recent months has shown me that the parties have never before spoken in such a devoted and generous way and have never come so close to solving the problems.
And that was my hope.
Unfortunately, you are perhaps right and it has been a vain hope.
I would be extremely sorry if that were the case.
Mr President, I hope this will not seem like an anti-climax after the excellent speech that we have just heard in response to the debate, but there is one point which has come up in a previous debate and in two speeches this evening that I would like to deal with once and for all.
At least one of the honourable Members who made the point today is in the Chamber and perhaps I can deal with it now, for the record, and we can regard it as having been sorted out.
It is the question of textbooks, which I know has been of concern to a number of honourable Members of the House.
I want to make it clear that the Commission rejects any attempt to use the educational system to promote intolerance or hatred.
It is worth noting that the main focus of the Commission' s assistance has always been to promote a culture of peace, tolerance and human rights in the Middle East.
For example, in recent years we have financed several projects, worth about EUR 4.5 million, to foster dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian youth.
I want to make this point absolutely clear.
The Commission has never allocated funds for the development of a new school curriculum nor for the printing and distribution of school textbooks.
The development of school curricula and the preparation of textbooks are the responsibility of the Palestinian Centre for Curriculum Development.
It was established in 1995 with the assistance of Member States through UNESCO. Since then the Centre has undertaken the charge of harmonising the hitherto separate educational systems - the Egyptian for the Gaza Strip and the Jordanian for the West Bank - and of organising a new curriculum that meets the needs of the new situation.
Only last year did the Palestinian Authority issue their own textbooks for Grades 1 to 6.
No sign of anti-Semitic content has been found in these new books.
Books used prior to that were, I am advised, the official textbooks in Jordan and Egypt and were authorised by Israel for the West Bank and Gaza until 1994 at least - after they had been subject to some editorial control.
I hope that has made clear the Commission' s position on this issue.
The Commission has had nothing to do with textbooks and we deplore any promotion of intolerance particularly among young people and particularly through the education system.
It was worth making the point at this stage, because it has been raised before.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Plan Colombia
The next item is the debate on the following oral questions:
B5Â­0002/2001 by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to the Council, on the plan to build peace and prosperity and strengthen the State, known as 'Plan Colombia' .
B5Â­0003/2001 by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to the Commission, on the plan to build peace and prosperity and strengthen the State, known as 'Plan Colombia' .
Mr President, I wish, first of all, to thank the Council and the Commission for the willingness they have shown today to address an issue of such importance, current relevance and seriousness as the situation in Columbia, which the Committee on Development and Cooperation is monitoring and will continue to monitor with the greatest attention and concern.
It has become clear that the European Union cannot only not remain indifferent to the current situation in that country, in the same way that it cannot - or rather must not - adopt half-hearted positions on this issue.
We are all aware of the situation in Columbia.
Indeed, there is no shortage of documentation from the most varied sources attesting to the tragedy affecting Columbia and the real risks of the conflict worsening, with serious danger, moreover, of it spreading to the rest of the region.
In this regard, I would emphasise the concerns expressed by representatives at the highest level of various Latin American countries at the meeting held on this issue in Rio de Janeiro, in the middle of last year.
The crucial factor in the current situation is undoubtedly 'Plan Columbia' , which was agreed in September 1999 between Presidents Clinton and Pastrana, and it is essential that the Council and the Commission stick to their positions and distance themselves even more vigorously from this agreement.
They must do so first of all because of its blatantly military nature, but also because it is not the result of any consultation process. Instead, it has generated widespread opposition both inside and outside the country, because it completely fails to address the grave phenomenon of paramilitary activity and, consequently, because it threatens the very negotiation process that has already been started.
Also, because this plan, which concentrates on the elimination of drug production and trafficking (by attacking producers, particularly through the use of chemical and biological fumigation), not only threatens Columbia' s rich biodiversity, but will also exacerbate the tragedy of displaced people, who might even have to become refugees in neighbouring countries.
We are familiar with the statement by the General Affairs Council of 9 October last year.
We obviously agree, in essence, with its proposals and we interpret it as moving away from 'Plan Colombia' .
In fact, we believe this to be the position of the vast majority of Member State governments.
It is also true, however, that some are attempting to read a complementarity-based approach into this Council declaration with regard to 'Plan Colombia' .
We therefore consider a clarification of the Community position to be crucial, which will prevent an interpretation of it which we believe is abusive, even if this runs counter to the opinion of any of the Member State governments, particularly from the only one that has publicly given a financial and political commitment to the plan.
As a matter of fact, I believe that the European Union, and the European Parliament itself, must not support an initiative that clearly stems from a bilateral agreement between the Colombian Government and the US administration.
I feel all the more strongly about this because I do not think it should be the European Union' s task to heal the wounds resulting from the actions of third parties.
Basically, as we stated in the motion for a resolution adopted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and as we have stated in a previous resolution by this Parliament, our understanding is that any action by the European Union must be accompanied by a strategy of its own which does not have a military dimension.
This is the attitude that I hope will prevail on the approach of European governments towards the Colombian Government on 30 April in Brussels.
Incidentally, it is our view that this European Union strategy should start from the premise that the armed conflict that is affecting Colombia is by no means confined to the drugs problem alone.
It actually predates that problem by a long way and is fundamentally rooted in deep-seated, pernicious political, economic and social phenomena in the country.
That is why I feel that a reform that guarantees another form of distribution of wealth and, specifically, a different form of land distribution by implementing a process of agricultural reform, is crucial and a matter of priority.
In fact, we also feel that the problem of drug production and trafficking requires a global approach on the basis of shared responsibility and international cooperation between the producer countries and the consumer countries, which, in the first instance, involves combating the laundering of money generated by trafficking.
The European Union' s strategy must also take account of the crucial importance of putting an end to the actions of the paramilitary groups and the impunity with which they operate, often in conjunction with Colombian military forces. These groups are mainly responsible for the wholesale massacres of communities and even of Europeans working with them.
By the same token, the European Union cannot brush aside the sense of trauma that pervades Colombia as a result of the persecution and massacre of countless leaders and members of the Patriotic Union, committed immediately after their participation in an electoral process.
In short, the European Union must fully commit itself to a genuine peace process, which 'Plan Columbia' cannot be taken to be and which it even thwarts.
We also need to continue to cooperate with Colombia and consolidate this cooperation, which would require, as a matter of priority, an effective commitment by the Colombian Government to implementing structural reforms and the involvement of communities and their organisations in solving the enormous problems that are affecting and overwhelming the country.
I hope that this is also the view of the Commission and the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the honourable Member, Mr Miranda, for putting his question to the Council and, in that way, giving us the opportunity to discuss the important issue of how the European Union can best contribute to peace and mutual understanding in Colombia.
Let me also begin by saying that the specific situation in Colombia and what the European Union may be able to do in that connection were matters which the Swedish Presidency had the opportunity to discuss face to face with President Pastrana during his visit to Stockholm last week.
The European Union is aware of the serious, multifaceted and interdependent problems faced by Colombia.
We believe that an integrated strategy is absolutely essential if it is to be possible to solve these problems.
On several occasions, the European Union has confirmed its intention, as far as possible and in the most appropriate way, to support the efforts to get a peace process under way in Colombia, founded upon respect for human rights and basic freedoms.
In its statement on 19 January of this year, the European Union expressed its deep concern about the fact that the armed conflict in Colombia had become more serious and at the fact that the suffering of the civilian population had increased.
The Union is convinced that the conflict can only be solved by means of a negotiated agreement and therefore calls for the peace negotiations to be resumed.
Since October 1999 when President Pastrana, here in the European Parliament, asked for the EU' s help for his plan for peace, prosperity and a strengthening of state power, the Council has had the opportunity, in response to a number of questions from honourable Members, to repeat the main features of the European Union' s position on Colombia and to inform the European Parliament of the way in which the work on this important matter has developed.
At its meeting on 9 October of last year, the Council confirmed its political support for the efforts to achieve peace that have been made by the democratically elected bodies in Colombia, as well as its desire to join the international community in actively monitoring the negotiation process - a process which, within the framework of consultation with civil society and with the agreement of all parties involved, should lead to a peace founded upon human rights, humanitarian law and basic freedoms.
Within the context of a continuation of the current peace efforts, the Council also gave notice of its intention to introduce a practical and independent European programme for socio-economic and institutional aid to the peace process in Colombia - a programme aimed at promoting and safeguarding respect for human rights, humanitarian law and basic freedoms, at improving living conditions for the local population, at encouraging the replacement of crops and the protection of bio-diversity and at supporting the programme of structural reforms in all areas which give succour to the armed conflict.
At the second meeting with the support group for the peace process in Colombia, held in BogotÃ¡ on 24 October last year, the Commission stated that the Community' s support for President Pastrana' s peace efforts would amount to EUR 105 million during the period 2000-2006. Approximately EUR 40 million of these funds would be allocated to economic and social development and the fight against poverty, approximately EUR 30 million to so-called alternative development and EUR 25 million to support for reforms of the judicial system and for the promotion of human rights.
The Commission has also stated that it is going to increase the additional support granted to disaster aid projects through ECHO.
The Member States are still studying how much is to be set aside for a European aid package for Colombia, but the majority have already communicated their intentions on this matter.
The Commission has undertaken to coordinate the efforts to set up an aid package of this kind.
When it comes to the fight against drugs - discussed under paragraph 8 of Parliament' s resolution of 7 September of last year, to which the honourable Member refers - the European Union has also emphasised the crucial importance of combating this scourge which directly affects all European states and their citizens.
The EU has set up a mechanism for cooperating with Latin American and Caribbean countries on drug issues, a mechanism whose action plan was approved in April 1999 and received considerable political support from Heads of State and Government at the 1999 Rio de Janeiro Summit between the European Union and Latin American and Caribbean countries.
To facilitate the changeover to other products for export, Colombia is also covered by the Generalised System of Preference, or GSP, and, since 1990, also by the Occasional Extra System of Preference.
A number of chemical precursors were signed in 1995 between the European Union and the Andean countries and have now come into force.
The Council has not expressed an opinion on the United States' s contribution to Plan Colombia, a significant part of which is intended to be used in the fight against the drugs trade, because this is an issue affecting bilateral relations between Colombia and the United States.
In conclusion, I should like to remind the honourable Member of the guidelines - adopted as part of the orientation debate at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 22 and 23 January of this year - for reinforced operational coordination between the Community, represented by the Commission, and the Member States in the area of external aid.
Hopefully, this will help us in the future to adopt an integrated approach to situations such as that in Colombia.
The EU has offered both political and financial support to the peace initiative of President Pastrana of Colombia.
We are well aware of the concerns that the military component of Plan Colombia has created especially among representatives of civil society both in Colombia and in Europe.
The EU reservations about some aspects of Plan Colombia are well known to President Pastrana and to his government.
The Commission does not intend to take part in any initiative with a military dimension.
In terms of the fight against drugs we will continue to subscribe to the global and balanced approach endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly special session on drugs of June 1998.
Thus in Bogota last October the EU stressed the need not to put alternative development projects at risk by non-selective operation of illicit crop eradication.
Within this context we continue to focus on positive measures such as demand reduction, promoting new crops, offering market opportunities in Europe and strengthening the rule of law.
As honourable Members may know, the EU decided last October to establish a European support package for the peace process in Colombia whose overall amounts should be decided at the next donors' meeting.
This package of European support covers contributions both from EU Member States and the EU itself.
All EU Member States indicated their willingness to provide financial contributions to this package and the majority of them have already put forward their pledges.
As the Swedish Presidency just announced, EUR 105 million of programmable aid will be made available by the Commission over the period 2000-2006.
These funds will be dedicated to modernising administration, strengthening democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights, protecting the environment and developing alternative crops.
Emphasis will also be put on tackling a series of structural problems in the country and, in particular, political, social and economic reforms.
The Commission will also continue to provide humanitarian aid to assist the all too many displaced people in Colombia.
This non-programmable aid has amounted to EUR 24 million since 1997.
This year it is envisaged that about EUR 10 million will be made available for these kinds of interventions.
These areas of cooperation are also priority areas for the government.
The EU intends to make its contribution effective as soon as possible.
For this reason a mission including experts supplied by the Commission and the Member States is at this moment in Colombia in order to identify a project in an area called the Magdalena Medio, for which the Commission could earmark around EUR 20 million.
In this region, violence is at its highest level and the EU initiative will target the promotion of dialogue between the parties in conflict.
This will constitute effective implementation of the concept of a peace laboratory.
The conclusions of these experts' mission should be available by the end of February.
Apart from our financial commitment, Europe is also increasing its political role in the conflict.
I shall mention the presence of several Member States in the Group of Friends which secured the meeting area with the National Liberation Army agreed on 26 January as well as the meeting promoted by the presidency with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in Paris on 15 December.
One last word about the risk of an extension of the Colombian conflict to neighbouring countries.
Many have raised their concerns, notably Ecuador and Brazil.
There has been, indeed, an increased flow of refugees crossing the border in the affected areas.
For this reason the EU emphasised the need for a regional approach to the drug problem and more specifically to the Colombian conflict.
This will be one of the major topics of the next EU-Andean Community meeting on drugs scheduled for the second quarter of this year.
The objective will be to put more emphasis on an overall strategy in order to counter the phenomenon of the transfer of illicit crops from one country to another.
Summing up, we very much welcome this debate and we very much support the line expressed by Mr Miranda.
Mr President, there is no doubt that the conflict which has been going on in Colombia for more than thirty years cannot be resolved by military means.
We agree, Commissioner, that violence can only create more violence.
That is why the PPE Group takes a positive view, not only of what strictly constitutes the Colombia Plan to put an end to the production and trafficking in drugs, but also of the concerted efforts of President Pastrana to hold dialogue with the guerrilla movement and his proposed strategy to deal with the problem at its roots and attack its causes, because the objectives of this strategy are to create alternatives which will facilitate the economic and social recovery of Colombia, the resolution of the armed conflict with the guerrilla movement, the strengthening of the democratic institutions, social development and finally the fight against drug trafficking.
In fact, unless the violence is not brought to an end through dialogue, unless rural workers are offered alternatives which will enable them to lead dignified lives, unless the serious problem of displaced people is resolved, unless human rights are respected, unless the foundations on which the rule of law is based are strengthened and impunity is brought to an end, unless drug trafficking is brought to an end, peace in Colombia will be nothing more than a fantasy.
It therefore seems to us to be essential - and we are delighted about it - that the European Union should support President Pastrana' s peace efforts in the way that the President-in-Office of the Council has just announced and also in the way that the Commission, through Commissioners Patten and Nielson, had announced previously and which it has just reiterated.
Thanks to this aid, we are making a contribution to resolving the situations of social justice and to improving the living conditions of the local population, as well as strengthening the democratic institutions.
It also seems essential to us that FARC' s leaders return to the negotiating table and that the time period for the peace zone be extended beyond the weekend which President Pastrana has just proposed, so that the peace talks may continue and reach a successful conclusion.
But this is also why, since we are determined to find peace and well-being for the people of Colombia, we ask that President Pastrana intensify his fight against the paramilitaries and armed groups which violate human rights and spread pain and death amongst the civil population, and we also ask him to apply the United Nations resolutions on human rights.
This is the only way, with the concerted effort of all of us, with a truly intense and decisive fight for peace, that it will be possible for hope to return to the people of Colombia.
Mr President, the violence in Colombia is a matter of great concern to Parliament. We have already passed a series of resolutions in support of the peace process in recent years.
We hope for a genuine peace process, based on a consensus amongst the various parties to the conflict and civil society, including NGOs, farmers' organisations and local communities. That is quite different from a plan amounting to financing fumigation and likely to exclude dialogue with the main players involved in the peace process.
Europe' s external action in Latin America has proved successful when Europe has conducted its own independent policy, promoting solutions and imbuing its cooperation programmes with its own political values regarding human rights, democracy and social cohesion.
It is worth recalling events in Central America leading to the San JosÃ© dialogue. On that occasion, the European Community as it then was supported a regional solution instead of taking sides in the East-West conflict.
The European Union must adopt this distinctive approach and promote it at international level.
To this end, as I understand it, the Council and the Commission are prepared to support an independent autonomous approach and to fight against drugs.
However, the fight against drugs goes beyond crop-spraying. Furthermore, collusion with the United States' military plans is out of the question as far as we are concerned.
Crop replacement has to be preceded by a dialogue with the peasant farmers, who must be offered other possibilities for development.
A commitment to sustainable development is also called for: we are already aware that fumigation using Fusarium oxysporum is harmful to the environment.
Government cooperation is required to facilitate redistribution of the land so as to guarantee the farmers' survival and put an end to mass migration.
In short, a different plan is needed, one based on negotiation.
As regards Community cooperation, we are somewhat concerned that the EUR 105 million of aid planned may not be allocated to specific projects to combat poverty and promote human rights. We should like to receive more details concerning these various funds.
In particular, we would like some guarantee that NGOs will cofinance the projects for which the funds are intended and will therefore be involved in their management This would also represent a guarantee for the future of Colombia and of this Plan Colombia.
According to the information available to me at present, there are currently no NGO cooperation programmes cofinanced by the Commission in Colombia.
If indeed there are some, I would like details on them.
What type of programmes are they?
In short, we believe that the European Union must pursue its own policy in Colombia. This policy should involve genuine peace, dialogue, the elimination of poverty and prospects for sustainable development.
No other route can lead to peace, especially not unpredictable military moves by the United States. The latter are certainly not acceptable to this House, and after what I have heard today, I trust they are not acceptable to the Council or to the Commission either.
I believe it is important to make this clear. If we succeed in drawing up a sound peace plan for Colombia with the European Union acting independently, today will have been a good day.
Mr President, the population of Colombia is suffering under a regime of poverty, violence and drugs.
These three problems can only be solved in interrelation to one another.
Many Columbians live in dead-end situations.
More than half the population earns less than two dollars a day.
The inequality is shocking.
Three percent of Columbians own 70% of the land.
Many farmers rely on growing coca and poppy as their only means of existence.
Social inequality, violent traditions and the lack of state power give guerrilla fighters and paramilitary units free reign to sustain their unscrupulous acts of terror.
Their fight for power is essentially a fight for drugs.
Lawlessness reigns supreme, and human rights violations are legion.
Needless to say, the world drugs problem must mainly be tackled at root level, that is to say also in the producing countries themselves.
That is why it is essential for farmers in Columbia to be offered a reasonable alternative to producing drugs.
This should also be the focal point of the European contribution.
In addition, Europe and America must, of course, also open up their markets to alternative products from Columbia.
A unilateral military approach will not offer any solace as long as the deeper causes are not addressed.
So far, the contamination of plantations has resulted in serious environmental damage and horrific disorders in people, as well as in a shift of production.
However, we should at the same time not be naÃ¯ve.
We need to realise that a hard-line approach is sometimes required vis-Ã -vis the drugs mafia.
It is not always possible to win over big-time villains by negotiation alone.
Europe should mainly focus on the outcome.
The world must be set free from drugs and the Columbian population from poverty and violence.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, exactly which Plan Colombia are we discussing here?
Is it the first version which was sent straight to us, in English, from the United States before being submitted to the Colombian Congress or the second version, intended for Europe, which stresses the social aspect but certainly does nothing to conceal the basically military nature of the plan.
This programme of aid to the Colombian Government aims to combat drug production and trafficking.
How is it going to do this?
By providing the Colombian Government with weapons.
This military equipment is apparently going to be used to destroy cocaine plantations.
You will forgive me if I am somewhat dubious about the use of these weapons in a country which, since 1948, has been devastated by a war sparked off by socio-economic reasons that are valid today, but which is increasingly becoming a war between the military-paramilitary alliance and the people.
Exactly who does Plan Colombia see as the opposing forces?
Officially, it is the Colombian State combating drug traffickers.
In reality, the drug barons are protected by paramilitary groups, who are in turn trained by the Colombian army.
These are the groups that are killing peasant farmers, the coca growers, and driving out the people living in areas valued highly by the oil companies.
That is without even mentioning the pressure exerted on the supporters of the 'Nunca MÃ s' project who are fighting to keep the memory of these atrocities alive.
On the pretext of combating drugs, a war is being waged against the civilian population,.
This plan provides direct support to the murderers, by which I mean the paramilitary groups, that have already killed over 150 people since the start of the year and whose close links with the army are obvious.
Moreover, on no account can the European Union sanction the lack of democracy or legitimacy evident at the signing of this agreement between the American and Colombian Governments.
The European Union and the Member States should not cooperate with this plan; they should oppose it, as do the NGOs and local social movements.
There is no question of sharing the responsibility with America.
Responsibility for what?
Millions of deaths?
Can we accept Plan Colombia?
I support the view of the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
We shall, therefore, vote in favour of this resolution which, far from recommending arms donations, proposes quite the opposite approach, i.e. to encourage scaling down armed conflict, to fight the association of the military and paramilitary groups, to show respect for those working in defence of human rights and to improve the living conditions of the population in conjunction with social movements, rather than against them.
Holding talks is the way to achieve peace, not waging war.
Mr President, although the whole of Latin America suffers from inequalities which ultimately lead to violence, Colombia is where these tragic dynamics are manifested in their crudest and most dramatic form. Indeed, as a doctor and teacher of medicine, I can tell you that a branch of epidemiology known as the 'epidemiology of violence' has come into being in Colombia.
The European Union has made conflict prevention and the peaceful and negotiated resolution of conflicts a fundamental principle of its international role.
Plan Colombia, drawn up between the United States and President Pastrana with no involvement by the Colombian Congress, is diametrically opposed to that principle.
Consequently, I returned yesterday from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre bearing a specific undertaking I am prepared to defend in this House. A group of parliamentarians drawn from Latin America, Europe and other parts of the world gave this undertaking to make it quite clear that we should say no to Plan Colombia and yes to a negotiated and peaceful solution to the conflict.
Herein lies the difference between the European Union and others who have intervened.
Arguably, the best way to combat drug trafficking is to dismantle the international networks for the distribution and laundering of dirty money.
The best solution to violence is to persevere with peaceful efforts to achieve democracy, negotiating with and dismantling the paramilitary networks linked to the army and to the state apparatus.
The best solution to poverty and inequality is to push ahead with social reform to ensure rights for all.
The opportunity before us is there for all to see.
Mr President, some confusion has arisen over the current dramatic situation in Colombia. It might be useful to recall that just a few days after his election victory - which incidentally was the greatest and most significant victory by a Colombian President in recent years - President Pastrana met with the top leadership of the FARC, the largest and most long-standing guerrilla group in the Americas.
It was the first time in thirty years of conflict that a President-elect came face to face with the leaders of a guerrilla movement on Colombian soil.
Three weeks after his investiture, the leadership of the ELN, the second largest guerrilla group in the country and representatives of civil society reached an agreement in the German town of Mainz.
Negotiating tables were set up, and a demilitarised zone the size of Switzerland was established under guerrilla control.
Unfortunately however, this whole period has been characterised by a conspicuous absence of peace.
Furthermore, violence, murders, extortion, kidnaps and sabotage by left and right-wing armed groups have become more widespread than ever.
Combined with the widespread climate of violence the country is enduring this situation has given rise to considerable scepticism regarding resolution of the conflict.
What can the European Union do, faced with such a situation?
As stated by the Commission and the Council, the only possible way forward is to support a specific European Union response aimed at promoting the strengthening of institutions, respect for human rights, alternative development, humanitarian aid and social development.
Commissioner, Representative of the Council, let me put it to you: do you really believe that at this critical juncture Colombia can allow itself the luxury of foregoing the aid and resources being assembled thanks to international solidarity?
An effort is clearly called for. It is also clear, Mr President, that moderation becomes reprehensible when it shies away from commitment.
The European Union cannot and must not enter into any commitment other than a firm commitment to offer strong support for peace.
For peace to be possible, three conditions must be met: cessation of criminal violence, a return to the negotiating table on the part of the guerrillas - President Pastrana has issued an appeal for them to do so and we hope it will be heeded-, and a firm commitment by the government to ensure that all the players in the peace process - every single one of them - reap the benefits of peace, along with civil society.
Mr President, I am convinced that generosity, realism, and bold and imaginative proposals are the way forward. Above all, good will is the key to a solution to the Colombian problem which the European Union is able to endorse, as the Council and Commission representatives have stated here today.
Mr President, the European Union should combat the illegal drugs trade and support a genuine peace process in Colombia but it cannot, must not, should not, do so by cooperating with Plan Colombia.
This is a barely disguised military strategy, sponsored by the US, whose effect will simply be to escalate the conflict, to aggravate the abuse of human rights and at best displace drug production.
Three quarters of the US contribution to the package is military assistance; only 6% will focus on human rights and only 4% will be put towards helping displaced people.
How anyone can argue that this is a plan that will support the peace process is baffling when only 1% of the US contribution is set aside for this specific purpose.
Plan Colombia was not a product of consultation with civil society at a local, national or international level; it was never approved by the Colombian Congress.
It has been the object of opposition in every sector of society, local communities, democratically elected governors, the Catholic Church, non-governmental organisations.
Support for it would therefore damage the trust and credibility the EU has earned with its projects and in its relations with local communities.
As for aerial spraying, what is proposed is no less than the use of biological weapons.
The toxic fungus spray used to kill the coca has been found to have caused fever in local people, to kill cattle and fish and it has been shown to attack the immune system of humans with effects up to and including death.
Dr Mondragon, giving evidence in this Parliament earlier this month, showed that the fumigation of 22,000 hectares of illegal crops last year in Colombia did not prevent 38,000 hectares of new cultivation because the problem is one of no alternative for the peasant farmers.
I welcome tonight, Mr Danielsson' s statement that European support will be independent.
This Parliament must support his efforts with Swedish NGOs behind the scenes to promote the peace process for all parties involved that was started in Costa Rica.
I am very glad that he was representing the Council and not Mr Solana, who scuttled out before the start of the debate, and who so badly misrepresented the EU when at the Madrid meeting last July he made a pre-emptive statement in support of Plan Colombia.
I very much welcome Commissioner Nielson' s commitment tonight to have nothing to do with the military strategy.
That is what this Parliament calls for, but he should disown the Commission press statement of September last year which expressed support for the plan.
Mr Salafranca says there is confusion.
There is no confusion.
