It is unacceptable for the European Union to pursue this policy aiming to make our neighbours take on the role of policing our borders.
It is unacceptable because the partner countries do not support it and because the European Parliament has already been very clear in its condemnation of this trend.
But were we consulted at any stage of the negotiation of these national action plans?
In order to be successful, the European Union's policy must be reciprocal, in other words it must respond to the interests of both sides.
It is also important for the European Union's policy to be consistent.
We cannot, for example, ask our neighbours to conclude readmission agreements, while certain Member States do not respect the provisions of the Geneva Convention.
Nor can we, on the one hand, encourage them to respect human rights and democratic principles and, on the other, close our eyes to flagrant breaches of those rights and principles committed in the name of the fight against terrorism.
With regard to human rights, the Commission is negotiating the setting up of 'human rights and democracy' subcommittees.
These are important forums for evaluating our effectiveness in this regard.
I therefore find it regrettable that the European Union is not making of an more effort to set up such subcommittees with certain states, such as Israel, for example.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Tannock, for an excellent report dealing with the relations of the European Union with its neighbours and the creation of aÂ ring of friends around the European Union.
In helping our neighbours we are, in fact, helping ourselves.
The ring comprises countries that do not aspire to EU membership but are keen on close cooperation with the EU, as well as other countries that would like to become members but are as yet unable to meet the criteria for becoming candidate countries.
It is commendable that association agreements and action plans have been signed with these countries, and that these countries are committed to taking all the necessary steps to participate in the EUâs internal market and are harmonising their legislation with that of the EU.
As we review the implementation of these agreements several years on, it appears that some of the goals were ambitious but not realistic.
The EU is offering substantial financial assistance to the countries covered by the neighbourhood policy.
It is, however, necessary to oversee compliance with other important provisions of the agreements, dealing with respect for human rights.
The violation of these provisions can lead to the suspension or cessation of financial assistance.
It seems that these provisions exist only on paper and that the countries in question continue to receive financial assistance in spite of blatant human rights violations.
IÂ therefore urge the improvement of compliance monitoring in this field.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, firstly, I want to say that MrÂ Tannockâs report on the European neighbourhood policy is a document I fully support, and I can only congratulate him on his excellent work.
His report shows that he is very familiar with European history and the current lie of the land.
It is only those who are knowledgeable about the past who can also respond to the challenges of tomorrow.
The conditions under which he has worked have not, however, always been easy, for the European neighbourhood policy now extends to include, on the one hand, European countries that are entitled to apply for membership and that may become EU Member States and, on the other hand, non-European countries that cannot become EU Member States.
In my personal opinion, the neighbourhood policy should only apply to countries that are neighbours of Europe.
Countries that are European and that wish to accede to membership should not be regarded as neighbours but as potential EU Member States and should be given clear prospects of joining the EU.
Moreover, the debate on these issues has recently shifted considerably.
When we talk about the European neighbourhood policy, we are speaking about a long-term perspective.
As for a short-term perspective, there is often no such thing.
Does this mean that opinion both within and outside Parliament has changed, or do we lack political courage?
A year ago, for example, the view regarding Ukraine was that it had very clear prospects of EU membership and that there was no doubt whatsoever that it belonged to the European family.
We all remember the many orange-coloured scarves to be seen in this Assembly in support of Ukraineâs democratisation process.
Had the issue of the status of negotiations for Ukrainian membership been discussed at that time, I am quite convinced that there would not have been so many who would have opposed that countryâs membership.
Today, the situation is different.
Certainly, we still tell Ukraine that we wish to see it become an EU Member State, but we emphasise that this will take some time and that it should not be in a hurry.
Turning now to another state, the situation in Belarus resembles that of a dictatorship and is anything other than satisfactory.
Its road to possible EU membership will be a long one.
In spite of this, I believe that, alongside our calls for democratisation, we should send out clear signals that, when it one day becomes democratic, Belarus too will have its place in the European family.
What I am looking for, both in the neighbourhood policy and in the European debate generally, are visions and optimism.
Without optimism and clearly expressed desires regarding what we want to bring about and what kind of Europe we want to see in the future, shall we rise to todayâs challenges, either.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to congratulate MrÂ Tannock on his report on the new European neighbourhood policy, which is set to be one of the EUâs most strategically important instruments, not least from the point of view of global security, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, to whom I also wish to pay tribute, pointed out.
There is no point in the Union shutting itself inside a fortress behind its borders to protect itself from such dangers as terrorism, organised crime, drug trafficking, illegal immigration and the trafficking of women and children.
No matter how high the walls, there will always be a way around them, Lampedusa, Ceuta and Melilla being dramatic illustrations.
Good neighbourhood means enhanced mutual security for the neighbours concerned.
Hence the importance of correctly implementing this new policy, which will enable us to support our neighbours by means of specific programmes with a direct influence on reinforced security â both their security and ours.
By helping them to solve their security problems we will also be helping to extend the area of stability around us.
Yet the south-western section of the security ring around Europe that this new policy seeks to build would be breached if Cape Verde were excluded from this instrument.
To exclude Cape Verde would be to overlook its strong ties with Europe and its common border with the EU via the Canary Islands.
This report needs to provide a solution whereby Cape Verde would be eligible for programmes under the scope of the European neighbourhood policy.
The EU must not let Cape Verde become a weak link in its chain of neighbours.
If it is able to enjoy the benefits of programmes within the framework of the European neighbourhood policy, Cape Verde will be able to play an important role in European and worldwide security.
The authorities in Cape Verde must be helped to prevent their territory from becoming a platform for organised crime, illegal immigration and terrorism.
Accordingly, with my groupâs support, I have tabled two amendments, which I hope will be supported by the majority in Parliament.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that Mr Tannockâs outstanding report on the European neighbourhood policy has been written.
It offers practical answers to problems that the EU must solve if it is to appease the anti-globalisation doom-mongers.
It is simply not possible with every round of EU enlargement simply to shift the lines of latitude and longitude on the map of Europe and to mark out our territory in the sand; the same sand, incidentally, in which one may always bury oneâs head, rather than face the problems of the world around us, including those of the EUâs neighbours.
It is precisely this phenomenon, in my view, that the report addresses and attempts to solve.
The European neighbourhood policy is about the offer of privileged relations between the EU and its nearest neighbours, supported by financial instruments such as TACIS and MEDA, which are to be replaced by the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument in 2007.
On the other hand, however, the EU often seems unaware that it should not claim the right to dictate to neighbouring countries what they should and should not do, on the grounds that it is providing them with financial support, and I am not afraid to say this.
We are not talking here about irresponsible or inferior countries and this is something that the Union often forgets, in its sometimes arrogant navel-gazing.
The EU must fully respect its neighbours and not attempt to put pressure on them.
This is the only way in which we can talk about good neighbourhood policy.
Â Â  We are talking about one of the core policies of the European Union, and I am pleased to be able to thank Mr Tannock for a very good report, and you, Commissioner, for ambition of the highest order.
EU security is vitally dependent on the quality of democracy and economic development among our neighbours.
I support the clearly expressed political will that we will not be satisfied with the status quo for pragmatic reasons, but will actively support the development of democracy, respect for human rights and the development of a social market economy on a permanent footing amongst neighbouring countries.
I especially support the appeal to the Commission to establish clear criteria for assessing the political achievements of our neighbours, and I assume that respect of human rights will occupy a key position among these criteria.
I must reiterate the exceptional importance of regional cooperation, as well as projects at a local level.
Moreover, as part of any action programmes I would also like to see youth cooperation projects, and in particular projects aimed at the development of civil society.
May I close with an expression of strong support for the opinion regarding the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
I firmly believe that the European Union can and must achieve more through the OSCE than it has to date, including in regions beyond the borders of our closest neighbours, and I have in mind in particular Central Asia.
Thank you for your attention, and I hope that in future we might also strengthen the parliamentary dimension of our cooperation.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that this very topical report has been completed.
After the most recent enlargement, the European Union needs a determined and flexible neighbourhood policy more than ever.
The European Commission must very clearly formulate the objectives and priorities of the neighbourhood policy, and the criteria for evaluating its success.
The neighbourhood policy as it is presently being implemented is fading away.
The countries covered by the policy are slipping into a grey area.
As the leader of the delegation of the European Parliament, I have had to observe this course of events in Moldova.
Moldova is a hostage of the Transnistria problem, a fact that we must not neglect.
The Transnistria conflict is one of the most significant reasons for the slow rate of economic development in Moldova.
Yet Europe, as is also noted in this report, has not taken full advantage of its strategic partnership with Russia to resolve the conflict.
Today Chancellor SchÃŒssel praised his government for its successful intervention in the Russian-Ukrainian gas problem.
He was seconded in this praise by Mr Barroso.
The fact that Moldovaâs analogous problem has received no attention whatsoever, and as a result suffered a gas crisis that lasted for nearly three weeks, shows the inadequacy of the present neighbourhood policy.
Ignoring a partner in the neighbourhood policy, ignoring a country in the middle of Europe with a population of four million is not a pattern of behaviour that the European Union should continue to practise.
I support the rapporteurâs call to recognise the aspirations of Ukraine and Moldova regarding accession to the European Union, and I welcome the demand to offer them the possibility of becoming members of the European Union; that is, when all three of the Copenhagen criteria have been fulfilled.
The opportunity to obtain membership of the European Union is of the utmost importance for democratisation and economic reforms.
That was the very argument that was emphasised in justifying the commencement of accession negotiations with Turkey.
If we can give an opportunity to Turkey, whose population will soon be greater than that of Germany, then why can we not send a clear message to Ukraine, which is half that size, and Moldova, which has a twentieth of the population of Turkey?
In that sense the neighbourhood policy report is a generous exception in the European Union.
Once again, many thanks to the rapporteur, and thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to pay tribute to Commissioner Verheugen for his work in securing the successful enlargement to include the Baltic States.
Could Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, in her reply to this debate, clarify an aspect which is somewhat confusing?
We talk about our 'neighbourhood policy', but Russia is a new neighbour of the European Union.
Is Russia part of the neighbourhood policy or do we have an EU/Russia policy that is distinct?
George Orwell, one of my countrymen, wrote a book called and he used the expression: 'All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.'
I hope that the European Union Member State governments do not share that view but rather subscribe to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and to the idea that there will be no bilateral negotiations with any of our neighbours.
An American poet, Robert Frost, talking about neighbourhood, said that: 'Good fences make good neighbours.'
I hope that Russia will very soon find itself in a position to be able to ratify the border agreements with Estonia and Latvia.
It is very difficult, however strong our view about good relations may be, if not only Member State frontiers but our own EU borders are not recognised by a neighbour.
Perhaps the Commissioner might be able to comment on the progress made with President Putin and his colleagues towards agreement on what must be a fairly fundamental issue.
We are obviously investing a great deal with our Russian colleagues and friends, but unless they recognise our fences, it is surely very difficult for us to have that mutual sense of confidence and trust.
Two minutes is not a great deal of time to discuss this vitally important subject, but I would refer colleagues to paragraph 1 of Mr Tannock's excellent report, which says that the European Parliament 'declares that the aim of privileged neighbourhood relations with the EU's neighbours includes, as an essential precondition, an active and concrete commitment to common values in the fields of the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the principles of a transparent social market ...'.
I hope that President Putin may find time to read at least paragraph 1 of Mr Tannock's report.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too wish to thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur, Mr Tannock, for their integrated positions.
There is no doubt that the European neighbourhood policy is a successful policy.
However, the time has come, I think, for us to consider whether it perhaps needs to acquire an institutional basis.
My proposal is specific and refers to the following: all these states which are today taking part in the European neighbourhood policy should form a commonwealth, an improved version of the British Commonwealth.
In this way, the European Union would create around it a large zone of peace, freedom and prosperity.
In this regime, in this commonwealth, customs union will be valid for all the countries, but citizens will not be free to relocate to the countries of the European Union or to participate in the Community decision-making institutions or the single currency.
This special relationship will offer economic and other advantages in sectors such as infrastructures, energy, the environment and transport, which will constitute incentives for joining the commonwealth.
The institution of the commonwealth may develop into a valuable reserve solution in the event that the full integration of a country into the European Union encounters serious obstacles.
It could also be the way in which the countries on the periphery of Europe will converge more quickly with Europe.
It would create a zone of European-orientated countries and would resolve once and for all the dilemma between the constant enlargement and the deepening of the European Union.
At the same time, it will deflate in good time many of the problems within Europe and will head off new dilemmas and new polarisations in the Union before they damage its unity.
It will unite us and will strengthen us at the same time, without any significant cost and with far less risk.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, this eveningâs debate in the House concerns one of the most important challenges facing the European Union.
I refer to the development of a Neighbourhood Policy that will enable the area of security, democracy, political freedom and economic development in the contemporary world to be broadened in the immediate vicinity of the European Union.
The European Union has become a global player, always on the basis of its principles such as respect for peace, the quest for compromise, plus the defence of human rights and of a liberal democracy.
In particular, it is engaged in an effort to promote democracy in countries in North Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus and Eastern Europe.
It should be noted that this policy involves a whole network of reciprocal political, economic, scientific and cultural links.
I should like to draw attention to the human rights aspect of the European neighbourhood policy.
Societies struggling against the lack of democracy and respect for human rights in their countries perceive the European Union as a partner and as a guarantor of democratic processes.
The European neighbourhood policy should take into account the aspirations of societies in those countries.
It should support civil society and assist with visa policies.
It should also bring about a genuine opening up of the European Research Area to include countries outside the European Union.
Finally, the European neighbourhood policy should not become an obstacle to European countries hoping to seek membership of the Union in the future.
Â Â  â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days and weeks there has been much talk about Europeâs energy dependence on outside sources.
EU Member States remain largely dependent on supplies of crude oil and natural gas from the countries covered in this report, such as Russia, Algeria, Libya, Egypt and Azerbaijan, as well as other countries in transition, such as Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia, across which flow these supplies of strategically important raw materials.
In this regard, I should like to turn to one aspect of the neighbourhood policy to which we have yet to pay sufficient attention, namely regional cooperation.
I am of the opinion that the neighbourhood policy should not be based solely on the consolidation of bilateral relations, but rather on regional cooperation between these countries on an economic, cultural and political level.
If we look, for example, at individual regions such as the Southern Caucasus, we see that such cooperation is either fraught with problems, or does not actually exist at all.
And yet the existence of good neighbourly relations, involving regional cooperation between the countries around us, is one of the preconditions for fulfilling the aims of the neighbourhood policy, not least in order to ensure energy supplies to EU countries.
I should therefore like to call on the Commission to place greater emphasis than it has done hitherto on boosting regional cooperation and on solving regional conflicts, when implementing the individual practical stages of the neighbourhood policy.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I really admire your physical capacity.
I address that comment to MrÂ Tannock too.
The last round of EU enlargement dramatically changed the European external dimension.
Enlargement took place and we introduced the European neighbourhood policy.
Today's ENP makes me think of NATO's Partnership for Peace and enlargement.
The Copenhagen European Council set out the criteria for enlargement and ten countries were ultimately admitted.
The process lacked concept, planning and project management.
Let us not repeat the same mistake.
Point 1: Let us say that enlargement is enlargement.
The ENP should be everything but enlargement.
Let us speak about the ENP.
Point 2: We also need privileged partnerships.
Every power in history has had special relations.
The EU needs them as well.
A special, new 'A minus' category should be clearly defined.
We all know that, for security, energy, economic, trade and even social, cultural and political reasons, there are already countries with which we have and need special relations, yet they will never â in the foreseeable future â become members of the EU.
Let us call that system the ENP.
Point 3: The biggest mistake is the current situation: We do not speak about the ENP; we speak about whether or not the Balkans, Ukraine and Turkey â with or without a clear set of criteria â should be eligible for enlargement.
Clearly, the ENP must be dissociated from the names of countries, and concepts and criteria should be introduced.
Point 4: Criteria.
Geographical criteria should be discussed on the basis of the Treaty.
Not all eligible countries have the capacity to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.
We cannot lie to ourselves as regards the full respect of individual human rights, equal economic opportunities, full liberalisation and privatisation.
We should concern ourselves with defining the 'A minus' Copenhagen criteria.
Only if we are serious and transparent can we upgrade the region.
Point 5: Institutions and our capacity.
Four freedoms should be analysed.
The free movement of goods is acceptable but the free movement of people should be limited, as should the free movement of capital, but not the free movement of services.
Transparency and accountability are the cornerstone of stability, understanding and the fight against frustration, extremism and radicalism.
Let us be open, transparent and logical.
We will all be secure and prosperous as a result.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to make clear my wholehearted support for MrÂ Tannockâs outstanding report and also the Commissionerâs excellent, practical neighbourhood policy.
Nevertheless, I cannot and shall never accept certain concepts.
What do the ancestors of many western Ukrainians have in common with the ancestors of the Commissioner or myself, of MrsÂ HybÃ¡Å¡kovÃ¡ or MrÂ RouÄek, of MrÂ Peterle or of many others in this room?
They were citizens of a Central European state called Austria-Hungary.
No one has yet been able to give me a rational explanation as to why some of these citizens should suddenly be Western Europeans and others Eastern Europeans, or why, indeed, some of them â as some people thoughtlessly say â should suddenly be Europeans and others Europeâs neighbours.
The neighbourhood and enlargement policies, like economic policy, need the concept of regulatory policy.
The fact is that Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova are unambiguously European countries â as are the South-East European countries that we curiously label âWestern Balkansâ.
All of these must ultimately be given the prospect of full membership of the European Union, even if we currently know that, for some, such as Ukraine, Belarus or Moldova, this is a very long way off.
For this reason, the European neighbourhood policy makes perfect sense as a staging post.
We must simply distinguish here, however, between those for whom this policy represents the prospect of European membership, on the one hand, and those with whom we wish to have permanent associations as neighbours, such as the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean, on the other.
In this regard, I very much liked the remark by MrÂ Ãzdemir of the Greens today that we need greater interlinking of the Barcelona process and the Mediterranean countries with the European neighbourhood policy, as our Mediterranean policy will have to be a neighbourhood policy in the classical sense in the long run.
That is why, today, we have to come to terms with the concepts and categories as they are currently set out.
We should not lose sight of the realities of the situation, however, or a rude awakening is in store, something of which we saw chilling signs this winter in the form of the situation between Russia and Ukraine.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, in crisis situations like the one that arose recently when Moscow turned off gas supplies to Ukraine and Moldova, the European neighbourhood policy ought to play a key role and provide a formula for creating a common vision of European Union policy.
Gas has become a means of exerting political pressure, so one of the priorities for European neighbourhood policy has to be to participate in a dialogue on energy with third countries, and become involved in the organisation of trans-European energy networks.
The most important reserves of oil and natural gas in the world are located in areas surrounding the European Union.
Many of the Unionâs neighbours are producer or transit countries.
There is therefore considerable scope for action in the context of a policy aimed at the creation of a friendly zone around the Union.
Action to date in this regard has proved unsatisfactory.
I could mention the political consent to the construction of the northern European gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea.
Not only is this system detrimental to the interests of Member States, in the longer term it will have a negative impact on countries beyond the European Unionâs Eastern border affected by our neighbourhood policy.
I refer to countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and to the countries of the Southern Caucasus.
European decision-makers failed to react decisively on this matter.
This meant that a strategic decision was taken over the heads of several Member States, with negative repercussions for a number of transit countries.
I would be grateful if the Commissioner would comment on the matter and make her views clear.
The European neighbourhood policy must become an effective tool for the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law in countries close to the European Union.
It must also encourage change in countries where there is no effective democracy.
The activities of democratic movements in neighbouring countries should be supported, by facilitating access to independent media and information.
The European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights can play an important role in this regard.
In a flexible and effective manner, this instrument ought to be able to support initiatives to promote parliamentary democracy.
I would remind the House that this is the only external Union instrument that does not require the consent of the recipient country.
Â Â  Thank you Mr President, Commissioner, I also wish to join my colleagues and present my compliments to the rapporteur for the good work he has done.
This is a comprehensive report on a very vast field.
I appreciate therefore that his job has not been easy.
If I may criticize the report, I would say that I do not think that the report places countries from Eastern Europe and countries from the southern Mediterranean on the same level.
It seems as though the report was written for Eastern countries and then some parts were added about Maghreb and Mashreq.
In fact, in paragraph 33 the report even asks the Commission to clarify the definition of the ties between the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
I therefore say this, Commissioner, that if we at the European Parliament are not understanding well how much the European Neighbourhood Policy covers and includes the countries of the Barcelona Process, and if we are not understanding how this policy compliments our Euro-Mediterranean policy, then how can we expect that our partner countries in the Mediterranean would understand it?
No wonder that a lot of people coming from Mediterranean countries who speak to me, who are our partners, especially in my capacity as Vice-President of the Maghreb delegation, express their serious concerns about the European neighbourhood policy.
Probably, it is because like us, they do not understand the link to the Barcelona process, probably because they are afraid that this will take over the Barcelona process to the detriment of Mediterranean countries, probably because they are afraid that with the new fund, which will be set up next year, the European Partnership Neighbourhood Instrument, will stand to lose instead of gaining anything; probably because the funds will not be ring fenced and so the Mediterranean countries will have no guarantee that they will get what they have already obtained, let alone get even more.
These are all points of concern which are raised by our colleagues from countries like Tunisia and Morocco.
These are points to which, I hope, the Commissioner will be able to make a reply, because they are serious and legitimate points.
Thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I should like to greet my colleague Mr Verheugen, who is behind the neighbourhood policy.
It is a happy coincidence that he is here today.
Secondly, I should like to repeat that I am very appreciative of the very broad support for the report by Mr Tannock and for the neighbourhood policy.
It is indeed a very broad policy and it was therefore a broad discussion.
This is a policy directed towards the EUâs neighbours in the East, but also towards its neighbours in the Mediterranean.
I will come to that in a moment.
On the European perspective, it is clear that the neighbourhood policy is one that is distinct from enlargement, but at the same time I should also say that the future is not set in stone.
At this stage we have a policy totally distinct from enlargement.
I could not be clearer in distinguishing and defining that policy.
There is also a regional perspective.
This is very clear, for instance, in the Mediterranean process, Euromed.
It is regional and the neighbourhood policy is the bilateral, complementary part of it, so the two work together.
For instance, we have always very strongly supported the south-south Agadir Cooperation between the countries.
Naturally, with regard to the East, that aspect can still be broadened.
There is still a lot to be done.
However, I can also tell you that during the energy crisis the regional dimension was also apparent.
We have also very much enhanced, helped and encouraged Ukraine to help Moldova in the very times it has experienced recently.
In the energy field as a whole we are trying to work towards an integrated energy market.
In the Mashreq there is an integrated gas market.
There is also the cooperation between Palestine and Israel, which is at least aimed at more effective integration.
Let me answer a few specific questions. Many have been asked here.
First, the inclusion of the southern Caucasus countries in the neighbourhood policy â something originally demanded by the European Parliament â is very welcome.
The report suggests fully utilising the ENP to promote inter-state confidence building.
That is very important.
It is crucial for the southern Caucasus countries to create stability.
I agree with everyone who has said that we have to promote and reinforce the currently-frozen conflict solution in those countries.
That is what we are trying to do.
The development of the ENP, as regards the southern Caucasus, remains a high priority.
You all know that technical missions have been going to those countries in order to negotiate the action plans, notably because we also want to contribute to regional stability and reinforce EU support for resolving the conflicts there.
We know that this will take time, but it is highly important that we are fully engaged in it.
Another question referred to Belarus.
To date the Commission has been represented through its delegation in Kiev, which is accredited to Belarus.
I have requested, as a first stage, that a regionalised delegation mission be established in Belarus, headed by a chargÃ© dâaffaires under the head of mission of Kiev.
I am still awaiting a positive reply from the Belarusian authorities.
However, my understanding is that if we have a delegation there then we can work much more closely with the government in Minsk and try to reinforce our own criteria.
Many of you will know that our assistance to Belarus is characterised by a two-track approach.
There is also a strategy for more democratisation and human rights to meet the needs of the population at large, and a decentralised programme.
That means new funding for support to democratisation, which is available under the EIDHR and direct work, for instance as regards the radio station and the possibility of directly influencing information through our independent broadcasting to Belarus.
That is already under way.
But we are also working for higher education and for training, if you bear in mind the closure of the university in Minsk and our work in Vilnius.
The whole question of the Transnistrian conflict has been mentioned.
In line with the commitment in the action plan, we have taken a much higher profile in supporting the mediation process.
Since October 2005 we have tried to work, together with the US, as observers.
We now have a special representative for Moldova, Ambassador Jacobovits de Szeged, who is working for a solution to the Transnistrian conflict.
In this connection we set up the Moldovan-EU border assistance mission on 1Â December.
It is designed to assist Moldova and Ukraine in ensuring transparent management of their common border, thus stepping up cooperation on border issues and trying to combat corruption and the misleading of customs.
I disagree with those who say that the Barcelona Summit was a failure. I really regret the media reports about Barcelona.
I was there from the very beginning until the very end.
I can tell you that Barcelona was excellent in its substance. There is a report on migration.
Please read it. There is a common position on combating terrorism.
There is the substance that the Commission, in our communication, brought forward in April.
One should look at why various heads of state did not attend.
For instance, it may have been somewhat difficult for the King of Morocco to go to Spain because of the differences they still have.
King Abdullah II of Jordan had to change his government.
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria was in a hospital in Paris and still is, as far as I know.
President Mubarak had just had elections in Egypt and was not in the best of conditions to go to Barcelona.
However, many prime ministers attended and it is they who have to implement policy.
Twinning and TAIEX, the two excellent instruments that have helped the enlargement countries a great deal, are also there for the neighbourhood countries, and we will use them.
There were many other questions, but I cannot go into more detail now owing to time constraints.
However, if those questions are raised again in the Committee on Foreign Affairs then I would be pleased to answer them.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise on a point of order, the number of which will be familiar to your aides, about supplementary questions following a debate.
The Commissioner was not able to answer the question as to whether or not the EU/Russia policy and the neighbourhood policy are allied.
I would refer the Commissioner to paragraphs 16 and 26 of the Tannock Report.
Perhaps she might give me a written reply.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very happy to answer that.
I just thought that the debate was going on for too long.
Russia is not in the normal ENP.
We have a special financial instrument â ENPI â the European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument.
Why?
Because Russia is a huge country and feels it deserves a special strategic partnership.
We have worked with Russia on the four common spaces, and for every summit we go through the agenda and the different questions, such as the one you mentioned on the border agreement with Estonia and Latvia.
Other questions, such as on gas and energy, will certainly be important points.
Those are bilateral issues of the countries with Russia.
We have tried to facilitate those negotiations, but we have heard that for the time being those parties prefer to work on the issue themselves.
I see at least some sort of progress, but I am cautious because it will take time.
I did not forget to answer your question, but the debate was very long and there were so many interventions, all of them very valuable.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 January 2006 at 12 noon.
Â Â  â Neighbourhood policy needs to be a more open concept, not restricted merely to Mediterranean issues or to the EUâs eastern border.
We must not forget that we have other neighbours on our Atlantic maritime borders.
In light of their importance and their particular sensitivity in terms of European security, they also deserve special prominence in this context.
Adjoining the outermost regions of the EU, adjacent to the European mainland, these insular countries are especially vulnerable to large-scale trafficking.
This is dangerous for the countries themselves and in turn for our security and we must accordingly pay careful attention to these countries.
There are those who say that Cape Verde already has its own framework in the African Caribbean Pacific (ACP) area.
This is a blinkered view that does not take account of the reality of the situation.
We must be able to define policies that interact with other frameworks, such as, , the ACP, in a manner that is fruitful, flexible and imaginative.
We are duty bound to do this, and, in light of its peopleâs exemplary record on democracy, good governance and respect for human rights, not to mention their profound historical, social, political, cultural and geographical ties with the EU, Cape Verde deserves this.
I therefore call on Members to vote in favour of Amendments 11, 12, 36 and 38.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by Dominique Vlasto, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on implementing the European Charter for Small Enterprises (2005/2123(INI)) (A6-0405/2005).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, if I could only put forward one argument in defence of this report, it would be that there are around 25Â million small enterprises in Europe, employing nearly 95Â million people.
They are the backbone of the European economy, a major breeding ground for jobs and growth, and we need to make the most of their potential.
The European Charter for Small Enterprises is a symbol of their importance, and it is the only official document devoted entirely to them.
This Charter has provoked many attacks from businessmen.
Unfortunately, five years after it came into being, the results achieved are still very uneven and its implementation remains inadequate even though it has had some success among the professional organisations and 35 countries have signed it.
Nevertheless, MrÂ President, these small businesses consider themselves to be the orphans of a Europe that cannot manage to provide them with a system of consultation, dialogue and work.
Whether in my home town of Marseilles or elsewhere, the heads of small and craft enterprises see Europe as a machine producing costs and restrictions.
For these executives, the internal market âÂ which is, in fact, undoubtedly a successÂ â is not an opportunity, it is an illusion.
And if these business leaders do not have confidence in European policies, that is a real problem.
It is quite clear that the regulatory framework we are creating is not a success if 98Â % of businesses in the European Union feel that it does not work for their line of business.
That is why the Charter needs to be an instrument that will enable us to regain the trust of small enterprises in Europe.
Its implementation must enable us to assess the progress made by all the European states and institutions in improving the regulatory, financial and political environment in which small businesses operate.
That is why we are calling for a more critical annual report.
It is, however, regrettable that this year's annual monitoring report does not really make it possible to assess the progress made.
We are calling for better implementation of the Charter, so as to make a significant contribution to the European Commission's essential commitment to better regulation.
That is why we suggest, firstly, strengthening the implementation of the Charter by ensuring that its small and micro-businesses dimension is retained with actions specifically intended for them; greater involvement from the professional organisations; maintaining the dissemination of best practices and exchanges of good practice; and retaining a specific annual report on the Charter.
We have no objection to a reflection on the implementation of the Charter, but we would ask you not to sacrifice the Charter for Small Enterprises by tying it into the Lisbon Strategy.
This approach must remain complementary to and distinct from the other policies targeting SMEs and industry.
This also recognises a reality that we need to take into account: small enterprises have specific needs and abilities that are different from those of businesses with 250 to 10Â 000 employees.
This principle, as set out by the Commission, is that we must think about small enterprises.
This commitment now needs to be translated into reality, because that is not always the case.
If we look, for example, at the REACH proposal, we do not get the impression that this principle was applied.
It was the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that introduced the adjustments and measures intended to make REACH applicable to and bearable for small enterprises.
It is for the benefit of these small enterprises that I have once again stressed in my report the importance of simplifying legislation.
We would ask you once again to institute a clear and precise method for performing impact assessments, particularly for the smaller SMEs.
This defence of the Charter and of better regulation is at the heart of this report.
It includes a number of other proposals from my fellow Members, and I would like to thank them for their positive contribution.
What we propose is a complete work programme, first of all to get to know small businesses better, but above all to make progress in a number of fields, including taxation, aid for investment, innovation and research and so on.
MrÂ President, I am not going to go into the details of the proposals made, but the Commission and the Member States will find in my report a source of inspiration for action.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, honourable Members, I am very much obliged to the rapporteur for her balanced reports and constructive proposals.
I should like to take this opportunity to say a few quite fundamental words about the Commissionâs policy for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
The rapporteur has just spoken of the âorphanageâ of SMEs in Europe.
I myself use the expression âshadow existenceâ, and of course both expressions imply massive criticism: criticism of the fact that, even though there has been constant discussion of SMEs in the past, none of the European institutions has really done any serious work on improving their situation.
I resolved to change that, and I am pleased to be able to tell you that last year saw a political breakthrough for European SME policy.
Not only has there been recognition at all levels of the priority given by SMEs to growth and jobs but, at long last, serious work is now being done across the board on taking the necessary steps to enable SMEs to really fulfil their tremendous potential for growth and job creation.
The achievement of Europeâs objectives â stable, sustainable growth and full employment â will only be possible with the help of SMEs.
Large enterprises will not help us to achieve these objectives, as their tendency to cut jobs is also set to continue in future.
For this reason, I do not quite agree with the rapporteur on one point.
I differ fundamentally from her in that I am firmly convinced that it was not until the Charter policy was integrated into the new growth and jobs strategy that the policy for SMEs became top priority in Europe.
I simply cannot understand how it is possible to say that large enterprises should have their place in this growth and jobs strategy but the smaller ones should not.
In Europe, two-thirds of the workforce are employed by SMEs.
It is not the large enterprises but the smaller ones that are the employers.
Small and medium-sized enterprises are at the heart of this strategy, which can only succeed if SMEs actually continue to be central.
I really am firmly convinced that the clear improvement in the political environment for SMEs that has been achieved over the past year can be traced back directly to our having accorded this policy its rightful place in the European Unionâs growth and employment policy.
In the interim, the Member States have also reported on their national reform programmes in implementation of the new growth and employment policy.
I am pleased to be able to tell you that more than half of the Member States have designated the policy for SMEs a priority in these national reform programmes.
I do think that there is still room for improvement; we shall be reporting to Parliament on this in a few weeksâ time.
For example, at least on occasion, a lack of detail on the measures taken is still evident, which could lead to an overly optimistic assessment, but this is just the start of the process, of course, and this process will become even more effective, and is, I believe, capable of succeeding.
At any event, the Charter itself will be retained.
Furthermore, it serves as a point of reference for the exchange of best practice and mutual learning.
The main instrument, the annual Charter conferences, will be continued.
Best practice in a selected number of SME policy areas will be presented at the annual Charter conference in Vienna on 13Â and 14Â JuneÂ 2006.
Since Parliament started work on its report, a few things have changed.
On 10Â November of last year, the Commission adopted its Communication on a modern SME policy for growth and employment; which would not have been necessary, of course, had I been convinced that the current policy is sufficient.
The Commission Communication on a modern SME policy for growth and employment now constitutes the coherent framework for the various instruments of enterprise policy, and goes much further than the 10Â lines for action in the Charter.
The Communication emphasises the importance of SMEs in the context of Lisbon and establishes the â principle for all EU policy fields.
It also specifies the daily challenges faced by SMEs and proposes measures for enhancing their ability to grow and create jobs.
The communication supports the European partnership for growth and jobs, which recognises the importance of promoting an entrepreneurial culture in Europe and creating a favourable political environment for SMEs.
There are some special policy fields on which I should like to say just a few brief words.
The Commission has adopted a communication on home state taxation, which it hopes will be carried through. That would help SMEs involved in international business.
The Commission attaches the utmost importance to improving access to SME financing instruments, which is a fundamental problem.
I shall do everything I can to ensure that, in the next financing period, too, the available resources are sufficient to enable the continuation of this successful project.
The Commission is preparing an initiative to further entrepreneurship education in Europe.
There is simply not enough entrepreneurial spirit in Europe; there are not enough people prepared to become entrepreneurs.
This is not only a matter of economic conditions, but also of the cultural, social and political environment.
Endeavours to arouse entrepreneurial spirit and impart the relevant knowledge must start in schools and universities.
Finally, I should like to point out that we are also currently in the process of drawing up proposals to make it easier for SMEs to pass from one owner to another.
In the years ahead, we shall see millions of cases where enterprises pass into new ownership, and failure to manage these correctly could put millions of jobs at risk.
On the whole, we have reached a point at which the right ideas, plans and strategies need to be put into practice across the board.
This is not primarily the responsibility of the European institutions: our options and means are limited.
In essence, it is up to the Member States.
For this reason, I would appeal to the Member States to increase still more their recognition of the opportunities and potential lying precisely in the promotion of SMEs.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Vlasto, for her integrated report and the Commissioner for the Commission's clear presentation relating to the subject of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
However, I should also like to welcome the initiative by the Austrian Presidency in immediately defining the European Charter for Small Enterprises, so that specialised initiatives and measures can be promoted to strengthen the competitiveness and employment in the European Union.
The European Economic and Social Committee highlights certain financial and tax incentives in its opinion which could help small- and medium-sized enterprises to break into the economic area of competitiveness, research and technology and the mobility of workers: not fragmentary and dispersed mobility, mobility within the framework of a clear European social model.
I should like at this point to refer to the question of relocations of large enterprises, which have a significant impact on turnover and employment in small- and medium-sized enterprises, given that many of them act as sub-contractors.
I agree with the Austrian Presidency that, in small- and medium-sized enterprises, subsidised investments need to be promoted at regional level.
Commissioner, small- and medium-sized enterprises live and work in the shadow of multinationals, of large chains, and in the shadow of bureaucracy.
In order to address this state of affairs, I would point out that important horizontal, national and Community measures need to be taken, which will include:
Firstly, simplifying bureaucracy.
Secondly, promoting a simplified general system of financial support for small- and medium-sized enterprises which will include new banking products.
Thirdly, simplifying the tax liabilities of small- and medium-sized enterprises, taking account of the fact that the pilot plan for the taxation of small- and medium-sized enterprises in their country of establishment could help in this direction, with the ultimate objective of adopting a common, unified basis for taxation.
Finally, strengthening incentives for the integration of innovation and research, on the basis of the proposals of the Commission itself on competitiveness and national aid and within the framework of the 7th research programme.
We need to turn words into action.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues I am delighted to welcome here the new SME Envoy.
I speak today as a Vice-President of the SME circle here in Parliament, as well as the draftsman of the opinion on the Commission report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I am delighted to record that this opinion was not only passed unanimously in that committee, but that all its suggestions were incorporated into the final report by Mrs Vlasto which was also passed unanimously in the Committee on Industry.
So I thank Mrs Vlasto for her cooperation and congratulate her on an excellent report.
One might ask, then, why we are bothering to have a debate, especially at this very late hour, given this complete agreement on all sides of the House.
I suggest that the answer is very simple: we do not want just a debate about SMEs, we want a debate that will lead to concrete action, and we want concrete action not just by Member States but also by the Commission.
Commissioner, I welcome the comments you made elsewhere today that 2006 will be a year of delivery for SMEs.
All of us want to help you deliver.
We see ourselves as on the same side as you.
I would just like to mention quickly three specific ideas.
We want the voice of small businesses to be heard loudly, clearly and officially within the social dialogue, not to be drowned out by the larger social partners, as happens now.
A concrete proposal has been promised.
Can you please confirm when it will arrive, in what form it will arrive, and how we can help you to turn it into a reality when it does arrive?
Secondly, the Charter has proposed that SMEs should be exempted from certain regulatory obligations.
Can you please confirm whether the Commission will lead by example in this respect and, if so, when we can expect some concrete proposals from the Commission on this issue too?
Finally, given that apparently there will be no more annual Charter reports from the Commission in future, how will the Commission ensure that issues facing SMEs remain increasingly front-of-mind within Member States, given the temptation for it to be weaker, rather than stronger?
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, firstly, I am obliged to MrsÂ Vlasto, who has demonstrated great commitment in her preparation of this report and has also brought out the key points very well.
Chancellor SchÃŒssel of the Austrian Presidency, who was here this morning, was himself once the secretary-general of an organisation for small- and medium-sized enterprises, which is why he is so familiar with the problems and knows the importance of doing more in this field.
I am also very much obliged to CommissionerÂ Verheugen, because the Charter report has, of course, considerably increased the focus on SMEs, and thus further increased the focus on efforts to promote this kind of enterprise.
I believe that it is also good to regard this preliminary study â that is, the detailed, in-depth study that is being carried out in all the Member States â as a preliminary study on the Lisbon process, so as to give the Lisbon process, too, corresponding relevance.
In this way, we know what needs to be done in the field of SMEs to show the non-governmental organisations, and ultimately also the Council and the Commission, where the strong and weak points lie.
I consider it extremely important that the three pillars we have created here â âmacro-economicâ, âmicro-economicâ and âemploymentâ â show clearly that, in the final analysis, SMEs account for 80% of taxes.
A social Europe must keep the spotlight on this.
We must look at where taxes are ultimately coming from and then, in future, reduce this burden on the enterprises and particularly the workers concerned, so that they can earn larger profits and higher salaries.
At the same time, excise tax should make a corresponding contribution to tax revenue, because imports from low-wage countries represent a particularly great opportunity for us in this regard.
The final point I should like to make is that I do not understand the reasons for the cuts in the framework programme for competitiveness and innovation (CIP), which puts the spotlight on entrepreneurship.
In this connection, we should work with the Commission in the context of this proposal to restore the full amount that was given to the CIP programme under the original proposal.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrsÂ Vlastoâs report on the implementation of the European Charter for Small Enterprises â a report that we endorse â reveals the main obstacles to development for small- and medium-sized enterprises, particularly fiscal, financial and bureaucratic obstacles.
It also calls on the Commission to intervene with targeted Community measures because, as MrsÂ Vlasto has said, small enterprises still feel abandoned.
The report recommends simplifying taxation systems; providing incentives for innovative enterprises; reducing the bureaucratic burden, especially during the start-up phase of small businesses, but not only then; providing easier access to credit; and exempting them from paying corporation tax on the European subsidies that they are granted.
Unfortunately, the Commission report on the implementation of the Charter, which is the basis for this parliamentary report, contains a number of gaps: for instance, the data presented are not homogeneous and it is therefore difficult to compare situations referring to different countries.
We should have preferred the Commission report to be more structured, more systematic and also more critical, with reference to progress on matters of entrepreneurial spirit and culture, for instance.
In any case, we call on the Commission to act in concert with the Member States and above all with organisations representing small businesses.
To that end, I stress the importance of involving such organisations to a greater extent, including through the establishment of standing working parties.
This is not the time to underline how useful the Charter is but, instead, I feel I must strongly emphasise something that Parliament has called for more than once, which is that the Charter needs to be made legally binding.
That is the only way we can be sure that the Member States will take it into account when drawing up national policies; otherwise, we run the risk of the Charter becoming a mere list of good intentions.
It seems that this will be the last annual report on implementation of the Charter, because in future it will be incorporated within the overall report on the Lisbon Strategy.
I can understand the reason for that â according to Commissioner Verheugen, it is to place SMEs at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy â but I can also see the danger of underrating the contribution made by the Charter, particularly in relation to the new Member States.
Finally, I should like to add that I find it difficult to comprehend why the Commission says that it considers small enterprises to be the driving force behind the revitalisation of Europeâs economy, when the initiatives aimed at them â as put forward in the Commission document on relaunching the Lisbon process â are pretty limited.
How can they be key players in this strategy?
That is not to mention the significant cuts in funding that the Competitiveness and Innovation framework Programme is almost certain to suffer because of what I regard as the Member Statesâ miserliness over the Unionâs budget.
It is unthinkable to promote the future of small businesses in that way, let alone the future of Europe.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, CommissionerÂ Verheugen, SMEs are now being given priority in all speeches â we have heard that from the Council Presidency today.
That is a good thing, and I should also like to state quite clearly here that this is also thanks to CommissionerÂ Verheugen, who has given this subject long-overdue momentum.
We are obliged to him for this.
However, except in many speeches, this subject is not always dealt with appropriately.
We can see this in our own institution, as Parliament is starting its discussion at an hour not befitting the issue.
We should pull our own socks up too, therefore, and improve the way we deal with this subject.
Looking at the figures â which have been cited here â we can see that SMEs are our main point of contact for the Lisbon agenda.
Employing two-thirds of the workforce, they are the most important employers, but they are also innovators in many fields, being global leaders in niche and part-markets and also accounting for more than 50% of patents.
That means that, in these fields, Europe has the authority and the competence to provide direction that it so badly needs in global competition.
The financial resources that we allocate to SMEs contrast sharply with this.
In this regard it is plain to see that, in the Commissionâs original budget allocation, which was a generous estimate, only 0.3% of all resources had fallen to SMEs.
Some of my fellow Members have raised the subject of the framework programme for competitiveness and innovation (CIP).
As the rapporteur, I wish to raise an objection, as there have been cuts in this field.
We all agree that we need to increase these resources to the maximum.
Nevertheless, on the positive side, I should like to say that the Commissioner has appointed a representative for SMEs and, in FranÃ§oiseÂ LeÂ Bail, has made a very good choice.
I should like to congratulate him on this and offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur on her sound report.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is important to discuss the issue of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises.
More important still is to put into practice measures to provide effective support for micro-, small- and medium-sized businessmen, which is something that has not happened; far from it.
Neoliberal policies have created enormous difficulties for micro and small enterprises.
As the report says, it is not enough simply to have a European Charter for Small Enterprises.
The Charterâs actions for small businesses should be incorporated in, and supplemented by, the general policy for SMEs on the basis of binding measures, not only at Community level but also within Member States.
It is especially important that small and micro enterprises have recourse to European programmes.
Accordingly, conditions must be in place to facilitate the access of such businesses to Community funds, either by amendments to be introduced to the regulations, or by setting up mechanisms of direct, unequivocal support for their associations, in order to help them overcome continuing financial, bureaucratic, tax and other obstacles.
It is also important to strengthen financial instruments for small and craft enterprises, particularly mutual guarantee systems, and to set up flexible microfinancing systems, aimed at family businesses, those set up by women and young people, helping to cofinance projects and making relevant information available.
It should not be forgotten that if the EU does not take measures now, it will be confronted in ten yearsâ time with millions of small and craft enterprises going out of business, with the attendant risk of millions of job losses, which will exacerbate poverty, the desertification of rural areas and social exclusion.
Accordingly, as the report says â and I take this opportunity to congratulate MrsÂ Vlasto on her work â it is crucial that the European institutions and the Member States implement and develop the actions laid down in the European Charter in full.
This must be binding, and not just a matter of paying lip service to the Charter.
Furthermore, it must not lose its content on account of its inclusion in the Lisbon Strategy, as Mr Verheugen suggested just now, a prospect that I find worrying.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report calls for a reduction in bureaucratic obstacles and the simplification of taxation for small businesses.
Who could disagree with that?
But then the report goes on to say that EU legislation should be implemented equally across Member States and, in the case of non-compliance, rapid infringement procedures should be applied.
We are immediately transported back into the world of one-size-fits-all EU legislation and penalties, which are guaranteed to strangle enterprise, initiative and business creation.
My own party pointed out during the British Presidency of 2005 that over 4Â 000 new regulations and legislative instruments were enacted, despite Mr Blairâs rash promise to reduce overregulation.
If small- and medium-sized businesses are to thrive in the EU, which is vital for job creation, then the simple answer is to reduce EU regulation, not increase it. Otherwise, one day the only way to own a small business in Europe will be to buy a big one and wait.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Verheugen, this evening is the last time that we will be considering the European Charter for Small Enterprises as a separate report.
Here, I would like to agree with those who have expressed hopes that this will not decrease the significance of the policy of support for small enterprises in the future, when the report is included in the joint report on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
I believe that it is essential for the European Union not only to maintain but also to extend its role in this policy sphere.
Small enterprises very often lack a political lobby and institutional support at Member State level.
The burden of tax and bureaucratic procedures places many small enterprises in a discriminatory situation when compared with other market players.
Small enterprises, therefore, frequently have to struggle not for special dispensations and the simplification of tax or bureaucratic procedures, but first of all they have to achieve a non-discriminatory environment for their own business activities.
European Union policy in the sphere of small business support must develop a more effective and aggressive approach, motivating the Member States to take account of the interests of this business group.
For this reason I believe that we should back the proposal to give the European Charter for Small Enterprises the force of law.
This, however, is not enough to significantly improve the situation in this sphere.
The charter must not remain just an instrument for transferring the experience of one country over the border into another, while enterprises remain fenced in inside their own national economies.
The charterâs impact would significantly increase the European Unionâs political will and foster action for further economic integration, with adoption of the Services Directive as the first step.
The liberalisation of the services sector of the internal market would give this group of businesses unprecedented opportunities and incentives for development, would remove administrative and financial barriers that prevent small- and medium-sized enterprises from crossing national borders.
We ought not to forget that it is actually small business activity from which springs the spirit of enterprise, which ensures economic vitality, development and stability in a period of change.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate Mrs Vlasto on the report she has produced, which I believe to be a very exhaustive, but at the same time very clear, report.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for being here today and for the explanations he has given us.
Secondly, it is a clichÃ© to say that small- and medium-size enterprises are the backbone of the European economy. However, the fact that it is a clichÃ© does not make it any less important.
Two-thirds of companies in Europe are classified as SMEs.
Europe has 25 million small- and medium-sized enterprises which, in employment terms, provide no fewer than 95 million jobs.
The objective, however, is not just for SMEs to struggle on, but rather for them to be able to prosper and grow strong.
To this end, we need a model in which SMEs do not just develop by means of merger or acquisition, which is the traditional model, but rather through the growth of the small- and medium-sized enterprises themselves.
I would like to stress some of the aspects taken up in the report presented by Mrs Vlasto.
I agree with her that incorporating the report on implementing the European Charter for Small Enterprises into the report on implementing the Lisbon process could lead to a certain marginalisation of the SME concept.
Furthermore, I believe that we must enhance the annual bilateral dialogue with representatives of SMEs and promote the participation of SMEs through the use of instruments suited to their needs, such as incentives to encourage SMEs to enter the world of research and development.
I would like finally to refer to something that the Commissioner raised in his speech: it is not possible to have strong small- and medium-sized enterprises if entrepreneurial activity is constantly being undermined.
I therefore believe that it is extremely important that we, once and for all, opt decisively to emphasise the social value of entrepreneurial action.
I believe that this is fundamental to the future of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, small- and medium-sized enterprises are important sources of employment and it is for this very reason that the European Charter is a project worth supporting.
At the same time, the Commission promptly needs to mention which Member States have not yet improved the way they do things or implemented the Charterâs lines for action.
SMEs for us are an immense resource and opportunity.
We must streamline and simplify legislation the whole time and make it easier to found new companies.
Any action that promotes a climate of entrepreneurship has the support of our group.
An important goal must be to harmonise company taxation.
The problem with the Charter is that it does not contain enough concrete measures which would provide support for innovative companies and their potential for networking.
More effective use of the internet and business are areas which offer enormous opportunities.
The development of electronic public services in Member States as support tools for SMEs is also important.
The Union needs to start implementing the Basel II provisions promptly. That too would facilitate matters.
The Commission and the Council should also re-embark on action with regard to a Community patent, which is problematic but essential.
The legislation on state aid could be examined, so that companies might receive support in the event that private risk financing shies away.
Obviously we should support the establishment of small companies based merely on self-employment, but ambitious and inventive companies are the vital boost which we need.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am, of course, delighted at the very broad consensus uniting us around MrsÂ Vlasto's report this evening, and I am pleased to have heard ChancellorÂ SchÃŒssel and then MrÂ Barroso telling us this morning how interested they were in SMEs and assuring us that this subject would be brought up during the spring Council.
I would like, for my part, to draw your attention to two points.
We have just been talking about SMEs in abstract terms, as an administrative body, needing simplification, more money, a better environmental context, and so on. A small business is, in essence, its leader âÂ I know there are some in this Chamber who have just spokenÂ â and it is now nearly 31 years since I myself set up my first business.
We therefore need to take these leaders into account if we are going to give them real answers, so that their small businesses can run properly.
If you talked to all the heads of SMEs in Europe, they would tell you one thingÂ âÂ that there are not enough hours in the dayÂ âÂ and, at this time of night, many of them are still hard at work.
We must provide real answers, Commissioner.
We must simplify, but in particular we must apply the principle of subsidiarity so that authorities, states and professional organisations can provide real support at local level.
It is not up to the European Union to do all of that itself, but it must do it.
My second point relates to our fellow citizens.
As has already been said, we must increase awareness right from school age.
I would therefore like to make a proposal.
Just as there are music and football competitions at European level, why not institute a European 'open day' for small enterprises?
Why not organise a European Good Practice Day?
Those are just a few ideas on how we can communicate and show our fellow citizens how important our SMEs are.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, there are 25Â million small enterprises employing almost 100Â million people.
These small enterprises provide well over half of private jobs in the EU and are of great importance to regional, cultural and social development, including in rural areas.
They deserve to see their opportunities for innovation and competitive prospects discussed every year.
As my fellow Members have already pointed out, the importance of these enterprises was underlined today by Wolfgang SchÃŒssel during his presentation of the programme of the Austrian Council Presidency, when he called for us to âwake the sleeping giantâ.
I fully agree with him.
There has also been criticism of the Charter from many quarters, however, on the grounds that it contains too many non-binding appeals.
I, too, should like to see substantial measures at Community and, as CommissionerÂ Verheugen said, Member State level.
At any event, the 10Â lines for action in the Charter are important orientations for enhancing the exchange of best practice, promoting the setting-up of new enterprises and generally creating a positive environment.
This starts in school lessons, and we have to set the tone for it from primary level onwards.
Once again, Finland is a good example of this.
The Netherlands is exemplary with regard to the simplification of regulations, particularly on account of its standardised impact assessments.
We agree that work on dismantling the considerable bureaucratic and tax obstacles in the Member States must continue.
It is important that subsidies be fully exempt from corporation tax.
A very good report has been drawn up by MrÂ Bushill-Matthews in our advisory committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I am thinking in particular of the suggestion to draw up a Green Paper on the reduction of these barriers, and of the call for better access to the Structural Funds and to risk capital funds.
Personally, I consider it important that small enterprises promote their apprentices and other staff more through transnational exchanges within the framework of programmes such as the Leonardo da Vinci apprentice exchange programme.
This will increase mobility and at the same time create one of the preconditions for small- and micro-enterprises to work together very much better in future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am delighted that small enterprises are now at the heart of Europe's activities, firstly in ChancellorÂ SchÃŒssel's very encouraging remarks this morning, making this subject a top priority for the Austrian Presidency.
They are also at the heart of the debate in your comments, Commissioner, before the SME intergroup this afternoon and here this evening, affirming that the situation for SMEs is of great concern to the Commission and that we need to create better political conditions for SMEs in Europe.
Finally, they are at the heart of the debate in this evening's discussion.
In the current difficult economic climate, it is often small and craft enterprises that continue to create wealth and form the main source of employment, with local jobs that maintain social cohesion by nourishing the whole territory of the EU.
The European Union must be a staunch supporter of these small businesses, by increasing the power of the Charter as a specific assistance instrument and by going beyond good intentions, as called for in MrsÂ Vlasto's excellent report.
In order to ensure that these small businesses continue to be created and passed on, we need to reduce the administrative formalities in Europe and in the Member States; make it easier for them to access capital and European programmes, particularly on research; improve the dissemination of information on measures that help them; and encourage innovation and the fight against counterfeit goods.
To do all of that, however, we need ambitious funding, so let us hope that the good fairies who have been looking into the future of these small enterprises todayÂ âÂ this sleeping giant, as ChancellorÂ SchÃŒssel put itÂ â turn their wishes into reality by allocating the necessary funds to the various actions and that their good intentions are backed up by specific financial commitments.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, small enterprises constitute one of the main drivers of European competitiveness.
However, I would like to note that the report is rather formal and does not exactly reflect the actual situation.
I would like to draw your attention to the problems of small enterprises and business development in the new Member States of the European Union.
The level of entrepreneurship in many of these countries â like in my home country, Lithuania â is unfortunately four times lower than in the old Member States, and the prospects for the growth of small businesses are not sufficiently favourable. This will decrease the overall competitiveness of the European Union.
The establishment of companies and creation of jobs require conditions attractive for business start-ups as well as favourable funding opportunities.
Entrepreneurship and initiative of the citizens are important preconditions for harmonious social development.
This is a problem in the new Member States so far.
Therefore, these states need an impetus on the part of the European Commission and additional exceptional measures and conditions facilitating the development of small businesses.
How?
First, it is essential to eliminate the taxation of small business investments, thus opening better possibilities for small companies to use capital resources.
Second, small businesses should be ensured access to the Structural Funds on a national level.
In my opinion, a certain percentage of the funds should be earmarked for small business.
Furthermore, it is vital to simplify the bureaucratic procedures and to reduce the tax burden upon innovative companies to the maximum extent, by exempting them from profit tax, especially at the business start-up stage.
Â Â  Mr President, the SME Charter is an important and necessary political document of intention, but in itself it is hardly more than this.
The open coordination method proposed to implement the objectives of the Charter is flexible, which may not only be an advantage, but also a disadvantage.
Therefore, I agree with the rapporteur and the Commissioner.
We must support SMEs not only with our intentions, but also with our mandatory regulations both at European and Member State level.
It is very important that the Charter, as well as other, sometimes too distant programmes running in parallel with it, should not only be about SMEs, but also be addressed to SMEs.
Besides principles, we need pragmatic, easily understandable and actually deliverable information and assistance solutions.
Otherwise we will never reach the tens of thousands of forced entrepreneurs who cannot afford the time or resources to enquire about them.
At the same time, we should not forget that SME policy is not a special, separate subject, but one of the horizontal pillars.
When we know that the vast majority of our businesses are SMEs, we must also realize that our only lasting, structural solution for the implementation of the cohesion policy, the reduction of unemployment, the enhancement of competitiveness and economic growth, or the facilitation of rural development, research development or even innovation is to build on our own SMEs.
We should not neglect this foundation.
This is why I am asking that we do not shut the Charter away in a drawer at the end of the debate, but leave it on our desks as a reminder of the long journey we still have ahead of us until we can say that small enterprises are a success in Europe.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 January 2006 at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The Charter for Small Enterprises is a great step forward in defence of that sector of the economy, which represents the individuality, the vitality and the richness of the European Union.
Improved access to European funding, more streamlined administration, training and tax relief are all essential measures to enable SMEs to exist, to produce, to invest and to employ.
Now that the European Union has recognised the importance of the sector, it needs to pay careful attention to the consistency of its policies: the recent debates on chemical substance registration or software patenting, to mention just a couple, have perhaps led people to doubt whether the EU is actually willing to commit itself totally to protecting SMEs.
The latest dreadful example comes from the now notorious debate on the textile industry and trade relations with China.
Promoting and implementing a charter for SMEs will be a wasted effort until the EU, and the Commission in particular, raises its voice at last to firmly demand that the rules of trade â which are already in themselves extremely unfavourable to small businesses â be obeyed, and to demand the best possible conditions from our international partners to enable this industry to continue to flourish.
Â Â  Progress in promoting SMEs has been achieved in the new Member States, mainly in: education for entrepreneurship, better regulation and skills shortages.
Concrete actions to foster SMEs friendly environment are the cornerstone for achieving Union's objectives of growth and employment.
Bets-practices suggest that the new Member States should focus on setting up systems to monitor skills gaps; developing policies to address bankruptcy and competition laws; adapting SMEs friendly taxation systems; using impact assessments for developing better regulation and fostering innovation and technological capacities.
It is therefore necessary that the SME dimension is further integrated within the other policies of the Union through increased consultation and better representation of the SMEs at national and Community levels.
Addressing this report is also the opportunity to welcome the Jaspers and Jeremy initiatives that will certainly play an important role in developing more effective SMEs friendly environment within the Union.
I also welcome the geographical expansion of the objectives of the Charter to the enlarged EU, the candidate countries, the Western Balkans, Moldova and the Mediterranean partners.
Finally, I support the rapporteur when calling for a wider consistent overview and for more systematic and critical review of the situation in future reports.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Onesta, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendments to be made to the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure relating to standards of good conduct for Members of the European Parliament (A6-0413/2005).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, you have a copy of our current Rules of Procedure in front of you.
According to those rules, you should have your ushers throw me out immediately, because I am wearing a T-shirt with a small political slogan printed on the front and back.
According to our Rules of Procedure, it is completely forbidden to display political opinions visually, regardless of the medium.
That just goes to show how absurd the current system is, all the more so given that the current Rules of Procedure do not allow us to intervene in cases of violence, invective, defamation or insults, in the Chamber or elsewhere.
Our current tools in this matter are very weak: it is a case of nothing or an atomic bomb, and you, MrÂ President, are the atomic bomb.
You can move that Parliament penalise the offender but, as the offender has practically no rights, you hesitate about doing so and, by hesitating, you are the one who risks being penalised, MrÂ President.
That is why neither you nor any of your predecessors have ever used this atomic bomb, and that is all to the good.
Things therefore needed to change and I would like at this point not only to thank you âÂ I am really very touched by your last-minute arrival to chair this debateÂ â but also to congratulate the four shadow rapporteurs who have helped us to reach a consensus: MrÂ MÃ©ndez de Vigo for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, MrÂ Corbett for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, MrÂ Guardans CambÃ³ for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and MrsÂ Kaufmann for the Confederal Group of the European United Left â Nordic Green Left.
This report gives us an opportunity not only to develop more reasonable, more appropriate, more flexible and more proportionate Rules of Procedure, but also âÂ and this is all to the goodÂ â to increase the basic individual rights of each Member.
For the first time, thanks to these new Rules of Procedure, our protection by primary law is now enshrined in the Rules.
We are also protected by the Statute for Members.
For the first time, an offender will have the right to be informed individually, and he will have the right to explain himself to you, MrÂ President.
The penalty must be justified in writing.
There will be no more discretionary powers.
The offender will have the right to an internal appeal, in addition to the right to an external appeal, and that appeal will have the effect of suspending the penalty.
If our appeals body acts too slowly, the penalty will be deemed null and void.
Even better, Members will have a new right of visual expression.
I will finally be able to wear this type of T-shirt without your ushers intervening, MrÂ President, provided that what I am wearing is not offensive or defamatory and does not disrupt the sitting, which I hope is the case this evening.
Also for the first time, we will enshrine in the Rules of Procedure the right to vote.
Currently, if a Member is suspended for a few days, he loses his right to vote.
That means that we are penalising not only him, but also all of his constituents, who have done nothing wrong.
We have therefore decided to say that democracy is strong enough to go that far, in order to protect even the worst Members of this Parliament: those who do not respect democracy.
Democracy will respect every single one of their rights, which I think is very much to Parliament's credit.
Once again, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for enabling us to reach this consensus.
There is a safeguard built into the Rules of Procedure themselves, which will in future include the following sentence: 'The application of this Rule shall in no way detract from the liveliness of parliamentary debates nor undermine Members' freedom of speech'.
I have kept one example to finish with.
You may remember that, a year ago, one parliamentary group caused a major disturbance in this Chamber during the vote on the European Constitution.
You yourself, MrÂ President, had some difficulty restoring order in the Chamber and enabling it to continue its business.
You remained extremely calm, but the situation was very difficult and the pictures of that disturbance shown outside did no credit to European democracy.
It is certainly to be expected that the same group will stage another demonstration during tomorrow's vote on the topic concerned, but it will be quite different in nature.
Some of them have told me that they have already taken on board the spirit of the new Rules of Procedure.
They intend to use some puppets, and display ostriches; it will not be violent or disruptive, and it will certainly not be aggressive.
The simple fact that they have already taken on board the new Rules of Procedure shows that we are moving in the right direction.
In conclusion, I think that, thanks to the efforts of all Members, we will be able to have a Parliament that is dignified yet lively, lively yet dignified, and you can count on me, MrÂ President, being widely known as a political agitator, to ensure that Parliament remains very lively.
Â Â  Thank you for your explanation, MrÂ Onesta, but I will have to have you removed from the Chamber, as that is what is laid down in our current Rules of Procedure, which are still in force.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I should like to discuss the purpose of these Rules of Procedure and what has changed in them.
Their purpose is to fully ensure liveliness and spontaneity, whilst enabling Members to be called to order in cases of genuinely malicious, continuous disruption of the smooth conduct of parliamentary business.
These have been redefined and aspects of the rules that had hitherto been couched in very non-specific terms have been clarified: that is, the difference between the ânormalâ Chair, the Chairman of a delegation or committee, or a Vice-President chairing this plenary assembly, and the one President â who is of course present in person today.
The ânormalâ Chair may issue a reprimand, exclude from the Chamber a Member guilty of continuous disruption, and suspend a sitting, but the really unpleasant penalties may only be imposed by the President.
At first it sounds surprising that the President alone, without plenary, may impose an effective penalty thus, but this is corrected or balanced out by the introduction of a right of appeal, so that Members who consider that they have been unfairly treated by the President may appeal and any penalty wrongfully imposed can then be rectified.
A genuinely new aspect is that breaches of the rules governing confidentiality may now also be penalised.
Another new aspect is that there has been some increase in the possible penalties.
Up to now, it has been possible to suspend a Member from his or her duties for two to five days, but the new period would be between two and ten days.
I share MrÂ Onestaâs opinion that this is a balanced draft, a proposal that permits liveliness and nevertheless ensures the smooth conduct of business.
Our group will therefore support this proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, as I am sure you are aware, almost all parliaments have rules in order to protect themselves against disruptive behaviour that is aimed at preventing them from working.
It is not that the rules ever need to be used, maybe they will never be necessary, but it is important to have them as a democratic safeguard.
What our committee is proposing today is a modest set of proposals.
They would give you, Mr President, powers that are far smaller than the powers of, for instance, the Speaker of the House of Commons; they are strictly circumscribed and are combined with safeguards to reassure those colleagues who feared that we were going to clamp down on any kind of behaviour that was in any way colourful or lively.
That is not the case.
But we are right to bring in a coherent and proportionate set of rules to protect ourselves if necessary.
After all, at the last European election, a Member was elected who seems to have disappeared now, but who, at the time of the election, said his ambition was to come here to disrupt Parliament, to prevent it from working.
In the end, he did not manage to do that.
But, who knows, he might, in combination with others, have made a serious effort to stop us from working.
That is why it is necessary to protect the democratic process, or at least to have the instruments just in case we need them.
I notice that some members of our press are saying that these rules are aimed at silencing those who oppose the European Union, silencing a minority viewpoint.
That is not true and anyone who looked at the proposals would know that viewpoint is not plausible.
We have gone out of our way to say that the pluralism of Parliament â the right to express yourself, the right of freedom of expression and even, within proportion, visual expression â is safeguarded and guaranteed.
So, this is not to stamp down on any minority.
Those who are saying it are aiming at gullible journalists or at the Eurosceptic press, hoping to get a story making us look silly or ridiculous.
Unless they think it targets them, and I can scarcely believe that, those behind this story must either be planning to disrupt our work â and I hope that is not the case â or they are paranoid.
Given their general attitude to the European Union â that anything coming out of our institutions is necessarily an evil plot â I rather think it is paranoia that is governing their actions in telling the press the story about this very reasonable report.
My group will support the proposals of Mr Onesta and I hope that this gives our Parliament a proportionate set of rules that we need, just in case we need to safeguard ourselves.
Â Â  Mr President, my group is going to give this report its full support in the form it now takes following the approval of several amendments, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the text on which we have finally been able to agree amongst all of us.
The previous speakers have explained this very well and it would be impossible for me not to repeat some of their points.
This text basically rationalises the current system â which in itself is quite a task â it codifies but rationalises, it makes each personâs role much clearer and, above all, it achieves a balance between two extreme views.
The first is to see this as a parliament and not a school, nor a church and â please take this as a joke, Mr President â nor is it an opera house.
It must have its vivacity, its movement, its people.
Nevertheless, its operational rules must be obeyed and Parliament must be able to preserve the dignity of its role at all times.
It is intolerable â and I am going to give an example which scandalised me in particular, if you pardon the expression â to interrupt a formal sitting with a President, a Head of State, during his last speech, and probably one of his last political actions in Europe and in his political career.
I am referring to the speech in this House by President Ciampi.
That is intolerable.
Other similar actions are totally unacceptable, too.
It is that that should be penalised, much more than a Member displaying some poster or other, or some little pamphlet, which in no way disrupts the work of the House.
On the one hand, therefore, vivacity, energy and contrasting ideas are fine â and these are sometimes expressed through shouting and other reactions that those of us from Latin Parliaments even believe are lacking, because simultaneous interpreting makes it difficult for us to laugh spontaneously or to react to a comment â but not to the point of losing the dignity of the role entrusted to us and of what each of us represents, which is much more than any one of us means individually.
That is why we are here even at this time of night.
I believe that this balance is well reflected in the report that is going to be put to the vote tomorrow.
There are proportionate penalties, there are guarantees for those who may be penalised, there are powers for the President, which are balanced against a right to appeal to the Bureau.
I believe that all of this is a step forward.
My hope for this text is the best one can hope for a text of this nature: that it does not have to be applied.
I hope that it stays where it is, that we all practically forget that it exists and that it goes unnoticed because it is not necessary to apply it.
That would be the best possible result of having clear rules with regard to the internal discipline of this Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Onesta has tried his best to strike the right balance between indignation about the actions of some MEPs and guarantees for freedom to express dissent.
On the credit side, penalised members will not lose their right to vote and will be able to appeal.
I still think that this proposal could be counterproductive.
It is an invitation to MEPs to make the headlines by proclaiming their own punitive measures and thus to present themselves to the public as martyrs.
It also prompts frightened Presidents to come down unnecessarily hard on the people they do not consider to be their friends.
Moreover, every incident will lead to even stricter rules so as to rule out all unanticipated irritations.
Interruptions in debates and a visible display of different opinions are part and parcel of normal parliamentary practice.
This House would expose itself to possible ridicule if this were to lead to exclusion from a number of sittings or even to Members being suspended.
If that were the case, the media would not be reporting as much about the content of the debate and the decision-making as it would about the lack of tolerance.
Since that is sending the wrong message to the voters, it would be preferable if a regulation of that kind were to confine itself to preventing and penalising physical violence.
Â Â  . Mr President, since my party, the UK Independence Party, came to this Parliament in 1999 and returned in more force in 2004, we have established the first genuine opposition to the process of European political integration.
My concern is that the proposed measures may be used to try to stifle the voice of national independence and opposition to the European Union.
If that is the case, it will not succeed.
However, I should like to offer some constructive suggestions to improve the proceedings.
Firstly, the presiding Presidents should ensure that speakers are kept to their allotted time: pro-EU speakers are given much more leeway to overrun than anti-EU speakers.
Secondly, during the vote some presiding Presidents need to slow down a little.
In that way we might have time to vote properly.
At the same time, the Presidents might not make so many glaring mistakes in estimating the vote and there would be less call for electronic checks.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall speak out of parliamentary courtesy: firstly, because you are here and I believe we should be grateful for that and, secondly, because it was my group that requested that we hold this debate.
In accordance with our Rules of Procedure, this debate need not have taken place because the vote in committee was overwhelmingly in favour of the report by MrÂ Onesta, but my group asked for it, precisely because my group likes transparency.
I would like to say that I am delighted that we asked for it, despite the time, because I believe that it has been a model debate: the Members who have spoken before me have expressed perfectly what this reform of the Rules of Procedure means.
Again out of parliamentary courtesy, and in view of the time, I shall say no more and we can all go home.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to make it absolutely clear that I am not here to take the place of MrÂ Martin, but that my group has given me two minutes even though I am not a member of the committee responsible.
I am very grateful, MrÂ President, that you are present for these questions, and I am also very grateful that you are a President who endeavours to keep in check the good many abuses by some Members in invoking the Rules of Procedure.
I do not wish to discuss now whether the status of a number of Members is perhaps being enhanced by penalising their questionable conduct in the Rules of Procedure.
Nor do I wish to discuss whether several members of the Presidency of Parliament perhaps simply have less sovereignty, which even an amendment to the Rules of Procedure cannot confer on them.
I expressly support the inclusion in this text of breaches of the rules governing confidentiality.
I do feel somewhat uneasy, however, that the Committee on Legal Affairs, which is responsible for the mandate of Members, could not be consulted on this text.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs is responsible for the Rules of Procedure with good reason: the matter is in good hands there.
Sometimes, however, Membersâ rights do conflict with provisions in the Rules of Procedure.
Naturally, Membersâ rights are not restricted to merely the right to vote: we are a parliament and not a âvotamentâ.
It is with good reason that, if Members are absent and cannot present their arguments, courts may declare a vote unlawful.
If the Legal Affairs Committee had been involved, I would have raised an issue that goes to the heart of the matter.
Up to now, a Member who had been penalised could request five minutesâ speaking time in Parliament â this was decided by Members â which is also why no right of appeal was necessary.
That procedure, which would have been a public one, is now to disappear into the parliamentary bodies, to an extent, which I consider a step backwards.
Nevertheless, I support it, albeit with some misgivings.
I would ask, however, that, in the event of future discussions that venture beyond merely organisational procedures, where the mandate could even theoretically be affected, the Legal Affairs Committee be included in the consultation process.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at noon.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate MrÂ Onesta on his report, which will, if passed, amend our Rules of Procedure to institute stronger and more flexible procedures to discipline Members who disrupt the proceedings of the House or its committees.
I am not entirely sure of the meaning of the new Rule 147(3)b, which suggests one penalty will be the forfeiture of entitlement to the daily subsistence allowance for a period of between two and ten days.
Does this mean the Member concerned cannot sign in for the specified number of days â that is, stay at home â or, rather differently, that when he or she does sign in they receive no subsistence allowance?
Maybe the rapporteur can clarify his intention here?
I welcome Amendment 3 to Rule 9, paragraph 1b (new), laying down as it does a protection of Members' freedom of speech.
If this is passed and included in our rules I will immediately, if it comes into force next session, test its strength by retabling my written declaration on boycotting Ferrero-Rocher which, prior to this rule, was declared irreceivable by a former President of Parliament.
Freedom of speech is not limited by the wishes of Europe's multinational corporations.
Â Â  Given the behaviour of certain Members and groups in the plenary of Parliament it is unfortunately necessary to introduce new rules to govern Membersâ conduct.
In my opinion the report sets the right balance between the need to ensure freedom of parliamentary expression and vibrant debate on the one hand and dignified conduct of business on the other.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in the Middle East.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a great honour to address you today on the Middle East peace process.
It is particularly timely, since I have just returned from a visit to Gaza, the West Bank and Israel.
I had three objectives for this trip: first, to lend support to democracy-building in the run-up to the Palestinian elections.
There is an important Election Observation Mission there with your colleague, MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser; secondly, to underline the importance of European Union financial support to the Palestinian people, and, thirdly, to thus raise the visibility of a number of EU projects, notably in Gaza.
I spent a whole day in Gaza.
The security situation there is very complicated, it was not easy to go in but in the end it was a good day and I hope that the images brought to the Palestinian people show how much we, the European Union, are standing by them.
It is a critical moment in the Middle East.
In both Israel and the Palestinian territories, there have been tremendous changes in the political landscape.
I hope that these elections will bring about two leaderships that are ready and able to inject new vigour into this peace process.
I made it clear to both Israelis and Palestinians that the Commission will continue to offer its support to all those who seek peace by peaceful means.
That means in particular that whatever the composition of the new Palestinian Government, there must be full respect for the principles enshrined in the Interim Association Agreement and in the Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan that we agreed with the Palestinian Authority. These principles include respect for human rights and the rule of law, and thus a clear commitment to the roadmap.
The Palestinian Authority has given the international community assurances that the elections will take place free from violence and intimidation and according to international standards; we can only hope that this will come true.
President Abbas has also made it clear that acceptance of the Oslo Accords and the roadmap forms the basis for participation in the future government.
I think it was important that he gave such a clear message.
Acting Prime Minister Olmert, whom I also saw, assured me that Israel would facilitate the holding of these elections.
His government took a difficult decision, in the context of an Israeli pre-election campaign, to allow voting in East Jerusalem.
I welcomed that decision and I hope that this constructive spirit will help resolve any other remaining logistical and practical aspects of the elections.
Within the security constraints, it will be very important that Israel does all it can to allow free movement for voters and candidates in the Palestinian territories up to and including polling day.
The European Union is supporting the Palestinian elections with the biggest Election Observation Mission â 240 observers, including 50 of your colleagues.
I visited the Observation Team led by Mrs de Keyser, and was most impressed by her dedication and professionalism and that of her team.
I was also impressed to meet the Chairman of the Central Election Commission, Dr Hanna Nasir.
Thanks to the sustained support of the European Union â with which the Commission has been involved since 2003 â the CEC has established itself as one of the most credible and respected institutions in the Palestinian territories.
During my visit, I announced another EURÂ 1.4Â million to help with voter registration and polling activities, which brings our support for the election process to EURÂ 18.5Â million, which is a large amount of money to try to make these elections free and fair.
One of the purposes of my visit to Gaza was to raise the profile of the important work we are doing, providing urgent assistance to make Palestiniansâ ordinary lives more bearable.
We are improving the health system, building schools and repairing roads, making improvements as regards solid waste, sewage waste and electricity grids.
Much of that will be to the benefit of the Palestinian people and I hope they understand that it comes from the European Union.
I inaugurated some public works programmes and also announced the launch of four new energy and environment infrastructure projects in Gaza worth EURÂ 20Â million.
We are working with all possible speed, but the security situation is not making our work any easier.
Yet revitalising Gazaâs economy is essential.
What I saw only strengthened my conviction on that, and I will continue to press this point in the Quartet â there will be a Quartet meeting on 30Â January in London, after the Afghanistan conference â and with Israel.
We must continue to improve free movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza.
So, I have relaunched the procurement process for a EURÂ 25 million cargo terminal at the airport.
We visited the airport, and we know how important it is to open it up, not only to the region, but also to the world, to help facilitate Palestinian trade once it has been reopened.
We will only be able to go ahead with the project once there is an agreement between both sides.
We therefore strongly support Jim Wolfensohn with the whole scope of the project that he has outlined since the opening of the Rafah crossing.
We will not be able to step up travel in and out of Gaza without properly managed borders.
I visited the Rafah border crossing and I must say that General Pistolesi and his team at the EU Border Assistance Mission are doing an excellent job.
I was moved to see that Europeans are helping ordinary Palestinians to move across the border with Egypt for the first time in many years; this maintains the great dignity of the Palestinian people.
They are very happy.
I spoke to two women who expressed the hope that things might slowly get better.
Therefore, we will provide a further EURÂ 3Â million package of support for the Rafah border crossing.
We are carrying out customs duties there, so it will provide scanning equipment as well as training for the Palestinians.
I made it clear to both my Israeli and Palestinian counterparts and interlocutors that the European Union is contributing substantially to creating the conditions for a two-State solution.
Like everyone involved, we face major challenges, but we are in it for the long haul.
We want to make a long term commitment.
I clearly reiterated that.
We have been a consistent and reliable partner for both sides. But to make progress, both sides must move.
Israel should take steps to implement the agreement brokered in November by the Quartet Special Envoy Jim Wolfensohn on improving movement and access â the port, the airport, the link between Gaza and the West Bank and movement within the West Bank.
And the Palestinian Authority must take charge of law and order and public finances.
It must take serious steps to relaunch its reform programme and respect its commitments under the Interim Association Agreement and the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan.
At this critical juncture, our message is very clear: there is a need for negotiations; all action threatening a two-State solution must cease; and imposing law and order and fighting terrorism are important.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Palestinian elections on 20Â January are an opportunity for the Palestinians to confirm the democratic path on which they set out last January.
We are grateful for the Commissionerâs commitment, both personally and representing the Commission.
These elections take place in a highly challenging environment, which we certainly acknowledge.
But the importance the European Parliament attaches to their successful completion, and indeed to the peace process, can be seen in its having again authorised the largest observation delegation of 30Â elected Members, which I am again proud to lead jointly with Mrs Napoletano from the PSE Group.
Indeed, many Members present here today will be in Palestine next week.
The current situation in the Middle East represents a failure of diplomacy nearly a century ago.
The only democracy to date in the region is Israel, born of a genuine desire to create a Jewish homeland.
T E Lawrence of Arabia â who is a distant cousin of mine â wanted that too, but he also had a different vision for the region.
A recently discovered map he drew in Versailles shows kingdoms, not British and French dominions.
Today, however, we welcome the return of Europe in a different guise.
In her spending commitments for the Palestine Authority, could the Commissioner envisage funding a new chamber for the Palestine Council?
As colleagues know, democracy is my watchword.
At the Egyptian elections, which we witnessed last year, we saw intimidation of voters, including those supporting Dr Ayman Nour, leader of the secular al-Ghad Party.
The European Union rightly says that his subsequent sentence at a show trial to five yearsâ hard labour by the same judge who put Saad Ibrahim in jail for three years sent negative signals.
I should like to ask the Commissioner: what is the negative response from Brussels?
The Middle East is a region of fundamental strategic importance and a source of danger.
The London bombers last July came from my constituency in Yorkshire.
But the key to stability is democracy.
I am also proud, as a Vice-President, to represent the European Parliament on the Delegation to the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
But I also believe that the European Union needs a dedicated programme of democratic engagement in the region, and I look forward to hearing from the Commissioner what her plans are in that regard.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner for the information she has provided us with.
I should also like to send my best wishes to Prime Minister Sharon, as well as to MrsÂ Livni, for the important tasks she is taking on within the Israeli Government.
The situation in the Middle East is constantly changing.
In Israel, Deputy Prime Minister Olmert seems determined to take forward the process begun by Prime Minister Sharon, in view of the elections on 28Â March.
In Palestine, the imminent elections â the outcome of which is by no means clear â bring with them the important news that Hamas is standing in the national parliamentary elections for the first time.
We are faced with a dynamic situation, but one that is vulnerable to further setbacks.
The extremely fragile peace process â one might say that it never got off the ground in the way it was designed to in the Road Map â may be ruined once and for all by the escalating situation in the entire area, from the difficulties in stabilising Iraq to the alarming position taken by the Iranian leadership, the fragile situation in Lebanon, the role of Syria and the turbulent situation within Egypt.
Returning to the Palestinian elections, I do not wish to sidestep that most thorny of issues â that is to say, the issue of Hamas.
Regardless of the outcome of the elections, Hamas will play a key role in relation to the institutional representation of the Palestinian people.
I will refrain from doing or saying anything that might increase the support for, and influence of, Hamas and I will instead try to emphasise the fact that if a movement aspires to the highest echelons of political and institutional representation, then it must be willing to play the democratic game, starting with respect for international law and an end to violence.
From that point of view, I see it as a positive development that Hamas candidates have signed the code of conduct, even though there remains a general feeling of concern at the climate of violence in which the elections will take place, particularly in Gaza.
I should, however, like us to be more appreciative of the pluralism that is emerging in Palestine, which is also symbolised by new, secular electoral lists, bearing witness to the need for democracy, transparency and efforts to combat corruption.
The state of Israeli-Palestinian relations also has a bearing on the situation within Palestine.
That is another reason why Israel should stop the settlements in all the territories and refrain from acting in such a way as to jeopardise the chances of resolving the conflict, beginning with East Jerusalem, where a real annexation policy is being pursued.
The voting agreement in East Jerusalem is therefore â as you said â a positive development, even though we are well aware of its limitations, having observed the Presidential elections.
Nevertheless, it still has huge symbolic value.
Â Â  . Mr President, on 25Â January Palestinians will take to the polls to elect their parliament for the first time since 1996.
These elections may be six months later than planned, but that is a drop in the ocean for the generations who have longed to exercise their democratic rights.
With a EURÂ 18.5Â million contribution to support the electoral process and the deployment of a skilled observation mission, including an experienced delegation from this House, the EU is showing the Palestinians the path to effective democracy.
It is a critical time for stability in the Middle East.
It is crucial for the Palestinian Authority to acquire more democratic legitimacy.
Only with effective, functioning democratic institutions can the Palestinians lay the foundations for their own state, living in peace with Israel.
Some think legitimacy impossible with a black-listed terrorist organisation competing in the polls, but Hamas has rebranded itself as a change and reform movement and has maintained a state of calm in the run-up to these elections in spite of Tuesdayâs killing on the West Bank.
It has built popular support, perhaps as much as 40%, by providing numerous social services in an atmosphere of pessimism, anger and joblessness.
Muhammad Abbasâs ruling Fatah faction would also be hard pushed to meet our level of legitimacy with the legacy of cronyism and corruption.
Only this week the EU suspended EURÂ 35Â million in aid to the Palestinian Authority, and rightly so, because the necessary benchmarks have not been met.
Change and reform are positive words, but they need to be accompanied by concrete deeds.
In recent months, Hamas has made gestures towards moderation and its infamous Israel policy was not included in its election manifesto.
But if Hamas wants to work with the EU it must be ready to push the peace process forward.
That can only happen if it lays down its arms, drops its charter calling for the destruction of Israel and recognises the Jewish Stateâs right to exist.
As Javier Solana has indicated, the taxpayers in the EU will not be in a position to sustain political activity conducted along violent lines.
This is a test for the leadership skills of Ehud Olmert as he takes the helm after Ariel Sharonâs stroke earlier this month.
How he manages the challenges to law and order in Gaza, particularly as settlers step up their violent efforts to prevent eviction from the West Bank, will set the tone for the talks we hope will materialise after these elections.
But the threat of unrest should not stand in the way of democracy and we welcome Israelâs decision to facilitate voting in East Jerusalem, where Palestinians have been virtually annexed, split from their families by a separation barrier condemned by the International Court of Justice.
Moves by Israel now to comply with international law would be a tremendous confidence-building measure and an important step on the road to stability in the Middle East.
With the threat of nuclear developments in Iran hanging over the region, steps must be taken now to demonstrate that respect for international law is alive and well in the Middle East.
UN sanctions against Iran will only gain real legitimacy in the region if Israel is made to turn around its defiance of Security Council resolutions, a defiance unmatched by any other nation.
Otherwise arguments of double standards will only add fuel to the fire.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that, in the Middle East at the moment, there is a combination of, on the one hand, hope and, on the other, of substantial change on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides.
The hope could be dashed very quickly, however, because events on the ground do not give much cause for optimism.
In fact, in Jerusalem, right at the heart of the conflict, the situation is very worrying.
We, here in Parliament, are concerned that the Commission should have decided not to publish a report on the situation in Jerusalem, which was a report agreed to by all of the Union's services working there.
I believe that the situation in Jerusalem may represent a great obstacle to the creation of a viable and credible Palestinian State and become a for the two partiesâ most extremist and violent factions, which want to hinder progress towards peace.
Furthermore, I believe that the Commission should take measures to hasten progress, which has been incredibly slow, and to put an end to all the tortuous and bureaucratic procedures in order thereby to improve the quality of life of the Palestinians within the context of Mr Wolfensohnâs plans.
As you will have seen, some progress has been made in Gaza but, in reality, little real progress has been made with any of the projects, whether those relating to the port, trade, the passage of goods or the free movement of people.
The Palestinian Authority is in a very difficult situation.
At a time when we are, in some quarters, seeing the idea of a Greater Israel replaced with that of a Greater Jerusalem, the people who truly champion peace and who advocate a State with a single military power rather than illegal militias, which are incompatible with peace on the Palestinian side, have few arguments to put forward unless we make quicker progress towards improving the quality of life of the Palestinians and can in some way slow down the expansion of settlements on the ground.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, recent developments in the area of the Middle East are putting even more pressure on an area already burdened with wars and much more besides.
The crisis in relations between Iran and the West, the continuing political instability in Iraq, the crisis in relations between Lebanon and Syria, which needs very careful handling and, of course, the situation in the area of Israel and Palestine are intensifying our concern and creating a rather disappointing climate.
The crisis over recent days in relations between Iran and the West has taken its ugliest turn.
The possibility of military intervention against Iran would be disastrous and must be prevented, because another war in the area would create a chain reaction for security and peace, and not only for the area of the Middle East.
The situation in occupied Iraq is still permanently destabilising.
The recent disclosure by the former US Secretary of State Colin Powell, that the USA had made a mistake in its assessment and that Saddam did not have nuclear weapons, shows the real reasons for the military presence of the USA in the area.
The conclusions are, I think, obvious.
The parliamentary elections due to take place in Palestine on 25 January, with which I shall be involved, will be carried out under the shadow of the pre-election period in Israel itself, where elections are to be held two months later, and will place Israel in a new, post-Sharon, era.
Nonetheless, the Palestinian Authority is working ceaselessly so that free and democratic elections can be held and the democratic opinion of the Palestinian people can be demonstrated once again.
The Legislative Council and almost all the political parties in Palestine want Hamas to take part in the elections, so that it too can shoulder some of the responsibility for legislative work.
This is expected to result in milder policies and, ultimately, disarmament.
As for the election process in East Jerusalem, it would appear that the matter has been arranged in the same way as agreed by the Palestinians in 1996.
This too really is something to Israel's credit.
Nonetheless, I have my doubts as to the extent to which the Israelis will consent to a democratic and fair pre-election strategy being held in East Jerusalem as well, given that, generally speaking, it is hard for elections to be held under occupation.
I shall mention just one incident which took place just yesterday: the Palestinian People's Party candidate for Jerusalem, Fadwa Khader, was arrested during a pre-election meeting by the Israeli occupying army and is now in jail for no reason.
Elections to the new Palestinian Legislative Council will constitute the prospects and, once again, the proof that the Palestinians can operate democratically.
We, as the European Parliament and as the European Union, have already done a great deal, as the Commissioner said, but we need to continue to monitor developments in the area very carefully and, at the same time, to exert pressure in all directions for substantive talks which will lead before the end of 2006 to important progress and, very soon I hope, to a final solution to the problem.
Â Â  .
Mr President, good news from Iraq sounds, politically speaking, almost preposterous, yet, on the basis of recent, first-hand experience, and certainly in view of what I hear said in this House, I want to contradict that perception.
In mid-November last year, I had the privilege of taking part, as a Member of this House, in a major international conference on democratisation in the Middle East, on which Mr McMillan-Scott has just spoken.
The event was held in Arbil, the capital of the autonomous region of Kurdistan in Northern Iraq, where experts from Europe had the time, in absolute safety, to join with members of the Kurdish Government and Parliament in discussing, very frankly and openly, the prospects and problems associated with the development of democratic states under the rule of law right across that region.
Iraq is thus fortunately much more than simply the rather depressing arena for incessant and appalling terror attacks.
It is also in Iraqi Kurdistan that the European Union is being presented with an outstanding opportunity to make a substantial contribution to the urgent task of reconstructing Mesopotamia.
I would very much like to hear from the Commissioner whether she shares with me this vision, and, if so, precisely what the Commission is already setting in motion in Northern Iraq, or what it is preparing to do there.
At the same time, I can tell this House that our Kurdish counterparts in Iraq are looking to make contact with our Parliament.
Will the Middle East become democratic?
Let us not leave it at recommendations on paper, but rather give it substance through our own personal and practical political dealings!
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that the Palestinians living in the Arab sector of Jerusalem have been allowed to vote, but I believe that banning Hamas from campaigning is an extremely serious mistake and that Parliament, in my view, ought to formally condemn such a ban.
It is also important to point out the Unionâs commitment to the Palestinian people, even though I believe that we need to broaden this commitment politically at a time when the Union should be calling on Israel not only to improve the conditions for passing through and entering the West Bank and Gaza, but also to do away with that hateful barrier that fragments the Palestinian territory, divides local communities â and, in some cases, family units â and disrupts, if not completely destroys, a great many local Arab economies.
The European Union must call on Israel to block any new settlements in territories that remain occupied and to stamp out any discrimination against Palestinians who are living in enclaves within Israeli territory.
That is the commitment I call on Parliament and the Union to undertake.
Â Â  Good morning, Mr President.
I should like to assure the Commissioner that she has our full backing for any measures she takes with regard to Gaza.
We are delighted that the issue of East Jerusalem was cleared up during the meeting held by the Israeli Government last Sunday.
We are also delighted at the news that weapons have been banned on the day of the elections in Gaza and the West Bank.
We are closely following the latest developments in connection with Hamas.
We are aware that we must apply the same standards and the same criteria to Hamas as to the armed wing of Fatah.
The Delegation for relations with Israel is prepared to welcome General Pistolesi to Parliament, and to offer him our full backing for his activities.
We will also be very happy to support the Commissioner in any steps she takes to bring pressure to bear on the Israelis to meet their promise to safeguard the free movement of persons, goods and information and, of course, to lend their full support to the Rafah Agreement.
We are also making preparations ahead of the forthcoming debate on a definitive solution to the issue of East Jerusalem and its borders.
Nevertheless, I should like to remind the Commissioner that a delegation of Lebanese parliamentarians, two of whom were members of Hezbollah, visited our Parliament yesterday.
They strongly urged the EU to help Lebanon, and the thrust of their message was, without a shadow of a doubt, âsave us from Syriaâ.
We all know, however, that the main problem in the Middle East today is neither Palestine nor Syria, but Iran.
I should therefore briefly like to comment, if I may, on a number of precautionary steps that we might consider taking with regard to Iran.
For example, we should think about banning Iran from participating in the football World Cup to be held in Germany.
We should consider suspending technical assistance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the present resumption of Iranâs nuclear programme.
I would suggest to the Commissioner that we should think about banning Iran Air planes from landing in Europe, and about ways in which we could restrict the movement of high-ranking Iranian representatives.
That being said, Commissioner, I should like, if I may, to make a very personal comment, speaking as someone born in the former Czechoslovakia.
As a graduate in Arabic studies, I have been greatly alarmed in recent months, weeks and days at Russiaâs growing ambitions in the Middle East.
I am not talking merely about Iran, but also about Syria, Yemen and Iraq.
We now have a unique opportunity to enlist Russia as a partner, and to tell the Russians that if they are capable of reaching an agreement with the Iranians, then they should go ahead and prove it.
We should take Russia seriously as a partner, and we should tell them that if they can back up their words with action, then they should do so.
If not, then they should not interfere in the Middle East, since such interference is dangerous.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, the absence of peace in the Middle East is having increasingly dangerous consequences: threats to destabilise the Palestinian community and risks connected with Iranâs aggressive behaviour, scarcely tempered by anxieties about Syria.
I appreciated the relative optimism of your opening words, Commissioner, but I think that things which go without saying are better said and I would like to help strengthen the grounds for optimism.
The media are taking the view that, in the present situation, the disappearance of Ariel Sharon presages disaster and that the outlook is quite frightening.
Indeed, Sharon seemed to be the only person capable of seeing through the astonishing process of unilateral partition that he had devised as a preparatory stage to peace.
I really would like to stress that this is no time to panic.
Contrary to the impression given by the media, great men do not make history on their own: institutions and situations have their part to play.
On the Israeli side, there have for a very long time been two political obstacles to any prospects of peace.
The first is that in the eyes of many Israelis and of Ariel Sharon, all processes of the Oslo, Taba or Geneva kind fail to take adequate account of the imperative of Israeli security.
The second is that Israelâs largest right-wing group, Likud, has never, ever, in any way agreed to make the slightest concession whatsoever on its vision of Israelâs future, a vision of Biblical Israel, â or âGreater Israelâ, on the pretext of exchanging land for peace.
Before he was taken ill, Ariel Sharon had removed both those obstacles.
He had removed the first one by making visible and beginning to carry out a plan aimed at achieving peace gradually by partition.
Many of us in this Parliament, Commissioner, do not like that plan.
Too much violence, not enough talks, and a Palestinian state much reduced in size into the bargain.
It is the only plan there is, however, and it has won over many Israelis, because it was the first to marry the absolute imperative of security with the prospect of peace.
The second obstacle was removed because Ariel Sharon had the extraordinary courage to break with Likud.
Even if Sharon has gone, a large new party has been born representing a section of the Israeli right that is willing to move towards peace because its mind has been put at rest.
Tomorrow, that party may be the dominant force in the Knesset and join with other forces from the centre and the left.
The partyâs doctrine and that of its leader Ehud Olmert are not focussed on negotiation, but only on withdrawal from the occupied territories.
We know that.
Nevertheless, Commissioner, the partisan mechanics of the Knesset can only move in the direction of deepening the split with Likud and of rapprochement with the parties of Amir Peretz and Schlomo Ben-Ami: Sharon or no Sharon, the necessary break has been made and the inevitable will follow.
The Israelis sense this and are showing it in the polls.
Not only must we not over-dramatise at this time, we must stand firmly behind this process, because even though the Palestinian community is strongly influenced by Hamas it will quite obviously follow.
Peace, Commissioner, is todayâs promised land and Moses, too, died before he could enter it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when, in November, the Palestine Delegation met the Catholic bishop, Michel Sabah, he stated clearly that we should not obtain peace in the Middle East during the next 40 years if a just peace were not achieved in Israel/Palestine, involving a proper Palestinian state within bounds corresponding to the pre-â67 borders and not to Sharonâs enclaves.
Jerusalem, which is also the Palestiniansâ city, is part of the solution.
Jerusalem is absolutely central.
If Israel annexes the whole of Jerusalem, the key to peace will have been thrown away, and not only in that particular area but also in terms of relations between the Arab countries and the West.
Bishop Michel Sabahâs words were in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council of 7Â November 2005.
Here was a clear statement that Jerusalem should be kept as an open city, and for the Palestinians too, and a request that Orient House be reopened.
This, however, is where the Westâs double standards really come into their own.
Israel is completely indifferent to the EUâs statements, for the Israelis know that none of the foreign ministers take their own words seriously.
We even maintain Israelâs major economic privileges, despite the fact that they are expressly conditional on Israelâs observance of human rights, and the Council has just arranged for its own report on Jerusalem not to be published.
At the same time, the EU is trying to buy its way out of anything to do with the Palestinians, for whom, in conjunction with Israelâs policy of apartheid, the EU and the United States are becoming entirely responsible.
The fact is that Sharon wanted to call these walled-in enclaves a state, which would mean that Israel no longer had responsibility for the Palestinians under international law.
Palestine would have no chance of creating a healthy economy on those conditions and would forever be dependent on others.
Matters will undoubtedly end badly unless miracles now take place in Israel and the people of peace and justice acquire power, not only in Palestine but also in Israel, or unless a miracle almost as remarkable occurs and the EU at long last begins to take its own words and international law seriously and makes use of the resources to which Europeans quietly have access.
Nothing will happen as long as the Council and the Commissioner do not even mention the settlements and the Wall and do not say a word about a proper state.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the European Unionâs role as a promoter of democracy and economic development and as an honest broker between the parties in the Middle East conflict must in my opinion be welcomed unreservedly.
The fact that the EU is also sending many millions of euros to the Middle East is also justified in this connection â including the EUR 1.5 million you mentioned for the Palestinian elections, Commissioner.
We also need to ensure, however, that the results of such democratic elections are accepted by all sides, even if the election winners include political forces â such as Hamas â that we perhaps do not like so much.
If the EU wants to be an honest broker in the Palestine conflict, it must speak out much more strongly in favour of the two-State solution.
Persuading Israel to offer the Palestinian territories the necessary space for democratic and economic development will be an essential step in this direction.
Only a genuine improvement in the Palestiniansâ living conditions will make them turn away from political radicalism and terror.
If the EU is to be able to play such a valuable role as mediator in this very problematical geopolitical area, however, it must not become a front-line state or party to the conflict itself.
That is why I would like to take this opportunity once again to warn against full accession for Turkey to the EU.
That would put the European Union on the front line with Iran, Iraq, Syria and also, indirectly, with Palestine.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Rocardâs excellent speech reminded me that in my earlier speech I failed to acknowledge his role as chief observer of the Commission delegation last January.
At present, Mrs De Keyser, from this House, is chairing the Commissionâs observer mission in Palestine.
I should like to acknowledge that duty.
I apologise in advance for having to leave early: I think I have caught a Strasbourg cold.
I therefore thank the Commissioner in advance for her reply to my questions.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner for her work in assisting the efforts for peace in the Middle East and for enhancing the visibility of the European Union in the region.
Two elections will dominate the developments in the Middle East in the coming months.
The Palestinian election is significant because it is expected to yield a pluralistic result.
Hamas will participate in that election and is expected to do well.
This is the time for the European Union, among others, to convince and encourage everybody on the Palestinian side that there is only one way: the politically and democratically chosen way, which is incompatible with armed struggle or with terrorism.
Also, the old and new guard of Fatah will find their distinct way of expressing themselves during the legislative elections.
That is why the elections have to be free and fair: free from any restrictions on behalf of Israel and free from any manipulations from inside.
The Palestinians must be able to campaign and vote freely in East Jerusalem.
I hope that the international observers, including our own parliamentary mission, will be able to do their jobs freely, without hindrance and intimidation.
The Israeli elections are also very interesting because there is now a renewed hope generated by the decision of Ariel Sharon to leave Likud and form a new political movement, joined by others, including Shimon Peres.
The opinion polls have been indicating that we may now have, at long last, a stable Israeli Government in a truly pluralistic â rather than a multi-fragmented â Knesset.
From the opinion polls it is obvious that Israeli public opinion is adhering to new ideas, giving hope to a pluralistic, realistic, secure, peaceful future, without the wooden positions of the past.
Alas, the illness of Mr Sharon is of consternation for all of us, but let us trust Israeli society.
In the context of the Middle East, we cannot ignore, have to be vigilant and alert to any external interferences from factors such as Iran, Hezbollah and other interconnected factors.
It is imperative that the assassins of Rafiq Hariri are finally brought to justice.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the election of a democratic Palestinian parliament and the setting up of democratic institutions are the necessary preconditions for the establishment of a viable and sovereign Palestinian state which will live in peace and security next to a secure, peaceful and democratic Israel.
Progressive, moderate forces in Palestine need to block the way to all the forces feeding the blind violence and clashes, to say no to the forces denying the existence of the state of Israel.
It is these extreme Palestinian forces that are materially undermining the very prospects of the creation of a Palestinian state.
All the political organisations have their place in the political system in Palestine.
However, they have their place without weapons, without paramilitary approaches, without terrorist action.
There needs to be â and I am calling today for â immediate intervention by the European Union and by you, Commissioner, for the release of the Palestinian parliamentary candidate in Jerusalem, Mrs Fadwa Khader, who was arrested and is now in jail.
She needs and we call for her to be released immediately.
I should like to touch on two major issues which relate to peace in Palestine and the Middle East: you referred to one, Commissioner, which is the drastic economic and social situation of the Palestinian people living in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
Your contribution is indeed important if this situation is to be rectified.
However, there cannot be peace with poverty, with despair and with the marginalisation of the Palestinian people. This poverty, this marginalisation is the best ally of the extreme paramilitary organisations.
The second issue relates to the unacceptable tactics which the Israeli authorities continue to apply to the occupied Palestinian territories, especially East Jerusalem.
The illegal settlement is continuing, as are the de facto annexing of territory, the building of the wall and the compulsory purchase of Palestinian property.
On 7 November, the Council of Ministers took certain decisions on East Jerusalem.
On 12 December, the question of East Jerusalem was discussed again.
I believe that the European Union should take immediate measures to respond to these unacceptable Israeli tactics.
We should not feed the radicalisation of extreme Palestinian organisations any more and Israel bears a great deal of responsibility here.
Â Â  Mr President, this period is an important opportunity for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.
I expect the elections next week will result in Hamas being elected and represented.
Europe must decide how to deal with them.
We cannot exclude them, and indeed the Israeli Government must be encouraged to accept the will of the Palestinian people in respect of who they select as their representatives, no matter how difficult that may be for them â and I quite understand that it will be difficult.
We have to engage with Hamas after the elections on a conditional basis to encourage complete abandonment of violent means in pursuit of its political objectives.
The Israeli Government must come to realise that missiles, demolitions, apartheid walls and assassinations will not guarantee or bring it sustainable peace.
Political engagement with the enemy is necessary, otherwise there will be no peace.
Most of all, Israelâs current government must realise that a sustainable peace is not possible without a sustainable Palestinian State.
A âSwiss cheeseâ Palestinian State on the West Bank, with the Israelis controlling the cheese and the Palestinians controlling the holes, will not work and will not deliver peace to Israel in the long term.
What has been absent up to now is a mutual respect for each otherâs rights and for each otherâs humanity.
We must work to ensure that those two aspects of a political solution in the Middle East are developed.
Â Â  . Mr President, may I thank the honourable Members for a very broad and interesting debate.
The Middle East is a subject on which one could speak for hours, but I shall take up the most important points.
Firstly, Mr McMillan-Scott raised the issue of funding a chamber for the Palestinian Council.
We will have to await the outcome of the elections and see what government will be formed â I shall come back to the question of Hamas shortly.
Then we will have to consult the Palestinians themselves to find out their demands and to see where we can support them.
It will depend on that common vision whether we can support such a chamber.
I do not rule it out completely, but it is really up to the Palestinians to ask for that.
Secondly, you also asked how we could help the democratisation process.
I think our Neighbourhood Policy and the action plan would be the best basis for such further democratisation, for the rule of law, which is one of the major issues and one on which we insist very strongly.
For a year now we have had much better relations with the Israelis; on the one hand because Prime Minister Sharon kept his word on the withdrawal from Gaza â which was a step forward â and, on the other hand, because of the action plan, in which the Israelis are highly interested.
I had a lengthy talk with Prime Minister Olmert on that subject.
They are very interested in doing something.
On your third question, I would say that we are very preoccupied about the sentence on Mr Ayman Nour, the leader of the main opposition party in Egypt.
The Commission was very supportive of a Troika statement issued by the European Union immediately after the sentence.
We will follow up the case in the Council meeting of Foreign Ministers on 30Â January and then in our current negotiations on the action plan with Egypt â negotiations which, it must be said, are not easy.
To return to Hamas, I know one of the crucial questions is what the government will look like after the elections.
The polls show a possible share of the vote of between 30 and 40% for Hamas.
Accordingly, I have very clearly stated that we will work with any government that will seek peace by peaceful means and will also respect the principles incorporated in our two major agreements.
One is the interim association agreement.
As I have already said, there is democracy, the rule of law, the basic principles that we all hold up.
Secondly there is the action plan, in which there is a clear commitment to the roadmap.
President Abbas himself made it very clear that the acceptance of the Oslo Accords and the roadmap forms the basis for participation in the future government.
I know that the Israeli Government is very clear and adamant about certain things it demands of a future Palestinian Government.
We will of course work with both parties on these issues, because we know how sensitive and crucial they are in order to make progress on those issues on which we all agree: the free movement of people and goods for the Palestinians, where I have announced the possibility of going forward with the airport; where we are starting the procurement procedures in order to make it possible to get more access for people and goods.
At the same time, it is also important to see how a government can be formed in Israel.
I agree with my Cypriot colleague, Mr Kasoulides, that an interesting situation is also arising on the Israeli side.
With Prime Minister Sharon incapacitated at the moment, acting Prime Minister Olmet has taken over in a pragmatic, pro-European way â that is clearly what he stated â but in a way in which he can hold up the security question, which is the overriding question for every Prime Minister in Israel.
Hopefully, things will go in the right direction.
I do not want to interfere in any of these processes; we are still two months ahead of the Israeli elections.
The important thing is that there is a leadership in the future that is able, capable and willing to go on with that.
I agree with those who say that, as very clearly stated in the Quartet, we also have to speak out very clearly on the question of settlements, on the separation barrier.
The Councilâs report â it was a Council decision, by the way â has not been publicised, but it has already been covered in the press, so everybody knows what it contains.
