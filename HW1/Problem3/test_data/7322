We also defended our position, the EU's position, on economic partnership agreements.
Mr Mitchell may have spoken on this issue in more depth and more detail, but we had the opportunity to clearly explain what the EU's position is on economic partnership agreements.
We are seeking agreements that are fair and balanced and that favour Africa and our African partners: that is our position and nothing else.
We should be absolutely clear on this issue!
What we are trying to do is respond to African concerns and aspirations and nothing else.
Those who, in this respect, attack, criticise or devalue the effort being made by the Commission, and also the Council in support of the Commission, to conclude the largest possible number of economic partnership agreements by the end of this year are wrong.
Those who say, however, that the summit is not, in itself, the end of the road and that it will not, by itself, revolutionise relations with Africa are right.
We need to follow up the decisions made, without any shadow of a doubt.
The real value of this summit, its real importance, will be determined in the medium and long term by our capacity to fulfil what was agreed, decided and undertaken.
We must therefore follow up the decisions that were taken.
We must assess the results achieved and, only then, when this assessment has been made in the medium and long term, will we be able to properly say whether the summit was successful in terms of its consequences and effects.
As I have said, by agreeing a joint strategy, a specific action plan and concrete follow-up mechanisms, by discussing such important and current issues as climate change, integration, energy and immigration, the summit clearly represents a step forward, a maturing of our relationship with Africa.
We waited seven years to get from Cairo to Lisbon.
We are absolutely certain that we will not wait so long before we have another summit between Europe and Africa.
The importance, usefulness and significance of this summit demonstrate, without any shadow of a doubt, the need to hold another summit in the short term.
You will understand why the Portuguese Presidency is delighted at this event and this initiative which we shared together.
We thank everyone for their cooperation, commitment and effort which made this summit a success.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to quickly reply to the main points made, and then I intend to briefly discuss the economic partnership agreements (EPAs).
Two Members spoke of their regret at the inadequate involvement of the European Parliament.
I must say that perhaps we can do things better, but to be honest, with regard to other major international meetings in the past, I have the feeling that today, in any case, Parliament is fully involved in this process.
What is more, as far as I am concerned, I always take great pleasure in debating with the Members and even contradicting them, since this helps hone my own postures. I regularly change my opinions because of you, not to keep you happy, but simply because you persuade me.
The second point is Darfur and Sudan.
First of all I wish to say, like the President, that the priority of this summit was not to find a solution to this issue.
We did, however, arrange a troika meeting with the Portuguese Presidency, President Barroso, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and myself.
We met with the Sudanese President, and I can tell you that the tone and content of the message conveyed during that meeting more than amply reflected the tough words I have heard here.
We told Mr Bachir quite clearly that he had to respond in a positive manner as soon as possible to the UN to allow rapid deployment of the hybrid force that is obviously necessary to improve the situation of the people in Darfur ever so slightly.
Mr Cornillet, I must tell you that I fully agree with your speech on international humanitarian law.
As you know, yesterday, for instance, I had a meeting with all the ECHO partner operators.
There was a great number of them, and I discussed this problem of international humanitarian law.
I took up the proposal you had mentioned to me, and we have made arrangements to organise a major conference in April or May on this matter.
I also told them, even though I have no power to invite, that I would invite the European Parliament and national parliaments to attend this conference, if this is possible and if Parliament is interested in such a proposition, because it is true that every day I observe the increasing banality with which respect for international humanitarian law is being treated, and this is extremely serious.
To such a point, in fact, that while I was there, I talked to the person responsible for gaining access for humanitarian convoys.
I said to him: 'but you are not respecting international humanitarian law at all', and he said: 'but you must understand there is a war on'.
It is obviously quite dramatic to hear that, because this attitude contradicts the very essence, the very origins of international humanitarian law.
We will therefore move forward on this issue, believe me.
On the nuclear issue, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, I must say that this is a good question which does catch my attention.
You should simply be aware that this was requested by our African partners, I think more likely due to a question of principles than as an actual issue.
Otherwise, I do agree with your misgivings.
They were first of all asked to talk about non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and they said: 'all right, we can talk about that, but in that case there is no reason not to talk about civil nuclear applications'.
Well, this is all part of the current climate.
Like you, I regret it, but they did request it, and we can hardly refuse to talk to our partners about this.
It was also very low-key, and nobody is talking about developing a nuclear sector in Africa.
We agreed to discuss nuclear issues and we accepted that these are a subject to be debated between us, because it was made clear from the beginning that no subject was taboo.
Therefore I feel we do have to be coherent.
There are two other issues I wish to comment on, and then I will finish up with the EPAs.
I think it was Mrs Zimmer who said that there is particular interest in anything that can be used by major European investors.
I will come back to this again with the EPAs, but I obviously do not agree with this argument.
You can keep me here for another two weeks, day and night, and I will not accept this criticism.
I will not accept it for a very simple reason.
I have attended these negotiations for several months now, although I should say I do not negotiate, but I do attend the negotiations.
At no time did it seem to me that the ultimate objective was to assist either the European economy or European businesses.
Those who make these claims, I feel, are either mistaken or misinformed, or they do so in bad faith.
I think they are misinformed, because one never acts in bad faith.
I feel, however, that in relation to this issue the remarks are extremely unjustified.
Now I come to the economic partnership agreements.
On the subject of the interim agreements, I wish to ask: what are their aims?
Have they been devised in support of European businesses?
Not at all: the objective is actually to provide protection for countries with average incomes which would otherwise, as you well know, fall into a system of generalised preferences. This is obviously much less advantageous than the system that they operate at present, which is the equivalent system for least-developed countries (LDCs), in other words, Everything But Arms.
Therefore, if at the end of this year, despite all my goodwill, the countries concerned have no other agreement setting them on the same footing as they had until today, they will certainly lose markets, and I have already mentioned the example of the CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
This other agreement is the interim agreement.
Who have we made these interim agreements with?
In most cases, we have arranged them with countries with average incomes which would otherwise find themselves operating a much more unfavourable system than they had to date.
Has this been done to protect our businesses, to open up channels for our companies to move into Africa or invade Africa?
No, that is not true.
What, then, have we proposed?
I am now coming to the heart of the agreements, because the truth should be heard.
I am willing to listen to everyone, I am willing to understand everyone, and I am even willing to agree with certain remarks and criticisms from the House.
Well then, what have we proposed?
We have proposed transitional periods of between 15 and 25 years.
Mr Wade claims his market will be flooded with subsidised European agricultural products.
This is precisely my point.
Agricultural products can offer him protection from the 20% that is not liberalised.
I do not understand exactly what he means.
What is more, Mr Wade is not directly affected.
It is true that he is entitled to speak on behalf of all of Africa, but he is not affected because he is an LDC and he has the 'Everything But Arms' system.
Mr Mbeki, who I admire very much and get on with very well indeed, likes to denounce the EPAs, but this is easy to do.
He has a special association treaty with us.
This means we can ask ourselves to what extent he is unconcerned about bringing in all the other countries in that region as his competitors.
I do not speak in bad faith; all I am saying is that we could ask him that question.
I do not think this is the case, but we could ask him.
As for Mr KonarÃ©, the Chairman of the African Union Commission, he is a brilliant lawyer, and it is his vocation to gather up the concerns he hears from those around him.
All this is legitimate.
However, Mr Hutchinson, when you tell me 'all the African leaders said ...', that is not true.
It is not true of all the African leaders.
It is true that a number of them did ask us some questions.
For example: 'what will happen, Mr Michel, when the tariff barriers are removed?
We will obviously lose money and our ways and means budget.
How will we pay our teachers, policemen, civil servants etc?', and we said: 'you can set up regional funds, and we will draw up what we call contribution agreements, which means provision of financial resources at least matching the net fiscal impact of removing the tariff barriers in order to offset the losses, and this will give you the means to finance state services etc.'
This is an asymmetric system, a transitional period.
What else did we do?
We drew up generic matrices with these countries, at their request, for it was they who provided the content for the agreements.
What is this bureaucratic term?
Generic matrices are a kind of plan containing all the projects, all the sectors, indeed the very nature of what they want to see as accompanying measures to go hand in hand with the gradual opening up of markets if they so wish: technology transfer, increased capacities, increased expertise, work on infrastructures, interconnection or improved access, all those aspects.
I also drew up a financing memorandum by regional economic community. This is a kind of undertaking, on paper and with figures, of the resources to be made available to them by the EU.
There is only one thing I cannot do, and that is to promise them the money promised by the Member States at Gleneagles.
They promised one billion euros, and at least half of this was for Africa.
I hope they will come through on this.
This money will be provided from 2010 and is intended as aid for trade.
It is therefore extra money.
We have doubled the regional funds I mentioned before.
This is all on the table.
I must confess my great concern is 'economic integration', because I feel that in relation to the 'development' aspect, it is initially 'economic integration' that will allow them to create wealth, wealth they can obviously use for social services and to redistribute prosperity among their people.
It is true we have made very little progress on this aspect, for the reason I mentioned previously.
We will therefore be discussing, probably all next year, this matter of regional EPAs to create, maintain and consolidate this dimension of economic integration.
I therefore admit this, but this will only occur after having given everything ...
A positive response was forthcoming on everything they asked us for.
This was true on the financial front, or in any case within the budgetary limitations, and also in relation to technical-legal issues, institutional and even political issues.
What is also true is that, when we have to negotiate in 2008 in an attempt to secure this regional integration, we must be extremely convincing, and we must of course have arguments.
Do not worry, they will be heard, and we will listen to them ...
I will certainly try to do my best to reply to their concerns, their uncertainties and their questions so that we can really specifically reassure them.
I should tell you, however, that beyond this additional sum of one billion euros, half of which must be allocated to Africa, I do not have many more arguments.
We will see what will emerge from this.
I am nevertheless a little hurt to hear we have been blackmailing our partners.
There was never any blackmail of our partners for the very simple reason that we had no power to blackmail them.
First and foremost, I would not have done this.
We cannot just force our partners to sign agreements.
Pardon me, but that is simplifying things too much.
I can see the result.
I even wish to inform you about the current status of countries that have signed up, to show you that there are many more countries than you think that have signed and have understood the mechanism.
The last item to round off concerns LDCs that now benefit from 'Everything But Arms' and thus have complete and unlimited access to our markets.
In this case, I was asked what they stood to lose.
They do not, in fact, lose anything at all, but gain the opportunity to benefit from particularly generous rules of origin.
What are these particularly generous rules of origin?
At the present time, for a product to be considered as originating in a partner state, the item must have undergone at least two transformations.
Henceforth this will be a single transformation.
For example, in the case of fish caught in their waters but imported here, this will be sufficient.
That will count as one transformation, and so they may enter our markets quota-free and duty-free.
This, then, is the big difference.
There is considerable potential for opportunities of which they are currently being deprived.
I wanted to tell you all this, and I am obviously willing to repeat the experience whenever you wish.
Ask me questions, or send me questions in writing.
I promise I will attempt to answer you sincerely and in full.
If it appears that my answer to one of your questions is not good enough or is wrong, I will gladly admit this and I will rectify it, of that you may be sure.
To date I have heard all the questions, I have checked all the questions, and I have involved myself considerably.
I have not yet heard a question that did not receive a precise, specific and honest answer.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - The summit between European and African countries took place on the 8 and 9 December in Lisbon, Portugal.
More than 70 heads of state and government attended.
Malta's contribution focused on the issue of irregular immigration.
It is in Malta's interest that Africa is seen as Europe's responsibility.
Assistance given and investment made in Africa will mean that fewer people from that continent will be forced to leave their country for a better life.
The majority of irregular immigrants that reach Malta come from sub-Saharan Africa and are economic immigrants.
The situation, however, could deteriorate when the general preferential trade agreements expire on the 31 December 2007.
Most African countries have rejected the proposal of 'special partnership agreements'.
Only one fifth have signed interim agreements.
Even if the expiry date is extended, it is in the interest of every country to sign interim agreements to absorb the negative economic impact following the expiry of the 'preferential agreements'.
Other irregular immigrants who come to Malta are political refugees.
The fact that human rights issues in Darfur and Zimbabwe were omitted from the original agenda does not augur well for the voiceless who continue to suffer in silence.
in writing. - The European Council must turn its attention to Burma, where the situation on the ground remains dire.
The EU sanctions, decided on 15 October, target the leaders of the regime, their backers and those who benefit from their policies, including trade sanctions in those sectors - timber, minerals, metals, gems - from which the regime draws most of its revenue.
But is this enough?
The European Council must assess the situation and establish what further measures the EU can take to bring about real change in Burma.
It is time to apply further restrictive measures - including a ban on new investment.
Although it is too early to determine the real impact of the decisions made at the EU-Africa Summit, and despite certain contradictions, the rejection of the EU's free trade agreements (known as 'economic partnership agreements') by the African countries should be welcomed.
Somewhat ironically, this rejection - despite all the EU's unacceptable pressure and blackmail - of these 'economic partnership agreements' by the African countries constitutes a real example of what is, ultimately, the infamous 'good governance' so extolled by the EU.
In other words, it represents the assumption and defence by a country of control over its economy.
In our opinion, effective cooperation for development requires respect for national sovereignty, for political and economic independence and for the right of all peoples to decide their present and future and to define and build their country and their development project.
Such cooperation is incompatible with the more or less hidden objectives and ideas of interference, exploitation, pillaging of resources and political and economic control.
It has been said that the EU-Africa Summit turned a 'new page'.
For our part, we will continue to speak out so that the neo-colonialist ambitions of the EU and its major multinationals are not (re)written on this page.
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Question Time (B6-0384/2007).
We gave a long time to that debate because of its importance, and we hope to be able to continue over our time with Question Time to make up.
Because we are late, first of all we shall try to deal with the supplementary questions each time as a group so that we can try to get through more questions this afternoon and also, as normal, I would invite Members to come to the front to participate more closely in Question Time.
Commissioner, I am sorry you have had to wait, but it was an important debate, as I am sure you will acknowledge.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part one
Subject: Energy - World Trade Organisation
Although the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) were not formulated with energy products and services specifically in mind, they also apply to them and protect investments in the energy sector.
Accordingly, export restrictions and discrimination against products are prohibited, and free trade must be guaranteed, although there are exceptions for measures in the interests of safety.
However, in the energy trade, the distinction between production and services is not always clear.
In the run-up to the inclusion of energy policy as a competence of the European Union in the new Treaty, what measures will the Commission take to tailor WTO rules to energy investments and energy services as well?
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, as the honourable Member has observed, within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) the provisions of GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, apply to trade in energy products, and the provisions of GATS, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, apply to trade in energy services, including direct investments in such services.
There is not yet an agreement that extends to direct investments in energy-related activities carried out on the investor's own account in the secondary sector, such as mining, refining, energy generation and energy distribution.
Under Article 133 of the EC Treaty, which regulates the common commercial policy, the European Community is explicitly given exclusive power to legislate and to negotiate agreements on trade in energy products and to negotiate agreements on trade in energy services.
In addition, the Commission is empowered to negotiate on behalf of both the Community and its Member States on the liberalisation of direct investments outside the service sector in the framework of talks with non-EU countries concerning free trade agreements.
This means that the Commission can already address core issues relating to trade and investment in the energy sector and represent European interests in these matters in bilateral and multilateral WTO negotiations, and indeed that is precisely what the Commission does.
The energy policy that will be mapped out in the new Treaty will focus on matters such as the security of the Union's energy supply and the promotion of interconnections between energy networks, and in this respect it supplements but does not replace the common commercial policy in the energy sector.
(NL) Madam President, Mr Verheugen, that is indeed good news in the context of the new Treaty.
We have also, for instance, decided today to fund four Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs) to the tune of EUR 3 billion and there is another EUR 3 billion coming from industry for clean technology, aircraft engines and so on.
On the other hand, I am still concerned that obsolete technology which is harmful to the environment is still being traded, especially with developing countries.
There is an open playing field for obsolete technology, such as coal-fired power stations from the last century.
What opportunities does the Commissioner and the Union see in the WTO to at least establish a new basis and call for a stop to some of these things?
(DE) At the WTO negotiations it will be very important to negotiate on the chapter under which bioethanol should actually be dealt with in future.
Will it be classed as an agricultural product, or does it belong in the category of non-agricultural products?
How does the Commission see the future structure?
Will the more likely aim be to discuss it in the agricultural chapter, or is it more of an industrial product?
Bioethanol comes from a field crop and is essentially an agricultural raw material.
On the other hand, however, as a energy product it could fall under the heading of non-agricultural market access (NAMA).
Has the Commission already formed an opinion on this question and, if so, what line will it pursue in negotiations?
(DE) Commissioner, whenever there are discussions in my constituency about trade in energy sources, energy policy, the European Commission and the new Treaty, and especially about the WTO, time and again my constituents voice the fear that we shall have no option but to import nuclear energy and that we may even have to build nuclear power stations if present trends continue.
Please put my mind at rest and tell me this is not the case, and please give me some substantiation that I can pass on.
Vice-President of the Commission. - The Commission strongly supports the promotion of sustainable urban development which fully respects the environment.
The Commission adopted its thematic strategy on the urban environment in 2006.
The strategy recognises the whole of sustainable urban development in relation to the quality of life, but the strategy also recognises the diversity that exists between citizens in the European Union.
For this reason, and following extensive consultations with local authorities and the Member States, the strategy, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, assumed that local and national authorities are best placed to find and implement solutions most appropriate to the local circumstances.
Against the background of the diversity of urban situations, the Commission does not recommend a specific model of development valid for each city in Europe.
The Commission considers it essential to put in place the appropriate governance and planning tools, but is of the opinion that there is no real added value in imposing an obligation to establish specific plans, such as environmental management plans and sustainable urban transport plans.
The Commission has, however, published guidance on sustainable urban transport plans and on integrated environment management plans, with the aim of assisting local authorities to implement the strategy's objectives.
Guidance should be seen as a description of the process, and a reminder of the key elements that could be considered when developing integrated environmental management programmes and sustainable urban transport plans at local level.
Both documents are based upon comprehensive consultations and examples of best practice developed by cities themselves.
Legislation affecting urban areas exists already, for example in the field of air quality, water management, noise and waste.
That legislation needs to be implemented better.
A noticeable and significant improvement in the living conditions in urban areas will be seen through the full implementation of existing legislative instruments.
The Commission recalls the wealth of ideas on urban development which has allowed the ministers responsible for urban affairs to reach a consensus based on the Lille Action Programme, the Rotterdam Urban Acquis, the Bristol Accord and, more recently, the Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities adopted at an informal Council meeting on 25 May 2007.
In September 2007 it approved a Green Paper on urban mobility, which has now been submitted for public consultation.
Those documents constitute a shared background, outlining the main conditions necessary to achieve urban sustainable development.
Furthermore, the Commission actively encourages dialogue and the dissemination of best practices between cities within the framework of programmes financed by the European Regional Development Fund.
Concerning the data available on the situation of European cities, which can provide the basis for policy decisions, the Commission has put in place the Urban Audit, which contains data on the situation of European cities, and is now being updated.
The Commission has recently published a study on the state of European cities, which further analyses the results of the Urban Audit.
(LT) Many thanks, Commissioner, for your detailed and persuasive answer.
The Commission's input in finding ways to encourage towns and cities to seek positive initiatives and share them is most significant.
I would like to ask which regions you consider to have moved closest to the ideal, which, of course, remains unattainable.
Which EU Member States have achieved most in the implementation of the ideas recommended by the European Commission?
(DE) Mr Vice-President, you have just about answered my supplementary question already, but since nothing is as clear as a clear statement in our mother tongue, I would be very pleased to hear you repeat in German what you said before about the Commission not seeking to act as Europe's supreme planning authority by interfering in every area, particularly by imposing or recommending a specific development model.
As the rapporteur on the Green Paper you cited, entitled 'Towards a new culture for urban mobility', I can assure you that Parliament will certainly follow you along the path of supporting diversity.
Member of the Commission. - The question raised by the honourable Member is very important for consumers, telecom service providers and content providers, and of course also for telecom regulators.
It concerns a balance between network providers' desire to offer differential qualities of service for internet services, in order to optimise the use of its network resources, and the freedom of users to distribute or access any legal on-line content without interference such as blocking or degrading.
The Commission is committed to keeping the internet open both for service providers wanting to deliver new, innovative services and for consumers wanting to access the services they choose and to create and upload contents themselves.
The ongoing debate in the United States on net neutrality is strongly influenced by the lack of regulation in the US to ensure that access is kept open, and, combined with the concentration of network ownership, the lack of access regulation has provoked real concerns among consumers and content providers that there could be foreclosure of the internet.
The situation in Europe is that we are generally in a good position with regard to net neutrality and net freedoms, because we have effective network regulation in line with EU telecom rules, and European consumers have a greater choice of broadband services providers.
The fact that consumers have more choice and there is more competition means that, if one supplier seeks to restrict user rights, then another can enter the market with a more open offer.
The current EU regulatory framework has so far ensured that the telecom market remains open, that offers made to consumers are transparent and that competition is effective.
I understand the honourable Member's question, because there is a risk that in the future a prioritisation of traffic may increasingly be introduced.
In the past, all information, packets and bits of data were treated equally.
But today new techniques can differentiate between packets, in order to award priority to high urgency communications or to users who have paid a premium for higher-quality services.
These techniques are legitimate in cases where service levels have to be guaranteed in order for the service to be effective.
Voice-over internet services, for example, need a basic minimum level of connection in order to be satisfactory, especially for emergency or business calls.
In addition, prioritisation creates an incentive mechanism for network operators to invest in upgrading bandwidth as demand increases.
That is the nice part of the story.
The problem is that the same techniques could be utilised to degrade the quality of service to unacceptably low levels.
Such discrimination might then lead to sub-standard services for consumers and alternative providers.
That is why, in the telecom reform package, which was adopted by the Commission on 13 November 2007 and presented to Parliament that same day, we proposed to give national telecom regulators the power to set minimum quality levels for network transmission services based on technical standards identified at EU level.
In addition, there is now a new requirement in the telecom rules to indicate to users in advance any techniques that have been implemented and which could lead to prioritisation.
That is what we call the transparency rule.
We as a Commission believe that this approach strikes a balance that will safeguard competition and user access, without unduly restricting the ability of network providers to experiment with different business models.
In addition to this, Parliament knows that the Commission is closely monitoring developments as regards net freedoms.
Following the 2006 World Summit on the Information Society, we presented to Parliament a communication which clearly stated the Commission's intention to monitor and safeguard the neutrality of the internet.
The architectural principles of an open internet and end-to-end connectivity are also explicitly mentioned in the Council conclusions from 2005.
These issues are under constant analysis, are constantly monitored and are discussed regularly with Member States, for instance in the i2010 High Level Group, and with third countries.
This is important, because the internet does not have borders.
The Commission will promote continuously the need for an open internet and for non-discriminatory access.
This is what underpins the philosophy of the regulatory approach under the EU telecom rules, which will be further enhanced by our reform project, to be discussed in Parliament in the coming months.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I was very happy with your answer.
It was very broad and really showed your interest and your knowledge about this important matter.
I believe that you will be closely monitoring the system, as you have promised.
I hope that, within a year, you will be able to report back to us to see whether net neutrality has been guaranteed by the transparency clause and by the monitoring system which we have installed.
I hope we can come back to this subject within six to twelve months to see if the system is functioning.
I would also like to thank the Commissioner for a very comprehensive answer.
I had dialogue with members of Congress last week and gave them the same answer, so am pleased that you have confirmed it.
However, could you comment on the issue of sustaining open access, given that we are now moving into a new era of major investment in next-generation networks in fibre to the home, in which some in the industry are saying there is insufficient incentive to invest?
Could you confirm to this House that you will sustain the principles of open access for exactly the reasons you set out in response to Ms Riis-JÃžrgensen's question?
(DE) I, too, would like to congratulate the Commissioner on her election as Commissioner of the Year.
We really do face some formidable tasks in this area.
On the one hand, there are the public television corporations, which have been receiving a great deal of money for their output, which has enabled them, of course, to produce good educational programmes.
On the other hand, mobile TV is now reaching more and more people.
How do you assess the developments in this field?
Vice-President of the Commission. - During its seven years of existence, the European Charter for Small Enterprises has become a core document for small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) policy in Europe.
Starting with the 15 Member States in 2000, 44 countries have now adopted it as a reference frame and it is also used today at regional level.
Since 2005, SME policy has become a key element within the renewed Lisbon Partnership for Growth and Jobs, and the Charter was integrated within the Lisbon reporting process.
This ensures the necessary priority attention at political level.
This is complemented by the yearly good practice exercise and the Charter conferences, which provide the necessary focus on implementation.
Both the good practice exercise and the yearly Charter conference continue to be very successful.
The good practice exercise has, up to now, provided more than 250 examples of proven and successful SME policy measures.
In around 80 of these cases, Member States indicated that they have been inspired by measures from other Member States in the development of their own policies.
I shall give you a few examples, although I could give you a long list.
The Greek system of one-stop-shop services was inspired by Ireland and its presentation at the Dublin Charter Conference in 2004.
The Austrian tax exemption for invested profits was developed on the basis of a similar measure in Italy.
Denmark provides support for SMEs in the use of e-business on the basis of similar initiatives in Ireland, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and Norway.
In all these cases, Member States have confirmed that the Charter triggered the inspiration.
The high interest in the Charter is also demonstrated by the constantly increasing number of participants at the annual Charter conferences.
This year's Charter conference in Berlin attracted 350 participants, the highest number of participants ever, and I was very happy that I was able to be there and to address those people from more than 40 countries.
The next Charter conference will take place from 3 to 4 June 2008 in Bled, Slovenia.
It will be co-organised by the Slovenian Presidency, and I expect an even higher number of participants.
The Commission sees that the Charter is highly useful in encouraging the Member States to improve the business environment for small enterprises all over Europe.
In its seventh year it continues to be a crucial policy instrument.
So the natural answer to your question is 'yes'.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your comprehensive answer.
Where I am coming from really - and I know it is not in your area - is in relation to the whole development of internet services and broadband services.
Across Europe there is a 19% take-up.
In my own country, there is something like a 16% take-up, and it affects small enterprises in rural areas, particularly where I come from.
For instance, I fly out to Parliament from the westernmost airport in the EU, which is in Tralee.
My point basically is that the voluntary organisations of small enterprises who give support to small enterprises have been very good at giving information and I am just wondering whether we can do more with them, helping them to make information available to their members.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen, for that very encouraging answer.
I wanted to make two points in my supplementary question, on how we should move this initiative forward and build on its success.
The first concerns how the Charter will be incorporated into your ideas for a small business act, which I consider to be a very important and exciting new development.
Secondly, linking this issue to the Lisbon Agenda, would you agree with me that one of the biggest issues is how to help small businesses grow quickly, particularly those small enterprises which have good ideas but find it difficult to get capital, accelerate their growth and create new jobs?
Is there, within the Charter programme, an opportunity for a 'mini-charter' for high-growth businesses?
Vice-President of the Commission. - The issue of noise emissions of four-wheeled motor vehicles - cars, vans, trucks and buses - is addressed by UNECE Regulation No 51 and equivalent Directive 70/157/EEC introducing noise tests and limit values.
The limit values have been reduced several times in the past, most recently in 1995.
The maximum allowed sound level lies today between 74 dBA for passenger cars and 80 dBA for heavy trucks.
A further allowance is given to direct-injection diesel engines, off-road vehicles and sports cars.
This latest reduction did not have the expected effect and subsequent studies showed that the measurement method does not reflect real-world driving behaviour any more.
It was therefore decided that, before reducing the limits once again, it was first of all necessary to develop a new test cycle and bring the driving conditions for the noise test closer in line with real-life driving operations.
The work on a new test cycle is now finalised.
It will replace the existing test protocol with a better measurement method reproducing the sound levels generated by heavy vehicles during normal driving in urban traffic.
With the new test procedure, it is foreseen that the existing additional allowances for certain vehicles or technologies will be abolished.
Before this method can be used for type-approval purposes, new limit values for this method need to be established on the basis of an impact assessment.
In order to obtain representative data to determine those values and establish a solid impact assessment, vehicle manufacturers are obliged to carry out the old and the new measurement methods in parallel during a period of two years.
The old method will continue to be required, in order to receive type approval, and the new method will be used for monitoring purposes until 2009.
As soon as the collection of data is finished, the Commission will propose new legislation setting revised limit values.
A new test method for motorbikes is also close to being finalised.
The discussions in the UNECE are now focusing on additional roadside tests that would be carried out during type approval in order to provide noise values that would allow comparison with those measured at roadside checks in order to detect motorbikes that have been tampered with or that are insufficiently maintained.
It is expected that the work can be finalised in 2008.
The Commission will then propose to adhere to the relevant UNECE regulation with revised limit values.
In addition, the Commission has recently carried out a consultation exercise on a package of measures on tyres, including the reduction of the existing noise limit for tyres.
The consultation proposes reduction of around 4 dBA for passenger car tyres and 6 dBA for commercial vehicle tyres: it is quite considerable.
The new limits would be expected to come into force for new tyre types around 2012.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your comprehensive reply.
I certainly welcome your indication that there is a new test site now available and that new limit values will be set.
I am coming at this from an Irish perspective.
In the last few years we have had the phenomenon of what we know as 'boy racers', who modify old cars, take to the roads at all hours of the day and night and cause a major problem in relation to sound emissions which sound like a jet plane, causing major disturbance, particularly in urban areas.
I welcome the fact that there are two regulations, as you mentioned, Commissioner: UNECE Regulation No 51 and Directive 70/157/EEC.
But the problem as I see it, in relation to UNECE Regulation No 51, is that it applies only to new cars.
I think there should be a specification, at least in relation to the reply received from Commissioner Dimas: there should be a regulation that there should be no modification of a car and that there should be regular tests.
(DE) Commissioner, in the case of road vehicles, noise emissions may not exceed defined ceilings.
In the case of rail transport, the ceiling is based on average noise levels, which means that extremely high noise levels have to be endured in the vicinity of railway lines simply because the average noise level does not exceed the permitted limit.
Does the Commission intend to adopt similar measures to those that apply to motor vehicles so as to provide relief in future for those who live next to noisy stretches of railway line?
(LT) I would like to point out that we keep referring to specific requirements a lot, but the issue of their implementation is not being covered sufficiently.
Speaking of pollution, I would like to draw the Commissioner's attention to the fact that the mechanism for monitoring all the requirements we have just discussed happens to be very fragmented.
In my opinion the Commission should put forward a proposal (perhaps they are in the process of preparing one) with a view to harmonising the procedure for administering pollution criteria and assessing pollution, as it is a key problem for small countries such as Lithuania whose management bodies are weak and do not have the means to implement all the requirements.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the first question, there is no doubt whatsoever that modifications to vehicles which result in noise emissions above the permitted level are prohibited.
Such modifications may even be a criminal offence.
It goes without saying, however, that it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure, through their normal traffic surveillance, that such traffic offenders - for that is precisely what they are - are caught.
I do not see the remotest prospect that we at the European level can do anything to make the Member States take more action to curb practices which are unequivocally illegal.
Car racing on the public highway is, of course, illegal in every European country.
There is no European legislation that anyone could cite in answer to a charge of racing on the public highway.
This matter therefore lies entirely within the competence of the Member States, which have all the instruments they need to prevent such offences.
As for noise emissions from rail transport, my direct responsibility is limited to active noise prevention, in other words what can be done to cars to limit the noise they emit.
I am not directly responsible for the passive noise prevention to which you have referred here.
I am more than willing, however, to discuss the matter with the competent Commissioner and to ensure that you get an answer as quickly as possible to the question as to whether the Commission has any plans in this respect.
I do, in fact, share your views entirely.
This is a very important issue.
Noise prevention efforts cannot be focused on road traffic alone.
Modern railway technology can pose particularly serious noise problems.
I know from Germany that noise pollution is a very significant factor in the modern technology that powers the Transrapid monorail system.
We shall therefore look into this matter, and you will receive a definite answer.
The third question referred to control mechanisms.
On this matter, I can only say that our legislation is unambiguous.
The rules are clear, the limits are clear, and responsibility for ensuring that the limits are observed lies with the Member States.
The Commission does not possess control instruments with which it can check in every single case whether European legislation is actually being applied in the Member States.
The subsidiarity principle is a fact of life.
I cannot identify where we would have to amend European legislation in order to ensure that it was properly applied everywhere.
The rules are the same for all Member States.
They have clear instructions stipulating how these should be applied.
In this case, which concerns Lithuania, I can only say that our counterparts in the parliament and government of that country are responsible for ensuring that such problems do not arise.
Member of the Commission. - The Commission is following closely the recent developments in prices in Member States.
It considers that those increases cannot be easily explained by one single factor, but need to be seen in the broader context of rising world demand for oil and gas.
However, increasing investment activity - and in particular the switch to more sustainable energy production - definitely plays a part too.
Moreover, the point of departure for market opening was, in several Member States, very low prices.
In the medium and long term, this failed to give the necessary signals for much-needed investment, and we are now paying the price.
As to the question of whether such price increases can also be attributed to the exercise of market power, the Commission has studied this issue and it came to the conclusion that electricity prices in certain Member States were higher than one would expect in fully competitive markets.
In this respect, the Commission, the Council and the competition authorities armed regulators to identify anti-competitive behaviour and to take the appropriate action.
The Commission is also itself investigating alleged anti-competitive behaviour by certain operators, and has launched five anti-trust proceedings in the course of this year.
The Commission is very much aware of the structural problems in the sector too.
Therefore, the third energy package makes wide-ranging proposals to remedy those structural problems, in particular by proposing ownership unbundling of the transmission system operators.
The Commission has always been of the opinion that consumers should be the main beneficiaries of liberalisation.
The Commission's proposals for the third energy package therefore contain a number of measures which will strengthen the role and rights of consumers.
In particular, the package proposes to give consumers the right to switch supplier at any time and to have free access to their consumption data.
By increasing consumer awareness and rights with respect to their energy consumption, the Commission is providing the tools for a functioning retail market.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased you are keen to allow consumers of gas and electricity to be the priority beneficiaries by applying more restrictive measures in this sector, which we hope will have some effect on prices for EU citizens, downwards of course.
I can give you an example: a 20% increase has been announced in Belgium, and this is just impossible for the worst off.
As a humanist I cannot accept this situation.
Furthermore, Commissioner, can you assure me that consumers will in fact be involved in all phases of the implementation of liberalisation, by making them part of the various advisory committees and also by involving them in the new mechanisms for settlement of disputes?
(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to ask a question on the consumer retail forum you said you would work towards.
When do you intend to launch this forum?
What type of participants can this forum have to allow it to actually function to the benefit of consumers?
What will the function of this forum be in relation to everything you have just said?
(LT) In Germany electricity prices have recently risen by 10%, the reason given being that electricity creates a great deal of comfort and is therefore bound to cost a lot.
Will the third energy package have any effect on regulators?
Would it be possible to have any influence on price increases when there are no reasonable grounds for them?
Would it not be useful to apply certain restrictions to price increases when there are no grounds for making excess profit?
Member of the Commission. - I will start with the third question.
There are issues that could be dealt with by the market, by consumer power, but there are issues where we need structural change.
The particularity of the electricity market is that the marginal power plant decides the price level.
Here, it is very clear that we need complete transparency in the market, which is why the third regulation package really addresses the separation of transmission activities from the supply activities.
Otherwise we will never have a chance to ask whether we are paying a fair price.
Secondly, if you create the conditions for competition in the market, then the price trends are really that it is not increasing or coming down or it is increasing less compared with an uncompetitive market, because otherwise the companies which have a semi-monopoly could really dictate the price.
That means that these two issues are actually in the hands of the governments.
On consumer power, we have adopted a consumer rights charter and this definitely gives all the right information about the rights of consumers stemming from all existing legislation.
We have strengthened these rights even more.
Regarding the consumer forum, we will certainly invite the consumer organisations that are well represented in Member States and the umbrella organisation.
The best supporters of our measures to really create a Europe-wide competitive market definitely come from the different consumer organisations.
As the author is not present, Question No 41 lapses.
Subject: Energy cooperation in south-east Europe
What measures is the Commission taking to reduce the dependency of south-east European Member States and candidate countries and the Balkan states included in the Thessaloniki process on Russian energy supplies?
Member of the Commission. - The Commission pays great attention to the security of supply situation in south-east Europe.
This was among the main objectives in setting up an Energy Community, which is based on EU legislation, for the internal gas and electricity markets, and in particular its provisions on security of energy supply and solidarity.
South-east Europe is at the crossroads of several main energy routes.
Several countries of the region produce gas.
I would mention Croatia and Romania.
New LNG terminals on the Adriatic coast and the new gas and electricity interconnectors linking to the different energy sources were recently put into service or are at an advanced phase of development.
However, for certain countries there is a significant share of natural gas from one provider for the industrial sector, for heating and also for power generation.
In the framework of the Energy Community Treaty, with the support of EU financial instruments and the international financial institutions, the Commission promotes the development of an integrated market in the region, anchored to the EU market.
But this means that the development of gas and electricity trade in the region, the development of new interconnection and generation projects and the setting up of a stable regulatory framework will considerably enhance security of supply.
Moreover, new gas sources will allow the development of the gas sector in those countries where it does not exist yet.
There is also a very clear focus on energy efficiency.
In order to strengthen energy security, the Commission favours the policy of diversification of suppliers and of transport routes.
In particular, it strongly supports the development of the Nabucco project and other gas projects and LNG developments in the region, as well as well-grounded oil projects aimed at achieving the diversification objective.
The Commission also considers that Russia will in the future remain an important energy source for south-east Europe but alongside other sources from the Mediterranean Basin and the Caspian Sea region.
(DE) First of all, thank you very much for your very good and thorough reply.
I only have two brief supplementary questions.
Firstly, is there specific cooperation with the two candidate countries in the region, namely Croatia and Macedonia?
Secondly, Kosovo's energy dependence is a particular problem.
Is it not possible to provide special support for wind and hydro power in neighbouring Albania?
As a matter of fact, there is considerable potential for hydro-electricity generation in Kosovo and Albania in particular but also in Macedonia.
(LT) Two weeks ago news broke out regarding an agreement between Italy and Russia on the construction of a new gas pipeline in the Southern region.
This South Stream pipeline actually duplicates the Nabucco project.
Vladimir Putin commented that he was grateful to the Commission for approving this project.
I would like to hear your comments on this.
Member of the Commission. - Concerning relations with Croatia, that country is part of the accession negotiations and is most advanced in terms of accepting the Community acquis, at the same time participating in all the activities of the Energy Community.
Because of its more advanced stage in respect of the acquis, Croatia is also more integrated into the EU energy market and is leading a couple of projects.
Macedonia is part of the Energy Community and is also advancing with implementation of the acquis.
Its advancement in this respect means that it is a leader in the region.
Concerning Kosovo, we are working with UNMIG and supporting all the activities there.
I know there are always certain difficulties with payments and power supplies, but until now we have managed to resolve these issues and people have received the energy supplies they need.
Concerning the Italy-Russia pipeline South Stream, I never saw this as a replacement for Nabucco.
Nabucco is advancing well, as has been reported in the Council.
I have also received first notifications from the regulators concerning the third-party access issue, and Nabucco is looking for new supply sources - Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Egypt and in time Iran.
The issue of South Stream is very clear-cut.
It is a supply source of Russian gas.
It is a project that at this stage is undergoing a feasibility study that will be performed jointly by ENI and Gazprom.
We must wait and see how the project develops.
It definitely gives the European Union a new supply route and strengthens security of supply, because more pipelines towards the EU mean more security of supply, but it is not replacing Nabucco.
Concerning the praise from President Putin, I have no particular comment to make.
Subject: Ireland's integration into the EU energy market
The security of Ireland's energy supply is becoming increasingly important for consumers, businesses and policymakers; hence the need for full interconnection with the broader European energy market.
To achieve this, the necessary infrastructure needs to be put in place to ensure a secure supply of safe and reasonably priced energy.
In Ireland, EIRGRID is currently in the consultation phase in relation to the Meath Cavan Power Project and the Cavan-Tyrone Interconnector, both of which are part-funded by EU TEN-E Initiative, with the EU likely to contribute to the construction phase.
Locally there is concern about the scale of these proposed projects, notably in relation to the possible health implications for those living in the immediate vicinity of the power lines.
Could the Commission make a statement in relation to this particular dimension of the problem?
In addition, given that the power lines run for up to 58 kilometres, there is a strong argument in favour of placing these lines underground.
Could the Commission outline its position in relation to this aspect of the abovementioned and similar projects across the EU?
Could the Commission outline what is considered best practice and what needs to be taken into account in deciding whether such power lines are carried over ground or under ground?
Member of the Commission. - The Commission has no competence over the siting of power lines, which is decided exclusively by the Member States authorities under the respective EU environmental law.
The Council recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields establishes a framework of minimum restrictions and reference levels, but the Member States are responsible for the implementation of the measures.
As far as the possible health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields are concerned, the scientific committee on emerging and newly-identified health risks has recently adopted an opinion which provides an assessment of the state of scientific knowledge in this area.
Overhead power lines are often the most cost-efficient solution for long-distance transmission of over 50 km.
Underground cables are also a proven technology, but until now used more for short- to medium- distances, and this is more expensive as things stand.
The construction of overhead electrical power lines with a voltage of 220 kW or more and a length of more than 15 km has to undergo an environmental impact assessment.
Furthermore, any plan or project for overhead electrical power lines that is likely to have a significant adverse effect on Natura 2000 sites is subject to the procedural safeguards set out in Article 6 of Council Directive 92/43/EEC.
Can the Commissioner tell me if there is any definitive evidence or scientific proof in relation to whether or not electromagnetic fields are a hazard to public health?
I know that the Member States, as he said, have the final competence in relation to their interconnectors and their cables etc.
Secondly, would the Commissioner not agree that, despite the fact there is resistance from industry, at the same time, from the point of view of visual intrusion, public health and the environment, it would preferable if such cables were underground?
Member of the Commission. - I will start my answer with undergrounding.
Up until now, undergrounding cable technology has been used only in limited cases, like Madrid Airport.
In principle there is now no limitation on the length of the cabling itself.
The question is the cost.
That cost would normally be around three to five times higher than overhead lines, and, to date, it has not been used for the very reason that you have two options.
In fact, it has only been used when overhead lines are impossible.
There are some cases where municipalities are now considering the use of cables, which will be ground-breaking cases.
However, it will mean more costs for the consumer.
Concerning scientific evidence on exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, there is a general limitation, there are the Council recommendations that I mentioned dating from 12 July 1999, and there are minimum framework restrictions and reference levels.
However, as concerns further scientific evidence on damage to health, I am not aware of a need to go beyond those safety recommendations originating in 1999.
Basically, overhead lines are still a viable option and I believe that the choice between overhead lines or cables is one that should be made according to the situation, if one considers that cabling is not without its difficulties too.
One needs to be aware that a Natura 2000 site may be involved or that there may be some impact on the environment.
There is no solution that makes zero impact on the environment.
At the same time, there are technology choices that could be proposed, and companies are aware of these.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
Commissioner Piebalgs stays with us but will now answer questions on behalf of Commissioner Dimas.
Subject: EU funding of European environmental NGOs
Through NGOs civil society plays a very important role in meeting the needs of the process of European integration and new kinds of European governance.
Which Community action programme is currently in force for supporting European NGOs active mainly in the environmental protection field?
Which NGOs (and which of their activities) which contribute to the further development and implementation of the Community's environmental policy and legislation have so far received funding?
What is the amount of funding received per NGO?
Is the scope of the existing Community programme differentiated geographically?
Which Greek NGOs have taken part - or are taking part - in the current programme, either independently or on a transnational basis?
What are the criteria governing the selection, monitoring and evaluation system based on impact results and indicators?
Member of the Commission. - Funding from the Commission to support the operation of European environmental NGOs is provided through a programme that has existed since 1997.
The legal basis for the current programme is the LIFE+ Regulation.
The objective is to strengthen the participation of European NGOs in the development and implementation of EU environmental policy.
A large number of diverse NGOs have been founded during the course of the programme.
Lists of operations and amounts are published on the DG Environment website.
Time does not permit me to read them all out, but the list will be forwarded to the honourable Member.
There is no geographic differentiation in the programme, since it is targeted towards European and not national organisations.
To be eligible, the organisations should pursue activities in at least three EU Member States.
But only one of the organisations consistently funded, the Mediterranean Information Office for Environment, Culture and Sustainable Development, is based in Greece.
Many of them have Greek member organisations, for example, the European Environmental Bureau, EUROPARC and International Friends of Nature.
Grants are awarded in a yearly call for proposals.
Applications are assessed against award criteria and the NGOs that have the best potential to contribute to development and implementation of the EU environmental policy priorities are selected.
Monitoring and evaluation is ensured by the Commission, based on reports submitted by the beneficiaries as well as an in-depth audit.
In this process, the extent to which the organisation has fulfilled its work programme and contributed to EU policy development and implementation is assessed.
(EL) Madam President, I wish every success to Commissioner Dimas, who is representing the European Union at the Bali Conference.
However, I would expect more light to be thrown on the particular questions I have asked, because the questions are specific, and the answer was given in general outline.
I would like to believe that Commissioner Piebalgs will intervene to ensure that the Commission sends me the information on the specific questions I have asked.
If nothing else, I am one of those who believe that non-governmental organisations are a form of European governance, albeit an informal one; they play an extremely important role, and that role - this is the reason for my question - must be given greater prominence.
So I am waiting for the information, not in terms of transparency, but in terms of the democratic accountability to which the Commission is subject.
To conclude, I would like to ask Commissioner Piebalgs to use the official name which the European Union has accepted, when referring to third countries.
(DE) Commissioner, I should like to ask you a question on this subject that has been occupying me for a long time.
I myself am a member of some of these organisations.
Recently, however, I have been wondering more and more often how democratically these organisations work and whether the Commission checks whether these NGOs are democratic organisations that hold internal elections or whether they are bodies with a command structure that is not open to scrutiny and is not accountable to the members of the organisation or to anyone else, which would mean that funds might, in certain circumstances, be channelled in directions that no one would suspect.
Member of the Commission. - The legal basis is very clear: it is the LIFE+ Regulation.
We evaluate organisations on the basis of this regulation.
That means we have particular criteria regarding which organisations may apply, but we do not evaluate the internal structure and the internal organisation.
Concerning the question about transparency, we definitely support transparency.
We will provide answers in writing to all the questions you have asked, along with the list that I promised in my answer.
I think it is important that the public can monitor the situation, because it is very clear that it is public money that is given to NGOs and the process should be completely transparent.
The Commission does all it can to guarantee this process is transparent and accountable, in accordance with the LIFE+ Regulation.
Subject: Waste crime / protection of the environment through criminal law
In February 2007 the European Commission proposed a directive (COD/2007/0022) that obliges Member States to treat serious offences against the environment as criminal acts and to set minimum sanctions for environmental crimes such as waste crime.
This is a positive step - as the Environment Agency of the UK Government has pointed out, one major problem with fighting environmental crime is that fines are too low and thus do not offer sufficient incentives for compliance with environmental regulations.
However, given the obstacles facing this directive before it becomes law in Member States, what other steps does the Commission envisage in order to combat waste crime across Europe?
Member of the Commission. - Ensuring that Member States correctly apply EU waste legislation and preventing illegal waste activities are among the Commission's top priorities.
The proposed environmental crime directive will ensure that serious environmental offences are subject to effective criminal sanctions throughout the European Union.
All serious waste-related crimes, including the illegal treatment, transport, export and import of waste, are covered by the proposed directive.
The environmental crime initiative is, however, far from being the only action taken by the Commission in order to prevent waste crime.
The Commission is taking a number of specific actions in areas where waste crime is a serious problem for Member States.
This concerns, in particular, illegal landfills and illegal waste shipments, which are covered by important EU legislation.
The Commission takes early action in order to prevent negative environmental and health impacts as a result of waste activities.
Awareness events concerning landfills and waste shipments are organised where the risk is high.
Last year, 16 such events took place and, this year, another 10 events are planned.
Multilateral meetings are also regularly held with national authorities and stakeholders to tackle bad implementation of EU waste legislation.
Guidelines are continuously developed regarding key EU waste legislation, such as on waste shipments and targeting particular problematic waste schemes, for example, waste electrical and electronic equipment and light vehicles.
Focus on such guidelines will ensure that EU legislation is uniformly and correctly applied throughout the European Union.
It is of paramount importance to know what is going on in the Member States and to verify compliance on the ground.
The Commission closely cooperates with the IMPEL network regarding, for example, joint enforcement actions on waste shipments and inspections and monitoring of landfills.
Systematic failures by Member States to respect EU waste legislation are continuously met by legal action from the Commission, including the powerful threat of fines under the EC Treaty.
For example, in 2003 Greece was fined EUR 20 000 a day for tolerating an illegal landfill on the island of Crete.
Currently, a large number of illegal landfills in many Member States are being tackled by serious infringement actions launched by the Commission.
The Commission is also encouraging Member States to make use of funding opportunities at EU level and to ensure that the waste programme expenditure under the various instruments contributes to the improved implementation of waste legislation.
The EU waste shipment regulation contains the basis for cooperation between Member States to prevent illegal waste shipment.
We are currently examining the need for further actions in order to strengthen the enforcement of EU waste legislation, including legally binding rules for inspections of waste shipments.
Specific criteria could possibly be defined in order to ensure sufficient quality and frequency of inspections.
Thank you, Commissioner, for that comprehensive answer.
I recently consulted with the Environment Agency in the United Kingdom on this directive.
While we all welcome the prioritisation of the Commission in this area, what I was hearing from the Environment Agency in my own Member State was concern that the penalties and possible fines in Member States will be pitched far too low for there to be any real incentive to obey rules where enforcement action would not actually occur.
This would result in massive fly-tipping and dumping of illegal waste.
Do you have a view on this, bearing in mind also that the Environment Agency and other national agencies welcome these proposals very much?
Member of the Commission. - As for fines imposed on the Member States, I would mention that, for Greece, the fine is per day, and per year it is quite substantial.
In my opinion, in the case of Member States' failure to enforce legislation, we should follow the legal infringement procedures that we follow, and it is the Court which decides on the fine.
For companies, the fines are also imposed according to national legislation if this is violated.
So it is up to the Member States to really strengthen these fines, because, from the Commission point of view, we do what is required and we cannot prescribe the fines for not implementing vigorously enough EU legislation.
It should be addressed through the Court, because that is the legal structure of the European Union.
If there is a need to strengthen the system of fines, we will definitely follow this advice very carefully, because, basically, fines should be imposed in a way that prevents violation of the law, not just so that companies can shrug them off or pass the cost on to consumers.
But, in this area, I believe that everybody shares the same objective, so I believe that the level of fines imposed today is not an issue.
The issue is that legislation is not implemented vigorously enough and inspections are not particularly frequent, and that requires that the Commission should take additional steps to guide the Member States to take stronger action on waste crimes.
(DE) Commissioner, you rightly pointed out that the enforcement of legal provisions is at least as important as their enactment. We have a case that you have not mentioned yet.
That is the situation in which the disposal of certain waste is made a criminal offence in one country, and the waste in question is then shipped to another country.
In such a case, in fact, two Member States are probably committing infringements of the Treaty.
Has consideration been given to this eventuality too?
Member of the Commission. - The verification of compliance with the requirements of Directive 91/271/EEC on urban waste-water treatment is a complex task as it implies the evaluation of data concerning thousands of agglomerations all over the European Union.
The Commission's services collect and assess all information available and focus on the data included in the national implementation reports.
When their assessment shows that Member States are not complying with their obligations under the directive, the Commission initiates infringement procedures in accordance with Article 226 of the EC Treaty.
Given the thousands of agglomerations which have to be checked, the Commission has privileged a horizontal approach.
Thus, instead of randomly starting individual infringement procedures for each agglomeration, the Commission has initiated global cases addressing the situation per Member State and per core obligation.
Greece is one of the Member States which still face significant problems in properly implementing the directive.
As regards agglomerations of more than 10 000 inhabitants, Greece has designated 36 sensitive areas.
Out of the 18 agglomerations discharging into those areas, 14 comply with the requirements of the directive.
However, the Commission considers that 10 other water bodies should have been designated as sensitive areas.
There is an ongoing infringement procedure at this stage of a reasoned opinion.
The Greek authorities contest the need for the designation of those areas as sensitive.
The assessment of the information sent is ongoing and, if necessary, the Commission will not hesitate to bring the case before the Court.
As regards the specific question of the agglomeration of Thriasio Pedio, in its judgment of 24 June 2004, the Court of Justice declared that Greece had failed to install a collecting system and to provide for appropriate treatment.
The Commission has therefore initiated an infringement procedure in accordance with Article 228 of the Treaty.
The Greek authorities have approved the construction of infrastructure required, which is co-funded by the Cohesion Fund.
According to the information available, the project is planned to be operational by the end of 2009.
As regards agglomerations of more than 15 000 inhabitants or their equivalent, out of the 75 agglomerations, 52 meet the standards laid down by the directive as regards collection systems for urban waste water and secondary treatment.
With regard to the agglomerations that are not in compliance, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure.
In its judgment of 25 October 2007, the Court ruled that 23 agglomerations still did not comply with the requirements of the directive.
The Commission has requested information from the Greek authorities on the measures they plan to take in order to comply with the judgment.
As regards the point raised on the reduction of the size of agglomerations, the Commission verifies the information available and addresses any inconsistency in the framework of the ongoing infringement procedure.
It should be stressed that, in order to comply, Greece uses the European Community funding available.
As far as the Cohesion Fund is concerned, in Greece 41 projects are currently open.
The absorption rate is 49%.
Very often, such projects are combined projects which, apart from waste-water- and rainwater-related infrastructure, may also include water supply infrastructure.
The ERDF Operational Programme 'Environment' co-finances nine waste water projects.
These projects relate to the construction and/or modernisation of waste-water treatment plants and sewage networks.
The absorption rate is 19%.
As regards asserting regional operational programmes of the ERDF, the question of absorption rates for the waste-water sector should be addressed to the competent regional authorities.
Contrary to the case of the Operational Programme 'Environment', a Member State is not required to inform the Commission of the progress of each individual project.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, in your answer you mentioned dozens of major cities in Greece which remain without adequate sewage treatment because of incomplete construction of the biological cleaning plants, although the great majority of them were co-financed from Community funds.
I ask you: can you give me a list of those cities which you referred to in terms of numbers?
And secondly, what does the Commission have to say about the fact that years after implementation of the European legislation, these problems persist?
Do you intend to take the matter to the European Court of Justice?
And if so, when?
Member of the Commission. - In a couple of cases we are going on with the infringement procedures.
The information that we can provide, we will provide.
However, in some cases I mentioned, we can inform you about progress on the Operational Programme 'Environment', but we cannot report on each project, because this information is available to each Member State.
So you will get information that is available to us.
As I made a point of saying in my answer, we are very vigorously pursuing implementation of the new acquis in this area.
Questions 67 and 83 are inadmissible.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
I would like to thank the Commissioner for staying with us and, in particular, our interpreters for going over time.
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 20.10 and resumed at 21.05)
European Aviation Safety Agency (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council Directive 91/670/EEC, Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and Directive 2004/36/EC (10537/3/2007 - C6-0353/2007 - (Rapporteur: JÃ¶rg Leichtfried).
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, as a postscript to this report, since the process is apparently drawing to a close, let me take the opportunity to express my sincere thanks to all those Members who have supported me in this work over a period of more than one and a half years.
My special thanks go to Mr Becsey, Mr Degutis, Mrs Lichtenberger and Mr KohlÃ­Äek, to the Commission for its strong support and to our Secretariat, and particularly Mr Vervloet.
It was certainly very interesting to see how colleagues truly became friends in the course of that year and a half as a result of working together.
That is also reflected in the report we have produced.
Thank you all very much.
On the report itself, we are confronted with a paradox with regard to European airspace.
On the one hand, Europe's airspace has been completely liberalised for the aviation industry and air carriers, while, on the other hand, there are still 27 different civil aviation authorities with 27 sets of rules and ways of thinking which sometimes diverge.
As a result, the skies above Europe have not become any safer but are actually less safe than they were.
This has led certain airlines to engage in a kind of licence shopping, in which they have tried to obtain their licences in countries where licences can be got more easily and where the rules may not be quite so strictly applied.
The consequence has been very many minor incidents, some accidents and some disasters in Europe's airspace.
The idea behind this report - an idea I fully support - was to create uniform rules governing air operations, certification of aircraft and aircraft parts and licensing of pilots.
The aim was not only to create uniform rules but also to ensure that they were then jointly and simultaneously implemented.
That was the Commission's original intention, and a large majority of the European Parliament endorsed that intention.
Our aspiration, however, was to go further and make it easier to achieve the desired aim.
We wanted EASA, the European Aviation Safety Agency, to become more efficient, to be able to act more swiftly and to be more responsive.
It was the wish of Parliament that the controlling body of EASA, the Management Board, which still reflected and asserted the national interests of the Member States or the national agencies to some extent in its deliberations and activities, should be given a somewhat more independent position.
The second idea was that, since only two options had hitherto been available to EASA for dealing with errors and problems, namely to do nothing or to withdraw an operator's licence altogether, there was a need to find intermediate responses.
The third point, which I consider essential, was that one group of staff employed in air operations with special responsibility for safety, namely cabin crews, was still the only uncertificated category of personnel in the entire field of aviation and that this had to be changed.
What has been achieved?
With regard to the Management Board, we succeeded in improving the situation by securing an obligation on its members to submit a report to the competent committee of the European Parliament.
We also managed to introduce a system of penalties which enables EASA to respond flexibly instead of having to choose between the so-called 'nuclear option' and no action at all.
Above all, we also succeeded in finding a means of ensuring that cabin staff will henceforth be licensed.
In other words, a uniformly high level of training, safety standards and all the accompanying attributes will now be found among cabin crews too.
We have managed to deliver a report that has largely won the acceptance of all parties.
The industry was content with the report, the trade union was content, the employees were content, our House was content, and all but a few of the Member States were content with it.
The most important success, however, lies in the fact that passengers in Europe's aircraft will be safer in future.
That was the most important thing we could have achieved, and we have achieved it.
(Applause)
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, Mr Leichtfried, ladies and gentlemen, we are now on the verge of obtaining agreement at second reading with the Council on an extremely important proposal.
We owe this especially to the fine work by the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, who I wish to congratulate specifically.
We also owe this result to the spirit of compromise among all the shadow rapporteurs, and I wish to express my thanks to them also.
I wish to remind you of the approach underlying this proposal for a regulation.
On adopting Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002, laying down common rules in relation to airworthiness and establishing the European Aviation Safety Agency, it was agreed that an optimum and uniform level of safety could only be secured by extending the scope of this text and, therefore, extending the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency to air operations, pilots' licences and safety of airline companies in third countries: this is the purpose of the amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002.
Furthermore, this proposal intends to step up controls and penalties in the event of non-compliance with these rules and, in the light of experience, to improve the functioning of the European Aviation Safety Agency.
The Council's common position generally follows the proposal made by the Commission, even though a number of provisions, such as those relating to the Agency's governance, have been reduced.
The common position also takes account of a number of amendments tabled by Parliament at first reading.
Our three institutions have worked hard in recent months to reach an agreement at second reading.
Some major improvements were made thanks to amendments by Parliament.
This has produced a system of fines, as Mr Leichtfried has just told us, which will allow the Commission to give a tailored response in the event of minor infringements of the safety rules.
This option is in addition to the withdrawal of certificates and will add flexibility to relations between the Agency and the entities it administers.
Thanks to the persistence of Parliament, the initial Commission proposal concerning cabin crew attestations was reintroduced.
This is a major step forward in acknowledgement of this profession.
The added value of well-trained cabin crew is quite obvious.
They have solved delicate situations on a great many occasions.
Cabin crew perform a major safety function.
A pragmatic solution was also found to flight time limitations.
Additionally, in specific discussions on the Agency's budget in relation to fees and charges, the Commission undertook to take account of the specific situation of small and medium-sized enterprises when reviewing the Regulation on fees and charges, especially the impact on their economic feasibility.
In relation to the definition of complex aircraft, I feel the compromise is balanced.
I understand the concerns of some Members not to overburden certain sectors of the market with requirements.
Here the Commission will also assess the economic impact of including aircraft with one or more turbojet engines or turboprops.
Concerning possible changes to the system for ultralight aircraft, the Commission will ask the Agency for its opinion on this matter.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think I have covered all the major points in the compromise.
The Commission can therefore easily accommodate these amendments which reflect a negotiated compromise between the three institutions.
I again thank Parliament and the Council for allowing a rapid second reading.
Rapid adoption of this text will also guarantee the Agency's reserve for the year 2007.
Thus, the last phase of implementation in the EU of a coherent and uniform set of safety rules will be completed with the proposal that I will make to the College in June 2008 on extending the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency to safety of airport infrastructure, air traffic control and air navigation services.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to your determination and, I repeat, of your rapporteur in particular, we can move European skies closer to maximum safety.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Madam President.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs on my own behalf too, and I think that perhaps in this way we will manage to close this chapter tomorrow at the second reading.
To touch briefly upon the compromises for the second reading, which are important for my group: the first is the issue of punishment, which has cropped up many times.
The current text has already improved a lot, and I think that there is a lot of protection in it for those concerned.
It truly is progress that the licence does not have to be taken away immediately, and I also hope that the built-in system of an appeals authority established by the Commission really will work and not destroy small businesses.
The other big question for my group was tariffs, mainly on the part of the British and Czechs.
It is still too expensive for small businesses and - I think - my British colleagues will say so, and I also hope that the obligation, undertaken by the Commission, that we will mention the situation of small businesses even more at the time of the audit, will be noticeable.
I considered the composition of the management authority and management administration to be very important, and Parliament really has been given a role of political control here, which I feel is a very important step forward so that the Member States do not send to the administration whatever and whoever they want.
Financial independence is also important for this authority so that we can put the revenue into different categories depending on where it was taken from.
To summarise, I would therefore like to congratulate all my colleagues, and to say that I hope the responsibility has filtered through to everyone.
It also shows that by joining forces we have, with the Council, been able to bring the issue of cabin crews back to the original Commission level, and it shows that we have been able to find a very good compromise on restrictions of flying time. I would like to thank the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur again for their work.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I wish to congratulate my colleague JÃ¶rg Leichtfried on his human qualities and on his ability to make friends in a complex parliamentary confrontation on such a technical issue, but also so vital an issue, in order to ensure safety in such an important sector for European economic development as aviation.
I also wish to state my satisfaction at the progress made in relation to safety, a difficult and complex issue if ever there were one, with some areas that are totally clear, as today's report shows, and others rather darker, although I prefer not to say which areas occur to me.
Today we have certainly taken another stride towards finalising a long and complicated process, at least part of which began many years ago with the transfer of JAR-OPS requirements to EU-OPS requirements; I refer in particular to the progress made concerning rest and flight time.
At that time both Parliament and the Commission committed ourselves to charging the Agency with moving forward on an issue which, though difficult, ultimately filled an inexplicable gap and, at that particular time, required updating.
Thus I am pleased that those involved were able to accept this commitment, which I feel was important and was what Parliament was bound to do.
All in all, I feel these issues will have to be reviewed following the study and the proposals now being drawn up by the Commission on the situation of the aviation sector in terms of social and employment issues, an important concern.
I am also very pleased at the agreement on cabin crew, whose professionalism and certification must be recognised.
As the Commissioner rightly said, it is in everyone's interest from the point of view of safety for training to be improved.
I am likewise very pleased at the positive outcome of the definition of helicopters, which at one point had created cause for concern in the production sector.
I also feel the solutions provided on penalties are extremely important, as also Parliament's control not only in relation to comitology, in the case of flight time, but also in relation to the right to information, in the case of the Management Board.
I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his flexibility and clarity in connection with the Agency's budget, since, as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I feel it is essential for this kind of Agency.
To end, I wish to express the hope that the Agency can develop without clashing with Eurocontrol.
In my opinion European and worldwide aviation safety needs both bodies, and it needs both to be equally effective.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) My thanks to the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council.
I have found this subject and all the work done on it not only interesting, but also useful.
Despite the fact that after lengthy discussions an acceptable compromise has been achieved on nearly all issues, the Commission's position regarding the classification of aircraft types up to 7 500 kg according to weight gives cause for concern.
The Commissioner has briefly touched upon the subject.
This apparently very technical subject is of great importance to the aviation industry and happens to be very complex; therefore, it would have a significant impact on the development of new technologies and their implementation in the aviation industry.
Unfortunately, discussions on this directive have been used not for the first time, to my understanding, to promote internal competition without much consideration being given to the damage caused to the whole of the European Union in terms of outside competition.
I have in mind competition with the United States, Brazil and possibly very soon with China.
Personally I am disappointed with the Commissioner's position on this issue.
To some extent I can appreciate the positions of Individual Member States being protected in the European Council.
However, the European Commission should not have considered this issue from the narrow point of view of the corporate interests of individual countries.
The benefits for the Union and possible harm caused by the implementation of such decisions should have been given serious consideration.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, small companies and individual aircraft owners would be forced to use single-engine aircraft produced using obsolete technologies instead of modern twin-engine ones with modern jet technology.
The worst thing about it is the fact that this decision has been made under the disguise of aviation safety.
Who has ever heard of a single-engine aircraft being safer than a twin-engine one?
Regretfully, this is the understanding of aviation safety shared by the Council and, alas, the Commission today.
Today I am not afraid to sound very categorical because, as a pilot myself, I know what I am talking about.
I am interested not in the declarative, departmental side of the issue, but merely the practical side.
I am sure it will not be long before we start to feel the consequences of this, to my true belief, very wrong position and will then unavoidably have to declare the names of its creators to the aviation community.
Nevertheless, I believe in the efficiency of the Aviation Safety Agency and in its position enough to be prepared to undertake another study with a view to assessing these conclusions and perhaps negating them.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, Mr Leichtfried has done excellent work on the task with which he was entrusted.
I should therefore like to offer him my personal congratulations and those of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
Sensible compromise should allow us to finalise work on the rules relating to civil aviation in the Union and the safety of air transport.
Air transport operations, licences, training, crew and aircraft of countries outside the Union are also affected.
The work we are today involved in is a continuation of the initial 2002 Regulation.
In my view, we are dealing with a sensible expansion of the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and improving many financial and management procedures.
The question as to whether this is necessary and useful is bound to arise in such a situation.
The answer has to be yes, in view of the dramatic increase in aircraft movements over Europe and the need to coordinate connections whilst retaining maximum safety levels.
These unifying measures do not really involve restricting the sovereignty of Member States.
Instead, they amount to an acceptance by these countries of the highest possible standards in the field of civil aviation.
Safety in terms of all stages of the flight itself and also of conditions at airports has to be deemed a priority and must not be allowed to be the subject of conflicts of competence with national authorities.
I also anticipate that the competence of the European Agency will be broadened to include matters currently dealt with by Eurocontrol.
There is therefore no need for a proliferation of standards.
In this context, including third-country aircraft in the scope of EASA actions is particularly important.
It will allow checks to be made to establish ex-ante whether an operator from a specific country meets safety standards before being authorised to fly within the Union or to fly into the Union from outside.
The Convention on International Civil Aviation signed in Chicago on 7 December 1944 plays a key role in this area.
Indeed, we marked its anniversary only four days ago when we celebrated International Civil Aviation Day.
I would remind the House that the 2007 slogan for this day was: 'Global Air Transport - a driver of sustainable economic, social and cultural development'.
I trust that it will not be long before the EASA assumes a role within the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization), which is a UN body dealing with issues pertaining to aviation at global level.
After all, this is a problem affecting the entire world.
The issue of fees and charges requires clarification.
I very much hope that the Commission will take account of the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises in this regard.
The Member from Hungary has already spoken to this effect.
We are dealing with a very important issue that will benefit our citizens.
We therefore trust this venture will be crowned with success.
In addition, we hope the details of its implementation will not prove irritating to passengers as is unfortunately sometimes the case in such situations.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I would also like to begin my speech with a word of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried.
He cooperated closely with us and always kept us informed.
That was a good starting point, for the subject was not the purely technical and administrative matter it might seem at first sight.
It ultimately became very clear that, as is so often the case, this was a struggle involving numerous competing interests.
Let me deal now with the individual points.
I believe - and I hope this reflects a widespread conviction - that a single airspace needs strict and uniform supervision.
Divergent investigation standards must become a thing of the past, and at the end of the day we must have an instrument - an instrument with teeth - to properly implement and enforce the blacklisting rules for aircraft based outside as well as inside the European Economic Area.
We learned at a hearing that blacklisted aircraft cause far more accidents than all the others.
It is, in short, clearly apparent that European rules make very good sense.
We all hope, of course, that we shall now make equally rapid progress on the issue of functional airspace blocks, which continues to be thwarted, as you know, by the national interests of some Member States.
That is a great pity as well as being highly detrimental in the long run to efforts to reduce the volume of emissions from air traffic.
Whether there should be penalties or fines was one of the most complex questions.
Yes, I am afraid there is no alternative in our world.
We saw that intermediate measures were needed for an efficient system, and these have now been put in place.
One final word on cabin crews: I am very pleased that we have now come up with a sound arrangement.
It was high time we did.
The recognition of that occupational group must be taken further, and another task on the agenda will be to cut emissions and to make aviation less harmful to the climate than it has been to date.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express my thanks to all those whose hard work has brought about the outcome of the conciliation procedure, namely Mr Leichtfried and Mr Props of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
I welcome the ambitious plan of the EASA to simplify testing procedures for aircraft under 1 tonne and for aircraft with a maximum take-off mass under 2 tonnes.
The debate so far leads me to believe that Annex 2 will be retained in its present form.
I hope that together we will soon open the door to the LSA category - Light Sport Aircraft - in the internal market for all manufacturers in the EU countries.
I do not believe that any of the parties involved would like to see the demise of this promising and developing sector, which has several dozen small and medium-sized enterprises operating within it.
We urgently need a set of temporary rules for these enterprises, which are situated mainly in Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy and France.
I also hope that, following Parliament's accommodating approach, representatives of the Commission and EASA will show similar flexibility and vision in regard to the present position of this rapidly developing segment of the world market.
I believe that their decision will support further development of the light aircraft sector in the European Union by using the recognised testing and certification procedures, mechanisms and organisations.
I hope that the representatives of the Commission and of the Council will, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, support further development of this branch of the aviation industry, which is so progressive both in technical and technological terms.
At this particular stage of development, premature decisions, just as much as prolonged hesitation, could have fatal consequences for the sector.
I look forward to further debate and to the proposal on the progressive lowering of contributions of small manufacturers in aviation engineering.
I would like to thank you in advance for your support and understanding in this area as well.
As a goodwill gesture, I would like to express my full support for the compromise achieved.
Madam President, there is no doubt that aviation safety is a vitally important issue and one that we cannot afford to ignore.
However, the European Aviation Safety Agency continues to display many failings, especially with regard to its ability to run in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
As a result of these inefficiencies, Parliament has in the past decided to suspend funding from the Agency.
I am therefore alarmed that, despite these problems, Parliament now appears happy to oversee an extension of the Agency's powers.
In order to highlight the impact that the EASA is having on businesses across the EU, I wish to draw Parliament's and the Commission's attention to the case of a company in my constituency.
This company, with whom I have much correspondence, will see charges for the issue and renewal of maintenance approvals soar as a result of these new regulations.
According to my constituent - whose cost increases I have in writing - maintenance costs will rise from GBP 1 206 this year to in excess of GBP 3 000 next year.
This represents an increase of 150%.
I am worried, to say the least, that an extension of powers to EASA will represent only an increase in terms of the burden of extra red tape and not the extra gain in safety that we all desire.
Until such time that EASA can prove that it is fit for purpose in a manner that is not harmful, especially to small businesses, and in a manner that does not represent yet more red tape, I, along with my British Conservative colleagues, must oppose any further extension of powers to this Agency.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my opinion is the exact opposite to that of Mr Bradbourn, but, before I proceed, may I add my thanks to Mr Leichtfried for the report and, of course, for the skilfully negotiated compromise.
Extending the powers of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is a step towards guaranteeing the highest possible standards of aviation safety, uniform pilots' licences with equivalent training standards, licensing of airlines from countries outside the European Economic Area and uniform training of cabin crew as well as responsibility for the implementation of EU-OPS.
By enabling EASA to impose fines for non-compliance with safety regulations, I believe we are considerably enhancing its enforcement powers.
This, I hope, will soon put a stop to the sometimes unnecessary and unproductive rivalries and power struggles between the national authorities and EASA.
The rapid growth of aviation in Europe makes it essential that EASA should be a strong body with centralised responsibility for overseeing technical safety.
In my view, this also means that the funding of EASA must be put on a stable long-term basis.
I believe that one of the next steps will be to ensure not only that the work of the national air accident investigation authorities in Europe is coordinated but also that their findings are analysed by EASA.
That will enhance safety in Europe and prevent whitewashing by the affected Member States.
In the long term, and I emphasise the long term, we need a model in Europe that will not only make the national tier superfluous but will also deal jointly with matters relating to safety and accident prevention, as the Federal Aviation Administration does in the United States.
That is my vision.
(EL) Madam President, the three-day discussion of this topic has already been completed and we are simply called upon here to agree on a complex issue: complex because it tries to provide a global solution to problems which are specific in their extent.
Thus, it is proposed that the Commission should be able to impose fines, as an alternative to EASA's power to withhold an airline's certificate in the event of a contravention.
Note that under this regulation, the agency in question will be responsible for issuing certificates.
This will entail thorough technocratic restructuring and, for this reason, the proposed regulation provides for an independent budget for the agency, so that it does not lose its independence in relation to the Member States.
Although this ambitious scheme seems to have fitted into a proper technocratic mould, I wonder who will bear the political responsibility for possible future mistakes, a responsibility which is currently borne by the competent national minister or administrator of the Civil Aviation Authority.
In this case, then, we are creating, in the name of political unification, an agency which has no reason to exist since these matters could very easily have been organised at multilateral level within the framework of existing mechanisms such as the ICAO.
Besides, if there is a problem with flight safety, there is no one to blame but the European Commission, which pushed liberalisation of the sector to the limit, with the result that small private airlines are springing up like mushrooms, without the necessary infrastructure or know-how.
Let us not start trying to salvage our mistakes by wasting taxpayers' money!
We now have 22 external agencies of the European Union.
At some point we will have to limit ourselves to the ones that are essential.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the oft-invoked 'European sky' is still far from being a genuine common airspace, even after more than 50 years of the European Communities.
The Member States remain fundamentally unwilling to give up their sovereign airspace for the sake of a united Europe or even to share their sovereignty with Europe.
Moreover, common European legislation is lacking in many specific technical areas too.
Our aim in establishing the European Aviation Safety Agency, or rather in extending its remit, is to forge ahead with a small but important regulatory package.
The Commission presented a balanced proposal.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism and its rapporteur have, we hope, improved it.
In the next step of the process, the report has been the subject of successful consultation with the Council, which means that we can now be hopeful of its adoption at second reading tomorrow.
Lastly, as many other Members have done before me, I should also like to mention the rapporteur and thank him for his good work.
Together with his shadows, Mr Leichtfried has done a really good job.
Let me remind the House, however, that there is still a very great deal to do.
Yesterday and today we discussed many unresolved issues relating to air safety.
I hope we shall manage to reach a consensus on the remaining key issues of funding, comitology and liquids - a buzzword, perhaps, but one with deeper implications.
We need a consensus on these matters if the dream of a common European open sky is to become a reality.
(RO) Madam. President, the objective of the proposal for amending the Regulation on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing the European Aviation Safety Agency is to improve civil aviation safety in Europe.
These amendments aim at extending the initial applicability of the regulation to the aircrafts used in the Community airspace as well, obviously within the limits imposed by the Chicago Convention.
One of the subjects that have created controversies is related to the certification of the on-board personnel.
The Commission has continuously taken actions to improve aviation safety; it has regularly published a black list of companies that do not meet the safety standards imposed by the European Union.
There is already a sixth list published.
The field of air transport has experienced strong development and this development cannot be achieved without meeting the security standards.
Low-cost companies are also part of this development and we should specify that, in 2006 alone, approximately 300 new routes were created, which represented approximately 1,800 flights every week.
According to a recent survey, in 2006 alone, low-cost companies transported 140 million passengers, such companies being present in 280 European airports.
Low-cost companies provide 427,000 jobs directly or indirectly.
I believe this regulation is extremely important for air transport safety.
Although there is a possibility to punish non-observance of security rules, we must not create a bureaucratic system, but a flexible one, which would contribute to the air transport improvement.
I also consider it important to acknowledge certificates for on-board personnel.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
Madam President, since its inception in 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has, sadly, been a benchmark for incompetence.
Now it is time to look at the agency carefully.
Evidence suggests that safety standards have sometimes been neglected and, after all, the EASA is meant to be a safety agency.
What is more important than safety?
It is clear the agency has experienced significant difficulties in setting up and operating in a satisfactory way.
Unaccountable delays still exist in its procedures.
It is still not meeting its own objectives and the confusion and disruption are putting the EU at a competitive disadvantage.
In the UK, regulatory costs are, of course, high because the Civil Aviation Authority is required to recover its costs from the services it provides.
But this does not take into account the new increases in maintenance costs and negative impacts on the repair sector caused by EASA.
But this agency is not just affecting big commercial airlines or businesses. It is affecting private pilots like myself.
I am worried.
Take the instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) rating, which I myself hold: the certification that allows UK private pilots to fly by using a plane's instruments to fly in more unfavourable weather conditions - well, I understand that is now under threat from EASA.
Flyer magazine in the UK writes that the IMC's case is not helped by the fact that it is designed for peculiarly British conditions.
The UK weather means pilots need more of an IMC rating than others.
The scrapping of this would be disastrous for the light aviation industry in the UK and might lead to thousands of pilots like myself having their certificates effectively revoked.
I must ask, whatever else the Commission looks at, please reassure me and so many other pilots about this important issue.
The EASA's performance has been unacceptable.
I am afraid it is not yet fit for purpose.
A single aviation market is not going to be achieved while distortions remain, while delays in procedure persist and while common sense is not applied to the aviation sector.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I am at the disposal of Mr Kirkhope, who is an excellent pilot.
If he encounters any difficulties with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) - and I do not believe the Agency has made any controversial moves recently - but, if this were the case, I would be the first to protest and would be at your disposal.
Having said that, I also wish to reassure you that the Agency's regulation and control function will not involve any tasks requiring additional financial resources, insofar as these tasks are financed by public funds.
I simply ask Parliament to ensure that the Agency has the necessary resources so that, as Mr Bradbourn told us, it is not obliged to seek charges which could be excessive in certain cases.
I honestly believe the EASA's track record has been positive.
It is of course understood that the Agency's means of action must be perfected, but I feel we must not underestimate the potential of the EASA for European aviation as a whole.
As proof of this, I can tell you that Mrs Marion Blakey, a former Administrator of the FAA in the United States, held meetings with the Agency in Cologne to discuss cooperation since she felt EASA was a high-quality agency.
Mrs Blakey told me this personally.
I listened very carefully to the comments by Mr Degutis.
As I said, the Commission has not ignored your arguments.
It will assess the economic impact on the aircraft market, whether or not aircraft are defined as complex, and I wish to tell you that we have taken due note of your request.
I note that you are also a pilot, and we will not bring this matter to a conclusion without studying it carefully and taking appropriate action.
You were right to persist.
Madam President, it would be bad form for me to prolong the debate excessively.
I particularly wish to thank Parliament.
I feel we have made good progress on safety and, as Mr Rack said, on a single European sky imposed in functional airspace blocks.
Mrs Lichtenberger is right to say that the blocks are essential for a much more efficient and environmentally friendly sky.
Therefore, Madam President, I thank Parliament for its extremely positive work on this issue.
There will be subsequent stages in this process - everything in due course - but I believe we now have a regulation that will make European skies even safer.
Once again I wish to express my thanks to the House.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday 12 December 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) I am glad we have secured a balanced agreement with the Council.
This ought to allow us to rapidly implement the text, which definitely represents progress for the EU and passenger safety.
Now all aircraft from third countries will be inspected and must obtain certification to transport passengers within the EU, and this also represents progress in terms of harmonising the protection of European citizens.
This extends the process that began with the European blacklist, allowing all passengers to be protected in the same way regardless of which airport they use within the EU.
Before I finish, I wish to mention another point that I feel is important.
In the recent adoption of the Galileo project, 50 million euros were taken from the budgets of several European agencies, and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was one of them.
I have always supported the Galileo project because it is especially important in my region, and I am very glad an agreement has been reached on how it will be financed.
I wish to point out, however, that we cannot simultaneously increase the powers of an agency and reduce its budget.
EASA must not be affected by this levy.
Eurovignette (debate)
The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Paolo Costa on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, concerning Eurovignette - B6-0386/2007).
substitute of the author. - (RO) Madam President, the subject we are discussing is a requirement that the Committee on Transport has had for some time and which it submitted to the European Commission in order to present a model for internalization of external costs, applicable to all modes of transport.
In fact, I requested the Commission to present, by June 2008 at the latest, after examining all options - including of costs related to environmental protection, noise, congestions and health - a generally applicable model, transparent and comprehensive, for assessing all external costs, which would define and act as a basis for the subsequent calculation of charges for using infrastructures.
Based upon the intermediate results obtained in developing this model, the Commission should indicate whether the global environmental costs, such as the costs related to climate changes and the recently published costs, related to health, are examined in the intermediate report and if they shall be taken into consideration as a substantial factor in the subsequent assessment and calculations.
I would like to mention the fact that the directive we refer to offers the possibility to the Member States to introduce a road tax and, for its calculation, to take into account more cost elements than before.
In fact, there is a discussion regarding the inclusion of the so-called external costs, such as those related to environment, into the road fee.
Many Member States are against the introduction of such costs into the road tax, because they think that there is no sustainable model for this calculation, but other countries believe that these taxes will generate income and that, in this way, the necessary funds for developing infrastructure will be created.
I would also want to mention the fact that it is extremely important to ensure fair competition between the various modes of transport, but also to ensure a reduction of traffic noise.
I believe that the proposal the European Commission shall submit will also help us improve transport efficiency and, especially, the efficient use of various modes of transport and, of course, thus will contribute to the overall sustainable development of transport.
24.1% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the 27 Member States come from or are due to the field of transportation.
For this reason, it is important for us to know if the environmental costs, such as climate changes, will be a part of this proposal.
I would also want to mention that the Eurovignette directive allows Member States to include an additional tax for certain roads in sensitive areas, such as the mountain regions in the Alps and Pyrenees.
Any income thus collected should be reinvested in other alternative means of transport and related infrastructures.
I would also want to ask the Commission if it could confirm to us the fact that, after the European Union ratified the Transport Protocol of the Alpine Convention, the paragraphs in the mentioned protocol regarding the enforcement of taxes on the transport of goods will be taken into consideration in this model.
I hope Commissioner Barrot will offer us details regarding the date when a new amendment of the Eurovignette directive in force shall be launched by the Commission.

I would like to finish this presentation with two additional questions, namely I would like to ask the Commission if these external costs will be internalized not only for road transport, but also for other means of transport, in order to ensure a balance in the development of various modes of transport and, also, I would like to ask the Commission how it intends to monitor the implementation of this Eurovignette directive.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, the Commission carried out a study to collate all publications on the subject and identify the best practices for assessment of external costs.
Many of the various methodologies identified referred to research projects financed by the Commission: Unit, ExternE, and other more recent projects.
A handbook is now being drawn up and we intend to publish this shortly.
This is the first point.
Secondly, the Commission has started work on an impact assessment in relation to compensation for external costs.
Many charging options have been identified and submitted for public consultation.
The consultation will come to an end on 31 January 2007 and a high-level conference will be held in January 2008 to present the handbook and the results of the public consultation which will add to the ongoing impact assessment.
This is our work schedule.
As you can see, it is quite intense.
The following external costs are being considered: accidents, congestion, air pollution, climate change and noise.
The assessment covers all means of transport.
It envisages different systems and different economic instruments such as taxation, user rights and emission rights trading. We are assessing the instruments using a model-based quantitative analysis.
The purpose of all this is to make our means of transport increasingly environmentally friendly.
In accordance with the results of this work, the Commission will issue a communication before next summer.
I wish to digress slightly to answer Mrs Å¢icÄu on the Alpine Convention.
The aim of the Convention's Transport Protocol is to establish specific charging systems that take account of actual costs and encourage the most environmentally friendly transport systems.
The system introduced by the 2006 Eurovignette Directive to encourage the use of more environmentally friendly transport systems pursues the same objectives as the Alpine Convention's Transport Protocol.
What does the present Eurovignette Directive actually say?
It makes provision for obligatory modulation of tolls to be paid as of 2010 by vehicles which pollute up to 100% more than environmentally friendly vehicles.
In mountain areas, the Directive aims to internalise the external costs of environmental damage and congestion through an additional toll of up to 25% of the infrastructure toll.
Revenue from the additional toll must be reallocated to projects that make a direct contribution to alleviating environmental damage.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make myself very clear: this communication, in light of all the work I have mentioned, is an extremely difficult task, believe me.
It will allow us to assess the best calculation methods in this field.
It will define a methodology that can be used for the various means of transport.
In mid-2008, before the summer, in fact, in June, I also intend to submit a report to the College on the assessment and internalisation of external costs.
I mentioned a communication, and so I will submit this report, with the agreement of the College, along with a proposal to amend the current Eurovignette Directive.
It is clear, but it must be stated, that the proposal in relation to the present Eurovignette Directive constitutes an amendment that will allow external costs to be internalised within the scope of the current Directive.
This was what I had to say to the House.
Madam President, I know all this is at the heart of our sustainable development policy.
It is in fact necessary to internalise external costs but, in order to internalise external costs, we must have a Community definition and we must choose the best internalisation methodology.
I have tried to be as precise as possible this evening, and I am willing to return to the House to report on the difficult and important tasks required by the report which I will be presenting in mid-2008.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, what you said about having commissioned studies and preparing conferences is very heartening, but let me ask you a simple question.
I do not intend to ask whether you are going to present a communication by 10 June 2008, but I will ask whether you are going to present, by 10 June 2008, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 11 of the current version of the Eurovignette Directive, what that Directive calls - and I quote - 'a generally applicable, transparent and comprehensible model for the assessment of all external costs' and for the assignment of these external costs to operators of all modes of transport.
So are we going to get a model for the assessment and assignment of external costs, yes or no?
My first question is as simple as that.
And so to my second question.
If I read the situation correctly, in contrast to the requirement to present a model, you are under no obligation at all to present an amendment to the Eurovignette Directive in 2008.
That would no doubt be impossible anyway, because the idea, if I understood it correctly, is to develop a model for the distribution of costs and then, at the implementation stage, to apportion external costs to operators of all modes of transport - inland navigation, sea shipping, railways, private cars and so on.
What must not happen is that you begin by undertaking an amendment of the Eurovignette Directive and apportioning external costs to hauliers but take no action to ensure that operators of barges, trains, etc. also meet their external costs.
This is why I should like to know whether you will be undertaking a revision of the Eurovignette Directive at the same time as you provide for the apportionment of external costs among the other modes of transport too.
Two simple questions, and I hope to receive two simple answers.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, let me begin by thanking the Commissioner for his remarks.
As you know, Commissioner, we have been having this discussion about the assessment of external costs since the 1920s, and we Members also proposed various models when we were adopting the Eurovignette Directive.
However, since we did not succeed at that time, for political reasons, in incorporating external costs to any great degree into the method used to calculate the road tolls for heavy goods vehicles, we reached an agreement that you - the Commission - would present a uniform method by the summer of 2008.
That agreement assumes particular importance in the light of the present discussion on climate change.
This being the case, we now have questions to ask. Some of them have already been aired.
Firstly, will the Commission present a universally applicable and transparent model for the assessment of all external costs by June of next year, a model that may be regarded as universally binding?
When I hear of a handbook, it sounds good, but the term tends to suggest a pick-and-mix catalogue of good practices.
What we want, however, is a universally binding method that will not subsequently be called into question.
Secondly, will this model take account of the climatic and environmental objectives set by the EU?
That is what my honourable colleague Mrs Å¢icÄu asked.
In terms of method, that would no easy matter, because all the existing approaches focus purely on the inclusion of current costs and not on the achievement of environmental goals.
If the pursuit of these goals were factored in, it would create a prescriptive element - a normative dimension, as it were - whereas the debate has so far been confined to current costs.
Thirdly, it goes without saying that we want a legislative proposal at the end of the day.
May I therefore ask when the Commission intends to revise the Eurovignette Directive?
Is that its intention, or is this still entirely up in the air?
Fourthly, when will this method or model start to apply to the assessment of infrastructure charges for other modes of transport too?
That precise question has been exercising us, as Georg Jarzembowski said.
We want to get rid of the distorted competition between modes of transport and raise them all to a common comparable level.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Commissioner, thank you very much for your remarks.
It was quite thrilling to hear what you told us about the process and the timetable.
The issue that will be on the table in June is crucial, and not only for the Alpine region.
I believe that you - a man of the mountains, as you have described yourself - are patently aware of this and that it is important to you.
It has major implications for all roads as well as for all countries whose transport routes, and especially roads, carry high volumes of traffic and for all who live near these busy arteries.
The huge costs generated by such heavy traffic place an enormous burden on the countries most affected by it.
This burden is more than doubled, according to numerous studies that have already appeared, by external costs.
That point must be taken into consideration, and its importance needs to be far more clearly reflected in the actions of the Commission.
We shall not be content, however, Commissioner, with a philosophical and mathematical treatment of the issue of assessing external costs.
We need implementation, but we cannot wait for twenty years until the last lobbyist has been convinced.
Nor shall we be able to wait until the environmental pollution from bicycles has been calculated too.
The bottom line is that we shall have to act immediately.
We need a proposal for a regulatory instrument in the course of 2008, we need to discuss it, and we need to conduct this debate now, not in twenty years' time because we have had to wait until everyone has been convinced by governments of countries which are, in many cases, far less seriously affected by the problem than those in the central part of the European Union.
Commissioner, the mountains need you to act.
Sensitive places such as cities and other protected areas need a written regulation that clearly states what is reckonable.
The Member States can no longer bear the burden of environmental pollution alone, and they should not be required to do so for much longer.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, as has already been said, you described yourself as a man of the mountains at the time of the discussion on the European toll disc, the Eurovignette, and you certainly went a long way towards living up to that name, at least in the context of those earlier discussions.
Now, however, there are more steps to be taken, steps that are probably more important.
The time has come to internalise external costs or, if I may switch from Euro-newspeak to a language that people understand, to ensure that we all pay for what we get in the realm of transport and to obtain more knowledge about who generates what costs and surely also more knowledge about how we can recoup the costs from those who generate them.
You have presented us today with a timetable which contains initial key elements of what you promised back then.
That, I believe, is good, and what you have presented should certainly be welcomed.
What is missing, however - and this has already been mentioned - is the absolutely crucial next step.
When will there be a proposal for a legal instrument which will ensure that the various infrastructure users are charged on the basis of the true cost of their operations?
And there is a wide diversity of users to take into account.
We wait with bated breath to see if it will prove possible, and we expect it to prove possible, to achieve this goal in the current legislative term, for only if we actually set this instrument in motion will other major projects that have been approved in recent weeks and months, some of them proposed by you, become sound investments.
If we pour a lot of money into the construction of the Brenner tunnel, that will only be a sound investment if a shift in the cost structure actually leads to the desired changes on the transalpine route.
In that respect we are confident that you, as a man of the mountains, will help us on this important issue.
(ES) Madam President, following on from the broad agreement on the need to deal with adapting transport to the challenge of climate change and other effects to make it as sustainable as possible, since this is the only way to make transport competitive in the EU and worldwide, the Eurovignette has proved a useful initial tool to deal with the problems of congestion, pollution and so on, by providing modulation that is both sufficient and quite diverse in terms of its application to a range of heavy vehicles.
However, in view of the complexity of the problem, a number of questions occur to me, and so I wish to ask the Commissioner whether, in accordance with his offer and the agreement reached with the House, the ongoing studies involve the same measuring rule for all means of transport, and I do mean all of them.
I would also like to know whether, after the methodology has been drawn up, the proposals to be submitted will also refer to all means of transport.
I feel we cannot miss out on the chance to apply such an important exercise to all means of transport, since all of them are involved, and we need credible solutions for all of them in coherence with the co-modality proposal.
I would also appreciate information on a number of matters I feel are important.
How does he intend to relate the proposed amendment of the Eurovignette and the new methodology for the internalisation of external costs to the 'green corridors' that appear in the logistics action plan and which could perhaps represent some scope for an extension to this methodology?
How will this financing instrument be added to the current debate on the financing of EU policies?
Will the Commission be prepared to extend it to private vehicles also?
Would this not be more efficient and less discriminatory?
How can we curtail its effects on the additional problems of growing isolation in an increasing number of areas and regions?
Finally, does he feel that this instrument, the instrument he is now preparing, will prove sufficient on its own to provide finance for public works such as the large tunnels forming part of the trans-European road systems?
(DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, you may remember that, in the discussions on the last amendment of the Eurovignette Directive, I was one of those who clamoured insistently for internalisation of the external cost of road haulage operations.
Our bid failed.
For this reason I am pleased, on the one hand, that we are now heading in that direction.
I am not pleased because I campaigned for this the last time but because I see what has happened in Austria in the brief intervening period.
It is no longer merely western Austria that is awash with heavy goods vehicles.
We have now reached the point where eastern Austria is congested too, with some of the roads there completely blocked and the area around our capital, around the city of Vienna, already bursting at the seams.
For that reason it is high time we finally managed to factor the external cost of HGV operations into the European toll disc.
I appreciate, of course, that this kind of system must be applied to all forms of transport, but we have a set of rules in place for HGVs, so that is where we must now begin; needless to say, we must also go on from there to deal with the other modes of transport.
I would add my voice to those of my fellow Members who have asked when we are going to be presented with an actual legislative draft.
The second point I wish to address is that we should perhaps reflect on the fact that this is a problem throughout Europe, and merely prescribing high tolls in parts of certain small countries will serve little purpose.
Instead, we ought to come up with a general system.
In this context, I wonder whether we should not assess the potential of minimum tolls, at least on trans-European network routes, as a means of adjusting the modal balance throughout Europe.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I always listen to the House with great interest, but I nevertheless wish to explain a number of points.
First of all, since this is a matter of finding the model, as you say, we must take account of the fact that there are certain practices in the Member States and that, before deciding on the model, we must first discuss the calculation methods used in the various Member States.
I regret this, but the handbook at least has the merit of opening up public debate to do just that: to find the best model.
Now, I cannot understand why the Commission is seen to be on the sidelines of the issue when it has taken the trouble to examine all the practices in the Member States, to gradually find a genuine calculation model that could be used in Europe: on the contrary, I feel we are at the very heart of the matter.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should tell you this is a difficult exercise.
I also feel I must defend the services provided by the Transport Directorate-General, which at present is compelled to find reliable methods, because if we do not have reliable methods, there will never be any acceptance across the EU of these methods and this model, as Mr Stockmann said.
I also wish to express my great surprise to Mr Jarzembowski.
I am told: we must act, we must take action towards more sustainable transport, transport that is more environmentally friendly, we must support the railways, we must support river transport, and we must support maritime transport.
As Mr Leichtfried very wisely said, we have to begin at the beginning, and we can rectify later.
Let us begin by improving the present Eurovignette Directive, that is my proposal, if the Commission agrees with me, in June 2008.
We will internalise the external transport costs of heavy vehicles because that is precisely how we will encourage the use of other modes of transport.
However, Mr Jarzembowski, at some point in the future we will also apply the calculation methods to these other modes of transport as well.
Having said that, we must take one thing at a time.
We can hardly take action and do everything at once.
That is not possible.
We need a method; if we want the EU to accept this policy, believe me, we must act intelligently.
I am most determined on this issue.
I must thank Mr Rack for praising my mountaineering abilities.
I do not stop halfway, even when the route turns into a slope or a gradient; one must keep up a reasonable pace to get to the summit.
The debate is closed.
