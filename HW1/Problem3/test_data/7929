In these cases, too, we must respect their democratic decision.
Nevertheless, the votes in the Netherlands and France, two of the founding countries, have still created a new situation that we must face up to.
Via these polls, the people have expressed their worries, their aspirations and expectations, but also their disappointments.
Unfortunately, European unification no longer seems to be this mobilising project that has enabled us, over decades, to reconstruct our continent in peace and prosperity, before reconciling it by means of enlargement.
Is hope changing sides?
Does Europe now only inspire anxiety, incomprehension?
Is it bringing upon itself all of the social unrest that many of our fellow citizens feel, quite rightly, faced with difficulties, faced with long-term unemployment for too long?
I do not think so.
The message sent by many French and Dutch citizens is twofold.
True, there is dissatisfaction with the form and operation of Europe, but, at the same time, for a large proportion of the citizens who said no, there is still considerable support for the idea of Europe and for the necessity for it, but it is support for a Europe that acts differently in a world that is undergoing a process of transformation.
The European Council will have to listen to these messages, expressed following a democratic debate that, certainly, has been lacking for too long.
All those who justified their choice to refuse by referring to a hypothetical PlanÂ B must now realise that there is no easy escape from a situation that has become extremely complex.
We must note, today, that DeclarationÂ 30 nevertheless provides for a situation in which, at the end of the ratification period, several countries have not managed to complete this procedure.
We must also take into account the fact that ten countries have successfully completed the ratification procedure while more than half of the Member States have not yet expressed their opinion.
It is not easy to deprive these people, or these parliaments, of a democratic debate and of the opportunity to express their opinion in their turn.
Let us also remember that the draft Constitution is the result of an overall compromise, that it has its own coherence, and that we cannot easily have one element without another.
The European Council should therefore carry out an in-depth collective analysis of the situation before defining clearly how the process will continue.
One thing seems certain: the European Union must not slide into a sort of permanent uncertainty, opposition to change or, even worse, paralysis.
Our institutions work, and will continue to work.
Our decision-making capacity is intact, even if, obviously, the provisions of the Treaty of Nice are inadequate, in view of the political, economic and social challenges that the EU and our Member States must deal with ever more urgently.
The citizens expect concrete action, better consideration of their concerns, whether in economic and social matters or with regard to their security.
The world is wondering about the future of the EU, which has for a long time fascinated many peoples on all continents.
The European Council must therefore broaden its thinking.
It cannot limit itself to procedural issues, when peoplesâ expectations are, above all, political.
A political EU must remain our aim, and the construction of a true European democracy is still the only way of achieving it.
In that context, the negotiations on the financial perspectives take on a very particular dimension.
Failure, an inability to reach a satisfactory compromise, would be, for our own citizens and above all for the outside world, the sign of a dangerous impasse.
These financial perspectives may not reflect all the ambitions of one party or another, but they will nevertheless enable the EU to take action in the interests of competitiveness, employment, economic and social cohesion, better protection of the environment and internal security and in favour of a more active international role.
Indeed, if we can adopt them now despite our differences, this will provide the political impetus that the EU now needs more urgently than ever.
Following the rich debate that you had yesterday, the vote that Parliament will take shortly on the resolution could send a signal of prime importance, a signal of encouragement.
You can be sure that the Presidency will do everything in its power to facilitate a compromise that is acceptable to all.
MrÂ President, in addition to these decisive questions, the European Council will be dealing with other matters that are no less important for the citizens.
We now need to implement the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy in the interests of growth and employment.
To this end, in accordance with the new approach adopted in March, the European Council will have to approve the integrated guidelines for growth and jobs 2005-2008.
That is how, on the basis of the work of all the relevant configurations of the Council, the implementation of macroeconomic and microeconomic policies and employment policies can be based around 24 integrated guidelines.
By the autumn, the Member States will have translated these guidelines into coherent national programmes promoting growth and employment.
This must not be a formality, but an enterprise involving all those concerned and, in particular, the parliamentary bodies and the social partners.
I would also like to mention that, in line with the decision taken in March, the European Council will be invited to approve a declaration on guiding principles for sustainable development.
This should enable us to adopt a revised sustainable development strategy, if possible before the end of 2005.
The European Council will also have to look into certain important aspects of the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice.
In this field, we owe it to ourselves to demonstrate that the EU is able to respond effectively to the citizensâ expectations.
The citizens of Europe expect, quite rightly, that the European Union will adopt a more effective common approach to cross-border problems, such as illegal immigration, people trafficking, the fight against organised crime, the fight against terrorism, which you debated yesterday and which we consider to be very important.
Last November, we adopted the Hague Programme which, quite rightly, sets the priorities over the next five years for the creation of a true area of freedom, security and justice.
In this vein, the next European Council will be presented with an action plan translating the objectives of the Hague Programme into concrete measures.
In that regard, the Presidency would stress that it is crucial for the Member States to implement the various measures included effectively and within the deadlines.
The European Council will in particular review the efforts made to combat terrorism.
You have emphasised its urgency, and the need for a comprehensive approach that combines security and freedom.
The European Council should, in particular, identify certain high-priority areas of action for the coming months: for example, police and judicial cooperation, the ongoing work to prevent the recruitment of terrorists, the fight against terrorist financing or strengthening our civil protection capacities, in particular in order to combat any bioterrorist threat.
Finally, and I am now coming to the end, MrÂ President, certain important issues need to be raised with regard to external relations.
I am referring in particular to the reform of the United Nations, which will be the focus of the United Nations Summit in September.
We consider it to be essential for this summit to reach a balanced and ambitious result, which will make it possible to reform the UN in order to respond more effectively to the multidimensional threats and challenges identified in the report by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
I think we are going to discuss this, particularly this afternoon.
Among the other international issues, preparations for the International Conference on Iraq, jointly organised by the European Union and the United States, which will take place in Brussels on 22Â June, will be up for discussion.
The aim will be to set up a new framework to coordinate the aid effort in Iraq.
In this regard, it is appropriate to stress the prime, essential, fundamental role of the Iraqi Government in the period of transition and reconstruction of that country.
As you can see, from these various subjects, Europe must continue.
We must show that it has retained its full ability to make decisions and take action.
I think that the debates you are going to conduct now must be a spur in that direction.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council, set to take place on 16 and 17Â June, must meet two key challenges for the EU head on.
The first of these is to send out a message to our fellow citizens that there is convergence between the Member States regarding the process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty, and the second is to provide the Union with a stable financial framework for the next few years.
Yet whilst these issues are undoubtedly important, we must not overlook other items on the agenda, such as the integrated guidelines for implementing the Lisbon strategy and the sustainable development strategy.
There is one issue that I should like to bring to the fore: that of development aid in the context of the Millennium Goals.
Our internal problems must not divert us from our external responsibilities, particularly with regard to developing countries.
In 2005, which is already considered the year of development, Europe must fulfil its responsibility to support those most in need and must be at the forefront of the fight against poverty and hunger in the world.
Ahead of the G8 Summit, where Africa will rightly be a priority, and the important United Nations Conference due to take place in September, it is vitally important that the Council confirm the agreement reached by the ministers of the Member States on the basis of a proposal tabled by the Commission and firmly commit itself to honouring the Millennium Goals to support development.
This is what is expected of a Europe that must continue to show solidarity and be open to the world rather than inward-looking.
I wanted to make sure that I mentioned this at the beginning of a process in which the European question will naturally be the main focus, but at this difficult time we must not lose sight of the fact that there are others in need of our help.
Around 25Â 000 human beings die every die of starvation or thirst.
Europe must not continue its tacit acceptance of this situation.
The crucial challenge for our civilisation at this time is to say that enough is enough, and that it is time to put an end to this situation that appals every one of us.
Mr President, I do not intend to go over the details of yesterdayâs debate on the financial perspective.
The Temporary Committee of Parliament, under your chairmanship, Mr President, achieved a remarkable synthesis.
I have every confidence that this will be reflected in the vote later today.
Parliament will then have established a clear vision for the Union and its financing for the coming years.
Between now and the meeting of the European Council, there will be a series of staging posts which, we hope, will lead us to a Council position to match that of Parliament and then to the adoption of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
Of course, the current political context has raised questions about the likelihood of agreement on the financial perspective.
I should first of all make it clear that I am in full agreement with the Council presidency that an agreement at European Council level is not only desirable, but also possible.
We shall do everything to achieve that.
When faced with political problems, the worst reaction would be to do nothing and remain paralysed.
Rather, we should show that the Union remains a dynamic political force, strong enough to continue its work in the face of difficulties.
I believe that, at a time when some would expect the Union to be in disarray, an agreement on the financial perspective would show its determination to overcome problems and help generate renewed political impetus.
With regard to substance, I should like to reiterate that we need to retain the overall rationale and balance of the Commissionâs initial proposals.
However, this is a negotiation.
We recognise that means changes to the proposals and that those changes are inevitable.
There is always a risk that, in order to reach agreement, we may be tempted to go down the road of undermining policy coherence in order to satisfy particular interests.
I would hope that we can resist, or at least minimise, that temptation.
The Commissionâs proposals were a careful balance between tried and tested policies and the Unionâs new policy proposals.
We would be doing the Union a disservice if we undermined that balance.
The Unionâs budget exists to deliver common, set political objectives.
At the European Council we will doubtless have detailed and sometimes difficult negotiations, but if we can keep in mind that we are talking about what the Union really has to do, it is possible to reach an agreement that will allow the Union to go forward effectively.
I would like the Commission and Parliament to remain in close contact in the run-up to and during the last stage of negotiations so that together we can contribute to the best possible deal for the Union.
The Luxembourg presidency has led discussions into their final phase.
It has proposed a new ânegotiating boxâ.
Next Sunday we will have the final ministerial conclave; on the eve of the summit we will have the trialogue between the institutions.
We must commend the presidency for its great efforts and determination in finding a deal.
It is true that the proposal now on the table is closer to the minimalist approach favoured by some Member States than to the position of Parliament.
As I indicated yesterday, I hope that the presidency will carefully consider the very balanced views expressed by Parliament and take due account of them in the final round of negotiations.
I hope an agreement will be reached that shows that Europe is maintaining its ambition and solidarity.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands are, for the European CommissionÂ âÂ and also, I am sure, for the majority of ParliamentÂ âÂ a source of concern, given that those results risk weakening the EU and that those two countries have always been important players in our common project.
Throughout its history, the EU has experienced many difficulties, but the commitment and conviction of its leaders have enabled us to overcome them and to relaunch the European project.
Perhaps you will allow me, MrÂ President, to share with Parliament certain thoughts brought to mind by the parallels between the current situation and the one we experienced 50 years ago, when the project of the European Defence Community failed and the European leaders, instead of bringing an end to their ambitions for Europe, found the best way of overcoming this problem.
We must now honestly try to understand why two countries as important as France and the Netherlands voted no.
It is very important that these concerns were expressed in a democratic vote following a very lively debate.
For a democrat, that is a positive element in itself.
We must all respect the expression of the citizensâ will, but we must honestly recognise that this debate was often mixed up with national issues and that, sometimes, the arguments exchanged had little to do with the European Constitution.
Besides certain purely national considerations, the fact is that popular votes have become opportunities to express fears, which we must take seriously, in particular the citizensâ fears faced with the European social model, with decolonisation, with the fact that Europe is moving too fast and expanding too far or is even sometimes connected with the threat of globalisation.
Even if we admit that the referendum debates were to a certain extent contaminated by other subjects, we must recognise in all honesty that this vote is an expression of dissatisfaction with the EU and with the European project in those two countries.
That is why, at Berlaymont, the Presidents of the European Parliament and of the European Council and I emphasised, in our joint declaration following the French referendum, that the relevant national and European politicians must do more to explain the true scale of what is at stake, and the nature of the answers that only Europe can offer, and that we must ask ourselves how each among us can contribute to a better understanding of this project, which cannot have its own legitimacy without listening to its citizens.
The content of the debates and the results of the two referenda thus force us to seriously consider our abilityÂ âÂ both that of the European institutions and that of the national institutions and authoritiesÂ âÂ to mobilise the support and commitment of Europeans.
We must reconnect the EU with the citizens and the citizens with the EU.
This is absolutely imperative, and I will have the opportunity to return to this subject in the coming weeks.
Today, though, the most urgent question that we must answer in the face of a situation that could put the brakes on European integration is this: how can we bring about a new political consensus and take advantage of this difficult moment to relaunch Europe?
This is a political difficulty, and we must resolve it politically.
We must not avoid looking reality in the face.
I would like, straight away, to emphasise that ratification is above all a matter for the Member States.
Twenty-five governments signed the Constitutional Treaty.
It is up to them to decide when and how to ratify it and whether they want to honour the commitment they made or withdraw from it.
Ten Member States have so far ratified the Constitution, including one, namely Spain, in a very clear referendum.
In two other Member States, the referenda came out negatively.
However, other Member States have not yet expressed their position and I think that all the Member States of the EU have the right to express their position on equal terms.
Nevertheless, the essential thing now, in my view, is for the Member States to respond together to the current situation and for us to avoid unilateral, individual, disparate actions.
That is why I asked them to wait for next weekâs European Council to adopt a position.
I note that the governments have largely demonstrated restraint and, where it was considered unavoidable to adopt a position for internal reasons, they have retained a sense of moderation and the possibility of a debate and of a collective decision.
The fate of the Constitution is now in the hands of the Member States.
It is important for the Heads of State or Government to analyse the current situation and to send a clear message to all Europeans.
I am convinced that it is possible and desirable for this message to translate the desire to reach a new political consensus in Europe.
Analysis of the current situation shows that there are two possibleÂ âÂ and I would stress, possibleÂ âÂ extreme solutions that, in my opinion, must be avoided at all costs.
The first inappropriate solution would be to say that nothing has happened, that everything can continueÂ âÂ business as usualÂ âÂ as if these two negative votes in such important countries had never happened.
In my opinion, this would demonstrate an attitude that is self-absorbed, irresponsible, arrogant and disrespectful of the will expressed by a majority of the citizens of two countries that we have a duty to listen to.
Another inappropriate extreme solution would be to abandon the draft Constitutional Treaty straight away.
This would involve ignoring the fact that ten Member States have already ratified it and that the no votes in two States, although they express a negative position with regard to the Constitution, nonetheless do not constitute support for an alternative project and also include some contradictions.
Therefore, if we are going to avoid these two extreme solutions, we must look for another solution.
And I think that we must now start to create the conditions that will allow a solution to be found that results in the emergence of a new political consensus, becauseÂ âÂ I say againÂ âÂ it is in political terms that we must find a solution.
There is no administrative, bureaucratic or technocratic solution.
We must have a political debate in Europe in order to reach a political solution for the future of our Europe.
Without calling the draft Constitutional Treaty into question, we must move Europe on and avoid paralysis.
This solution can only result from an in-depth analysis and from an open debate.
It must necessarily be drawn up in a spirit of compromise between the 25 Member States within the European Council, also with the full participation of the European Commission and having listened carefully to the European Parliament, and also to the national parliaments and our societies.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, as we have always said, there is no plan B. It does not exist.
It has never existed.
But could we perhaps talk about a plan D?
D for democracy and dialogue.
A plan D to listen to the people; a plan through which the European and national institutions devote themselves to an exercise of listening to and debating with the citizens and civil society, in order to deepen our analysis of a complex situation.
This should enable us to take a more consensual path, particularly because it is more representative of the will of all our citizens.
In view of the scepticism expressed by some of our fellow citizens, we must show that the European Union can, now more than ever, respond to their concerns and to the many challenges of the new millennium.
Admittedly, the results of the two referenda last week constitute a serious problem, but it is not the first time that Europe has encountered problems and it will certainly not be the last.
Europe is necessary, now more than ever.
That is why the Commission is continuing, and will continue, to take important decisions that will bring real benefits to all the citizens of Europe, because the political life of the EU is continuing, even after the referenda.
We have strategic objectives to implement, which have also been supported by the European Parliament and by the European Council.
They respond to the citizensâ concerns, as they focus on prosperity, solidarity and security.
All the European institutions must now particularly show a spirit of compromise and unite around the aspiration to move forward and to achieve our aims, in particular by combating unemployment and insecurity.
In the coming days and weeks, we will have to join together to manage a complex situation.
In this context, I think we must avoid two dangerous pitfalls: the first I would call the blame game, and the second pitfall I would describe as the deepening of negative ideological splits.
First of all, we must at all costs avoid succumbing to the blame game, in other words making pointless and dangerous accusations that aim in particular to make the European institutionsÂ âÂ be it the Commission, the European Parliament or the CouncilÂ âÂ scapegoats for the difficulties encountered, either at national level or in the face of global challenges.
Of course, the European institutions are not perfect.
Who could claim to be!
It is because we have recognised that there were certain problems that my Commission, since it entered office six months ago, has decided to draw up initiatives to achieve better communication and to improve the quality of legislation, by avoiding pointless legislation and pointless bureaucracy.
That is why we have launched the initiative âBetter regulationâ.
We have also started to consider the transparency with which the institutions operate.
We recognise, indeed, that we could all improve the relationship of confidence and responsibility between the citizens and the EU, in particular by adhering more closely to the subsidiarity principle that everybody talks about but that is often not applied.
Take care, though, ladies and gentlemen: the temptation to attribute unpopular decisions to Brussels - what we are accustomed to refer to as Brussels - has already, in the past, caused immense damage, and it continues.
We must resist this temptation.
Meetings between the representatives of the Member States must not be described as battlefields with victors and losers.
Europe is created in compromise and by compromise, and it is above all the responsibility of the representatives of the Member States to explain that and to argue in favour of Europe instead of exploiting national egotism in a way that is negative to our Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us be frank: if we attack Brussels six days a week, from Monday to Saturday, can we hope that the citizens will support Europe on Sunday?
It is difficult, is it not?
However, there is a second pitfall.
This second pitfall consists in now becoming entrenched in ideological splits, even if we admit that there are different concepts of Europe.
Encouraging division around two monotheistic political ideas, the monotheism of the market and the monotheism of the State, does no service to Europe.
Neither of the two, neither the god of the market nor the god of the State, will solve Europeâs problems.
Any attempt to impose on Europe one of the two, a single European idea, is doomed to failure.
What we now need is an intelligent fusion of the market and the State that can help Europe to be a winner, not a loser, in the face of globalisation.
We do not have any illusions: Europe, by definition, is diverse, and it is good that it is remaining diverse.
We have different ideological positions, particularly in the political battle at national level.
Any attempt to impose on Europe, through the European institutions, a single ideal, a single ideological direction, would mean forgetting that Europe is forged in diversity, in difference, but also, it has to be said, in the search for compromise and consensus.
That is why I think it is vital to transform this period of crisis into a period favourable to opportunities and to take advantage of it to forge a new political consensus.
The role of the Commission as I see it is to promote this consensus and to avoid exacerbating pointless and dangerous antagonisms.
Without this new political consensus, it will be more difficult to reach a compromise and solutions.
It is in this vein and with this aim that I am launching an appeal to all European leaders, particularly at national level.
All of us must demonstrate a sense of responsibility and be equal to the very difficult situation with which we are faced.
Thus, I call on all the national authorities to agree to make a serious effort to resist the national egotism which has done such harm to Europe and which is continuing to damage it seriously.
I call for unity around European values, around, we could say, the European culture, around our European spirit, so that, together, we can build a new political consensus, both dynamic and constructive, a consensus that will make it possible to avoid Europe becoming the first victim of globalisation, but, on the contrary, will enable Europe to win this battle of globalisation.
I can assure you that the Commission is fully mobilised and available to contribute to this and that we are quite willing to work with all of you, with the various political groupings, on the condition that you all understand and accept that Europe is not the problem, but rather the solution to the problems the citizens are facing today.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, greatly disappointed though the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has been by the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the greatest danger that we now face is that of losing direction.
That is why we say that the European Union might not be the answer to all of our problems, but without the European Union we will not be able to overcome any of the major challenges facing us, and that is why we say: the objective is still right!
France and the Netherlands â two important countries, admittedly â cannot take responsibility for the 25 Members of the European Union.
Secondly, the ten countries that have ratified the Constitutional Treaty represent 220Â million people; these ten ratifications cannot and must not go by the board.
Thirdly, the 13 countries that have yet to ratify are entitled to express their views on the constitution.
That is why we recommend a pause for reflection.
No one has a quick-fix solution today.
We need to reflect.
We must be calm and collected.
In the same way, however, we need to combine being calm and collected with determination, and probably the right solution â although this is for the Heads of State or Government to decide â is to engage in a period of reflection and thought, and to postpone the referenda for a certain amount of time.
This must all be reflected on.
There are a whole host of possible reasons for the ânoâ votes in the Netherlands and France. Some of them are identical; some are not.
The unpopularity of the present leadership, the government, is perhaps a factor.
Then there is the point that you made, MrÂ President, a point which also concerns us in the European Parliament: less legislation in Europe is sometimes more for all of us.
Then the issue of enlargement: it is very significant that people have the impression that everything is moving too quickly.
We have to take this into account.
In our groupâs view, we need firstly to endeavour â and given the subjects at issue this will lead to more quarrels â to ensure that we concentrate on the essential issues.
Europe must be strong where Europe alone can act, and we also need to be more strict about applying the principle of subsidiarity.
Secondly, we must not overstretch this European Union politically, culturally or geographically.
That is the major concern that was expressed in the referenda, and it is one that we must take very seriously.
We say very firmly: But does not apply solely to the European Union, but also to those countries that want to join the European Union.
It also applies to both Romania and Bulgaria!
MrÂ President of the Commission, I would make this request to you and your staff: when you draft your progress report for Romania and Bulgaria â Parliament has given its assent for both countries, but there will be this progress report â please do not pull your punches in this report, but describe the situation as it really is, openly and honestly.
That is what we now expect from you.
Then we will be able to draw conclusions from this progress report.
As far as Turkey is concerned, we are expecting â the Council still has to decide of course â that Turkey will also meet the conditions set, and introduce the six pieces of legislation concerned.
They need to be ratified.
The question of whether Turkey is fit for entry to the European Union is also relevant.
Cyprus also needs to be unambiguously recognised, for how can you negotiate with a party that you do not even recognise?
We need an answer to this too.
The negotiations will be open-ended.
But we would ask for this to be the subject of reflection, and I confess that in our group, as in other groups, opinions diverge on this.
The objective can be membership, but it can also be a privileged partnership.
We need to have an open and honest conversation about this, so that we do not raise any false expectations.
I wish you, MrÂ President-in-Office, and the Commission â and I was delighted to hear both of your impressive speeches â every success with the financial perspective.
Everyone needs to make a move here: those who have written the letters, but also the United Kingdom, so that we again prove that we are able to act.
This will also serve to rebuild confidence all round.
I wish the President-in-Office, the President of the Commission and of course the President of our own House every success.
This crisis has to be seen as an opportunity!
We carry on down the same path, albeit perhaps not at such speed.
We have understood the message, but we remain committed to Europe and Europe remains our major objective!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I must confess that I am at a loss, and I do not think that I am the only one.
Rarely have I found a speech as difficult as the one that I have to give this morning, because, as the spokesman for a group of over 200 Members, I have to try to draw together the diverse sentiments that the current situation has called forth in them.
It is not easy, because it has been interpreted in many different ways.
I should therefore like to add a few comments to what has already been said.
I should like to underline one point: no country will allow another country to dictate how it implements its national law, and that is as it should be.
We are a union of sovereign states.
One country might say that it is going to suspend the ratification process, while another might say that it wants to ratify by parliamentary procedure or by holding a referendum.
This is something that we in this House will have to take on board.
Each country chooses how it wishes to proceed and each country is also entitled to do this as it sees fit.
There is no golden-goal rule in the European Union, whereby someone scores a goal and the game is over.
It cannot work like that.
The 77% of Spaniards who said âyesâ to this constitution have the same value as the 55% of French people who said ânoâ to it.
That is why the process goes on.
However, when interpreting the results, all of us â and I specifically include myself here â also need to ask some self-critical questions.
What we have seen in the referenda is actually nothing new.
It is just that for a very long time we have turned a blind eye to these developments.
Every European election â in 2004, 1999, 1994, and even in 1989 â has showed similar tendencies: namely that increasing numbers of European citizens are turning away from the European project.
None of us wanted to take this on board.
This comment is directed particularly at me, for nor did I.
This time it has been made abundantly clear that there is a gulf between the governments, the European institutions and the public.
Why is there this gulf?
In the fifties, sixties and seventies, at the time of Jean Monnet or Helmut Kohl, of De Gaspari and Mitterrand, people did not read the treaties either.
The citizens of Europe did not read the Treaty on the European Coal and Steel Community, but they had a trust in Europe, a basic confidence, a feeling.
Europe promised peace and democracy, and peace and democracy were created for all to see.
In other words, the claims matched up to reality.
This created trust in the governments and in the European institutions.
This promise of democracy and peace was complemented by a promise of prosperity, jobs and social security.
The claim â more jobs, more social security, more protection â is not matched by visible results, because in many countries there are fewer jobs and less security.
The public feel this gulf.
And we are not making it any narrower, because we do not see the European Union sufficiently as an opportunity and because we do not present it as an opportunity either.
And there is a reason for this.
Alongside all this self-criticism that I am directing at us â at myself, this House and the Commission â there is one factor that cannot be overlooked and that should perhaps finally be discussed in the Council of 16 and 17Â June.
We all know that what we do in Brussels does not produce a direct relationship between ourselves and the citizens, but an indirect one.
In between there are always the national governments.
Their evil deeds of the past have now come back with a vengeance to haunt the governments of France and the Netherlands.
You cannot claim every success for yourself as a national government and lay the blame for every failure at Brusselsâ door, and then expect people to rejoice over Brussels.
It does not work!
I therefore say very clearly: we in the European Parliament have a job to do.
I agree that we need to talk more about subsidiarity, about cutting red tape, about improving effectiveness and increasing transparency.
But the governments of the European Union must also assume their share of the responsibility, and that means saying what they are doing and then doing what they are saying.
It is as simple as that!
Finally, I should like to say a few words about enlargement.
Anyone who withdraws the prospect of enlargement from those states that are hoping for it is playing with fire!
Enlargement must remain a possibility.
That is the unanimous opinion of our group.
But promising enlargement before the foundations for that enlargement have been laid â the constitution was to be those foundations â is just as negligent.
We cannot demand reforms and processes of transformation from other countries when we ourselves are not capable of putting our own house in order.
That is why this Union has to do something.
It has to reform.
That is why giving Europe a constitution remains our objective.
Because only with that constitution can European enlargement â and with it peace â become a reality.
Â Â  . Mr President, Thomas Jefferson said in 1787, âa little rebellion now and then is a good thingâ.
Beyond the gloom and pessimism about Europeâs future, last weekâs rebellion by our citizens could turn out to have some benefits.
Member States are confronted with the outcome of their own duplicity.
If you claim the credit for everything that goes right and blame Brussels for everything that goes wrong, then sooner or later your citizens will rumble you â and they have.
When the VGEÂ 380 was rolled out onto the tarmac last summer, we all cheered.
But it has features and a name that are scaring away potential passengers.
Some complain there are too many foreigners aboard, others that the new French and German specifications for the engines have weakened it.
But nobody is completely satisfied with a vehicle in which strategic decisions are taken without proper public debate.
That is a failing not just at EU level, but in our national debates too.
For all our grand plans for transnational cooperation, we have failed to explain to people what we are doing at European level and why, and to address their fears about jobs, careers and a productive retirement in a fast-changing world.
Europe is too secretive and too opaque.
Too many decisions are still taken behind closed doors and without proper parliamentary scrutiny.
Basic parliamentary prerogatives and formal opinions are ignored or dismissed, such as the opposition in this House to heavy-handed proposals on data retention or passenger data transfer.
Is it any wonder that big projects like the Constitution are rejected, when even basic institutional respect is lacking?
The British Foreign Secretary has been accused of making funeral arrangements before the coroner has spoken, but he gave voice to what many are saying in private, that the Treaty in its current form is unlikely to survive.
It would have been ideal to hear the opinion of all Member States.
In future, any such ratification must be put to all European citizens at the same time.
But these were votes to reject not a text, but the way our Union operates.
Mr Schmit, Mr Barroso, we do not blame you for getting us into this mess, but we look to you for leadership in getting us out.
Of course, there is a limit to how much a small Member State or the Commission can do.
A huge responsibility rests on the larger beasts in the European jungle for the economic and social ills plaguing the Union.
But since the Franco-German motor is clearly kaput, we want to see you building a new one.
More than ever, Europe needs leaders with a sense of purpose and vision, who can inspire our citizens to maximise their potential and opportunity.
If not you, then who?
With or without this Constitution, you can improve the way the Union operates and communicates.
Here are just three ways: the Council could and should be more open, legislating in public, respecting freedom of information; justice and home affairs policy could and should be decided by the normal Community method, as provided for in the existing treaties; the European Parliament could and should be given a real say on international agreements.
Those three steps would help to rebuild confidence in the European project.
At the European Council, you need an answer from Chirac and Balkenende about whether this Constitution will ever be ratifiable in their countries and if not, what kind of text might be.
We need a treaty for a Union of 27 Member States, but in the meantime there is much you can do to rebuild on the basis of the current treaties and restore public faith in the European project.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear today that everybody wants to tell some truths, and that is how it should be.
The first truth: when, today, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe discovers that we should have proceeded to ratification on the same day, I would remind you that, when we proposed a European referendum across the whole of Europe, even this Parliament did not follow us.
Today, everybody wishes we had held a European referendum on the same day because, even though it may indeed have resulted in defeat, we would not have this ridiculous problem of asking ourselves whether or not we should proceed with ratification: everybody would have voted on the same day.
That is what I want to say and we have only ourselves to blame: why did Parliament not call for a European referendum, as we proposed?
The second truth: I think, and this needs to be said openly, that, with regard to the financial perspectives themselves, the governments and this Parliament have not yet understood what this is about.
They have not yet understood that, if we want Europe to be capable of taking action for employment, for social protection, then we need to give it the means to do so.
However, even the compromise proposed by MrÂ SchrÃ¶der, even the compromise proposed by the others, is not a compromise that will give us the means.
Once again, we are lying to our citizens.
Let us say this clearly: either we have a budget that enables Europe to operate or we cannot promise anything for Europe.
Just for once, let us tell them this truth.
The third truth: let us be clear!
MrÂ Poettering, what happened in France was not a disappointment, it was a defeat, but todayâs defeats will be tomorrowâs victories, I can promise you that.
For that purpose, we, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, must really be able to set up and organise a convention with the Economic and Social Committee, with the Committee of the Regions, and with civil society, to reflect on and discuss Europeâs economic and social policies: what have been our successes? What have been our failures?
Let us get to work!
MrÂ Schmit, open up the black box of the Council, debate in public on the 16th and 17th, so that the citizens of Europe know what you are going to say!
The people of Europe are fed up with these press conferences that follow Councils, during which each country, each government representative, only tells half the truth, taking care to disguise the other half, the things he has said behind closed doors.
We, as European citizens and MEPs, have the right, like all citizens, to know what problems you have in Council, and how you respond to them.
Not only what MrÂ SchrÃ¶der will say to MrÂ Blair in public, but how the members of the Council respond when there are other positions, how they react to the positions of MrÂ Juncker, who wants to carry on, of MrÂ Blair, who wants to stop, of the Poles, who do not know, of the Danes, who do not know: we want all of that to be made public.
The lack of transparency is one of the reasons for failure.
MrÂ Barroso, this crisis is, in a way, an opportunity: we must seize it by telling the truth publicly.
For example, with regard to globalisation, China, all of that, let us say once and for all that, yes, the WTO is important, but that the WTO can only work if it adopts the criteria of the International Labour Office.
The problem is not to set up barriers against China, but to impose democratisation in China so that Chinese employees can fight for their salaries.
If China does not accept this, then we must expel China from the WTO!
It is quite simple, and it is the same for other countries.
We are fed up with it: business, always business, but when democracy is the issue, we are out at lunch.
It cannot continue to work that way.
That is what the citizens of Europe want to know!
That is why I would say to everybody: we have lost, yes, we lost in France, but, because I was part of the campaign, I do not want to lose again and I do not want to continue to lie on very clear matters.
I will finish by recalling one of those lies: we need a European budget that will enable economic initiatives, we need to develop scientific research, but, to do so, it must at least be said that Europe is more interesting than the stingy proposals from governments as they are set out today.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Schmit, MrÂ Barroso, should we continue, suspend or stop the process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty?
Should we suspend it and wait for better days?
Bravo for political courage, democratic rigour and confidence in the Constitution.
In my view, nobody can refuse to give a population that wishes to express its opinion on the text the right to do so.
At the same time, we owe it to every citizen to tell them the truth: from now on, it will be a process of consultation, not of ratification, because the draft Constitution is irrevocably null and void.
It is void in legal terms, as it must receive unanimous approval in order to enter into force, and it is void politically given the power of the two ânoâ votes and their impact in many other countries of the EU.
So, what do we do?
What has just happened is not a French or Dutch thunderclap in a clear European sky.
Yes, MrÂ Schulz, the crisis of confidence between the citizens and the European institutions has been continuing to widen and deepen since the great liberal watershed of the single market and of the Maastricht Treaty.
As the years go by, it is no longer just the working classes, but the middle classes themselves who view this watershed as a swing towards a model of society that they do not accept.
Competition at any price, runaway loss of security, cynical and relentless power struggles, consensuses reached at summits, behind closed doors: it is no longer acceptable!
There is a burst of dignity in this huge ânoâ.
Many of these people still have dreams of Europe, but they are not dreaming about the Stability Pact or the Bolkestein directive.
The crisis in Europe today truly is an existential crisis.
We have already experienced other difficulties, MrÂ Barroso has just reassured us.
No, this time it is a different matter.
Until now, the political storms triggered by the infamous reforms so dear to the liberals in the Council and the Commission stopped at the borders of the Member States.
What a massacre there has been on the left since the time, not so long ago, when it controlled more that two-thirds of the governments of the EU.
Where the right held the reins until only recently, the approval was just as deafening, is that not true, MrÂ Barroso?
What did the European leaders, including the Council and the Commission, do after each of these popular ânoâ votes?
They congratulated the winners and carried on with the same policy: business as usual! This timeÂ âÂ and this is the major difference in the situationÂ âÂ it is the very heart of the system that the citizens now have in their sights.
Now, sooner or later, we will have to give explanations and accept real changes.
So, how can we get out of this impasse?
First of all, by showing that we have understood the extent of European unease by clearly declaring the Constitutional Treaty to be dead.
Next, by announcing, in the same spirit, the withdrawal of the most controversial texts, the most symbolic being of a tendency that should be stopped: the Bolkestein Directive, the Working Time Directive, and also the series of directives currently under discussion liberalising all over the place, without the slightest assessment of the effects of previous measures of a similar nature.
Finally, by opening a huge free citizensâ debate, not a convention but a citizensâ debate free from any pressure at EU level in order to assess the state of affairs in Europe today and determine what we need to change in order to produce a Europe in which the majority of Europeans can once again recognise themselves and get involved.
I will conclude, MrÂ President, by addressing the benches on the left, who, whatever their position on the Constitution, share the conviction that we must now go down this route in order to relaunch Europe.
Let us meet and do what we have to do so that confidence returns and hope is reborn.
Â Â  Mr President, what happened in France and in the Netherlands a few days ago can be summed up very briefly. The people wished to disassociate themselves from what Mr Barroso has called âBrusselsâ.
That means, the people of Europe no longer have confidence in Brussels.
Secondly, the second thing that is clear is that the Constitution is dead.
It died in Paris and has been buried in Holland.
I agree with Mr Cohn-Benditâs remark, âI do not want to tell any more liesâ, and I call upon all European leaders to reject Europeâs scornful attitude and cease to be spokesmen for the European machine against their people and to become instead, quite simply and democratically, the spokesmen for their people among their peers.
What do the people want? They want to remain free.
In practical terms, therefore, that means deciding to suspend immediately the negotiations on the accession of Turkey.
It means saying immediately that, in future, we will respect, and Europe will respect, the principle of national sovereignty. We must press for the notion of collaborative organisations of many kinds â political, industrial and scientific â all conforming to the principle of free membership and free cooperation.
That is the formula for the future.
Finally, and I will conclude here, we must put in place new mechanisms which will allow for a return to the common European preference, at least in those industrial sectors that are vulnerable, such as the textile industry.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is the only formula that can possibly save Europe and re-engage and win back the people.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to be united politically by means of an economic and social project, and to revive development, Europe needs to have institutions that communicate with its citizens.
The future depends on informed consent.
The vote that took place in France and in the Netherlands does not mean a ânoâ to Europe but the desire to stop going down the road where decisions are too often made at the top or without taking account of changing circumstances and new economic and social situations.
It is precisely the employment crisis, caused by the social dumping carried out by a number of countries and the lengthy time taken by Europe in tackling the issue, that has created the insecurity and fear that prompted the ânoâ vote on the Treaty.
It was not so much a case of saying ânoâ to the Treaty but to the poor information provided, which has also been acknowledged by the Commission in recent weeks.
When it was drawn up, the Treaty was the best compromise possible, but it was not sufficiently well suited to the challenges already in play.
What the people of Europe are demanding is to have clear, applicable rules, which respect the principle of subsidiarity and which are able to provide solutions not only to contingent issues but also to those issues that can be anticipated by analysing the geopolitical and geoeconomic context.
The situation calls for a renewed sense of responsibility on the part of the three Institutions, in order that what is possible is carried out and the decision is made not to address what needs to be put off.
After Bulgaria and Romania have returned to Europe, we believe that enlargement must end, in order that the Union may gather strength through dialogue between the Institutions and the citizens.
At the same time, the links with the European Central Bank need to be addressed in a fresh way, because the Union will never have a future if the political bodies do not have the necessary influence on the drafting of monetary policy.
We call on the Commission and the Council to pronounce on this issue without delay.
The Union has already experienced difficult periods from which it has emerged with the introduction of new initiatives: as a result of the French National Assemblyâs rejection in 1954 of the Treaty instituting the European Defence Community, the Conference of Messina was created, followed by the Treaties of Rome.
As a result of the European Communityâs stagnation in the 1970s, the Genscher-Colombo project came about, and following the vote at the European Council in Milan in 1985, under PresidentÂ Craxi, the Single European Act was attained.
We are therefore optimistic that the new Europe can arise out of this very period in which it is clear that the headlong rush of the pro-Europeans and the pessimism of the Eurosceptics provide no guarantees for the future either of individuals or of society as a whole.
Eurorealism is the only path of the present, and it is based on democratic choices and on respect for national identities, in order for a united and shared Europe to be constructed.
Â Â  â Mr President, the die is cast.
The European Constitution is still-born. Just one vote against sufficed.
There have been two votes, only three days apart, in France and in Holland, two of the six countries that were founder-members of the European Union.
Tomorrow, it will be Great Britain, whose currency is not the euro, that will take over the Presidency of the Council, and it has already announced that it sees the process of ratification as useless.
Never has the gap between parliaments and the people seemed so wide.
Eight per cent of the members of the French Parliament voted no, but 55% of the people did so.
It is, therefore, perhaps surprising that popular referendum is not the only means of ratification in all the countries of the European Union, seeing as it is the most democratic means which, in particular, those who complain in this House about the democratic deficit of the institutions might be expected to champion.
It is true that it is dangerous for princes who govern for their own profit to give a voice to the people, who suffer to their detriment.
It is against oligarchies â in politics, in the media, in the economy, in social affairs and elsewhere â which had far more powerful means at their disposal in the debate, that the people have spoken, refusing to give up their independence within a supranational state that, at one and the same time, showed itself to be ultraliberal, bureaucratic, economically mediocre and socially disastrous.
They said no to indefinite enlargement, beyond Europe, to Turkey.
Some will perhaps be tempted to get round the French and Dutch no votes. They should beware lest they provoke the legitimate wrath of the citizens.
It would be wiser to take into account, and to consider, the will of the people and to endeavour to give the desirable aim of European cooperation a more realistic structure.
It is clear that people do not want to give up their national structures. They are the bases of their identity, the defenders of their higher interests and the guarantees of their liberty, their cultures and their languages.
They want to retain their sovereignty, over their territory and their boundaries, and to forge their own destiny and that of their children, given the threat posed nowadays by globalisation, immigration, social collapse and moral decadence.
Â Â  Mr President, a former Labour prime minister said that a week is a long time in politics.
I suspect that, whatever oneâs views on the outcome of the French and Dutch referenda, few would disagree with that observation.
I do not want to go back over the issue of the Constitution and the referendum results, but I believe that it is now very difficult for the Constitution to be taken forward in its present form.
We can dwell on that forever.
What we should be doing this morning is looking at the positive sides of what is going on in Europe and what we can achieve outside of that situation.
There must be an proper ongoing debate on the kind of Europe we want to build.
The people have given a clear message and part of that message is that they feel alienated by the processes and by the institutions.
That cannot be good for democracy and it undermines the trust we need from the people to carry out our responsibilities.
However, we should now proceed with our programme and not be distracted too much.
It is very important at the moment that there should be no delay in driving forward the Lisbon Agenda, the current liberalisation policies or the sustainable development arguments.
As the President has said, we have to meet the challenges from China, India and other parts of the world with fast-growing economies.
It would be quite wrong, therefore, to deny our people the chance of greater prosperity, because we are diverted and distracted, possibly for a long period of time, by a structural issue which seems to be going nowhere at present.
So there is an urgent need for us to seize our opportunity for renewal.
We have to grasp the scale of what has happened this week, but we must move on and forward in a way that meets with the approval of the European people as a whole.
The Union has been offered this chance to rethink its future and face up to the profound questions concerning its future direction.
But we must not allow ourselves to be diverted away from the policies that are already being developed and pursued vigorously and necessarily to benefit all of us.
Â Â  - Mr President, this is the second time that France has rejected a treaty of political union. In 1954 it was because of fear of German rearmament.
In 2005 it is, without doubt, because of fear of global capitalism. We should see it also as an indicator for our own policies.
What is to be done?
I believe we should be guided by three principles.
The first principle is equality between the European nations.
Ratification by Parliament is the equivalent of ratification by referendum.
I have added together the results of the three referenda. When the Spanish, Dutch and French votes are taken together, the âyesâ vote wins by 54.04% of the votes, a figure that is a consolation for me, as a Frenchman.
We need equality between the big countries and the small countries, equality for all the people.
Nowadays, in 2005, I am not too keen on this word âfoundersâ because you, MrÂ Barroso, and you, Mr Borell, could not have been among the founders in 1957, because your countries were not members. You were living under dictatorships.
Others were living under totalitarian regimes.
We, the French and the Dutch, had the good fortune to be free.
Consequently, we need now to be careful how we use that term.
If a constitution has to be adopted unanimously, then it can only be rejected unanimously. The principle must be equally valid in either case.
The second principle is, in the matter of enlargement, keeping oneâs promises.
I am thinking in particular of Romania and of Bulgaria and of others too, but I shall also add the Balkans.
We must give to the Balkan states the prospect of entry into the European Union and we must hold to it.
If we block this prospect, we shall be storing up a powder keg.
The third principle is that Europe still needs, and will always need, a constitution. I say this in spite of the two ânoâ votes.
In France there is a that can show us the way.
It is the of which Philippe de Villiers is President, the . In 1992 the voted ânoâ to Maastricht, but it voted âyesâ to the Constitution.
Mr de Villiers is completely at odds with the people of the whom he represents.
You know, there is no need to go to Brussels to find a technocrat.
A technocrat is merely a technician whom one dislikes, that is all.
This shows us the way, so let us have confidence in the people of de Villiersâ .
Â Â  â Mr President, we are living through difficult times and I want here to express the profound sadness that I feel and that is felt by all those, in the European Union and in the world, who are committed to the project of a political Europe.
Europe is in crisis.
Our Europe is in crisis, the Europe that we wanted and that we built.
Of course, we all know that internal political issues had a significant influence on the French and Dutch results.
We must, however, also have the courage to acknowledge that it is also a particular vision for Europe that has been rejected.
For years, our people have had the feeling that Europe was being built without involving them, that they had no part at all in the decisions, often important decisions, that were being made on their behalf.
Europe seemed to them foreign and distant. We are all, collectively, responsible for that.
Our people also had the feeling that Europe was a project that was out of control, whose identity and whose boundaries were not defined.
This feeling of uncertainty caused them to react with fear and rejection.
Europe, then, has not fulfilled, and has not known how to fulfil, its protective role. It has not produced any answers to the question of globalisation, the difficult economic context that increasingly undermines our peopleâs support for the European idea.
Today, the European project is not sufficiently clear or understandable.
We have a major crisis of confidence and, in order to respond to it, European institutions must show that they are equal to the challenge.
Their response cannot, and must not be, purely judicial.
It must, first of all, be political, and, whatever might be the outcome of the ratification process, it is essential that the next European Council outlines the prospects and produces answers to the expectations of our fellow citizens.
They very much expect democracy and transparency, they expect a clearly defined Europe and they expect a Union that establishes a genuine economic and social system of government. This is the only way to stimulate growth, employment and cohesion.
We must act now.
The matter is urgent.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, I would like you to convey some sad news to your colleagues at the European summit.
The scapegoat has done its duty, but it is in a wretched state.
It has collapsed: it was left to the mercy of the publicâs anger and they have subjected it to a cruel beating.
What I am talking about is Europe, on the one hand, and the governments on the other.
Not for the first time, but for the nth time, they have invited the public to vent their wrath on Europe, for matters for which they bear the responsibility.
I know that the battle over how to interpret the ânoâ vote has been raging for some time already, and whoever wins it will determine the course of events and identify the way out of the crisis.
Is it the victory of nationalism over Europe?
Is it public discontent over our achievements, or is it â and this is my view â a public revolt against Europe as it is?
What is farcical about this is that the revolt against the Europe that we have makes the new Europe impossible.
The patient was so angry about his illness that he shot the doctor, but you will understand, MrÂ President-in-Office, that I feel rather nervous when I see that it is precisely the governments that are once again gathering around Europeâs sickbed.
What is then the existing Europe that the citizens are holding responsible here?
Is it really the dictatorship of the cold-blooded Brussels bureaucracy?
Is it really the kraken of a new superstate that feeds on the national identity of its citizens?
Or is it not rather this weak, ailing, irresolute Europe that has by no means overcome nationalism; the Europe of state chancelleries; the Europe of closed doors; the indecisive, asocial Europe; the Europe with the severe democratic deficit?
Is it not the Europe of governments, which in the arrogance of their power imagined that they could rule Europe on the side?
On the side â as the government, administration, legislator and even the provider of the constitution!
Is it not this Europe that we need to do away with?
Surely the governments bear more responsibility than the scapegoat that is being beaten here.
Is it not true that the governments blocked the convention after trying to dominate it?
Did the social issue not founder there?
Â Â  Mr President, for two months, I took an active part in the campaign which, in the Netherlands, won 62% backing for a âno to the Constitutionâ.
As the largest organisation in the ânoâ camp, our Socialist party stood up for the right of the electorate to change that text.
We were not opposed to the prospect of a European Constitution, or to new or future Member States, or not even, more specifically, to the fact that the Netherlands has now become the highest net contributor in the European Union.
It was about the content of the Constitution.
That text is far too much a recipe for a Europe in a more American mould, with the emphasis on free, undistorted competition, the liberalisation of services, rearmament, commitment to NATO and the possibility of interventions outside the EUâs territory.
Chapter 3 does not belong in a constitution; it should form part of normal legislation, which Parliament should be able to revise with the help of the national parliaments.
It would then be for the electorate, through elections, to demand changes, and the man in the street would no longer feel himself unable to help change policies.
Moreover, in the proposed text, democracy remains deficient as long as national parliaments can only delay legislation, as long as the collection of a million signatures is not rewarded with policy being adapted or with a referendum, and as long as the Council is the only body that can change this Constitution.
With those arguments, we managed to persuade many people to turn out to vote who may well have grumbled about policy and the EUâs interference, but who were inclined to stay at home because they had no hope of any improvement.
Instead of the expected low turnout with a majority voting âyesâ, we had a high turnout with a majority voting ânoâ.
This Constitution is now dead.
If the voters in other Member States are offered another referendum, though, I also expect the majority to reject this Constitution.
That is how peoples obtain the right to amendment ...
Â Â  Mr President, the Dutch people have emphatically rejected the European Constitution.
That is something that the European institutions would do well to recognise.
The rejection of the Constitutional Treaty is primarily a rejection of the speed and direction of the European integration process.
I fear that this lesson has not been learnt in Brussels, given the keenness with which reference is made to the impotence of national politics, the absolute lack of self-criticism and the pleas to continue the ratification process.
At the Summit of 16 and 17 June, the Heads of Government must demonstrate that they have more of an understanding of the French and Dutch ânoâ than many of my fellow Members.
The surrounding the European Constitution requires adequate action.
It is therefore incomprehensible that the political in Brussels should procrastinate and prefer the torture rack to the speedy advent of a new treaty.
I am delighted that the voters have demonstrated a lack of confidence in a Europe that is defined indistinctly both in terms of geography and policy content, and which combines the unhealthy concentration of power with unrealistic political ambitions.
Â Â  Mr President, listening to the debate this morning you would imagine that, not only is there a European crisis, but that Europe does not have any answers or responses to the will and the wishes of the people.
Whilst this is a difficult time, and whilst there is a lot of uncertainty, this is also an opportunity for us to reflect on what we have achieved so far, and to find a proper and more appropriate way forward.
Unfortunately, that way forward will not be found by trying to analyse why the voters in France and Holland said ânoâ.
There were many diverse reasons for their ânoâ vote.
At the same time, what do we say to the voters in Spain who voted in favour?
Do their votes count for nothing?
Those people who try and tell us that we must put off this whole process and stop and listen to the voice of democracy are totally ignoring the voice of democracy as represented by the nine other countries that have already ratified the European Constitution.
I think it is important now that we give leadership to Europe.
That leadership must come not only from this House, but also from the Commission.
I congratulate President Barroso on his stance immediately after the vote in trying to encourage the governments to keep their nerve, to take a long-term vision, to use the same kind of ideology and the same kind of selfless desire to see an improvement for all the people of Europe that the founding fathers of the European Union showed when Europe rose from the ashes of the Second World War.
The people within Europe today did not vote against more jobs, did not vote against better social protection, did not vote against better trade, did not vote against better Community development programmes, did not vote against giving more aid to the developing world, did not vote against protection for our environment, did not vote against ensuring sustainable development in fisheries and other industries.
They voted in favour of all of these things because they wish to continue supporting them.
It is now up to the Luxembourg presidency, as leader of the Council, to find a compromise and to find a way forward at the European Council meeting.
The best way for us to present this to the people of Europe is to say that yes, we have hit a bump on the road, but this is not the end of the European project.
We have to remind all the peoples of Europe that our best self-interest, as well as our best collective interest, lies in understanding our interdependency, not only in relation to single market economics, but also to our human responsibilities to each other across the European continent.
Â Â  â The Constitutional Treaty has already been ratified by ten states, including five old Member States Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain and five new ones Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia and Slovakia.
These account for 50% of the population of the European Union; given that a founding country does not enjoy a privileged position, it could be said that the score is now ten to two.
I do not know whether the French cured their unemployment problems, which they exploited in the run-up to the referendum, by means of the negative outcome of the latter.
I believe that, on the contrary, they have abused the ideas and good will of the new Member States and, moreover, humiliated a major European country my neighbour, Poland by using the Polish welder as a symbol.
I am calling upon Parliament not to weep over the negative outcome, nor to rejoice with some of those present here over the rubbishing of the idea of a strong Europe, but to take forceful and effective steps to facilitate the process in the future.
It is also a sad fact, Mr President, that I am the first Member from a new Member State to speak on this item.
Â Â  Mr President, at the time of our last session we commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the end of the war.
It is an irony of fate that, today, we are debating a Europe in crisis, through lack of support from the people for a treaty that was designed to confirm that our countries should unite, for better and for worse, a treaty signed by democratically elected Heads of State or Government, acting on the authority of the sovereign power, and by that I mean the authority of the people of our countries.
Two hundred and twenty million of them have already said âyesâ to this Constitution, and, Mr President, might I point out that Europe is more than just France and the Netherlands, or Great Britain. There are all the other countries too.
Changing the text would be disrespectful towards almost half the population of the European Union, who have already ratified it.
As far as the consultation process goes, I think it will also be up to those responsible at national level to decide what procedures to adopt.
Of course, it will be up to the President-in-Office to act not only with skill and sensitivity but also with firmness.
What is needed to convince the people is action and a financial perspective that will serve to demonstrate that Europe can stimulate the economy and create employment through investments in the major infrastructure or through âGalileoâ, which could create 100Â 000 new jobs and is waiting for a signal from the Council to get under way.
We will need also to communicate commitment to, and enthusiasm for, the European project and for its message of solidarity and humanism.
In fact, this crisis is also a crisis for democracy.
Europe can only work if its citizens believe in it.
Often, delegation of power is synonymous with lack of interest, and we know only too well the dearth of information available on European policy.
We need, therefore, to give more information, focussing on the most important points in our common policy, for the sake of our citizens and for a social Europe.
Mr President, the ânoâ vote was also the rejection of a Europe that puts the laws of the market and of competitiveness first, of a liberal Europe without any concern for the workers, and I say that for the benefit of those who were in favour of a 72-hour week.
Â Â  Mr President, the voters in the Netherlands and France gave us a clear message: Stop, we are hurtling along without knowing exactly where we are heading.
In the Netherlands, 62% of the voters said ânoâ.
It is now time we did something positive with those voters.
The ânoâ vote came from two different quarters.
On the one hand, there is the right-wing voter who has a clear anti-European sentiment and says ânoâ to the European project.
There is, on the other hand, a ânoâ vote from the progressive voter who is in favour of European cooperation but considers this Constitution too intrusive and lacking in the social dimension.
These sentiments are also shared by those progressive voters who have voted in favour of the Constitution with some hesitation, in the belief that it was a step forward.
We have to try to reunite those progressive voters from the âyesâ and ânoâ camps for the benefit of a clearly defined European project.
Needless to say, other countries must also be given the opportunity of speaking out about the European Constitution, but the die is cast in the Netherlands and France.
Not this Constitution, not a second referendum on the same subject.
We must avoid becoming isolated or marking time; quite the reverse.
We want to mount a reform battle in Europe to demonstrate to both the âyesâ and ânoâ voters that we have heard them.
This reform must be based on a broad and open debate about the direction and speed of European integration.
How many countries should we allow to join?
How do we make Europe strong and social?
The Council Summit on 16 and 17 June, and chaired thereafter by Mr Blair, may be able to make a start on thinking about salvaging the key elements, namely Chapters 1 and 2 of the Constitution, the principles of Europe, the improved weighting of vote, the high level of subsidiarity, accessibility, enhanced influence of national parliaments and citizensâ rights, in a simplified treaty.
Otherwise, we might well end up in an Echternach-like procession where, unfortunately, we only take steps backward, without a prospect of realistically European cooperation, and as Mr Barroso was right in pointing out that âdespite much public criticism, Europe is in actual fact the right answer and that is why I continue to be so committedâ.
Â Â  Mr President, Europe has a problem and that problem cannot simply be solved by working on presentation or by explaining more effectively how good Europe really is.
Europe may speak to the minds of many; it no longer speaks to their hearts.
Bureaucracy has the appeal of reinforced concrete and the customer-friendliness of a rhinoceros.
The European institutions must be forced to listen more carefully to the European citizens, and I am therefore delighted that President Barroso echoed this in what he said.
For what are we frightened of?
Why should we not let the President of the European Commission be directly elected by all Europeans and why not have the possibility of a collective referendum about European laws?
Not 25 national referenda but one European referendum.
Actually give the public the power over the European Union.
The question now arises of what type of reform the European Union would be able to handle.
The Constitutional Treaty would have enabled the EU to process the enlargement.
How is that now to be proceeded with?
The MEPs in my party are for enlargement but consider it wise to put enlargement of the EU on ice until such time as we have sorted out our domestic affairs.
After that, we will be happy to talk again about the accession of countries that meet the criteria.
We need a new debate about what Europe is, where it is heading and where its borders are, and that debate should not be held among governments alone.
It should be a Europe-wide, social debate about the economic and social future of our continent, again based, if need be, on something like the Convention, with a new mandate, a new composition and a new President.
Europe must again be able to inspire people; Europe must stand for quality, for creativity and for democracy, a safe, free, tolerant and prosperous Europe.
Europe has a problem but it also has an opportunity, and we must not be held back by the past.
Â Â  MrÂ President, âNever have so many Europeans had so few to thank for so muchâ, is my message to the French people.
Together with the Dutch people, they showed that they had grown tired of the Establishment continuing to push through proposals that transferred power away from the people and into the closed offices of government departments and the board rooms of large companies.
The problem is not that the EU is moving ahead too quickly, but that it is heading in the wrong direction.
The EU has got bogged down in yesterdayâs problems.
It is integrating states and maximising production instead of integrating people and maximising socio-environmental protection.
Stop tormenting the Constitution.
Allow it to die in peace, announce a new process in which each local authority has its own convention and then use their proposals for locally based European cooperation as a foundation for a new draft Treaty.
Â Â  Mr President, a year ago everyone here said that the Constitution would need unanimity.
Of course, in those days it was thought that all the referenda would be won.
In the David Goliath contest, the French people have aimed their stone well and they killed the Constitution.
The Dutch then buried it and now, in a scene that reminds me of the Hammer House of Horror, the arm is reaching up out of the coffin.
We are being told, no, no, it is not dead, the patient is still alive, and the ratification process will continue.
That surprises me, because it seems to me that you are indulging in masochism.
You are going to have a rather unhappy period.
Mr Barroso, it is not a case of going too quickly, you are going in the wrong direction.
Allied to that, I see the rapid rise of political extremism, of nasty nationalism, of blind nationalism; it is Euro nationalism and it knows no bounds.
I know that you intend to treat the peoples of Europe with contempt by pushing this through without ratification.
History will catch up with you.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate the people of France and Holland on bringing deliverance to all those in Europe who value democracy and national liberty.
The situation that now exists challenges the democratic credentials of EU leaders.
You set the test for the survival of the Constitution: ratification by all 25 Member States. You lost.
It is time to face up to it and bury the corpse that is the EU Constitution.
Your attempts to resuscitate it are as distasteful as they are ill-fated.
Mr Watsonâs reference back to 1787 tempts me to go back a little further.
It is not the first time that Holland has saved Europe from political tyranny.
This very week in that most notable of years 1690, William, Prince of Orange, landed at Carrickfergus in my constituency and brought us in the United Kingdom the Glorious Revolution and the Williamite settlement, which to this day is the basis of freedom ...
Â Â  â Mr President, I feel that the major question on the table at the Council, and here in Parliament, is whether the people understand that we have in fact entered a new phase, one in which Europe no longer responds to the citizensâ concerns as it used to, when peace and democracy were the prime objectives.
Nowadays, we want our European, national and institutional leaders to be equal to some of the main challenges, in a way that is objective rather than dogmatic.
We therefore want to know whether the European social model is compatible with a form of globalisation that has been brought in at the cost of the kinds of social dumping and environmental dumping that prevail in other countries and that have led to relocations and unemployment in Europe.
It is important, indeed crucial, that Europe â either of its own volition or if possible in conjunction with the United States, starting with the Doha Round â takes measures to ensure compliance with International Labour Organisation rules, in the same way that the Lisbon Strategy must become less bureaucratic and more entrepreneur-friendly and SME-friendly.
This is also the case with subsidiarity, which we have heralded but which in practice the institutions consistently overlook.
The Commission, and more importantly Parliament, must take action to ensure, once and for all, that subsidiarity is properly implemented across the board.
Lastly, we need to be aware of Europeâs limits and of the pace of enlargement, when the process of deepening has not been successful.
These are the European Councilâs main challenges.
Â Â  â Mr President, in a democracy, the majority vote must always be accepted and respected, even if the majority is not necessarily right.
The French and the Dutch votes are irrevocable.
The message, however, is not clear.
It is actually a multiple ânoâ, with mixed and sometimes conflicting motives.
Between the demagogues of the extreme right and the demagogues of the extreme left there is no common denominator.
The national socialists who are hoping they can draw together all the malcontents will soon find out that this will turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory.
What is to be done?
As there is no plan B and no one knows what improvements would be likely to transform these contradictory and ill-assorted ânoâsâ into a clear and resounding âyesâ, the only option is to play it by ear.
The next summit has to approve a financial perspective that will enable the institutions to function normally.
Just as the Eurogroup has elected in advance a president for two years, so governments should put in place other actions in anticipation of the treaty, relying on a voluntary agreement.
Thus, the Commission would have to consult national parliaments on any future legislative initiatives.
The ânoâ vote will stop neither globalisation, nor international competition, nor relocations.
After all, the worldâs leading exporter cannot be allowed to operate selfish protectionism.
It is necessary, therefore, to forge new links not only between Europeans but also with the many countries that remain outside of the globalisation process.
The accession of Romania and Bulgaria will take place under the terms of the Treaty of Nice.
Even Turkey could join us under the terms of that treaty.
Of course, the European Union could function better within the framework of the treaty that has now broken down.
Since, however, the ânoâ vote offers no solution, we have to show, difficult though it may be, that Europe carries on, while striving better to meet the needs of our citizens through more imaginative and more supportive policies.
Â Â  Mr President, it is with some sadness that I hear the reactions to the Dutch and French ânoâ votes.
Europe is too bureaucratic, too expensive; too many new countries have joined and Europe is going too fast.
I would beg to differ.
The environment is going faster, Chinaâs economy is growing more rapidly, and so is international crime.
Rather than needing to take its foot off the accelerator, Europe must take a great leap forward.
As for the enlargement, to be frank, I am relying on the dynamism of the new countries as new driving force for European integration.
We need a strong, democratic Europe; we do not need less of Europe, but more.
I would actually like to appeal to anyone who holds Europe dear to show leadership and courage; if not, we will give the populists and extremists too much scope.
We must move forward, and national politicians must be able to leave the past behind and take responsibility for Europe.
I am, in fact, concerned about the Councilâs position yesterday in respect of data retention when the Council decided to completely blank the European Parliament, which is not in the spirit of the debate that has taken place.
We should not forget that in addition to the two countries that said ânoâ, there are also ten countries that said âyesâ, and that is an important fact.
I would therefore be against suspending the whole process.
It is evident that time is needed to reflect, but I think that every country and every people must have the right to speak out about this Constitution.
It is right now that we need to take up the cudgels for Europe.
Instead of reverting to the , we need to redouble our efforts for Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Constitution is dead in France and buried in the Netherlands, yet the Councilâs otherwise decent President-in-Office is behaving like a body snatcher in wanting to continue with the process of ratifying the rejected document.
Start afresh.
Allow a working party with equal numbers of supporters and opponents to get together and prepare a discussion paper with draft ground rules capable of uniting Europe instead of dividing us.
This Parliamentâs Referendum Group would be happy to be involved.
We have seven current demands concerning openness, the election of Commissioners, majority voting with the right of veto, the principle of proximity, the right of control by the national parliaments, minimum flexible conditions, and enhanced cooperation instead of compulsion.
Read our proposal.
We have tested the first two demands by means of an opinion poll in Denmark.
They were supported by 80% of the electorate and opposed by only 12%.
It is that level of support that we need to have for common ground rules.
Use your ears, listen to the electorate and do come to our press conference at 4Â p.m.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party.
We cannot deny it: the French ânoâ vote represents a strong, decisive âhalt!â to the process of European integration, in the form that it has been taking ever since Maastricht.
By signing, the Treaty introducing the single currency and launching the political cohesion process, back in 1992, Europe knew that it was embarking on a journey that should completely transform both the institutional model and the overall shape of the Union, by gradually abandoning the geopolitical structure of the Cold War.
Many of the cogs in this mechanism have not worked, however, and many of the issues opened up by the Treaty of Maastricht are still on the agenda today.
It is time to make clear choices about the shape of the European dimension: a decision needs to be made about whether or not the Lisbon perspective should really be pursued, by postponing the associated projects of common interest; the areas and the limits of political integration need to be redefined; and, in a clearer manner than in the Constitutional Treaty, the choice of a free and competitive economic and social system has to be reaffirmed, a system that is genuinely capable of making Europe a leading player in the ongoing process of globalisation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Bonde said that he wanted equal representation from both sides, but this Parliament decided to support the constitution by a majority of 80-90%, and 52% of the population, through their parliaments and in referenda, have already said âyesâ to it!
This should not be forgotten.
Moreover, it is clear â and this point has been made by many speakers â that there is a mixed bag of reasons for the ânoâ vote and that the constitution itself is the least significant of them all.
They include the unpopularity of national policies, fear of globalisation and unemployment, as well as a desire to give us the message: âyou have gone too far in terms of both internal legislation and enlargement, and quite a lot more besidesâ.
Todayâs Europe has been examined and criticised, rightly or wrongly.
But it has been examined and found wanting, and this is something we should take on board.
That is why it is extremely important to have a period of reflection, in which we show ourselves to be restrained and moderate, and make it clear, by adopting appropriate policies, that we can win back the hearts of the people if we hold a dialogue of this kind.
I believe that we need this time for a suspension of the ratification process, so that we do not accumulate even more noâs on these false premises.
In this way we can then move forward during the Austrian Presidency, at an appropriate time, not with an intergovernmental initiative, but perhaps with a convention that could scrutinise the results of this reflection â the results of the period of reflection, not of the constitution.
I also think it is extremely important that we also present this in positive terms; according to the constitution, this European Union means nothing other than involving the citizens, giving the citizens rights, ushering in more democracy, giving the national parliaments more rights, and enabling us to act on the global stage in such a manner as to guarantee our internal and external security.
It also means that we can make it clear that Europe is not part of the globalisation problem, but part of the answer to it, and that for these reasons we are capable of winning back the hearts of our citizens for our policies.
It is this course of action that I commend to you.
If I may, I will add a footnote.
All of this will also cause a paradigm shift in Germany, because Germany will once again be on the side of the small countries, which is important for the identity of this Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest task for the European Council in a weekâs time is to create clarity, more clarity and yet more clarity.
The worst decision that could be taken in a weekâs time would be to continue in the same old way, in which clarity is hardly the watchword.
With a whole series of referenda, there is a risk of setting a self-perpetuating spiral of ânoâ votes in motion.
I should like to say that clarity is the fundamental requirement.
What, moreover, I fear, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, is that, if no clarity is brought about, the real choice we shall face will be that between being satisfied with the Treaty of Nice and gaining a little more time; and, if I have to choose between being satisfied with the Treaty of Nice and gaining a little more time to think through how we resolve the situation, I prefer to have more time.
We cannot live with the Treaty of Nice.
We cannot solve the problems using the Treaty of Nice.
We must have this Constitutional Treaty in place and, if more time is needed, then that is what I prefer to have.
MrÂ President, we can hold all the conventions and present all the treaty documents we like, but that will not help if we do not tackle the real problems in Europe.
In the course of two years, this Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the European Socialist Party, of which I am President, have presented clear calls for Europe to invest in more new jobs and to unite behind a common response to what many ordinary people see as the threats of globalisation.
Our greatest task now, under the British Presidency â and I really do think we have received some very exciting signals from Prime Minister Tony Blair â is to combine peopleâs need for social protection with new jobs in a globalised world.
I also very much support the call by the President-in-Office of the Council and by the President of the Commission for us to have the financial perspectives in place in a weekâs time.
That would be the most important signal of all that we are not incapable of making decisions but that we take peopleâs concerns seriously.
Â Â  Mr President, President Barroso said that we should not start the blame game.
However, we should certainly question the credibility of the European Council in stimulating and managing the great debate about the social and economic future of Europe.
The European Council should, and probably will, suspend the ratification process but it should not pull the plug on the whole constitutional project.
Instead, it should agree in principle to set up a new convention â pluralistic, parliamentary and transparent â with a broader brief than that of Laeken, especially to modernise and refresh Part III, to bring the common policies into line with the aspirations and anxieties of our citizens.
The new convention should also be asked to break the rigid relationship between the first, second and third parts and to create a proper hierarchy between them, so that in Part III the policies become distinctly subsidiary to Part I.
This Group and Parliament will play a full part in fostering such a convention.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, the draft Constitutional Treaty was comprehensively rejected in France and the Netherlands, in what amounted to a clear vote of no confidence in national and European political elites.
To our astonishment, however, there are those who are attempting to resurrect this document.
It has been suggested that the ratification process should be continued and the draft Treaty renegotiated, and the search is even on for legal means of negating the outcome of the referenda.
Such measures should be regarded as both anti-democratic and arrogant, and come dangerously close to totalitarianism.
The political elites should realise that the majority of Europeâs nations are opposed to the establishment of a bureaucratic, Brussels-run superstate monopolising social, economic and monetary policy.
Instead, they wish to participate democratically in decision-making processes and in European integration based on free cooperation between free countries.
Heads of State or Government who disregard the sovereign will of their nations may well find that the latter regard them as dictators, and deal with them accordingly.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate is in the first place about the forthcoming European Council and I should like to focus on it, for in this moment of crisis, this European Council has a very important task, namely setting beacons, and the first beacon should be for Europe to continue to function and to carry out its task, not only internally, but also externally.
I was delighted to hear President Barroso make reference to our duty in the area of development cooperation.
The key marker will undoubtedly be when an agreement is reached about the financial perspectives, because that must provide the framework for Europe to function in the next few years.
Much as I agree with MrÂ Cohn-Bendit that those financial resources will probably be too low to allow Europe to carry out its task properly, it does strike me as crucial that an agreement be first and foremost reached on those financial resources.
Secondly, the European Council must also give an indication as to how we should progress from here, because the questions we raised in the Laeken Declaration remain unanswered as yet.
We still have no framework for this enlarged Europe, Europe still has to provide an answer to globalisation and that answer can only be European.
However, we should take into account the ânoâ in two countries, but also the âyesâ in ten other countries.
I think that when Mr Rasmussen says that âthe European Council must provide clarityâ, that this European Council is as yet unable to provide clarity in the short term, because the ânoâ is far too diffuse for that.
That is why I call for a period of reflection, but it has to be organised and limited in time.
We need to decide clearly beforehand when conclusions will be drawn, and a year strikes me as an appropriate timeframe.
Indeed, it would be best to suspend matters, but not indefinitely.
It must be a defined period of reflection, clearly limited in time with a clearly specified time when conclusions will be drawn.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, far from being dead, as some are saying, the constitution is alive and must be kept alive, for there is, as far as I am aware, no plausible alternative to it.
There is no plan B that is at all likely to succeed.
That has also become clear in this debate.
We may need more time.
That is why each country should decide for itself when to proceed to ratification.
However, I think it is completely wrong to call a collective halt to the ratification process and suspend it across the board.
That is surely wrong!
Each country must decide this for itself, bearing in mind that we may need more time.
The ânoâ votes in France and the Netherlands have severely damaged those countriesâ status as founders.
There is also a positive side to this, because now perhaps all of the countries are on an equal footing.
Above all, I hope that the new countries will say a hearty âyesâ, because they have to understand that part of the ânoâ was also directed at them.
I hope that the people of Poland and the Czech Republic will say a clear âyesâ to the European constitution, because this is their future and also their project for the future in Europe.
Obviously, we also need to respond to the publicâs concerns.
The people are saying: we want more information; we want more participation; we want more clarity about the European project, and we want more information about its future direction.
Let us actually give people these opportunities!
I believe that project D, to which MrÂ Barroso, the President of the Commission, referred, is a possible way forward.
Let us together organise a grand European debate about the future of European unification, not 25 separate national debates, but one joint debate.
We need an instrument.
Some people are saying another convention, perhaps âEuropean assizesâ, or some kind of instrument.
It is next week, at the summit, that the signal for this new start ought to be given.
Â Â  Mr President, Europe was unable to win the obstacle race.
The Constitution failed to clear all the fences.
This European Constitution was the favourite, but it lost the race.
Did it lose, though, because the text was not good enough?
Did it lose solely because of European considerations?
I think not.
Rather, I think that the ground had not been prepared and that the Constitution had to compete with rivals doped up with lies.
We must all react â the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
What have the voters said to us?
âSorry, we do not really know Europe.
On the other hand, the situation in our own country has deteriorated, so we will make use of our power to say soâ, and they voted for superficial reasons.
The results are there, and we have to draw our conclusions from them.
For too long, some of our governments have turned their backs on the emergence of a real European culture.
In saying that, I am, of course, thinking of France.
How many generations of ministers of all persuasions have been suddenly afflicted with amnesia in the course of moving between Brussels and their own capitals?
Between the moment when, sitting in the middle of the Council of Ministers in Brussels and speaking on behalf of their country, and the moment when they explain a measure, all of them seem to have severe memory lapses.
In Brussels they approve a European measure, which, if it is popular, is immediately credited to the governmentâs initiative.
On the other hand, if an action is indispensable, but unpopular, it is Europe that is held responsible.
This attitude has led us to a sorry state.
For too many years now, no one speaks about Europe.
Enlargement has not been properly explained.
We have moved too fast in the face of public opinion that was not prepared, with people having the feeling of putting up with things rather than participating.
Making people like Europe means finding ways of making it understood.
One of the major errors in relation to this Constitutional Treaty was not to have organised popular or parliamentary consultation on the same day in all the Member States.
Let us remember, however, that ten countries voted âyesâ and that it is only by integrating the European debate within all issues of national politics that we can manage to avert the populist hurricane that is now sweeping over our countries.
Â Â  Mr President, continuing with the ratification procedure in the remaining Member States would have the attraction of showing that this Constitution does have the support of the majority of Member States and of the peoples of the European Union.
But it is a risky strategy in some ways.
It risks further 'noes', it risks giving the impression that we are proceeding with business as usual without listening, and of course it also poses the question of whether you can easily ask the French or the Dutch to vote again on the same text without further ado.
Something else has to happen.
We need the European Council to agree collectively on how to proceed.
It is no good some countries going ahead with ratification whilst others have pronounced the text dead.
We need a common agreement.
I think that agreement must comprise a pause for reflection at some stage for further debate and for further adjustment, with two stages.
Firstly at national level: those countries that have said 'no' or that risk saying 'no' must be able to think and tell the rest of the European Union how they see the way forward, what adjustments they think are necessary.
Then secondly at European level: we must make this a European debate, not just another quick IGC behind closed doors, but a public debate.
That is why I think reconvening a new Convention with a new president might not be such a bad idea. It does after all meet in public.
It involves national parliamentarians. It involves people from governing parties and opposition parties.
It would be the way forward. It would get far more public attention than the previous Convention.
There is no easy way forward.
We must find a way because we cannot afford to lose the reforms contained in this Constitution.
We need a European Union that is more effective and more democratic.
Â Â  â Mr President, the discussions which will be held at the European Council next week will, unfortunately, take place under the shadow of the two novotes on the European Constitution, two novotes which lead us to the conclusion that we now need to hold a fundamental, joint debate on the future of Europe.
In this debate, we shall need â if we have understood the message sent to us by the citizens of France and the Netherlands â to examine all the political, economic, social and cultural issues which concern â and they must concern â the citizens of the European Union.
The conclusions of this debate will probably cause us to re-examine the policies adopted and followed up to now by the European Union, both within the Union and in its foreign relations.
We should not be frightened by the idea or of the possibility of re-examining policies.
On the contrary, European integration, as a dynamic process, also encompasses the need to re-examine policies as and where necessary.
I have a feeling that, today more than ever, we need to remain faithful to the European idea.
However, precisely because we need to remain faithful to the European idea, perhaps the time has come for us to re-examine and redefine its content.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, why do we complain so much that politics has entered European life?
We all know that politics is not a long calm river and that sometimes it can also be a furious current.
I would like to say, firstly, that this process must continue, because we are all equal, we all have the right to express ourselves, and our precursors, the Swiss, have also expressed themselves in favour of the European Union in a referendum in which they decided to enter Schengen.
Secondly, a ânoâ is worth as much as a âyesâ, but a ânoâ is not a right to veto, and those who have said ânoâ must say what they want to do.
Do they want to stay with us or to leave?
They must say it, not us.
Since I am the first speaker who comes from a country that has said âyesâ in a referendum, please allow me to give some pieces of advice.
Firstly, in Spain we held a referendum on the European Constitution and I would like to pay tribute to all the opposition parties, who talked about Europe and not about our domestic problems.
Secondly, we must talk about Europe and we must speak well.
As Mr Zapatero said during the campaign, to speak well about Europe is a weapon of mass construction.
We have expressed clearly our gratitude for the âMarshall Planâ which has come to us from Europe and we have tried to generate hope.
Because there is much talk here about problems and complaints, but our duty is to generate hope and responses to the problems of the people, not to complain.
I must say that we need to reflect on what must be done, but we must not stop.
If we stop, the ânoâ syndicate will say that it has won and that is a risk we cannot accept.
I will end by saying to the President-in-Office of the Council that it should add two things to its list: we must defend the euro and we must work actively within the Doha Round, which is where globalisation is going to be debated this year.
Â Â  Mr President, next weekâs European Council summit will be one of the most important in the history of European integration.
We all realise that a wrecked Constitution would leave Europe as it was before the start of the ratification process.
If we wish to avoid Europe getting bogged down in a long-term crisis, the Council will have to be vigorous in taking the lead.
There are two possible solutions available to us now.
If the French President and the Dutch Prime Minister say that they will resubmit the document for approval, then we shall continue with integration.
If they are unable to do so, we shall create a political basis by separating the first and second parts of the Constitution from individual common policies.
The Convention, of which I was a member, came to the view that if the EU were to achieve effective reform, it would need not only to organise relations between institutions and incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also to consolidate existing agreements, including policies.
However, neither the Convention nor the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference had the political will to separate these two problems from each other.
We are here, Mr President, because France and the Netherlands rejected the Constitution.
Debate in those countries revealed dissatisfaction with many current European policies, and not with the institutional solution that the Constitution would have brought about.
Citizens were forced to decide on both questions at once, however.
The European Council should therefore take independent decisions on the separation of the constitutional framework in Chapters 1 and 2 and its submission for ratification.
The first and second parts of the Constitution are a balanced document upon which consensus was reached within both the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference.
Everything now depends on whether or not the European Council can find the will to take a courageous step forward.
If we cannot, we risk the acute crisis we are facing with regard to the ratification of the Constitution becoming a chronic crisis affecting the entire integration project.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, ratification is an ongoing process, and the right and duty of every state.
This is why the process must not be halted merely because two countries have said ânoâ.
I would urge the Members of this House who have today called for a halt to ratification to respect democracy and the sovereign right of each state to take autonomous decisions on this issue.
As a Polish citizen, I too should like to have my say on the matter.
I should like to have my say on the Constitution, and I do not believe that anyone should deprive me of this right, or tell me that France and the Netherlands have already decided on my behalf and on behalf of all Poles.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Still bearing in mind the outcome of the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the second point I should like to make is that the Polish people have been very much alarmed by the tone and direction of the debate in these countries.
I am not merely referring to the omnipresence of the proverbial Polish plumber.
This debate, which in fact was only incidentally concerned with the European Constitution, prompted us to ask ourselves the following key question. If this referendum had taken place before the recent enlargement, would we, and by we I mean the 10Â new Member States, still have joined the EU?
Have we joined an EU based on solidarity, or a selfish EU that is locking its doors?
I hope to hear answers to these questions after the forthcoming summit, which I believe will get to grips with this tricky situation.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, we have been inundated with a multitude of analyses, interpretations and speculations ever since the referenda in France and the Netherlands.
An oft-repeated claim is that the victory of the ânoâ camp in these countries was a public protest against the recent EU enlargement, and that the failed referenda are a form of punishment for what happened one year ago.
Continuing in the same vein, the conclusion drawn from this is that the brakes must be put on enlargement, and that accordingly we must wait until the EU has âdigestedâ the new Member States, much as a boa constrictor might swallow and digest a rabbit.
People have already expressed doubts, both in this Chamber and elsewhere, as to whether allowing Bulgaria and Romania to join the EU on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007 was a wise move.
The decision to open negotiations with Turkey in October is quite openly being called into question, and Ukraineâs European ambitions are being written off.
Of course, noÂ one can be forbidden from expressing these and similar opinions.
It would be a grave mistake, however, if they were to form the basis for restrictive political decisions, and there are at least three reasons why this is the case.
Firstly, we must not go back on the commitments we made, and that were made to the citizens of the EU candidate countries.
I would remind the House that we must not only abide by principles when it suits us, and when they are in any case redundant, but also when we encounter difficulties in doing so.
Secondly, every enlargement carried out to date has been an economic success.
Thirdly, the European Union is not intended to be an elite, members-only club.
It should be quite the opposite, namely an open area of democracy, respect for human rights and minorities and peaceful methods of conflict resolution.
In my opinion this last point is of particular significance, as it represents both the essence and the mission of the European Community.
Unless this mission is accomplished, not only will the Constitutional Treaty be killed off, but also the EU itself.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the construction of Europe and its integration always were, are, and will continue to be very complex processes, in which two steps forward are often followed by one step back.
In the past year, we have made two steps forward â simply consider the unprecedented and successful enlargement of the European Union to include 10 new members.
The outcome of the referenda in France and the Netherlands are, of course, a step back.
It is an enormous disappointment, and one I feel myself, since I come from one of the new Member States.
Neither in France nor in the Netherlands, however, does this mean the end of the integration process, and I am convinced that this does not necessarily mean the end of the European Constitution.
I believe and expect that the European Council will send out a clear message to the effect that the other Member States should also be able to express their views on the European Constitutional Treaty.
The score so far is 10 countries in favour and two against.
I think that the people of Poland, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Denmark should have the right and the opportunity to say whether or not they want the European Constitutional Treaty, and only then, on that basis â as provided for in the Constitution â should the Council decide next year what to do with the document.
I would like to say one more thing regarding the Financial Perspective.
I believe that a compromise will be reached on 16 and 17 June allowing Europe to move forward with the help of financial resources, which are, of course, necessary if we are to achieve our goals and realise our ambitions.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, from a legal point of view, this treaty, as everyone knows, has failed.
Politically, the need to bring it into force is even more urgent than ever before.
That is why we have to ask ourselves how we can help to advance the ideas outlined in the treaty.
From this point of view, I wonder how wise it is now to expose the treaty to a series of public executions in the form of referenda.
I think it would be much wiser to take time to reflect, so as to give the treaty a chance.
This time should be used to clarify a few questions.
Now is not the time or place for answers or magic formulae; now is the time for questions.
One question is: have we in Europe perhaps reached the limits of integration?
Are we not in the process of transferring more and more competences from the Member States to the Union, only for them to be managed there in procedures that are democratically rather dubious and in any case opaque and highly bureaucratic, to the extent that they are impossible for any citizen to understand?
You might go to the Commission, examine all of the draft directives lying around there, and only find one in which a clear distinction is drawn between what needs to be regulated in Europe and what is best left in the hands of the Member States and their regions.
I would bet that there is not one single directive in which this kind of subsidiarity culture is fostered.
We must turn our attention to these issues.
The second question is this: have we perhaps reached the limits of enlargement?
No one knows how far the enlarged Union should extend.
Ukraine, Belarus, Morocco, Israel â in the past all of these countries have been discussed.
This lack of a boundary breeds uncertainty, and uncertainty breeds rejection.
That is another reason why the voters said ânoâ.
Seen in this light, giving Turkey candidate status was a failure of historic proportions on the part of the Union, and one about which we need to think long and hard.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the events taking place serve as a lesson for the future.
This method of ratification has proved to be a mistake and one referendum on a single day would have been better.
If we had had more courage then, we would not be in this situation today.
The June European Council, as has been mentioned, will now have to be able to read the signals resulting from the ânoâ vote in the referendum and find an exit route.
It is increasingly clear, however, that there are two possible solutions in play: the first â as we have also heard in this House â is less Europe: it should turn back, slow down, stop enlargement, culminating in the foolishness that I have even heard in my country about the euro.
The second is to relaunch a fresh challenge that proposes more Europe â I would say the real Europe.
Yet if we do, however, want this second solution to prevail, as I do, we have to be able to innovate and change, and denounce the fact that we are paying for the hold-ups of recent years: we are paying for the hold-ups of Nice and of Lisbon, and the lack of resources to match our ambitions.
Moving forward is therefore right, as it is right to denounce the part played by national selfishness.
That setback must inspire us, however, to determinedly address the unresolved difficulties, and then Europe will genuinely be able once again to harbour hopes of tackling afresh those fears, uncertainties and anxieties experienced by our citizens today.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the question is actually always: national populism or European, social, shared responsibility?
That is why I would like the Council to take as its motto, ârecollection, not reversalâ.
I would ask you to produce a code of conduct for all of those who sit on national executives or European legislatures, so as to put an end to the culture of blame and double moral standards.
They should say the same in Brussels as they do at home.
They should be prepared to shoulder their share of responsibility rather than allocating blame.
They should provide information, rather than ignoring the publicâs questions and fears.
As well as drafting this code of conduct, I hope that you will open the door for a limited period of reflection, and that you will produce an information and communication strategy that will open a democratic debate with the public, so that the ratification process can continue successfully thereafter.
Â Â  â Mr President, the situation that we are now facing is called crisis.
It would be futile and dangerous to deny it.
Being clear, however, does not mean making gestures.
We must not give up so easily.
Each country has to decide on the Constitution according to its own constitutional rules.
In the meantime, we must reflect on the consequences of the apparent absence of unanimous ratification so as to establish as quickly as possible a new consensus for a political Europe, which we must not give up on.
Nevertheless, what Europeans have expressed by their vote or by their attitude needs close analysis and it calls first for changes in European politics and in the way they are conducted.
Europe has to get out of the somewhat schizophrenic state in which it operates on a daily basis.
Decisions are made at supranational level but debates are exclusively at national level.
Henceforth, the debate in each country should focus on the common issues and on European interests, as was the case in the French referendum campaign.
For the time being, Mr President, the European Council has to bring stability to the system as it is and show that it has clearly heard the message. For me, that means, as a priority, persuading the Central Bank to lower its key interest rate, as this is essential for growth.
Otherwise, we risk collapse because of monetary inflexibility.
Then we need to reach a political agreement on the financial perspective and to cut back some projects for legislation that are not meeting any real need.
We need to put in place real policies for industry and research and move from discussion to decisions and from decisions to action on asylum and immigration, on justice and common policy. We need too to postpone the start of negotiations for the accession of Turkey in order to introduce into the terms of negotiation the notion of a privileged partnership.
Mr President, we can overcome the crisis and move forward if we act democratically.
Let us make the European policies that the people demand of us.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, a great many people in Europe are dissatisfied.
They feel overwhelmed by too many laws and uncertain in key areas of their lives: on the labour market, in the various different social security systems and in terms of how safe and secure they feel.
People react how and where they can.
They say ânoâ to the political establishment in elections and they say ânoâ in the referenda on the European constitution.
In this situation, we politicians must respond calmly and perceptively.
Neither âbusiness as usualâ nor quick-fire responses and over-reactions are called for.
It would in any case be wrong to make the constitution a scapegoat.
It is not the problem, but at best a way of resolving our problems in Europe and with Europe more effectively.
We European politicians should therefore take the trouble to consider how we can turn this situation round.
I agree with those who want to suspend the process of ratifying the treaty for a certain period.
This could put a stop to the negative domino effect.
However, the decision-making process should then be re-started, perhaps even in a coordinated form, with the remaining decisions on the constitution all being made at the same time.
I would like to see a week for Europe next July.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not find it easy or pleasant to speak today.
I have put a lot of thought into the position my group should take and the position this Parliament should take with regard to the ratification process.
I believe that Europe has always made progress on the basis of consensus.
I have observed today â as has been said â that, despite the fact that 10 Member States have ratified it, despite the fact that many Europeans have said yes to the Constitution, there is no consensus to move forward.
I note that the text of the Constitution is not being debated, but rather the political context.
I therefore believe that the worst thing we can do is not to look carefully at the reality and not to concentrate on what the people are asking for.
The people are asking us to listen, to debate and to hold dialogue.
I believe, today as I did yesterday â perhaps more firmly than yesterday â that the Constitution is necessary for Europe; and since I believe that it is necessary and that we must save it, the most logical thing â and this is the position of my group, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â is that the ratification process be delayed.
I believe that, if the Heads of State or Government take a unanimous decision in this regard, we will all have time â perhaps one year until the end of the Austrian Presidency â to consider what we should do about the Constitution, how we should explain these things to the people, how we should re-establish contact with them.
It is at times like these, these difficult and unpleasant times, that the importance of people becomes clear, when we must not just do nothing and see what happens, but rather we should do what we believe to be most useful in order to implement something that we believe to be necessary.
I believe that the Constitution is necessary.
And since this is a difficult situation and a painful decision, my group, which has reflected carefully, believes that the best option is that of delay at this time.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like first of all to thank all the Members for their observations, their advice and the views they have expressed.
I should like first to congratulate Parliament. Long may it last!
If there were a fresh vote today on the Constitution, it would be clear that, in this Parliament, the Constitution is not dead. It is very much alive.
That is the task before us all.
It is a very difficult task, but one that we must carry out with determination and with tenacity.
All of those who have been members of the Convention have, to some extent, been deluding themselves because we really, honestly and sincerely believed that this Convention was very much in tune with public opinion and with the hopes and wishes of our fellow citizens.
We wanted to change the way of drawing up a text, a treaty and then, finally, a Constitution.
Today we have to recognise that, although the Constitution has some excellent qualities, it did not quite meet those expectations or make those innovations.
The first conclusion I would like to draw is that the democratic debate that has been started in Europe and that has opened up because of this sort of crisis, the importance of which should not now be exaggerated, must, at all events, continue.
Once again, whether or not we call for a postponement and that is an important question that I shall refer to the President of the European Council when I speak to him on your behalf to convey the different attitudes and the different analyses that you have expressed in your debate â reflection must not be restricted only to chancelleries.
This will not provide a way out of the present crisis.
Whether there is a postponement or not, we must, above all, avoid adding confusion to the current uncertainty, and that uncertainty is very real.
We must make clear decisions, we must tell the people, with the people, what are the ways out we have open to us and what we think is best.
I agree that we have to recognise that it is up to each sovereign nation â and, as I am from Luxembourg, I feel directly involved, since our referendum will be taking place very soon, on 10 July â to decide, if it wishes, immediately and without waiting, to carry on as if nothing had happened.
That is an option, and maybe that is the way we should continue.
Be that as it may, if we do take a decision, we must take it with clarity and not in confusion.
The democratic debate must be extended to our countries and to our Parliaments. It must be carried on with the very lifeblood of our countries and with the unions and management.
We have to make up for the time that has been wasted for so long.
There must be a European debate in tune with the debates at national level because that is the only means of emerging greater and stronger from this challenge.
I know of no magic formula. I am completely in agreement with the President of the Commission when he says that we need to find a new political consensus, here, in this Parliament above all, but also in our Member States.
Europe must be an issue, but it must also be the subject of a basic consensus between all democrats and between all those who believe that Europe is the solution and not the problem.
We must first reach agreement on the essentials and then open up the political debate, whatever its tendency, move it forward and carry it through to a conclusion.
I believe, Mr President, that when you go to the European Council you will be listened to because you have conducted a very useful debate.
I believe that your message will serve to clarify the thinking of those who have to make a decision next week.
Thank you again. You may not have provided a solution yet, but you have, perhaps, shown the way towards a solution.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like, first of all, to congratulate Parliament.
I believe that we have indeed had a serious debate.
I recognised that, although we started from different viewpoints, a genuine intellectual effort was nonetheless made to recognise that there is a problem and to analyse it seriously and responsibly.
At the close of this debate, however, it is equally clear that there is no magic solution and that all of us recognise the very great complexity of the problem.
The situation may be complex and may be difficult, but we have no choice but to accept a truth, handed down to us through political science from antiquity, and that is caution.
I know that, today, we live in a society where, because of media coverage, we are at the mercy of the constant demand for news and urgency.
However, we are responsible political men and women and we need to show caution. That too is a great political virtue.
That is why we must, perhaps, give ourselves the time and the conditions for a proper analysis, an in-depth analysis, and for a proper debate and a collective solution.
Nonetheless, I think it is possible to draw some conclusions from todayâs debate.
It was clear to me, and this has been reinforced by the conclusions drawn by the President-in-Office of the Council, that a favourable reception was given to the idea of a more intensive dialogue, both within the European context and within the national context, a dialogue that goes even beyond the political institutions.
If we can agree on this principle, the idea that Europe does not utterly disregard the negative results in two countries as important as France and the Netherlands, that Europe listens and that institutions and politicians listen and want to understand what is happening and to come up with solutions is an important one.
I think that, on this point, there has been, all things considered, fairly general agreement in favour of this idea.
I think I can say that there was also agreement in favour, too, of recognising the responsibility shared by all those involved and the need to work together in order to find a new consensus that will allow Europe to move forward.
There is a third idea which, I believe, is more or less generally accepted, and that is the idea that we must avoid paralysis.
We have an institutional problem.
Certainly, no one spoke in favour of paralysing the European project, no one said that now, because of what has happened, Europe was going to come to a stop and was not going to continue with the programmes that are in the interests of the people who are our citizens: programmes for growth, employment, security and the fight against crime.
We have to move forward.
The people expect definite answers, beyond institutional debate and constitutional discussions.
If one accepts that, if one accepts the idea of a refusal to paralyse Europe, if one accepts the idea of a genuine European debate, the idea of recognition of our shared responsibility with a view to a new consensus in Europe, one is entitled to expect the European Council to be able to find this new dynamic consensus, along with a strengthened resolve to advance our common cause. Independently, however, of the new vision for Europe that we need, we must also find specific answers for specific problems.
What, then, is the first real problem that we face?
It is the European budget, the need to find a consensus, in a spirit of compromise, on the financial perspective. I believe that would be a very powerful signal for the European Council to send to all Europeans, the signal that Europe goes on.
Of course, there are difficulties, but we are, I repeat, capable of overcoming those difficulties.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The mask has slipped!
Following the victories of the no campaigns in the French and Dutch referenda on the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ, it has become clear that for the political forces still running the EU in a brotherhood â the Right and the âsocialistsâ â and for the interests that they represent â the large economic and financial groups â the referenda have only taken place so that the people can say yes to what suits those forces and interests.
There is a great deal of confusion among the rank and file.
Some want to continue the âratificationâ process in order ultimately to impose fresh referenda on those insolent citizens (until they say yes), whilst others facing referenda and expecting no votes â and solely for this reason â want firstly to know how to avoid the same fate as the French and Dutch votes.
In other words, nobody wants this hot potato, until such time as a magic formula has been discovered to save the âEuropean Constitutionâ, be it revamped or otherwise.
This will take time.
In Portugal, the Socialist party, the Social Democrat Party and the Coalition, despite having been overtaken by events, are still pressing ahead with holding a farcical referendum on the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ, which has twice been rejected, on the same day as municipal elections, which will stifle any chance of open and meaningful debate.
There is therefore only one appropriate course of action: to bury the âEuropean Constitutionâ once and for all.
Â Â  I would like to welcome Mr Voronin, President of the Republic of Moldova, and the delegation accompanying him.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, when Romania joins the European Union, Moldova will become a direct neighbour of our Union.
The Union, therefore, Mr President, is working actively to strengthen relations with Moldova, as I have said before.
The action plan between the European Union and Moldova that we have recently implemented is a good instrument for moving these relations forward.
Mr President, I wish you a fruitful visit to our Institution
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there are 90 of us who, as MEPs, have signed a motion of censure on the Commission, because it was the only way we had ...
Â Â  Mr Bonde, I have cut you off because this is not the time to make statements.
If you have a point of order, please tell me which Rule you are invoking.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, it is Article 100 of the Rules of Procedure, on interpretation of the rules.
Â Â  Are you invoking Rule 100 on interpretation of the Rules of Procedure?
Please wait a moment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there are 90 of us who, as MEPs, have signed a motion of censure ...
Â Â  Mr Bonde, you do not have the right to speak under Rule 100.
It does not refer to any point of order.
Â Â  Mr President, this concerns the way in which we interpret the Rules of Procedure.
I arranged with the Secretary-General to have a one-minute explanation.
That is normally enough for a group leader.
Â Â  Alright, Mr Bonde, explain to me the problem you have with Rule 100.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the problem is that there are 90 of us who, as MEPs, have signed a motion of censure on the Commission, because it was the only way we had of getting the President of the Commission to come here to Parliament and explain the connection between a gift of between EURÂ 20Â 000 and EURÂ 25Â 000 and a subsequent decision to provide EURÂ 10Â million in regional aid to his friend.
Moreover, we wrote in our motion of censure that we would withdraw said motion if we were given a reasonable explanation.
We were given an explanation, but Parliamentâs President has in the meantime decided that, contrary to the wish expressed in the motion itself, we must vote on the motion.
We are satisfied that, in future, motions of censure are to be accepted from the moment they are submitted with 74 signatures, whereupon they will automatically be put to the vote, but the motion was submitted under the old rules, and some of us will therefore choose to abstain from voting when the motion is put to the vote.
That does not mean that we are satisfied with the Commissionâs answer, but we are pleased about the undertakings given during the debate, and we shall pursue the matter in the Committee on Budgetary Control and go on fighting for complete openness about gifts ...
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Bonde.
I note that that is in no way a point of order.
Please sit down.
Please do not indulge in parliamentary filibustering.
What you are raising is in no sense a point of order.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, at the vote in the temporary committee on 10Â May, we had around 620 amendments to deal with and vote on.
On the basis of the 620 amendments in the temporary committee, I had tabled 44 compromise amendments to the committee, of which 41 were adopted.
I should like to ask you to take account of the following when you vote: because of the vote, there are three technical corrections that need to be made to ensure that the text and the table of figures are consistent.
Technical corrections need to be made to the figures in paragraphÂ 50, indents seven and nine.
In the seventh indent, the figure of EURÂ 4.5 billion should be replaced by the figure EURÂ 4.7 billion.
