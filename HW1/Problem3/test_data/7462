Whilst climate change is making desertification worse, desertification is aggravating climate change, because less carbon binding with the soil eventually results in the carbon being released into the atmosphere.
Unless we act wisely, consistently and promptly, we may create a vicious circle.
Combating desertification entails the prevention of hunger and, through that, the prevention of conflict.
Last June the UN warned that over the next 10 years desertification could drive 50 million people from their homes, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia.
This would also mean more people trying to enter Europe illegally.
The Darfur crisis has been described as the first climate change conflict.
The water shortage is just one aspect of the crisis.
It is more generally recognised that the prolonged water shortage and the decline in the land's productivity have helped fuel conflict.
As stated in the resolution, there needs to be investment in sustainable land use.
Measures to prevent desertification will be a lot cheaper than its consequences.
A cautionary example on a small scale is the Easter Islands.
There was a flourishing culture there at one time, but when the forests were cut down the soil became poor, the islands turned into dry grasslands, and a thriving culture collapsed in a short space of time.
If we act wisely, consistently and determinedly, we can stop all humanity suffering the same fate.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this eighth conference on desertification is an extremely important opportunity, in a proper forum such as the UN, but it also requires specific responses to a dramatic situation.
Climate change is accelerating processes already under way affecting very fragile areas such as Africa, but not sparing our own continent.
Hunger and disease, migrations of biblical proportions and fires are our future, but also our present.
We therefore need to make strong, clear choices. The first is, naturally, to implement Kyoto and to sign, at long last, the post-Kyoto agreement, a multilateral agreement providing the frame of reference for a different future.
Further choices are also needed so that we can adapt in order to protect lives.
There is a real tragedy: its name is water. The right to access to water is already being denied and is likely to be denied more and more for millions of people.
For this reason, we should oppose processes to privatise this resource, which is vital for life.
Access to water should be guaranteed and it should become a genuine common asset belonging to humanity, including through a solemn declaration by the UN that would subsequently make it possible to put in place public policies to guarantee such a right.
It is also necessary for the fight against desertification to guide financial policies on climate. For example, all good practices that allow CO2 capture through agriculture and forestry ought to be promoted and encouraged.
This ought also to lead to a review of choices such as those in the common agricultural policy, which have encouraged a decoupling of productive activities carrying with it a risk of desertification and fires.
Choices such as intensive production of biomass for energy ought also to be reconsidered.
In Europe too, it is also necessary to have a specific, strong policy relating to soil, as for water and air.
For this reason we must not erect obstacles, as is being done in this Parliament by a section of the European People's Party, but instead the framework directive on soil protection put forward by the Commission should be welcomed.
It provides that soil should form an integral part of climate policy.
Desertification is also caused by a dearth of policy. We must combat it with good policy.
Mr President, there are areas within the European Union that fall victim to long periods of drought and its devastating impact every year or every few years; it is good therefore that this is being taken into account in policymaking.
In fact, there are two causes of desertification: one natural and one man-made.
Drought is a natural cause that can lead to poor soil condition, particularly in combination with man-made causes such as poor management of agricultural land, forests and water.
The risk of desertification then increases hand over fist, particularly in Europe's Mediterranean regions.
Now that many climatologists are predicting an increase in temperature, with an increased risk of extreme drought, it is good to take preventive measures to limit the impact of drought, including desertification.
In my view, policy must be targeted at both the natural and the man-made causes of desertification.
As regards the natural causes, it is important to use the available water as effectively as possible.
Water must be conserved where possible, and soil must be prevented from drying out.
One way of achieving the latter is to ensure good forest management. Good water management is also important.
Existing legislation on water can also be employed here.
My home country, the Netherlands, has a national coordination centre, which comes into operation as soon as drought threatens, and implements measures at regional level.
Frameworks can be laid down at European or UN level, but implementation must take place primarily at national and regional level.
Voluntary partnerships between problem areas with a view to learning to deal with the problems strike me as another effective possibility.
These can take the form of a knowledge platform with both political and scientific input.
Such initiatives also exist in connection with the implementation of the Directive on the assessment and management of flood risks, and appear to be having a positive impact.
(RO) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, global warming is a threat whose long-term effects are devastating.
This summer we witnessed the effects of the heatwave in Greece and other European countries, floods in Great Britain and extreme droughts in Romania.
Global warming effects became more and more visible for Romania in Dobrogea, Southern field or Western sands.
Following global warming, Romania will be, together with Spain, Greece and Italy, among the countries facing climate change the most by 2015.
Almost a quarter of Romanian territory will become arid in the next 20 years and many plant species will disappear.
The effects of desertification are already visible.
The situation in Romania is not unique in the European Union and that is why we have to act together based on the principle of solidarity which the European project is founded on.
Assessments 10 years Ã¡fter the entry into effect of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification , indicate increasing desertification trends while the reaction of states is absent.
If no measures to eliminate the negative factors are taken, desertification will be present forever or the costs for environmental remediation will be incomensurate.
Dear colleagues, preventing desertification is easier than removing it.
Efficient crop management, increased attention to irrigation systems and drawing up strategies for ensuring workplaces in non-agricultural fields for the inhabitants of dry areas could represent solutions for preventing desertification.
In order to ensure the efficiency of the efforts in combating desertification we need integrated development systems at national, regional and international level.
Meanwhile, Convention implementation has to be closely linked to the efforts of limiting climate change.
Having regard to the abovementioned points, I would like to ask a question to the Commission: at the Conference in Madrid, will the Commission announce a change or a toning of the strategy and undertake new obligations on behalf of the EU as regards the Convention, having regard the accession of the most recent countries?
(PT) The Green Paper on climate change draws attention to the natural phenomena aggravated by climate change.
Climate change is expected to lead to a reduction in rainfall, higher temperatures and a higher incidence of heat waves and periods of drought, leading to increased desertification.
Unlike other natural disasters, the impact of drought does not affect infrastructures but production and the environment, as well as the lives of local people.
One of the serious consequences of drought is the difficulty of supplying the population with drinking water.
Studies show that droughts and floods kill more people than any other natural disaster.
Moreover, 8 million people die each year from diseases linked to the consumption of unsafe water, for example because of dysentery, cholera and typhoid fever.
Shortage of drinking water causes 80% of illnesses and deaths in developing countries.
More than 4 500 children die each day of diseases caused by lack of water.
It was not by chance that the Informal Meeting of Environment Ministers, held in Lisbon a few days ago, was devoted to the problems of water shortage and drought, which is, moreover, one of the major concerns and priorities of the Portuguese Presidency's Programme for the environment, as the Secretary of State already mentioned.
It is hoped that the Conference of the Parties will take the appropriate decisions for combating drought and desertification and that the European Institutions will also make their contribution.
In conclusion, I should like to recapitulate the proposals which I put forward in the report on natural disasters, in particular those adopted by the European Parliament: the establishment of a European observatory on drought and desertification in order to gather information and ensure a more effective response; that preventive measures be implemented in the area of drought risk management, including strategies to minimise the resulting impacts, and incorporated into river basin management strategies.
(EL) Mr President, it is one of life's little ironies that this discussion should take place after the summer's tragic events in southern Europe.
These disasters will unfortunately play a major part in changing the landscape and creating future environmental problems.
Desertification is not a modern problem; it has been with us for decades.
In the past, the gradual deterioration of fertile soil has been a complex process.
It has multiple causes and proceeds at varying rates according to climatic differences.
For example, desertification may intensify an existing general climatic tendency towards greater dryness, or it may initially arise from a change in the local climate.
It is important to stress that the presence of a nearby desert has no bearing on desertification.
Unfortunately, an area undergoing desertification only comes to the public's attention once the process is well under way.
There is often very little information available to indicate the previous state of the ecosystem or the degree of degradation.
We therefore need to be particularly careful about what is to be done with the burnt land in southern Europe: in the near future there is a danger of climate change, which could well cause desertification in the stricken regions.
Scientists also happen to be investigating whether desertification is a permanent factor in the process of global change, and how and when desertification can be stopped or reversed.
This will be one of the topics for discussion at the United Nations International Conference.
More efficient use of existing water resources and control of salinisation are effective tools for areas of dry soil.
There are also ways of using surface water resources such as rainwater.
In addition to science, politics can be considered as a useful tool for combating desertification.
If we are to halt and reverse the degradation of dry and semi-barren soil, we must understand how and why the rate of climate change, population growth and food production affect these environments.
The most effective intervention arises only from the prudent use of the best information.
As a conclusion to this discussion, a resolution on the European Union's aims has been submitted to the United Nations Conference.
Let me emphasise two points which I consider to be very important.
First, it is finally time for the EU to fork out, if it wishes to call itself the 'European Union'; it must assign legally binding funding to actions to combat desertification.
Second, the EU should not rob Peter to pay Paul: it cannot present itself as protector of the environment having failed to promote mandatory general regulations prohibiting the import into the EU of illegal timber that has not been sustainably felled.
Indeed, desertification concerns not only the European Union, but the whole planet.
If, then, the EU wishes to make its presence felt, it must take appropriate steps, and not go to Madrid merely as an observer.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I seem to have detected in this debate a certain sadness, a certain consternation and perhaps a little scepticism on the part of some Members as to what we can do from now on to combat drought and desertification, having regard to what we have done to date in this field.
However, I think that the conditioning factors and the context have changed significantly since 1994, particularly in more recent times.
I think that the growing awareness among governments, politicians in general, civil society and public opinion of issues concerning climate change, the environmental challenges facing us and, in particular, combating desertification, climate change and water shortages, will help us to press ahead, with confidence, optimism, and a renewed impetus in combating the serious environmental problems that we shall increasingly have to face.
We also have reasons for some confidence and optimism when we see the Council of the European Union taking on important commitments, I would even say extremely important commitments, and taking the lead internationally in announcing measures for combating climate change and proposing that they become standards, goals to be achieved by the entire international community.
Portugal, in its Presidency of the European Union, will naturally have an important role to play here too, since we shall be leading the European Union at the Bali Conference which, as you know, will be preparing the decisions that we shall need to take in that area post-Kyoto 2012.
We think that the Madrid Conference of the Parties to the Convention to Combat Desertification could in fact provide an opportunity for renewing and updating the commitments made in 1994.
We hope so.
We have three or four priorities that we think it would be useful to achieve.
First, it is our opinion that the Parties to the Convention should improve their internal coordination as regards combating desertification, by taking a more integrated approach to this issue as a whole.
As the honourable Member mentioned, ministers for the various sectors often adopt domestic measures without previously agreeing on the objectives to be attained, so that decision-making is rather ad hoc and random.
At national level, therefore, coordination between the various departments holding responsibilities in this area needs in fact to be more effective and more efficient.
It was mentioned in this House, and I also said it myself in my first speech, that it is very important for civil society to feel more involved in implementing the measures needed to combat desertification.
Many of the problems are specific and localised, having a profound effect on the local population, and it is important in this combat that there should be a sense of 'ownership' or taking on board of the policies necessary to combat desertification.
We must also enhance the institutional mechanisms for implementing the Convention.
We also think it is important, at regional and international level, to step up such cooperation as well as cooperation to combat desertification.
The Parties to the Convention frequently tend to view their own problems from an exclusively national point of view.
This is one area where it seems to us, by the very nature of the problems involved, that regional and international cooperation are particularly appropriate.
To conclude, the question of the budget was mentioned here - budgetary appropriations.
It is an important point; naturally we must also allocate sufficient financial resources to enable these mechanisms to meet needs.
The establishment of a European observatory on drought was mentioned.
That was in fact one of the points discussed and debated at the informal meeting of Environment Ministers in Portugal and one could conclude from that debate that they regard the establishment of a European observatory on drought as an important measure both to draw attention to drought-related problems as well as to build the model required for the measures which must be, or could be, implemented in order to combat drought.
This is therefore, as I said, a measure that the Environment Ministers view with interest and enthusiasm.
Let us hope, then, that the Madrid Conference will produce results that come up to our expectations.
Ladies and gentlemen, it has been a very interesting debate, in which I would like to point out that five women and three men spoke.
I think that this is very important and that it shows that our female Members are particularly sensitive regarding such a fundamental issue.
To conclude the debate, I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.15 p.m. pending Question Time and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
Council Question Time
The next item is Question Time (B6-0138/2007).
The following questions have been submitted to the Council:
Subject: Global approach to immigration
In the light of the conclusions of the General Affairs Council held in Luxembourg on 17 and 18 June 2007 concerning the extension and consolidation of the global approach to immigration, as well as the problems posed by the implementation of permanent intergovernmental cooperation measures in this field, what measures could the Council envisage with a view to developing more effective Union policies, including, notably, real decision-making powers for the Commission or Frontex in such matters as establishing pilot association projects?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The EU institutions implement the series of measures envisaged in the Council conclusions of 18 June 2007 within the limits of their competence as conferred upon them by the Treaty, in cooperation with the Member States and, whenever appropriate, with the third countries concerned.
The responsibility for the control and surveillance of external borders falls to Member States.
However, it is of interest to all Member States belonging to the Schengen agreement, not merely those which have external borders, to ensure that external border controls are effective; certain measures have therefore been taken to promote solidarity and cooperation between Member States in this area.
The establishing of a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, an agency generally known as Frontex, by Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004, was an important step in promoting that solidarity.
In the same way, the capacity of the Frontex Agency was further strengthened with the adoption on 12 June this year of the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams as well as the setting up, during 2007, of the centralised record of available technical equipment - known as the 'toolbox' - kept by the Member States and able to be made available to other Member States.
Joint operations and pilot projects are launched with the agreement of the Member States concerned.
The Rapid Border Intervention Teams are set up in response to a request lodged by one or more Member States.
Frontex coordinates those activities.
There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the decision-making competence of the Commission or of Frontex in this context.
Furthermore, the approval of Decision No 574/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the External Borders Fund for the period 2007 to 2013 as part of the General programme 'Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows', is another important step for the promotion of solidarity and will establish a new means of extending financial aid to the Member States that apply the provisions of the Schengen Agreement at their external borders.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I understand your concern.
In any case we must, I think, here too, take a positive view of the progress made.
If we bear in mind where we have come from and where we were, the establishing of the Frontex Agency is, in my view, already progress and a step forward in cooperation within the European Union on matters concerning the management of external borders.
We may, as you say, develop the capabilities and competences of Frontex, if the Member States so wish.
However, a word applies here too I think, and it is not an intergovernmental word, but a fundamental word, a word, I would say, on which our Union is founded - and that word is solidarity.
We must rely, here too, on that solidarity, solidarity with the Member States who might at one time or another have need of it.
That word - there is no substitute for it - is a word denoting not an intergovernmental situation, but rather union.
(DE) President-in-Office, I should like to be more specific.
The idea of Frontex is excellent, but the implementation is poor.
One reason for this is that the Member States are not providing the staff or equipment they have promised.
Mr Frattini has found that only 10% has been provided. I should like you to tell me - and Parliament - how many of the staff and which technical equipment promised by which Member States has actually been supplied to date and what is still outstanding, and what action you envisage to ensure that all Member States finally provide what they have promised, to enable Frontex to function all year round.
I also understand the honourable Member's question.
We must bear in mind the commitments we have made within the Frontex area, whether in terms of equipment, funding or personnel, and we must stand by our commitments, and I would point out that the Presidency has not omitted to call attention to those aspects.
If we are failing to deliver on the commitments, then we must put that right as a matter of urgency.
That is the only way to enable the Frontex Agency to effectively exercise the role and competences allocated to it.
(DE) I should be interested to hear whether the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises has been considered - after all, these make a substantial contribution to employment in Europe.
I should also like to know the extent to which - as has been seen in the United States - female employment, in particular, has added measures to the Lisbon agenda.
Has the Council taken any relevant precautions to integrate workers accordingly?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I should like to say that, as regards the management of the Frontex Agency and the more general issue of immigration, the basic goals of the Portuguese Presidency are to combat illegal immigration more effectively and improve the adaptation, integration and quality of life of those working in our midst and contributing legally to our economic and social development.
The Portuguese Presidency has various initiatives in view on this aspect.
We shall keep in mind the measures that are fundamental and essential in this area as regards our relations with third countries.
Immigration will always be on the Presidency's and the Council's agenda in their dialogue with third countries.
Subject: Updating of labour legislation in respect of gender equality
What differences in treatment between men and women has the Council identified in respect of gainful employment?
What is the geographical distribution of such differences in the Member States?
What contribution will the Council make, in the context of discussions to update labour legislation, to combat discrimination so that men and women have access to quality jobs offering flexibility and security?
Is it possible to agree on safeguard clauses for the protection of maternity and the reconciliation of work and family life in the private sector?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As regards the differences in treatment between men and women in respect of gainful employment, basic legislation has already been approved, including certain directives which provide for equal treatment as regards pay, job access, professional training, promotion and working conditions.
Furthermore, the Commission and Eurostat are responsible for monitoring the situation in this sector in the various parts of the European Union.
It is clear that, in order to formulate policies, there is a basic need for high quality data covering the whole of the European Union.
Here I am very pleased to recall the agreement reached recently between the Council and the Parliament on the setting up of the European Institute for Gender Equality, which will operate precisely in that area.
On the subject of updating labour legislation, the Council can take action only on the basis of a legislative proposal from the Commission.
Nevertheless, the Council is also applying more open methods for coordination under the European employment strategy.
In this policy area our attention is currently focused on the recent Commission communication on flexicurity, which specifically mentions gender equality as one of the possible joint principles to be agreed at the European Union level.
We also welcome the fact that the Spring 2007 European Council agreed to set up a family alliance to serve as a platform for exchanging opinions and knowledge on good practices and policies for families.
As regards the question of introducing safeguard clauses for the protection of maternity and the reconciliation of working and family life in the private sector, I am pleased to mention the important directives already approved in the field of maternity leave and the protection of maternity and new-born infants at the workplace.
(EL) Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for reiterating the measures which, as we know, have been taken in the interests of equality.
I am asking about the positive discrimination in the legislation of some Member States.
For example, lower pension thresholds are provided for mothers; will this be condemned today by the European Commission, which is taking those Member States to the European Court?
Is the Council going to decide in favour of such positive discrimination?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) A careful reading of the programmes of the German, Slovenian and Portuguese Presidencies will show that social issues, specifically issues of gender equality and the protection of the family, are very high on our list of concerns.
In cooperation with the Commission and each within our own sphere of responsibility we shall, of course, be presenting measures that may be more favourable and may in fact reflect our concerns on social matters.
Those concerns are essential in a modern society such as the EU, taking account of the respective competences of the EU and the Member States.
Let me assure the honourable Member that social issues, in particular those concerning the protection of the family, are priorities for all three Presidencies and, in this specific case, for the Portuguese Presidency.
I hope that by December we shall not have disappointed her in this area.
(LT) As far back as 1975 the European Union adopted legal acts prohibiting discrimination in the provision of salaries and requiring that men and women were paid equal salaries for equal jobs.
Already 30 years have passed, yet these legal acts have not yet been implemented.
I would like to ask the Council to present its opinion.
Can Member States themselves choose which acts they will implement and which they will not?
What is the situation in Portugal?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Once again I should like to point out here what falls under the competence of the EU, namely policy and legislation, and what is the responsibility of Member States - this must be taken into account - and I should like to say that gender equality is an essential issue for Portugal.
I must say also that, in the EU and in this particular case in the new Reform Treaty - as already reflected in the Constitutional Treaty - equality for us is a basic and fundamental issue in European integration and is part of the acquis of those fundamental principles that will certainly always be at the forefront of our concerns.
Subject: Palestine
What is the Council's current position regarding direct communication with elected representatives of the Palestinian people serving in the administration in Gaza?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I would remind the House that the Council, in its conclusions of 23 and 24 July 2007, reiterated its full support for President Abbas and the Government led by Prime Minister Fayyad.
The Council reaffirmed its position on events in Gaza: the only way to achieve Palestine's national objectives by peaceful, legal and democratic means is through reconciliation and national unity based on the peace programme devised by President Abbas.
The Council also stated that the EU is opposed to any division whatsoever of the Palestinian territories and confirmed that the EU is ready to collaborate with all Palestinian parties whose policy and actions reflect the principles of the Quartet.
The EU resumed relations with the institutions of the Palestinian Authority.
We began providing direct financial and technical aid to the Palestinian Government.
In its conclusions of 23 and 24 July 2007, the Council reaffirmed its pledge to help establish the institutions and economy of the future Palestinian State and stressed the need to develop the economy fully in the Palestinian Occupied Territories, including by promoting cooperation with Palestine's private sector.
The Council confirmed its support for the Palestinian civil police by remobilising the EUPOL COPPS mission.
The Commission also called upon Israel to provide the conditions required for such a mission.
The policy of the European Union has been, ever since the Palestinian elections, to refuse to talk to elected representatives associated with Hamas.
Every time Hamas has made a small step that might be interpreted as being in our direction, we have slammed the door in its face.
From talks I have had with some of the President-in-Office's colleagues in Lisbon, I know that there are members of his Government who believe that this policy has been a disastrous failure.
But, in this instance, his job is to talk on behalf of the Council and defend the indefensible.
Can he tell the House in what ways the Council believes that its policy has proven a success?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I would point out that the Middle East peace Quartet met recently in Lisbon.
We are confident and believe that we shall be able to devise measures within the scope of the Quartet, and also within the scope of the European Union, that can help make progress with the Middle East peace process.
The situation there has remained unchanged for many years and we know it is a complex and difficult situation that cannot be resolved overnight.
However, we think that the political conditions might now be in place to enable us to make positive progress.
The Portuguese Presidency wants to work towards that, as does the Council of the European Union.
We need to seize the moment and grasp the opportunity.
We must take advantage of the political context and make the most of the sense of urgency to solve this problem, which I think we feel is there at the moment in relation to the Middle East peace process.
We must be realistic yet confident and we must not think of giving up.
Let me rephrase Mr Davies' very good question.
Does the Council believe we can make progress in the Middle East without bringing Hamas to the table?
Unless Hamas is involved in discussions, the Quartet can meet all they want but there will be no solution.
Does the Council accept that some day it is going to have to sit face-to-face with Hamas to solve this situation?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As you know, the Council agreed upon principles and policy lines for the Middle East peace process that it intends to uphold; it believes in those principles and in those policy lines that shape its political action, and it is intending to stick to them.
As the author is not present, Question No 4 lapses.
Subject: Aid for trade
The Finnish and German Presidencies are to be congratulated on the priority they assigned to aid for trade.
What steps will the Portuguese Presidency take to ensure that spending on trade-related assistance from the Commission, and in particular Member States, continues on the correct trajectory toward the target of â¬1 billion annually by 2010?
Indeed does the Presidency have, or will it seek, clarification of the individual countries' financial commitment toward the â¬1 billion target?
How will the Portuguese Presidency ensure that the Member States and the Commission deliver adequate assistance in those aspects of aid for trade identified by the WTO aid for trade taskforce in 2006, such as trade-related adjustment and trade-related infrastructure, which fall outside of the definition of trade-related assistance and therefore outside of the â¬2 billion target?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The Portuguese Presidency is firmly determined to continue the work successfully undertaken by the Finnish and German Presidencies and to implement the conclusions on aid for trade approved by the Council on 15 May 2007, in particular as regards the finalisation of the EU aid for trade strategy in time for it to be included in the WTO's next global evaluation of aid for trade due to take place in November 2007.
One of the Presidency's objectives is actually to reach an agreement on EU aid for trade strategy at October's General Affairs and External Relations Council, including an outline of the specific steps envisaged for attaining the EUR 2 billion agreed for trade-related assistance by 2010, notably the EUR 1 billion from the Member States to meet the needs identified by the developing countries.
The Presidency is confident that that will be achieved.
The strategy also aims to make a contribution to the broader agenda of aid for trade and to the definition of the measures to be implemented.
Therefore, on 5 July 2007, the Portuguese Presidency presented a draft EU aid for trade strategy which is under discussion in the relevant Council formations.
The draft strategy should be seen in the context of following up the recommendations put forward in 2006 by the WTO Aid for Trade Task Force.
I am very encouraged by the President-in-Office's response and wish him well for the October meeting.
I hope he gets a successful package.
If he does, will he consider publishing towards the end of this year how much each of the individual Member States has contributed in the form of aid for trade?
We know the Commission EUR 1 billion is very transparent, and it is very obvious how it is being spent.
It is not so clear where the EUR 1 billion from the Member States is supposed to come from, whether this is actually happening and who it is coming from.
Would the Council consider publishing that in November or December?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I thank the honourable Member for his words of encouragement and confidence.
The Presidency and the Council will take the appropriate action on this matter in line with the applicable practices, conditions and legislative provisions.
Subject: Northern dimension policy
The Portuguese Presidency of the Council has stated that it will seek to promote EU cooperation with the Mediterranean countries.
As the EU also has a northern dimension, how will the Council Presidency simultaneously promote the EU's northern dimension policy and its implementation?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) We have been implementing the northern dimension policy since the beginning of this year on the basis of two documents adopted at the Northern Dimension Summit held in Helsinki in November 2006.
The policy framework document and the political statement adopted in Helsinki represent a turning point for the northern dimension, insofar as they turn the policy into a joint policy shared by all the northern dimension partners, that is, the EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland.
Joint acceptance of the new policy is a key objective and includes Russia's full participation in all northern dimension structures and activities.
The other main participants and actors in the northern dimension, in particular the four Northern Regional Councils and the international financial institutions, will also be involved in the process.
The northern dimension now represents a permanent platform for debating northern issues and concerns.
The Portuguese Presidency will certainly take work forward in this area.
A Steering Group meeting is planned for late September, early October in ReykjavÃ­k.
The Steering Group aims to provide continuity between the ministerial meetings and the Senior Officials' meetings.
A meeting of Senior Officials is scheduled during the Portuguese Presidency, to be held on 21 November in Russia.
As a Mediterranean country, Portugal would like to see a more intense and broader political debate with our partners from the southern shores of the Mediterranean within the context of Euromed.
The EU and Euromed countries share common interests and are facing similar challenges.
It is in our own interest to broaden EU cooperation with those countries, especially with regard to tackling migration flows and social development.
At the same time, we shall continue to work on implementing the new northern dimension policy.
As in the case of Euromed, a great deal could be achieved through practical cooperation based on good neighbourliness, a partnership of equality, joint responsibility and transparency.
(FI) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Russia's role is crucial in the development of the Northern Dimension.
The European Union's relations with Russia are important in that respect.
Does the Presidency have any intentions this autumn of promoting talks with Russia on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As you know, during its term of office the Portuguese Presidency is to organise a summit with Russia to be held in Mafra, a town not far from our capital, Lisbon.
We are hoping to consider during that summit all the issues pertaining to cooperation and EU-Russia relations, within the economic, scientific, and cultural fields as well as fields directly concerning the freedom of movement of persons in the European area.
We regard it as important and strategic to establish a mutually advantageous and beneficial relationship with Russia based on shared principles and values.
Subject: Frontex
What has been the Council's experience over the last few months with Frontex, and what is its opinion of the idea of developing it into a real European border service, based on the German border police?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, known as Frontex, set up by Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004, which I mentioned earlier, is intended to improve integrated management at the EU's external borders.
The role and functions of the Frontex Agency are set out in the Regulation, which takes account of the fact that the Member States retain responsibility for the control and surveillance of external borders.
The powers of the Frontex Agency were strengthened recently by the approval on 12 June 2007 of the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams.
The European Council, in its conclusions of June 2007, welcomed the agreement reached on Rapid Border Intervention Teams and the launching of the European patrol network and the creation of a centralised toolbox of technical equipment to be made available by and to Member States.
At the moment there are no other proposals to amend the Frontex Regulation.
The Hague programme strengthening freedom, security and justice, invites the Commission to present to the Council an evaluation of the agency by the end of 2007.
That evaluation should analyse the functions of the agency and indicate whether it should take on other responsibilities relating to aspects of border management.
(DE) I was concerned less with the regulation and more with the vision.
In 1998 I presented a report in this House on enlargement and internal security in which I proposed a European border service.
The Tampere Summit addressed this idea, along with that of a European Police College.
Frontex was created as an initial step in that direction.
Does the Council Presidency share the vision of further developing Frontex and the battle groups into a real European border service for the common protection of our external borders?
I think that the Frontex Agency will develop and broaden its responsibilities in accordance with needs and, of course, the will of the Member States.
Subject: Improvement of police cooperation
What are the intentions of the Portuguese Presidency regarding the progress of two important Commission proposals designed to increase the security of EU citizens against crime and terrorism, namely final on the improvement of police cooperation between Member States at internal borders and final on the exchange of information under the principle of availability?
Not all elements of these two proposals have been incorporated in the 'PrÃŒm' Decision, so does the Presidency not agree that Member States' failure to agree them sends a poor signal about the importance and urgency with which they treat the challenge of cross-border law enforcement?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The Presidency agrees that improving cross-border cooperation for the purposes of law enforcement is not only an important and pressing question, but also a challenge.
The Council draft decision on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime - the well known 'PrÃŒm' Decision - on which the Council reached political agreement in June 2007, represents considerable progress on the implementation of the principle of availability and the strengthening of cross-border police cooperation, in particular by means of joint operations and the provision of assistance for mass events, disasters and serious accidents.
The Presidency is of the opinion that the 'PrÃŒm' Decision should be implemented as soon as possible, in order to enable tangible results to be achieved.
The Presidency is therefore intending to concentrate its efforts on seeing that progress is made in the next few months on the Council draft decision implementing the 'PrÃŒm' Decision.
The Presidency agrees with the honourable Member that not all the points in the two Commission proposals - one on improving police cooperation and the other on the principle of availability - are included in the 'PrÃŒm' Decision.
However, a considerable part of the Commission proposal on police cooperation is covered by the 'PrÃŒm' Decision and the Presidency has no reason to think that reopening the debate on the other parts would lead to a different result from the one achieved in April 2006.
Whereas the Commission proposal on the principle of availability lays down general principles and covers six types of data, the 'PrÃŒm' Decision in fact deals only with DNA data, fingerprints and vehicle registration data.
The Presidency believes that phased implementation of the principle of availability is the most realistic and practical and is also among the approaches most likely to yield practical results in the short term for day-to-day police cooperation and improving security for EU citizens.
The Presidency believes that those practical results would send a strong signal regarding the importance and urgency attached to cross-border cooperation, thus demonstrating that practical cooperation is possible and is being implemented, even if only partially.
That does not mean that we do not need to continue efforts to achieve even closer cooperation on law enforcement, in particular by means of the elements contained in the Commission proposals.
It is hoped, however, that this can be done on the basis of the results obtained to date as well as those resulting from implementing the 'PrÃŒm' Decision.
Mr President, can the Council therefore confirm that discussions in the Council on both the availability principle and the police cooperation measure have been suspended?
You have recognised that the PrÃŒm Treaty is less ambitious than either of those, so have you suspended them?
Why can the Council keep legislating for things that infringe on people's personal privacy but they cannot get to the root of cooperation between police?
One of the impediments to that is the lack of an overall data protection framework, of course.
We were promised by the German Presidency that such an instrument would be adopted this year.
Is the Portuguese Presidency actively progressing that, and what are the main blockages?
The Council and the Member States need to get on with practical cooperation of policing within a firm data protection framework.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The Portuguese Presidency is operating in this area in an ambitious but also realistic manner.
When considering the measures taken or that we are proposing to take, we always look at the starting point and our intended destination and, in fact, on this matter of police cooperation, I think that we have made remarkable and considerable progress in relation to our starting point.
Perhaps not all the progress that many would like to see, but something has been done and is being done if the Member States so desire.
The Portuguese Presidency will therefore support, develop and implement the measures that were agreed and that in our view represent positive progress in police cooperation in relation to the previous situation.
Subject: Ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate of Constantinople
Numerous events are indicative of the Turkish authorities' attempts to call into question the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
The Foreign Minister, for example, has expressly ruled out recognition by the Turkish Government of the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
Furthermore, Turkish officials have been prohibited from attending a reception given by the Patriarchate of Constantinople because the invitation refers to the Patriarch as ecumenical.
Moreover, the new national security policy of Turkey states that 'any attempt to overstep the current status of the Patriarchate must be deterred' and, finally, on 26 June 2007, the Turkish Supreme Court ruled that the Patriarchate of Constantinople is not ecumenical and that the Patriarch is head of the Greek Orthodox community of Istanbul.
Will the Council say whether the position of the Turkish authorities in regard to the Patriarchate of Constantinople is consistent with the Copenhagen political criteria and Turkey's obligations under the pre-accession process?
What immediate representations will it make to the Turkish authorities?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The Council has repeatedly stressed the importance it attaches to the issue of religious freedom in Turkey.
Religious minorities and communities are still encountering difficulties linked to legal personality, property rights, schools, internal management and training, residence permits and work permits concerning Turkish and non-Turkish clergy in addition to the possibility of foreign clergy being elected leaders of their religious communities.
The specific problems facing the Orthodox Patriarchate, in particular the use of the ecclesiastical title of Ecumenical Patriarch, must also be examined in that context.
That situation should not affect the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights.
Religious freedom is a fundamental area in which tangible progress needs to be made as a matter of urgency; it also requires specific action for the adoption and implementation of appropriate legislation in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights.
More specifically, one of the short-term priorities in relations between the European Union and Turkey is the adoption of legislation that is in accordance with the relevant European standards and provides a response to all the difficulties encountered by minorities and non-Muslim religious communities.
Similarly, social tolerance needs to be developed.
In that context, I can reassure the honourable Member that the issue of religious freedom will continue to be closely monitored, as part of the accession negotiations in the context of Chapter 23, Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, and of the ongoing process of reforms in Turkey, and will be broached at all levels whenever relevant.
That was the case at the last Ministerial Troika meeting between the European Union and Turkey held in Ankara on 4 June.
(EL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, in the two and a half minutes during which you have spoken, you have confirmed the problem that I put to you in my question, but you have not adopted a clear position.
On 22 August Commissioner Rehn, speaking on behalf of the Commission, said that the Patriarch and the Patriarchate had to be free to use the ecclesiastical title 'Ecumenical' and added that Turkey had to ensure that non-Muslim communities could acquire legal status.
Does the Council share this unequivocal position adopted by the Commission?
If so, why do you not say so clearly?
If not, what are the reasons?
Who has made you so reticent?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr Papadimoulis, I think that, as regards questions of human rights in our relations with Turkey, the Presidency and the Council have been clear, demanding and firm both now and in the past, as they will also be in the future.
I think, therefore, it is perhaps inappropriate to express doubts, reservations or scepticism on this matter.
We shall maintain our stance in our talks with Turkey, notably in the process of negotiations on Turkey's accession to the EU.
(DE) We have discussed this many times before during Question Time, and I should like to ask when Turkey's law on religion will actually be adopted.
We were assured of this over a year ago, and nothing has happened.
This is a very specific point relevant not only to the country's accession negotiations but also to its compliance with the political Copenhagen criteria.
The State does not have the right to interfere in the internal affairs of a church and arbitrarily deprive it of any legal status.
As the honourable Member knows, there is a kind of annual review of the process of Turkey's accession to the EU.
That review, or stock-taking of the process, takes place in the second half of each year and entails an analysis of and debate on all these issues on the basis of Commission reports.
That will take place again this year during the Portuguese Presidency and will provide a suitable opportunity, the right opportunity, moreover, for those issues to be debated - as they will be - by the Council.
As the author is not present, Question No 10 lapses.
Subject: Outcome of the EU-Brazil summit
Could the Council give its assessment of the EU-Brazil summit held on 4 July 2007, in particular the economic and trade relations dimension?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As you know, the EU-Brazil summit was held in Lisbon on 4 July with a view to launching a bilateral strategic partnership to enhance cooperation between the two parties in a wide range of areas of common interest.
A joint declaration was approved covering various areas in which our bilateral relations should be strengthened and it was agreed that this partnership with Brazil should be operational and forward-looking.
The EU and Brazil worked together to draw up an action plan containing practical, joint, coordinated proposals on issues that will help to formulate a common agenda.
The interesting debate covered bilateral relations between the European Union and Brazil, regional issues, in particular developments in Europe and Latin America, but also world issues such as the Doha Development Agenda, effective multilateralism, climate change, combating poverty and social exclusion plus energy-related matters.
As regards trade relations, although the Lisbon summit was not the appropriate forum for technical negotiations, there was an interesting exchange of views.
The Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson, repeated that obtaining positive results in the Doha Development Round was, and would continue to be a priority for the EU.
Despite the disappointing results of the recent G4 Group meeting in Potsdam, talks continued in Geneva and no one wanted to miss the opportunity to reach an ambitious, balanced and comprehensive agreement.
Brazil thought that the two negotiating positions were not so wide apart.
Continuing debate and closer coordination would make it possible to reach an agreement.
Both parties concurred that reaching an agreement in Doha would help to conclude an agreement between the EU and Mercosul.
On the subjects of climate change and energy, both parties referred to the International Conference on Biofuels held on 5 and 6 July in Brussels, as a step in the right direction to allay criticisms that the use of biofuels was allegedly harmful.
In this context the President of the Commission, JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, mentioned three essential areas: the setting of joint technical standards for a sustainable international market in biofuels, biofuels as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving security of food supply.
President Lula in turn linked the debate on climate change to reducing pollution, stating that the combined energy approach followed in Brazil over the past 20 years had proved to be more environmentally friendly and environmentally sound than the EU's high-technology engines.
Furthermore, he refuted the allegations of threats to the Amazon forest and to security of food supply.
Thank you very much for the comprehensive outline of the range of interests that were discussed.
Clearly, agriculture was amongst them, but could I ask whether the controversial issue of beef exports from Brazil to the European Union was raised, as well as the concerns about standards in relation to those, and if there is common ground on the WTO - the Doha Round - between the two parties?
Was the issue of double standards - the higher standards within the European Union, compared with those countries outside and specifically, in this case, Brazil - raised as part of the talks?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The summit was, as mentioned here, an initiative of the Portuguese Presidency; it was the first summit meeting held with Brazil and will, we hope, lead to the development of strategic relations with that country.
That was a first initiative.
It was intended to identify those areas and sectors where we should like to develop closer relations with Brazil.
Economic issues were broached, but you will understand that they were broached in a more general and strategic context, focusing in particular upon issues that are on the agenda within the scope of the talks in the Doha negotiating process.
Clearly, more specific questions will need to be approached at a more technical and more appropriate level.
In the meantime trade issues in general and the concerns which both the EU and Brazil have regarding those issues were approached with great openness and frankness, with each party expressing its points of view and expressing the hope that the Doha negotiating process can be brought to a successful conclusion.
I take that answer as a 'no' to Mrs McGuinness' question; that you did not trouble to press the Brazilian authorities about the lamentable health standards pertaining to their beef exports and the total lack of traceability in respect of their livestock herds.
It will come as a grave disappointment to farming and consumer interests across Europe that, when you had the opportunity, you failed to press this all-important issue.
When is the Council going to wake up to the health implications for the citizens of Europe and press Brazil for realistic traceability in respect of their livestock?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I think that, with the launching of this initiative by the Portuguese Presidency, all the conditions are now in place for an open and frank debate with Brazil on all the issues that could disrupt our bilateral relations, but also on all those that could develop and strengthen those relations.
I also think that, on matters where the EU and Brazil might hold differing views, the summit and the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency is an extremely useful tool for opening and extending the frank discussion needed on issues where the positions of the two parties do not, perhaps, fully coincide.
Subject: EU assistance to Estonia regarding agreements on fisheries with Russia on Lake Peipsi
The Council is undoubtedly aware that 126 kilometres of the EU-Russia border run along Lake Peipsi.
Estonian-Russian bilateral agreements have coordinated the protection of Peipsi's sensitive ecosystem and fish stocks.
However, the evidence of danger to the fish stocks caused by Russian disregard for agreements has been accumulating.
Particularly, the Danish seine is used by the Russian side almost all year, instead of during the very limited period agreed.
Russian markets offer reliable evidence that the Russian official measures are inadequate to protect undersized Peipsi fish of several varieties.
The Russian side has delayed the negotiations for the 2007 autumn season under various pretexts.
What does the Council intend to do to assist the EU Member State Estonia in what are essentially negotiations between the EU and Russia on quotas and their management in the future?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) In reply to the honourable Member's question on negotiations between the EU and Russia on quotas and their management in the future, the Council would like to stress that, although the Common Fisheries Policy specifically covers the conservation, management, and exploitation of living aquatic resources, Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy defines 'living aquatic resources' as 'available and accessible living marine aquatic species, including anadromous and catadromous species during their marine life';
Furthermore, on 28 July 2006 the European Community and the Government of the Russian Federation initialled a bilateral agreement on cooperation in fisheries and the conservation of the living marine resources in the Baltic Sea.
That agreement is due to be signed and come into force in the near future as soon as the Russian Federation has completed its domestic procedures for signature.
That agreement covers all the waters of the Baltic Sea and its straits, but excludes internal waters.
Notwithstanding the geographical area of application of the agreement, Article 13 provides that the Parties may agree to extend cooperation on the management of anadromous and catadromous species, but excludes species which live their entire life cycle in internal waters.
Consequently, as Community law stands, the Council can only recommend that the honourable Member address her question to the European Commission, so that the matter is raised in the context of the bilateral agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Russian Federation as soon as that agreement enters into force.
(ET) But the reply as it relates to Lake Peipsi does not entirely satisfy me: in terms of size it is the third largest lake in the European Union and the only one where a professional fishing industry operates.
It is not a body of water internal to Estonia, but a border lake with a third country, namely Russia.
Where prudent exploitation of fish stocks is concerned Estonia, a Member State of the European Union, is doing everything in its power to ensure the conservation of stocks in Lake Peipsi.
The same cannot, however, be said for Russia.
As a result I would nevertheless like to hear from the President-in-Office how the Council proposes to influence Russia to conserve Lake Peipsi's fish stocks as Estonia is doing?
What sort of specific own responsibility are you able to propose here today as President of the European Union?
You mentioned the Commission but the reply which you gave was more concerned with seas.
Peipsi is a border lake whose situation is very specific, it is not an internal body of water.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The honourable Member wishes her question to stand and I, unfortunately, have to say that my answer also stands.
I would recommend, as I did at the end of my last speech, that the honourable Member address her question to the European Commission.
Subject: EU-Bosnia relations
Can the Council make a statement giving an up-to-date assessment of EU-Bosnian political relations at this time?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is in a very delicate phase.
The verdict of the International Court of Justice in the case brought at the end of February by Bosnia-Herzegovina against Serbia and Montenegro on the application of the Convention on Genocide, brought to the surface the antagonisms which seemed to have been to some extent assuaged following the setting up of the Council of Ministers on 9 February.
The EU told the Bosnian authorities that it feared that the deterioration of the political climate in the country, the return of nationalist rhetoric and lack of political will to reach an agreement were endangering the reform process.
Bosnia-Herzegovina needs to operate effectively as a single economic and administrative space in order to ensure progress for its citizens and on the path towards EU membership.
As regards relations with the EU and the stabilisation and association process, the technical talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement were concluded in December, all Member States having given full support to the result of the technical negotiations on that agreement on 3 May.
The conclusion of the talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is being held up by the lack of tangible progress on police reform.
The recently appointed High Representative/EU Special Representative, Miroslav LajÄak, who took up office at the beginning of July, set as his initial and immediate priorities, in line with the concerns of the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council and of the Council of the European Union, the creation of a constructive political climate and the restructuring of the police force.
In that context the High Representative/EU Special Representative is confident that progress can be achieved by the end of this month.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response.
Rather than go through every single issue, I will concentrate on the question of police reform because this is the most urgent matter at the present time.
Are there any proposals from the Council with regard to putting together a team of facilitators to allow the different traditions in Bosnia-Herzegovina to come together to agree a common standard or common code for how the police force should work?
It already exists in the border protection area but not on the police side.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Thank you for your question, suggestion and opinion.
We are naturally eagerly waiting with great interest to hear what proposals the new Special Representative will present on this matter of reform of the police force in Bosnia-Herzegovina under this chapter of police cooperation.
If they took the form of an item raised by the Special Representative with the Council and of a solution or suggestion from the High Representative - who is working directly on this case which, as you rightly said, is fundamental for the stability of Bosnia-Herzegovina - if such a proposal were made and submitted to us, naturally the Council would consider it.
We think any suggestions, means and proposals that might be of real help in achieving the final and fundamental objective of stability and progress in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be taken into account.
Questions Nos 14, 15 and 16 have been withdrawn.
As the author is not present, Question No 17 lapses.
Subject: The European Court of Auditors
The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 significantly changed the EU's institutional framework, incorporating into it the European Court of Auditors (Article 7 of the Treaty).
By making the Court of Auditors one of its fundamental institutions, the Union demonstrated the importance it attached to transparency and the need to improve its work.
The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe also changed the institutional framework, excluding from it the Court of Auditors, which then came under 'other institutions and advisory bodies' in Title IV, Chapter II of the Treaty.
The ongoing work on a new treaty does not involve plans to amend the 'institutional framework', resulting in a deterioration of the status of the European institutions' external auditor.
Given that the Union should be improving its accountability to citizens, can the Council explain its decision to lower the status of the Court of Auditors?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) This question will probably receive the fastest answer this session because it is not, in fact, within the Council's brief to comment on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference for the reform of the Treaties which, as we know, began on 23 July 2007.
(PL) Mr President, it really does seem to me that this is very much a question for the Council to raise, especially as we are currently talking about a new treaty that is set to revolutionise the new European Union, and placing the Court of Auditors in the section 'other institutions and advisory bodies' is a clear downgrading of this institution in terms of how it is viewed by citizens.
The control function of the Court of Auditors is not just based on monitoring expenses and checking whether our common funds - the European Union's public funds - have been properly distributed; it is the watchdog for budgetary discipline throughout the European Union, including in the Council, Parliament and the European Commission.
Its recommendations and judgments help us all in our work.
The strong position of the Court of Auditors must be clear and evident to all EU citizens, as it is also the institution that confirms citizens' trust in the EU as a whole.
If you do not think that this is a matter for the Council, then I should like to know who it is a matter for, because the Council's remit - and the remit of the work currently being carried out - also includes the matter of locating the Court of Auditors in the right place, and in my view the right place is where all the most important EU institutions can be found (I am talking about the new treaty that we are currently engaged in drafting).
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Naturally I took note of your concerns and comments, but I am here as the representative of the Council.
The Council as such is not empowered to comment on the subject of the Intergovernmental Conference where the Member States sit round a table to discuss given items precisely in their capacity as Member States, that is, independent sovereign states acting completely independently as Member States.
The Council therefore has no competence to comment on that subject.
The Intergovernmental Conference does, however, have its own bodies, its own structures and presidency and naturally due note will be taken, if you so wish, of any suggestions, criticisms and advice you wish to offer on expediting the work within the Intergovernmental Conference.
However, the Council of the European Union as such is not, as I say, entitled to comment on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference in view of the judicial nature of that Conference.
As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 19 and 20 lapse.
Subject: Demarcation between Schengen and non-Schengen Member States
Taking into account the statements from both the Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern and the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who stated that both countries needed to end the demarcation between Schengen and non-Schengen Member States, and in view of the Portuguese Presidency's priorities in relation to Schengen, can the Council comment on how it intends to open further border controls and cooperation between Schengen and non-Schengen Member States before the end of the Presidency?
At its meeting on 12 and 13 June 2007 the Council asked the Portuguese Presidency to adhere to the timetable for Schengen Information System evaluation visits, with a view to adopting by November 2007 the decisions referred to in Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession with regard to those Member States which acceded to the European Union in 2004 and were given until the end of December 2007 to end border controls at internal land borders and at maritime borders, and until March 2008 at the latest for air borders, as soon as all the conditions were met.
With regard to Ireland and the United Kingdom, Article 4 of Protocol 2 of the Treaty of Amsterdam incorporating the Schengen acquis within the scope of the European Union states that Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which are not bound by the Schengen acquis, may at any time request to take part in some or all of the provisions of this acquis.
Those Member States have not to date asked to apply the provisions in the Schengen acquis concerning the abolition of control of persons at internal borders.
Since Ireland and the United Kingdom have not made any such request, the Council Presidency can do little with regard to this matter.
Thank you for your reply.
There have been statements by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, and the Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern, that both countries needed to end the demarcation between Schengen and non-Schengen.
However, in your reply you say that no formal request has been received from either country.
Has there been any informal request or approach from either the UK or Ireland on this issue, and can you outline for me, if possible, how it might be possible to apply part of the Schengen acquis, rather than all of it?
I cannot add anything on this question to what I said in my initial contribution.
Naturally the Schengen Agreement contains its own provisions and articles on the application and scope of application of the agreement, and we must abide by those articles and provisions.
Subject: Establishment of EU-Israel Subcommittee on Human Rights
In November 2005 the EU-Israel Subcommittee on Political Dialogue and Cooperation established an EU-Israel human rights working group.
Will the Council consider upgrading the EU-Israel human rights working group into a subcommittee on human rights which would meet more regularly than the working group (which up to February 2007 had met on only two occasions) and which could hold regular and systematic consultations with civil society in Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories and the EU to assess the human rights situation in Israel and the OPT?
President-in-Office of the Council (PT). - The EU-Israel human rights working group, set up at the meeting of the EU-Israel Subcommittee on Political Dialogue and Cooperation on 21 November 2005, is the platform which makes it possible to make a regular, systematic and in-depth analysis as well as for both parties to debate human rights issues, as the honourable Member wishes, and as the Council itself wishes.
Moreover, human rights is a constant theme at all levels of the ongoing political contact between the EU and Israel.
Civil society organisations, as mentioned in the honourable Member's question, are already making a contribution to such exchanges.
Quite honestly, that is a non-answer.
I asked if the working group, which has met only twice since 2005, would be upgraded to a subcommittee on human rights.
After 40 years of occupation of the Palestinian territories, there are clearly persistent breaches of Palestinian human rights as a result of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.
I ask the Council to indicate what its attitude is to upgrading the human rights working group to a subcommittee, which would meet regularly and keep some kind of pressure on the Israeli authorities to comply with human rights norms, which we all expect civilised societies and democracies to comply with.
I should like to tell the honourable Member, as I said, that respect for and protection of human rights are constant themes in dialogue between the EU and third countries.
It is one of the Council's concerns and an ongoing and constant concern of the successive presidencies of the Council and that also applies to the Portuguese Presidency.
Portugal is particularly attentive to human rights, for its own historical reasons.
Only yesterday I had the opportunity to point out here to some honourable Members of the European Parliament that, since we ourselves had a dictatorship in Portugal until 1974, we are particularly sensitive to anything relating to democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
Those topics are particularly dear to our hearts and therefore feature in our dialogue with third countries, including Israel; we shall always include those points in the regular dialogue that we have with the Israeli authorities.
Subject: Situation in Zimbabwe
The political and economic situation in Zimbabwe has reportedly assumed 'life-threatening proportions'.
The police have arrested more than 1 300 shop keepers and managers who refused to halve the price of their products, as President Mugabe's government had instructed.
Halving prices has led to panic buying at large chains of stores.
Essentials such as sugar, cooking oil and bread are now obtainable only on the black market.
Petrol stations are dry.
According to eye witnesses, many shops have been looted by government party supporters.
Inflation - the highest in the world - is the result of the never-ending printing of money with which the Government pays civil servants, police officers and soldiers.
According to the opposition party MDC, the Government is attempting, nine months ahead of the presidential elections, to secure the votes of the poor.
Representatives of the Zanu-PF government party are reported to have dismissed a request by South African President Mbeki to go to Pretoria.
What is the position of the Council?
Will it call on the Government to shoulder its responsibilities in the crisis to a greater extent?
The Council is closely monitoring the critical political and economic situation in Zimbabwe.
The Council debated this issue at its meeting on 23 April 2007 and obtained further information on the problem at its meeting on 22 July, therefore very recently.
The Council's strategy has been public knowledge ever since the restrictive measures were first introduced.
In 2002 the Council decided to introduce restrictive measures against Zimbabwe's leaders declaring that, as long as human rights continued to be violated the Council would deem it necessary to maintain restrictive measures against the Zimbabwe Government and against those responsible for such violations, and for infringement of the right to freedom of opinion, association and peaceful assembly.
Furthermore, the Council stated that such measures would be revoked only when the conditions were in place to guarantee respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.
In response to the recent acts of violence and violation of human rights, on 23 April the Council decided to extend the visa ban list.
Since the introduction of the restrictive measures the Council has tried to involve the Africa's multilateral institutions.
The Council has systematically included the question of Zimbabwe on the agenda for all ministerial meetings organised with SADC ever since the measures were introduced.
The EU also raised the question of Zimbabwe with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
The Council praised in particular the initiative of SADC and the mandate given to President Mbeki to facilitate dialogue between the opposition and the Government, as well as the appointment of Mr Kikwete as Chair of the SADC organ.
The Council is looking forward to seeing the first results of these African initiatives; if appropriate it will review its position accordingly.
(NL) Mr President, the situation in Zimbabwe is gradually becoming hopeless - and that is putting it mildly.
Sadly, the international community, including the EU, is standing by helplessly.
I should like to put a brief supplementary question to the Council, as the Portuguese Presidency is organising an EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon on 8 and 9 December.
This has not been possible in recent years, as agreement could not be reached on the issue of whether or not to invite President Mugabe.
My question is very specific, and I expect a similarly specific reply: is the Presidency intending to invite President Mugabe to Lisbon in December?
Secondly, in what way is the Council hoping to raise the situation in Zimbabwe at the Summit?
As I said, the EU has been closely monitoring the situation in Zimbabwe and has taken the measures it considers most appropriate in that respect.
In turn the European Council has always made it understood in the conclusions of its meetings that it is of strategic importance for the European Union to keep up a global, comprehensive and detailed dialogue with Africa as a whole.
It is that mandate, which we are given by the European Council, which reflects the interest in and the commitment to this global dialogue which we must hold with the African countries because we have much to discuss, but also to cooperate on, with Africa.
It is with that objective and that intention that the Portuguese Presidency is determined to conduct the second EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December.
We are convinced that that Summit is in our interest and in the interest of the other Member States, in the interest of the EU and also of Africa.
With Africa we have to discuss immigration, the economy, trade, energy, the climate, and also naturally human rights and good governance, subjects which we have already been discussing and which were also debated and discussed at the first Summit held in Cairo in 2000 during Portugal's previous Presidency.
It is an objective which we set for our Presidency and it is an objective which we intend to continue to work towards in close cooperation with our partners, both within the EU and also in Africa.
Subject: North European Gas Pipeline
During the German EU Presidency, a representative of that country stated that 'Nord Stream' was a project involving private companies and over which the EU had no influence.
On 15 July 2007, in an interview given to Lithuanian television, the German Foreign Minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, stated that Nord Stream was not a German and Russian project but a trans-European project.
The EU would oppose the project if Lithuania's energy and ecological interests were damaged.
What is the opinion of the Portuguese Presidency on the matter?
Is Nord Stream a private project or an EU project?
What is its place in the future common EU energy policy?
With regard to the points raised by the honourable Member and to the first question, the Council would point out that it does not comment on reports in the media.
Secondly, and in reply to the second question, the Council would remind the honourable Member that the 'Nord Stream' project is a private project being carried out by 'Nord Stream AG' as a joint venture.
Moreover, as the Council mentioned in its answer to Oral Question by Nils Lundgren on the Russo-German gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea, the development of a pipeline between Russia and Germany through the Baltic Sea was declared a project of European interest in Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.
For a more detailed explanation of that declaration, the Council would refer the honourable Member to the answer to that question.
On the third question, the Council would point out that the construction of a new gas pipeline in the north of Europe along that route is in accordance with the objective of the European Union's energy policy to improve the Community's security of supply.
Effective diversification of energy sources and transport routes was mentioned in the European Council's Community action plan of March 2007 as one of the means of improving security of supply.
The Community acquis will always be applied in its entirety whenever necessary, including in particular Community legislation on the environment, to those parts of the gas pipeline built within the territory of the EU Member States.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) On this question, I do not have much to add to what I said in my first answer, that is specifically to repeat our promise that the Community acquis will be applied in its entirety whenever necessary and always when environmental questions are at issue.
I hope, therefore, that our statement allays and provides a response to the concerns which the honourable Member expressed.
Subject: Mordechai Vanunu sentenced to six months in prison
On 2 July 2007, Mordechai Vanunu - a former nuclear technician and a pacifist for over 20 years - was sentenced by the Jerusalem Magistrates' Court to six months in prison for (according to the Israeli authorities) breaching the terms of an administrative order restricting his freedom of speech and freedom of movement.
Vanunu was abducted in Rome and transferred to Israel, where he was imprisoned and accused of high treason for having spoken to the Sunday Times about Israel's nuclear weapons programme.
He was tried in camera and sentenced to 18 years in prison, 11 of which were to be spent in solitary confinement.
On his release from prison in 2004, significant restrictions were placed (pursuant to the above-mentioned order) on his freedom: in particular, he was denied any contact with people from countries other than Israel and he was not allowed to approach embassies and consulates, own a mobile telephone, access the Internet or leave Israel.
What action is the Council intending to take vis-Ã -vis the Israeli authorities in response to these violations of the fundamental rights of free speech and free movement?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) As may be seen from our answers to questions,, and, the Council is following with interest the case of Mordechai Vanunu, especially his situation following his release in 2004, mentioned by the honourable Member in her question.
Subject: Progress on the Temporary Agency Workers Directive
What are the results of the initial consultations undertaken by the Portuguese Presidency with a view to seeking agreement on the draft Temporary Agency Workers Directive?
Does the President-in-Office expect to put the amended proposal for a directive to a vote in the Council during the current Presidency, and which timetable has he set down for informal and formal negotiations in relation to this?
I should like to tell you that, as a result of preliminary consultations with the Member States, the Portuguese Presidency decided to reopen the debates on the proposal for a directive on temporary agency workers, which it regards as an important element in the debate on flexicurity.
Since this dossier has not been examined by the Council since 2004, it is important to take stock of the current stage reached and to reflect upon the possible courses to be followed.
The Presidency will shortly be taking measures to that end.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for the warm words that he gave.
Indeed, flexicurity is a good principle, as we say in this Chamber and in the European institutions.
However, many people say that flexibility we see a lot of, but where is the security?
The Temporary Agency Workers Directive remains a real test of whether there is to be that security aspect.
I wonder what the President-in-Office thinks are the blockages at the moment, within the European Council of Ministers, that are preventing progress being made.
Despite the good offices of the Presidency, how confident is he that the Council will indeed be able to reach agreement during the term of office of our Portuguese colleagues?
I thank the honourable Member for his question.
As I indicated, this is a dossier that the Portuguese Presidency wants to work on and take forward.
We have always said that the success of a presidency depends in the first place on the presidency itself, but that it must also rely on the commitment, cooperation and will to move forward of all the Member States.
This is one case which we could not possibly bring to a safe harbour, so to speak, without all the Member States on our side.
We should be pleased if, during the Portuguese Presidency, we could at least make significant progress even if we cannot reach full agreement.
We shall work towards that in the hope, as I said, that our partners will be able to accept our suggestions and proposals, whilst also taking a realistic approach to this question, because we know that this is a complex debate and a complex issue, as the history of this Directive shows.
As regards flexicurity, I can tell you that for Portugal and for this Portuguese Presidency flexicurity means flexibility but also security and for us the two go together.
Thank you very much.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.

Human rights dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the functioning of the human rights dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries.
rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, the birth of the European Union was inspired by inalienable values.
In the same way that we keep a close watch on our Member States to make sure that they do not violate the right to freedom, or to life, or to democracy, we must have a decisive influence through dialogue on those countries with whom we have political, trade, economic or partnership relations, etc., so that they also respect human rights.
Within the complexity and magnitude of the EU's external relations, the space occupied by dialogue and human rights consultations with third countries could go unnoticed or remain in the background.
If that were the case, and we were to allow it, we would be making a very serious mistake.
This report deals with the aspects that are necessary to improve a task that is an EU obligation, according to EU Article 11 of the EU Treaty, and which also comes under political ethics.
Human rights should be the banner of EU external policy and the EU should use its influence to improve the living conditions of people in the countries with which it has relations.
This is one of the key political elements in this report.
When we sit down to negotiate economic or trade agreements with a country in which fundamental rights are violated, we cannot put figures, agreements and contracts on the table while shamefully brushing under the carpet the situation that its citizens are going through.
If we leave human rights outside the negotiating room, we will be falling into the most macabre cynicism.
We also need to take a close look at the role played by civil society and human rights defenders, significant voices that are essential for progress in all oppressed societies.
The report we are debating today evaluates one of the main instruments that the European Union has for achieving the objectives I have mentioned and also for clearly defining the role that we want to play in the world order.
It is only through respect and reciprocity that we can make progress in the task of promoting human rights.
There is absolutely no question of acting through imposition and paternalism.
We are not in a position to give lectures to anyone, but we do have an obligation to maintain consistency in our external actions and to promote relations with those countries that are making progress, avoiding imbalances and Ã  la carte treatment that undermine our credibility.
The report that I am presenting to this House calls for action on three levels: more consistency in conducting dialogues and consultations, which will require greater coordination between the Council, whose absence from this debate I regret, the Commission and Parliament, using a mechanism to facilitate smooth communication and avoid contradictions between the various Community institutions.
It is about us really speaking with one clear voice.
It is also about transparency in the management of dialogues and consultations which, in the field of human rights, should be a principle, not an exception.
The flexibility and pragmatism required in order to achieve specific results should not obscure the picture regarding the agenda, objectives or the result of dialogue.
We are calling for the European Parliament's role to be strengthened, which, ladies and gentlemen, is what is really lacking in the management of this instrument, without there being any legal or formal justification for this.
The European Parliament is prepared to act responsibly in the area of its external powers.
This House has established itself as the key European institution in the field of human rights, making them its focus, and it is resolved to use every method available to it to carry out its role as the political guarantor of the external action of the Union.
The European Parliament urges the Commission and the Council to listen to and put into practice the recommendations of this report, which are widely supported by all the political groups in this House.
Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's voice must be heard.
We know that what we are asking for will require a great deal of effort, and we are therefore considering the need to extend the resources allocated to human rights units, both in the Commission and in the Council, the latter not being present at this debate.
However, this is the minimum requirement for a European Union that claims to uphold before the world that human rights are an inalienable European right.
If we want to be credible, we need to work together towards this.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the report prepared by the rapporteur, Ms Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco, and the resolution before Parliament address a highly important but also increasingly complex instrument of the European Union's external human rights policy.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner (who regrets not to be able to attend this debate today) had accordingly instructed her services to lend every support to the rapporteur in her difficult task of scrutinising the functioning of the human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries.
The report adds a further building block to Parliament's remarkable work in assessing the EU toolbox on human rights, through its regular annual reports, the Agnoletto report on human rights clauses, the study of the European Inter-University Centre on the impact of Parliament's activities in the field of human rights, as well as the study on the guidelines on torture.
The report also usefully complements the regular review of the human rights dialogues and consultations undertaken by the Council and by the Commission.
The Commission would like to compliment the rapporteur and Parliament on its report and the detailed analysis and recommendations devoted to the European Union's human rights dialogues and consultations.
The Commission takes the view that, of all human rights instruments at our disposal, it is the dialogues that probably provide the best chance to secure positive, long-term results in the development of the respect for human rights worldwide, as long as we are prepared to invest sufficient time and energy in them.
We firmly believe that the European Union can obtain success in advancing the human rights record of third countries only through patient work of bridge-building and persuasion, and this not just in its bilateral relations but also in the framework of multilateral bodies, as developments in the Human Rights Council demonstrate.
The great variety and number of European Union human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries - which, moreover, are steadily increasing - make any global evaluation very arduous.
Structured dialogues, such as with China; agreement-based dialogues like those with many neighbourhood countries; consultations with like-minded partners, such as with the US and Canada, or local troika dialogues with a range of countries all differ in many respects, be it their periodicity, the policy level, the kind of interlocutors, the depth of the discussions or the fact that some are combined with civil society events and others are not.
Far from being a shortcoming of the instrument, the Commission sees such variety as proof of the dynamism and potential of the dialogue instrument and an asset that should be preserved.
The EU guidelines on human rights dialogues and the Cotonou (ACP-EU) Agreement both stress the importance of flexibility to take into account the different country situations, their evolution over time and the dynamic relationships between any given third country and the European Union.
Therefore, while keeping common base lines and targets for the dialogue, it would not be advisable to strictly align all their modalities.
For this instrument to be effective it needs to be tailor-made and able to adapt to changing circumstances.
It also needs to be borne in mind that the various dialogues and consultations are in different stages of maturity.
The dialogue with China or the consultations with like-minded countries have developed more or less consolidated modalities over several years and therefore allow for rather intensive, deep discussions.
In other cases, such as the dialogues with neighbourhood countries, we are still polishing the instrument and are in the phase of building up the necessary confidence to allow for genuinely meaningful exchanges.
We are therefore confident that, also in these cases, issues such as the desirable participation of experts from line ministries, involvement of civil society or the consideration of individual cases will eventually become possible once the exercise finds its own solid ground.
Finally, you can rest assured that the recommendations directed at the Commission will be examined carefully, and you can count on our commitment to improve the information to Parliament in order to allow for increased transparency of human rights dialogues and consultations.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for her report.
I am pleased that she has taken such full account of the recommendation I made in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
Particular attention needs to be paid to the role of women in human rights dialogues with third countries where their health and safety is concerned.
Human rights include the right of women to make decisions concerning their lives and reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence.
Sadly, human rights dialogues still take insufficient account of this.
on behalf of the PPE-DE. - (RO) Madam President, on behalf of the European People's Party I welcome the drawing up of this report which is of major importance for the future of EU dialogue and consultations with third countries and for the role of the European Parliament.
Above all, the European Union is a union of democratic values promoting peace, tolerance and respect for human rights.
Therefore, it is crucial that any dialogue started and carried out with third countries focuses on the need to guarantee and protect fundamental freedoms and human rights, not only in Europe but in the whole world.
This report aims at proposing solution for improving the operation of EU dialogue and consultations with third countries in the field of human rights.
Therefore, the report focuses on 3 concepts for enhancing efficiency: dialogue and consultation coherence, transparency and visibility.
The more active involvement of the European Parliament in this process is also important.
I think that the European Parliament has a legitimate right to take part in this dialogue, to perform the democratic scrutiny that is assigned to it by the European citizens.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the kindness analysing within the report the dialogue with neighbouring countries located in the eastern EU.
A major priority of European Union foreign policy is the creation of a real democratic area on our eastern border and dialogue on human rights should be considered as a very important instrument.
The creation of joint subcommissions for human rights would be an important step, for neighbouring countries as well, where a continuous deterioration of human rights is occurring.
I would like to focus on one thing, even if it is not part of the neighbourhood policy.
Russia is another Eastern partner that should finally accept that a direct dialogue in the field of human rights cannot cause but a better life of its own citizens.
I do not want to conclude without mentioning with satisfactory coverage of women's rights within this report.!
Madam President, the report by Mrs Valenciano concerns an essential aspect of European values: the human rights dialogue.
This dialogue, mentioned in various agreements with many countries and in various instruments, is in a way the signature of the soft power that is Europe.
This report was the subject of a vast consensus.
Today, the only amendments that remain were presented by the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group on the extreme right.
Curiously, all these amendments are signed by my compatriots, members of Vlaams Belang.
But what does this group, which recently made itself rather conspicuous in Brussels by supporting a demonstration against Islam that was banned by the authorities, actually want?
This is quite interesting.
Firstly, they want to restrict human rights to civil and political rights and are removing social, environmental, economic and cultural rights from the text.
While invoking the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, they neglect to say that at the same time, the same UN General Assembly voted in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which they are quick to forget about.
Secondly, they are proposing to link genital mutilation, early marriage and trafficking in human beings with religious practices - undoubtedly Islam - which is a crude link to make.
No way!
These practices are reprehensible; they may be cultural, perhaps tribal, but they are criminal and are not in any way religious.
Finally, thirdly, the ITS has a go at Turkey in a tirade against the party of Messrs Erdogan and GÃŒl that singularly lacks any basis.
To conclude, the report by Mrs Valenciano is a remarkable report, open but at the same time very firm.
It is anything but angelic.
Just read paragraph 22, which states that human rights dialogue should always be backed up by diplomatic pressure at every level, and I am talking to the Council!
It is a pity that certain extremist groups are using it as a platform for their intolerance and hatred.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to commend Mrs Valenciano on her well-balanced report, and to thank her for being so obliging in incorporating many of the amendments presented by our committee.
The result is a clear, thorough report, which contains a number of good recommendations for strengthening the EU's human rights dialogues with third countries and promoting human rights and democracy.
The EU must enhance its role as a proactive actor when it comes to promoting human rights, and so I am pleased that the Council has taken the initiative in incorporating human rights into EU policy.
It is good that the European Parliament is advocating the systematic inclusion of human rights issues in the agenda of the EU's political dialogues and external policy.
It is only by systematising the dialogues that we can improve the use of benchmarks and bring coherence to endeavours to promote human rights.
However, the EU should not lay down such exacting requirements that the dialogue, drowning in requirements to report against indicators, forgets to pursue its original objectives.
Dialogue must be used to open up an engaging, confidence-inspiring political space that, rather than only ever identifying violations, also identifies progress in the human rights field.
We must recognise that the human rights dialogues face major challenges.
The human rights situation in a number of countries gives cause for concern.
It is crucial to the EU's relations with important trading partners that we attach increased importance to linking trading relations to human rights reforms.
Trade agreements with third countries should be seen as a tool with consequences reaching beyond the purely economic.
Environmental and human rights issues must be incorporated from the outset and be placed on an equal footing with economic issues.
The dialogue with third countries must help strengthen democratic, social, political and environmental rights, and therefore it should also be made clear that trade agreements must contain an unambiguous mechanism for how and when agreements can be suspended in the event that one trading partner fails to comply with human rights or democracy clauses.
There can be no doubt, however, that the greatest progress is achieved by giving third countries an incentive to comply with the political and economic requirements that form part of agreements.
We must strike a balance in bilateral dialogues, whereby we can still exert pressure but have reciprocity and genuine dialogue as a cornerstone.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, as I believe Mrs Valenciano has shown very clearly in her excellent report, we are overflowing with concrete proposals that will certainly be very useful to the Portuguese Presidency, as it has stated its aim to achieve tangible results on human rights and democracy.
We have for some time been calling for greater coherence, transparency and results in our discussions with third countries, jointly with the Commission and the Council.
All that remains is actually to go from words to action.
I am convinced that you know as well as I do that all it takes is organisation to make human rights dialogues more effective, beyond their diversity.
Firstly, this means setting up clear, public objectives assigned to each dialogue so that a coherent, shared strategy, appropriated at the highest level, emerges.
Secondly, it means setting up indicators to allow proper evaluation of the results achieved by a dialogue and informing MEPs of them so that, for example when a delegation visits the country, they can check what progress has been made and discuss it with civil society and human rights activists, to be better able to question their partners on the commitments made within the framework of the dialogue.
On this score, we are still waiting to be informed of the indicators that should be used to evaluate the dialogue recently established with Uzbekistan.
Thirdly, it means guaranteeing that human rights are taken into account in all the EU's external policies, including trade policy, migration policy and the fight against terrorism.
It is our credibility in talking about human rights that is at stake here.
For example, can anyone explain how we can currently be discussing the implementation of guidelines against torture with Jordan in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, the first subcommittee to be set up under the neighbourhood policy, today held up as a model, when we know that European Member States have covered up the subcontracting of torture by the CIA?
How can we be discussing torture and the fight against it in this subcommittee?
Our first job as MEPs is to evaluate the pertinence of the EU's action, and to do this, you can count on the delegations, the committees and the whole Parliament, which will continue to fight for its application every step of the way, whether it means launching, reorientating or, if necessary, stopping a dialogue.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Valenciano very much because one of the things her weighty report highlights is the steps that the European Union still has to take in consultations on human rights, and thus the fact that this is a work in progress for all of us.
I believe that her request for greater consistency and transparency for all is vital, as well as greater involvement by civil society in foreign policy.
Above all, it is important to confirm the end and not the beginning of a policy which in many cases is based on double standards.
Mrs Flautre, for example, referred to the issue of torture.
It also seems to me very important to plan greater coordination between the various bodies and to create subcommittees, and above all to step up cooperation with national parliaments and the European Commission's delegations across the world.
I believe, however, that in the issue of double standards what is important is the fact that even we, acting as the European Union, do not implement the agreements we sign.
I am thinking, for instance, of Article 2 of the association agreements.
I agree, however, on a point put by Mrs De Keyser on the amendments made.
We thank Mrs Valenciano for having accepted many of our amendments.
Those tabled are negative except for one amendment, which was tabled not by any group but by Mrs Flautre, concerning increased monitoring and a greater presence and coherence in post-electoral phases.
I also believe, as Mrs Valenciano says, that the Commission and the Council ought to increase Parliament's involvement in the political dialogue process, take into account our opinion and provide us with more information, more consistently, both during and after negotiations with third countries, as provided for in any case by Articles 21 and 24 of the Treaty.
I also believe that, in general, the response to this issue needs to involve not only the announcement of actions, but also an investment in staff, which is extremely important.
For example I recall, with sadness, a question put by the European Parliament recently: the Conference of Presidents rejected a request to have a committee on human rights with full powers.
I believe that this was a mistake, because it would have been an excellent opportunity to see and give an idea of the strength and capacity of mainstreaming.
Madam President, the rapporteur has produced a significant report.
The promotion of human rights in countries with which the EU has relations is a task it must perform responsibly.
Structured human rights dialogues are indeed of great importance in this regard.
Precisely because of this, and in connection with this report, it is sad to note that last May's Expert Seminar with China did not take place.
The maintenance of good Sino-European relations requires commitment on both sides, however.
Recent alarming reports by organisations such as Amnesty International, Psy, Human Rights in China and Compass Direct give me cause to question this commitment.
'Opponents', including religious minorities and journalists, are banished to psychiatric institutions for political ends.
The infamous Ankang system is a reality in China, particularly in the run-up to the Olympic Games.
That is most regrettable.
Therefore, I would ask the Council and the Commission to keep their fingers on the pulse with regard to the human rights situation in the Middle Kingdom.
Maintaining harmonious relations with the strategic partner that is the People's Republic of China is important, but not at all costs, so that practice joins theory with regard to the following words of the report: 'whereas human rights dialogues [...] constitute an essential part of the European Union's overall strategy aimed at promoting sustainable development, peace and stability.'
(SK) Firstly, I too would like to thank my fellow Member Mrs Valenciano for her work on a topic that represents the most important human rights tool and as such is very sensitive; unfortunately it does not often get the attention it deserves.
That is why I agree with the point of view expressed in this report, namely that more attention should be paid to the reforms implemented by partner states in matters of human rights and democracy.
I think that the European Union will have to do all in its power to develop a more efficient and unanimous response in the area of international cooperation and dialogue with third countries.
I am pleased that the report defends and endorses the systematic integration of the protection of the rights of women and children in all dialogues and consultations on human rights between the European Union and third countries.
As a rapporteur for the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I am working on a strategy relating to the rights of children.
In my report I stress the need for the individual provisions on children in armed conflicts to complement one other, and the need to take account of the Paris commitments to protect children from unlawful recruitment or use by armed forces or armed groups.
I would like to emphasise the need to step up the controls over the assistance provided by the European Union, for example as a part of humanitarian aid, in order to avoid the possibility of funds provided by the European Union for education or medical care for children being used to buy small light arms that can be used by children.
Dialogue must not be limited only to matters of democracy or protection of civic and political rights; it must also encompass those issues that directly concern the European Union, for example environmental issues or health protection issues.
It is important to set clear criteria for the initiation, suspension or termination of a political dialogue and to define the goals we want to achieve.
In order to achieve our goals we must engage in a dialogue and not just dictate something unilaterally to third countries; we must endeavour to establish constructive cooperation; and we must cooperate with local human rights organisations and with non-governmental organisations operating in the countries in question.
Additional EU financial support must be provided and it must be conditional on respect for human rights: payment of funds to countries where human rights are not observed must be stopped or suspended.
Madam President, the Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco report on promoting human rights and democracy remains a fundamental cornerstone of the EU and the common values that unite the 27 Member States.
It is also a key component externally in our strategic alliances beyond, in the wider 47-member-state Council of Europe, in our transatlantic partnership in NATO and with like-minded countries within the UN.
Inevitably, as the Union has progressed with more and more formal trade and political cooperation agreements, we have sought to impose a degree of fundamental human rights conditionality on our global partners - albeit it ad hoc and inconsistent at best - aided by a specific instrument, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, and supported by human rights dialogues and consultations when required.
The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), for which I am co-rapporteur for Parliament, aims at establishing a ring of neighbouring friends committed to a common area of peace, stability, security, full respect for human rights and democracy, freedom of the press, independence of the judiciary, the rule of law and prosperity.
ENP action plans build on the existing, legally binding under the Treaty, contractual frameworks - association agreements in the case of Euromed partners or partnership and cooperation agreements with former Soviet states - which typically include human rights and democracy clauses that are monitored so that, the closer the ENP partner country comes in terms of shared values, the greater the aid and trade cooperation granted by the EU.
These action plans are monitored by subcommittees as part of an ongoing dialogue.
Theoretically, at least, geopolitical considerations should play no part, but in fact realpolitik usually prevails in practice.
Who, for instance, would dare threaten the same degree of sanctions against the People's Republic of China, as mentioned by my colleague Mr Belder, over its serious lack of human rights and democracy as we did against Uzbekistan?
That is my case.
(Applause)
(PL) Madam President, may I begin by congratulating my colleague Elena Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco on preparing the report on the functioning of the human rights dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries.
Today's report concerns one of the European Union's most important policies.
As far as the European Parliament is concerned, human rights policy is the trademark of European policy.
Today's report deals with this area in an exceptionally profound and thorough way.
I wish to draw attention to the report's recommendations for the Council and the Commission.
First of all we are highlighting the need for increased interinstitutional coherence, to find ways of improving coordination among the different EU institutions (the Council, the Commission and Parliament). Human rights policy really must be coordinated at a general EU level.
We must put a stop to the practice whereby each of the most important EU institutions acts in this area in some sense, if I may use the phrase, on its own initiative.
Dialogue and consultation objectives should be based on the principle that human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent.
We recommend that the criteria to be established should encompass not only civil and political rights, but also economic, social, environmental and cultural rights.
The report emphasises the enhancement of the European Parliament's role in EU human rights policy.
This is a demand that reoccurs in every report accepted by this House in the area of human rights.
The demand is clear - the European Parliament must be at the centre of a system of the most important European institutions, in which EU human rights policy is concentrated, as it is the institution that derives from democratic elections and possesses a political moral right to take a fundamental interest in this matter.
We also consider it essential to increase the role of interparliamentary assemblies and interparliamentary delegations in human rights dialogues and consultations.
Finally, we insist that women's rights are an integral part of human rights and urge the Commission to include the promotion and protection of women's rights explicitly and systematically in all areas relating to human rights that fall within the European Union's remit.
(FR) Madam President, I would first like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano on this report, which combines courage and ambition and I support her in all her proposals.
Indeed, this report reaffirms the universality of human rights and anchors them as fundamental principles of the European Union's relations with third countries.
However, although it is important to affirm and reaffirm the universality of human rights today, it is just as important, and even high time, to shed another dogma of international politics, and this is the illusion we use too often to reassure ourselves, namely that economic development will lead to democratisation and the safeguarding of human rights.
The last few decades paint a different picture.
Indeed we must notice that there is a two-speed evolution going on: on the one hand, we are currently seeing rampant globalisation at the economic level, and on the other, the sudden surge in democratisation, which produced democracies in Europe, Latin America and East Asia at the end of the Cold War, seems to be running out of steam.
Instead, we should be noticing that all over the world, economic growth and authoritarian regimes often go together.
On the contrary, rapid economic growth even seems to give these regimes legitimacy and to contribute to the stabilisation of their power.
Today quite rightly we are focusing our interest and concern on the human rights situation in the large emerging countries such as China and Russia.
Do not be deceived, though: several of the countries that number among the most developed in the world - including some that are our economic allies - do not respect the fundamental rights of their citizens.
I am thinking particularly of Singapore, a country with a prosperous and modern economy, whose population benefits from all the advantages of a developed country except political freedoms, and more specifically, freedom of expression and assembly.
Madam President, if proof of this were still needed, it was given in a way that could not have been clearer by the behaviour of the Singapore authorities towards a delegation of MEPs from my group in April this year, a delegation of which I was a member.
The local authorities prevented us from speaking at a meeting with members of the Singapore liberal party under threat of arrest.
This experience, as disturbing as it may have been, was also very revealing and it once again confirmed to me that protecting human rights does not necessarily go hand-in-hand with economic development, and that the European Union, as it happens, cannot just make do with an economic approach towards the countries concerned.
On the contrary, the European Union should continue to play its role of defending human rights and to remind foreign leaders constantly that human rights are for all humans all over the world.
(PL) Madam President, the promotion of human rights is the main pillar of the European Union's external policy.
I agree with the rapporteur that the Council and the Commission should systematically incorporate human rights issues into the European Union's programme for political dialogue with third countries.
It would also be a good idea to ensure that human rights are more frequently incorporated into all areas of the Union's external policy, including the external aspects of its internal policy.
All available instruments should be used to achieve this aim.
In this respect I think it would be good to make more use of the European Parliament.
For example, the Council could send Parliament and the relevant committee six-monthly evaluations of each dialogue and consultation held, together with an explanation that places emphasis on trends in the progress of work, and not on individual results.
It would also be appropriate to introduce a routine consultation session involving Members of the European Parliament after each round of dialogue and consultation.
This would give Members the opportunity to take part in key decisions relating to the continuation or suspension of a specific dialogue.
I also think that it would be a good idea to include Members in the decision-making process on the instigation of a new dialogue and to inform them about the aim, forms or procedures for its institution.
I also consider that, in order to make their actions more effective, the Council and the Commission should incorporate recommendations and conclusions in Parliament resolutions, especially resolutions on human rights, into their dialogue agendas.
(ES) Madam President, in the space of a minute and a half I would like to summarise some of the fundamental ideas that have led us not only to support, but also to clearly champion this initiative, and of course to congratulate Elena Valenciano on her work and on the capacity for reaching consensus that she has demonstrated.
I would also like to welcome the presence and interest shown by Mr Borg, as well as the presence of Mr Mattisen, but at the same time I regret the fact that the first two seats belonging to the Council are empty.
I believe that the Council should have been present for this debate and as has already been said, this must be stated and reiterated.
The three topics that I think it is important to highlight, in any case, and which I would like to mention, are, firstly, the need, which we can never state strongly enough, to improve the consistency of these instruments, to reinforce the fact that we cannot, on the one hand, lament certain events, and on the other hand keep quiet when it suits our interests.
The second thing that I think is important, which has also been mentioned, but I would like to reiterate it, is the need for greater transparency in this type of mechanism, which requires increased participation by Parliament.
It has been said many times that we are completely surprised, for want of a better word and to put it mildly, at what is missing from many of these debates, not only simply in terms of participation, but also in terms of the information that we often require.
Last but not least, is the important role in this report of the 14 paragraphs dedicated to the role of women in human rights, and as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I would like to celebrate the fact that many of the amendments that we discussed and adopted in committee have been taken on board.
(Applause)
(NL) Madam President, the widely supported emphasis on human rights is relatively new.
Previously, this emphasis chiefly derived from socialist or liberal inspiration.
The left was mainly concerned with the right to housing, income, facilities, codecision, a healthy environment, peace and liberation from colonial occupation - and all this not only for those already enjoying the right to it, but particularly for all those not yet able, or insufficiently able, to exercise that right.
Liberals were chiefly concerned with individual freedoms and the right of entrepreneurship.
For some other political forces, human rights were less important.
Even now that there is greater agreement than before on the importance of human rights, there is still a gap between ideals and reality.
Acting out of self-interest, the richest, most democratic countries tend to prioritise support to regimes that guarantee supplies of gas and oil and attempt at domestic level to destroy the movements that conflict most with Western interests.
Applying double standards is an invitation to discredit justified criticism of some other countries as useless, arrogant interference.
The Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco report rightly points out that endlessly pursuing human rights dialogues with reluctant governments is not a valid objective, and that such dialogues must not be allowed to founder in a lack of transparency and democratic control.
This report enjoys a broad consensus; the suggested amendments primarily originate from three Flemish Members from the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group in the European Parliament.
The shortcomings they identify are mostly correct, but the wordings and deletions they suggest give the impression that this is not a matter of seeking solutions, but of being resigned to the lack of results.
It is an illusion to believe that Europe would be better to shut itself off from the rest of the world in order to guarantee peace and quiet, prosperity and security on its own territory.
Amendments that do not contribute to equality and democracy for all and to solidarity with the poor and hungry of the world will not have our support.
Madam President, we in the EU set great store by human rights.
We try to inspire the nations with which we interact to have a good level of human rights also.
Dialogue is an important starting-point, but in this dialogue we must be willing to risk even economic advantage in order to speak courageously and truthfully.
China comes into this report; we know of serious cases of political and religious persecution there.
Two years ago, in China, I met a psychiatrist who was chair of a disability organisation.
Proudly, he told me that they had almost no one with Down syndrome in his city of over 10 million people, because they were not allowed to live.
This discrimination against persons with disabilities requires forthright dialogue, regardless of the economics between the EU and China.
On the issue of trade relations, in bringing pressure to bear on a government to improve its human rights, we must be willing to take decisive action, but careful that such actions do not make the situation of the poor in the country even worse.
Madam President, I find the report of Ms Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco a comprehensive one, which clearly aims to strengthen and improve the European Union's extensive action on human rights dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries.
Tonight we speak about one of the most important human rights instruments available to the European Union for promoting human rights in our relations with third countries.
I appreciate the critical but also constructive way in which the challenges that the functioning of human rights dialogues has to face with regard to the overall perspective and interinstitutional cooperation are addressed by the rapporteur.
I fully endorse most of the recommendations put forward by the report and the resolution.
I would especially like to draw your attention to the need to increase transparency and to adopt indicators for given benchmarks in order to achieve practical results that could be supported by other EU foreign policy tools.
I strongly support the recommendation to control the specific benchmarks for the EU-China dialogue on human rights as well as the EU-Russia consultations, hoping to develop them soon into a structured dialogue in order to assess the usefulness of human rights dialogues.
It is important also to apply and use the results of human rights dialogues in projects under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights and systematically to link those two tools.
I fully support the recommendation that the role and involvement of the European Parliament in interparliamentary assemblies in human rights dialogues can, in the said countries, be enhanced in the future.
Last but not least, human rights must be the cornerstone of our political message, and it is crucially important to develop our message through consistency, transparency and the strong political commitment of all European institutions and the Member States.
Madam President, now that the eight-year long duel over the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor in Libya has ended, I feel we are badly in need of a sober assessment of the human rights situation in that country.
Ms Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco's report mentions the need to start a human rights dialogue with Libya.
I support the need for a dialogue within the Barcelona process.
However, let us be clear that we cannot forget or tolerate the fact that European citizens were abducted, tortured (as was acknowledged even by Colonel Gaddafi's son), kept in prison for eight years and subjected to a judicial process which was a farce, and then behave as if we should be grateful to, or reward, the Libyan side for letting them go in the end.
It has already vividly been reflected in the European media that this could turn into a case study for any dictatorship to focus attention and develop relations with the European Union.
Moreover, Libya started a campaign against the President of Bulgaria for having pardoned the nurses after they returned to Bulgaria, as if it expected that we would send them to prison straight from the airport.
On the basis of the European Commission agreement with Libya, Bulgaria had to underwrite USD 56 billion of Libyan debt for the Benghazi fund.
Other EU countries will spend even more.
However, once again, let us be clear that this humanitarian aid is being used politically by the Libyan regime to hide the truth and blame the West for a plot to deliberately infect Arab children.
This absurd accusation is still current.
Libya has not yet shown any intention of reform and we should not create the impression of applying double standards just because there is so much oil and gas in that country.
This is a test of the credibility of the European Union's human rights standards.
Madam President, this excellent report by Ms Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco brings together, in a comprehensive fashion, Parliament's analysis of the potential, but also unfulfilled potential, of the EU human rights dialogue.
We demand action from the Council, sadly absent this evening.
The EU's human rights strategy will never achieve optimum results without being organised in a systematic and coherent way, and without transparency and periodic review.
Of course our credibility on human rights depends on practising what we preach.
How can we urge countries like Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Morocco or Algeria to end torture, when we know that the United States subcontracted torture to them and that European countries colluded with that?
Instead of being credible, we become hypocritical.
Our own House must be cleaned.
The silence of the Council, since our report in February on extraordinary rendition, does not go unnoticed.
One of the strongest dialogues we should be having is with like-minded countries, and I therefore welcome paragraphs 115 and 116, which urge the EU to seek syllogies and share experiences while addressing human rights concerns with the US, Canada, Japan and New Zealand.
But, in the last six years, while concerns about the war on terror have been shared by most European citizens, we have had no robust action by the EU to secure transatlantic respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law.
Of course, I am not saying the US is the worst human rights defender in the world.
But it could be the model for human rights excellence and the tragedy is that the EU is not urging it in that direction.
The Council's torture guidelines say the EU will make dÃ©marches and issue public statements urging relevant third countries to undertake effective measures against torture and ill-treatment.
What dÃ©marches?
What public statements about abductions, torture, GuantÃ¡namo Bay?
There is just embarrassed silence.
Perhaps an article in this week's Economist magazine gives a clue.
Headlined 'Czechs with few mates', it explains how the Czech Republic, in its three years of EU membership, has earned a reputation for promoting human rights at every turn.
Great!
Right on!
Let us cheer!
However, reading on, I learn that inside the Brussels foreign policy machine, such concerns are an irritant.
EU diplomats apparently describe the Czech Republic as 'out on a limb', even 'unprofessional' - no doubt the most disdainful insult in the diplomat's armoury.
Silly young Czechs!
They believe the rhetoric about the EU being a human rights community.
They thought Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty, setting out our values of democracy, fundamental rights and the rule of law, were there actually to be acted upon!
But the old cynics in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office or the Quai d'Orsay will put them right.
I am on the side of the Czech Foreign Minister, Karel Schwarzenberg, who sees no contradiction between being a friend of America and a critic of its human rights breaches.
He opposes both the American trade embargo on Cuba and GuantÃ¡namo Bay.
'I am against GuantÃ¡namo because I think it is a violation of human rights', he says crisply.
(ES) Madam President, I would like to refer to three aspects of this magnificent report.
Firstly, the role of Parliament in the democratic scrutiny of strategic documents relating to financial instruments on external assistance.
In the last plenary sitting we once again discussed and criticised the failure by the Commission to fulfil its commitment on transparency and parliamentary scrutiny in the context of the financing instrument for development cooperation.
I hope that this is not going to be repeated in this area.
Secondly, I would like the Commission to be asked to inform Parliament as soon as possible as to when and how it proposes to put in place the post-electoral protocol mechanism in the framework of Election Observation Missions, proposed by this report.
Thirdly and finally, the report calls on the Council and the Commission to analyse, support and coordinate the setting of benchmarks for EU dialogues with actions of other donors and international organisations, especially the UN mechanisms in place.
Tomorrow an urgent resolution will be debated in this House on the financing of the special court to judge war crimes in Sierra Leone, set up by the United Nations.
I consider this to be an example of the lack of coordination that currently exists between the EU and international organisations and a good example of the work that is still to be done.
I therefore hope that this report will be a step forward towards achieving this coordination.
(DE) Madam President, today a group of Yezidi Kurds demonstrated outside this House, and I joined them, along with Mrs Uca and others.
This demonstration, by representatives of a group both dogged by terrorism and threatened with genocide, was another illustration of the incredible hope placed in this House with regard to human rights issues.
This is why it is important that our human rights work is carried out systematically and sustainably, and that it avoids making certain mistakes.
The first serious mistake is to make a distinction between large and small countries where human rights is concerned, coming down hard on small countries and yielding to large ones with whom we share important economic and strategic interests.
This is something that is done by many of our governments of all political orientations, but that this report avoids.
In particular, the report very bravely addresses the subjects of China and Russia, and I am obliged to Mrs Merkel for stating in very clear language on her latest visit to China and a visit some time ago to Russia that it is possible to both pursue interests and in spite of this, or because of it, to raise the subject of human rights in clear terms.
The second mistake we must not make is the following.
An Austrian writer, Gerd-Klaus Kaltenbrunner, once said that there are two types of oppressed community and individual victim: one with and one without sex appeal.
One is in the limelight for a while, and the other is ignored.
Human rights must apply to all, whether or not they are the focus of particular international attention at that time.
The third mistake we must avoid - and this too is vital - is introducing party politics into this issue.
That is why I regret the speech by Mr Meijer, whom I otherwise hold in high esteem.
Try asking Mr Kelam or Mr Landsbergis, who were under the threat of Soviet persecution, who it was who argued their case back then, in the 1980s: whether it was our group or Mr Meijer's.
Imbalance and the tendency to abuse human rights for party political ends are found everywhere.
We should avoid this course in favour of that taken in Mrs Valenciano's excellent report, and create a human rights policy that applies objective standards and crosses the group divide, and is worthy of the great human rights tradition of this House.
(ET) I should like to thank the rapporteur for a good report and her high standard of teamwork.
I would like to highlight two points concerning our human rights dialogue with third countries.
In fact, I shall reiterate what the previous speaker said, but I believe it to be so important that it is worth repeating.
First of all, the point relating to conflicting interests and values, which is very important to me as well.
It is no secret that in the race to a globalised world we have sought to give preference to our own interests and values.
If we do not refer to and preach our own values then where our interests are pressing we will gradually forget them.
I welcome the rapporteur's flexibility: we jointly presented proposals for amendments concerning Russia and Central Asia.
These are regions where interests often take precedence and our values have been left behind.
The European Union must remind its partners of the international arrangements and commitments entered into by them.
As a Council of Europe rapporteur, I certainly think that interests come first for large States, yet at the same time we are very eager to single small States out; however, standards should be the same across the board.
Secondly, on a less important matter, I would like to refer to our conduct in relations with third countries and how this affects and supports human rights and related aims in host countries.
We must always provide hope, and not do the opposite, namely take hope away from them.
Each of the steps we take to tackle the sources of problems is observed with great care.
I believe, for example, that support from the West was important and necessary for the Balts, for their ambitions, and I find the effective absence of that support depressing.
In this regard too we should stress to our partners that they should comply with their obligations.
Finally, I repeat, this report covers those points and I thank the rapporteur once more for her high standard of teamwork.
(FI) Madam President, first of all I want to thank the rapporteur, Elena Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco, for her excellent and properly focused report.
It is very important for this European forum, the European Parliament, to deal with human rights.
I am in firm agreement with the rapporteur when she says that human rights should be at the core of the EU's external policy.
When we talk of human rights, we have to remember that they should not be just the subject of mere rhetoric or just words used in political speeches and on special occasions.
They should be a commonplace reality both within the European Union and in our relations with other countries - third countries.
What do human rights in all their aspects represent exactly?
The way I understand it is that human rights are the inalienable rights a human being has from birth to death, including the rights of unborn children and the elderly.
They include the rights of women, as has been said here, and the rights of children, but they also include the rights of the disabled, the sick, the elderly, everyone.
We have to remember that every life is precious and unique.
I would even say that every life is sacred, and nobody can take another person's life - take away their human rights.
If we in the European Union could share with others the notion that human value and human rights always win out against market value, we would be on the right tack, on the right road.
Unfortunately, however, it would appear that we very often allow market value to supplant human rights.
China provides many examples of this, and these are very obvious to us today.
In addition, we now have the situation in Russia, for example, to take into account.
What are human rights in Russia?
We see them; we know of cases by name - Hodorovski and so on. What have we achieved as a European community of values?
Obviously, we in a European community of values and the European Union have to practise what we preach and defend human rights and human values everywhere, inside the Union, but also in our relations with third and developing countries.
(ES) Madam President, in the second half of the twentieth century, and especially in the last three decades, democracy and respect for human rights have made enormous progress, but there is still a great deal to be done.
A few months ago in Berlin, in the Declaration adopted on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, the EU institutions formally expressed their desire to promote freedom and democracy in the world.
In this policy we must work openly on the principle that respect for human rights affects the whole of the international community and that these rights are universal.
These two ideas are expressly mentioned in the final document adopted at the New York Summit in 2005.
The theory that there are parts of the world which, for one reason or another, are exempt from observing human rights is not acceptable, in other words, the theory that there are regimes that cannot be required to respect freedoms.
I would like to recall here the brilliant essays by Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen on the global roots of democracy and democracy as a universal value.
In short, the promotion of human rights should play a very important role in the EU's relations with all third countries.
One of the tools for this is dialogue, which is why I think it would be good to produce a report that helps to organise and systematise human rights dialogues that the European Union conducts with other countries.
I welcome the fact that paragraph 31 of the report calls on the Council to ensure that the initiation or suspension of a dialogue complies with clear criteria and for a prior impact assessment.
I also agree that dialogue should not be an end in itself.
I would like to end by briefly talking about Cuba, which is not mentioned in the report, and where, unfortunately, human rights and basic freedoms are still not respected.
However, the Council recently decided to propose initiating a comprehensive dialogue with Cuba that would include these rights.
It is well known that the position of the majority of Parliament is that it does not agree with the somewhat erratic policy that the Council has been following in the last three years with the Castro regime.
In our view, the priority before any other initiative, should be firm insistence on the freeing of political prisoners.
(SV) Madam President, in a world where democracy and human rights are not always evident - among our neighbours and sometimes in certain countries which, whilst not members of the EU, are still part of our Europe - the EU's relations with the world around take on even greater importance.
Each such relationship, whether in the form of a meeting, a dialogue or an agreement, is an opportunity to assert our values and impose demands on countries which still do not live up to the meaning of the words humanity, human rights and democracy.
The report we are considering today is essentially good.
It illustrates some of the difficulties that arise when you deal with different wordings and approaches to human rights, but I still think that it should have been more critical as regards our attitude towards China or Russia, for example.
It is our duty to be critical of countries that do not respect human rights and that are not democratic, but it is absolutely essential that we criticise countries that believe themselves to be democracies - not only for the sake of our own credibility but also for all the people who live in those countries and who do not even have the opportunity to voice their criticisms.
Democracy and human rights in the EU are a given, so we sometimes think that they have always existed, they exist now and will always exist.
But we who were born in dictatorships know that we must fight for democracy and human rights every day. It is not enough to say that human rights work is taking place and that things are improving.
There is also much to be done, as we so often say.
In our dialogues we must be much clearer and much more specific, both in our criticism and in our demands, and we must start to tell things as they are if we want to leave a better world for our children.
(FR) Madam President, at this late hour, many things have already been said, but I would really like to thank Mrs Valenciano, of course, for this report.
It marks an important step in making European development policy more transparent and effective when it comes to human rights.
I am also taking the chance offered by this debate to call representatives of the Council and the Commission to better interinstitutional cooperation.
It is indeed essential to institute a dialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament so that action taken in the area of human rights can be better coordinated, and to prevent contradiction and duplication from interfering with the message to the outside world.
It is unfortunately an issue permanently in the news.
To take a specific example, that of Burma, our policy concerning the country is indecipherable from the outside.
The members of the EU have committed themselves to a common position in favour of national reconciliation, democracy and human rights, but in practice the EU Member States are divided, producing a weak and ineffective position that is having no effect on the regime in Burma.
Politically, the European Union has no clear strategy.
We concentrate only on humanitarian aid, which is obviously essential, but not enough.
We have not taken a position on how the UN Security Council should deal with the situation in Burma, offering no support for a resolution.
Moreover, the Commission has reduced the amount of subsidies for projects aimed at promoting human rights and democracy in Burma.
In short, the European Union has not used its influence positively and effectively to promote and support democracy and human rights in that country.
The recent failure of our call for the release of the Burmese Nobel prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, proves this.
Yet Parliament awarded her the Sakharov Prize in 1990.
This example perfectly illustrates the fact that our three institutions must act together in presenting a coherent, intelligible policy for the defence of human rights.
(PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating deserves our support in the first place because it examines in great breadth and detail a topic which is highly relevant for the European Union's external dimension and I should like, therefore, to congratulate the rapporteur.
The worst thing that could happen for the European Union's commitment to the global promotion of fundamental human rights would be for this to become an isolated question, dealt with separately.
The alternative, the right option I think, is to regard the promotion of human rights as both an ethical duty, for reasons which are self-evident, and as in the EU's interest insofar as the instability, migratory flows and political and military tensions linked to human rights violations give rise to crises which make the world a more dangerous place.
I therefore agree with the fundamental question, but we ought to look into the question of the method.
If the EU were to maintain relations only with countries that respect human rights as we defend them, then our firm relations would extend to only a few countries.
Conversely, if the European Union were always to opt for the realism of economic, energy, geostrategic and other interests, it would soon discover that rather than defending immediate advantages it was actually creating greater dangers for the future.
What we must hope for is a coherent EU strategy which includes the tangible and quantifiable promotion of human rights on its foreign policy agenda.
It is not an option to allocate budgetary funds without evaluating the result of their application or to pay lip service to proposals which are never realised.
In this connection, the next EU-Africa Summit is an opportunity not to be missed.
If we wish to help Africa and the Africans - and we do - we must be generous and demanding in equal measure.
We do not, as I said, delude ourselves that we can only forge relations with countries which respect fundamental values, but we must maintain the conviction that the human rights agenda is part of our policy for relations with those countries.
Otherwise we should be yielding to the force of some dictator and giving a signal, not of our goodwill but of our lack of political capability and negotiating strength
A better world, Madam President, is a safer world and Europe cannot confuse the soft power of its diplomacy with dream power, or worse still, with no power at all.
(HU) I warmly congratulate Mrs Valenciano on her excellent report; she has put forward some very important proposals.
At the same time I would like to point out several gaps, which are not her fault but which represent conceptual shortcomings by the European Parliament and the European Union.
To take the example of China, we rightly protest against the violation of human rights or the restriction of freedom of religion but we never mention the 700 million people living in villages who have no social security and no pension.
I would ask: is this not an important human right?
I would go further.
In the entire report there was not a single mention of the question of national minorities in China.
The European Union should now finally wake up to the fact that, whether in the Western Balkans or anywhere in the world, if it wants stability then it must be honest in its dealings with the issue of minorities, and national minorities.
The European Parliament needs to attend several seminars in the Council of Europe building to learn at last that human rights and minority rights are two completely different issues!
It is unacceptable that in the entire report there was no mention of the issue of national minorities, and no mention of the issue of migrant minorities or western European migrant minorities; only today, in this very House, I have said that in France, Great Britain and the Netherlands the integration of new minorities is in crisis.
Thus if the European Parliament and the European Union do not change their approach, they will be incapable of managing international problems and international conflicts and will not have the moral high ground for judging China legitimately; we should be putting our own house in order, with our own insoluble minorities issues, here in Europe.
Madam President, there has not been sufficient consistency in the EU dialogues with third countries and such a situation may undermine the very credibility of the EU's human rights policy.
These are two conclusions of this report.
Therefore, our message to the Commission and the Council is very clear: human rights issues should be upgraded into practical policymaking.
In other words, they should not be conditioned by strategic or geopolitical interests.
The biggest challenge remains implementing these noble goals in our current relationships.
There is clearly a conflict of interest and views in the EU relations with the Kazakh dictatorship.
In the case of China and Russia, expressing the right concern about the situations there, we should also ask whether the dialogues as they have been conducted so far have produced a real improvement in the situation.
Also, speaking of Russia, that country should stop claiming that the EU-Russia partnership is founded on shared values.
In the present situation, it sounds rather ironic.
We need to call things as they are, as Putin's Russia is probably where Hitler's Germany was in the mid-1930s.
Not addressing these realities with all the power and authority of the EU makes us share responsibility for the brutal violation of human rights in Russia.
At the same time, Mr SchrÃ¶der called on the EU not to burden Russia with exaggerated demands about human rights and democracy there.
Unfortunately, the fact is that the EU still lacks real grip while trying, with the best of intentions, to balance human rights and its economic and strategic interests.
(LT) You can never give too much attention to human rights dialogue, and therefore I would like to welcome a speaker who has presented many suggestions and assessments.
The European Parliament wants to, and can, participate more actively in the Council and Commission dialogue with third countries on the issue of human rights because it has the necessary potential and experience.
The creativity and independence of MEPs can supplement the realism of the Commission and the Council.
We need to talk ever more loudly about the status of human rights defenders and the environment in which they work and also about economic, social and ecological human rights.
Although relations between the EU and the United States are overshadowed by the Iraq War and Guantanamo, they are healthy because of our common values.
The EU and Russia are linked by gas and oil pipelines, but human rights dialogue in Russia cannot be softened by energy sources and mercantile interests.
This large and important country is searching for a national idea and a special path.
Here I might mention a comment heard in Moscow: earlier we mistakenly thought that we were on the right path in Russia; now we mistakenly think that we are on a special path.
Nobody argues against Russia's right to travel down a specific path, if the majority of citizens want this.
It is another thing altogether if this is accompanied by restrictions on freedom of expression and of the press and NGO activity or exceptions for certain parties.
A human rights dialogue is not being sought with Belarus; however, I believe that not only the human rights defenders in that country, but also the EU are interested in this.
The reason for which we actively criticise Belarus also applies to certain countries in Central Asia and the Southern Caucasus that even participate in the European Neighbourhood Policy.
However, greater losses and the smell of oil and gas should not soften attitudes towards the violation of human rights.
Madam President, I have to say that this was not an easy report to wade through.
It was excessively long and duplicative, but it deals with an important subject.
I am a staunch defender of genuine human rights.
But I must confess I have difficulty with the extension of the concept to cover just about every conceivable aspect of human activity: social, environmental, economic and cultural rights, to name but a few that are repeatedly referred to.
Nevertheless, the abuse of human rights throughout the world has never received as much attention as it does today, but paradoxically this has not led to change for the better in many countries where the worst abuses take place.
The EU has an important role to play in promoting the rule of law and respect for human rights, but its habit of flouting its own rules does nothing to encourage reform among the worst regimes.
In this regard I think especially of Zimbabwe and Burma, in relation to which the EU's own travel ban and targeted sanctions have been ignored on spurious grounds on several occasions.
And we wonder why our measures are ineffective and tyrants laugh at us!
Many African countries have not responded to their obligations to deliver good governance.
It is not surprising if there is no strong message on this from EU interlocutors.
For years now we have tried to get other African countries to join with us in bringing about change for the better in Zimbabwe, but to no avail.
Meanwhile, that country plunges into economic chaos and millions of its people are left starving and destitute under Mugabe's arrogant dictatorship.
It now seems there is a possibility that the EU will again break its own rules and invite Mugabe or other banned Zimbabwean ministers to the EU-Africa summit in Lisbon in December.
I wrote to the Prime Minister of Portugal about this on 3 July.
I have not yet received a reply.
As the Council is not here at the moment, perhaps the Presidency could find out what it intends to do on this subject?
I hear from a report yesterday that Ms Ferrero-Waldner, the Commissioner for External Relations, has said that maybe they would invite the Foreign Minister instead of Mugabe!
Well, he is banned as well; he is number 83 on the banned list.
So could we actually be told what is going to happen in this regard?
(RO) Mr President, dear colleagues, stating that woman's rights are an integral part of human rights could be considered as a tautology because, they would be inherent.
Reality shows that they are only explicitly ignored.
We have recently inventoried the delays in attaining the Millenium Development Goals in which women are a target group but also essential factors for process acceleration.
In Elena Valenciano's excellent report, the Commission and the Council are requested to consider the gender dimension in dialogue with partner countries.
However, in a dialogue there are at least two parties involved and we represent one of them.
We think that the efficiency of the measures to promote and defend woman's rights as well as the control of their implementation also depend on the European parties, institutions and our governments' sensitivity towards gender issues.
It is conditioned by the achievement of their own goals set out in the roadmap for gender equality.
We do not need to invent sophisticated indicators to observe that in the European Union there are governments where there is no woman or others that uncritically defend traditions and practices violating woman's rights.
We all know that the decision to initiate a dialogue on human rights is taken based on several criteria laid down by the Council when certain situations are considered worrying in the partner country.
Even in the optimistic case that all the Council members are supporters of woman's rights, I am wondering what kind of example we set for a country to which one requests measures on representation in political structures.
Unfortunately the remark is valid also for the European Parliament where there is a great reserve that the reform of our own structures include a balanced gender balance.
We request coherence between statements and acts from the European institutions and member states.
It is necessary to preserve coherence between Community policies and instruments so that they do not negatively interfere with the capability measures of women in partner countries.
Talking about women is important but letting them talk is even more important in order to improve the political climate, peace processes and to reduce corruption all over the world.
(PL) Madam President, the report presented has my full approval, particularly as it relates to one of the most pressing problems facing not only the Union, but the world as a whole.
The quality of dialogue and consultation with third countries in the area of human rights depends primarily on coherence and transparency in action.
I would like to stress that the road to maximising the benefit of dialogue lies in tightening up cooperation, especially where the Union decision-making triangle is concerned.
We need to specify precisely the aims we are hoping to achieve.
The suggested increase in coherence should also extend to the common practice of separating human rights dialogue from other bilateral relations.
Admittedly the report does emphasise that hypocrisy of this kind should be eliminated in the case of China.
However, it is not sufficiently strongly worded as far as relations with Russia are concerned.
The criteria we apply to the subject of human rights should be clearly laid down for all countries, and most importantly they should be identical.
I am sorry to say that this rule is quite often broken.
Universally accepted standards are selectively applied, depending on the payback that can be achieved from this sort of action.
That is how the situation looks with regard to Russia, as I have said, with the European Union being Russia's main trading partner.
Mutual benefits do undoubtedly flow from this fact.
However, we cannot allow the relativisation of human rights to come at the expense of good trading relations.
I hope I do not need to remind you that in the Russian Federation the use of torture and persecution against a racial background is widespread, as in Chechnya, while the organisation 'Reporters Without Borders' places this country 147th in the world press freedom ranking, which is dangerously close to such countries as China and North Korea.
The consequence of which I am speaking also relates to Cuba, which, incidentally, is not mentioned in this report.
Like Russia, the European Union, as the main trading partner, appears to be closing its eyes to the things that go on there.
Despite the June resolution, no specific action has been taken.
We read from time to time that the European Parliament is demanding something or another, or deplores something, but do we think about what happens as a result?
