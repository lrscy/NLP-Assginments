I welcome the fact that European Union is prepared to play an active role in third-party monitoring operations in the Middle East and I believe that the European Union must and should play a stronger role in any future talks that may take place in the Middle East region.
Madam President, my mother taught me that you should keep quiet if you have nothing worthwhile to say, but how are the elections of Mr Giscard d'Estaing, Mr Amato and Mr Dehaene as leaders of the Convention to be commented upon?
We can of course commend the appointment of the three wise men with their splendid careers behind them as a good signal to the Chinese leaders as to how we promote women and young people in the European Union.
What, however, do our own women and young people say about the fact that the future of the EU is now to be directed by those responsible for the majority of our laws' now being adopted by officials and Ministers behind closed doors?
My group expects the leaders of the future to be given places in the Convention, which it also expects to be opened up to that 50 per cent of the electorate who voted 'no' in the referenda in France, Denmark and Ireland and who might have voted 'no' in other countries if the latter had had the courage to ask them.
The critics of the EU, or Eurorealists, ought at least to have one place in every single national delegation, and I should like to thank Mr Verhofstadt for having supported this demand when SOS Democracy had a meeting with him.
The Danish Prime Minister has already offered the Danish critics of the EU a place.
The Convention should draft two texts: a constitution, as desired by the majority, and an agreement between independent nations which cooperate on cross-border matters that we cannot solve ourselves in our own countries' parliaments.
The two proposals can therefore be subject to consultative referenda in all the Member States so that our politicians can see what people want before they call an official Intergovernmental Conference for the purpose of making changes to existing treaties.
The two proposals should be prepared as completed drafts that can be adopted if desired.
The Convention should therefore do some detailed work and employ the necessary experts to help with both the majority and minority approaches.
There should also be ongoing debates on the two drafts in the national parliaments and at public meetings in the Member States.
The successor to the Treaty of Amsterdam must not come as a surprise but as the result of a democratic process.
The democratic process is at least as important as the content of the new treaty, in which it is not only the future of Mr Amato, Mr Dehaene and Mr Giscard d' Estaing that is now at stake, but that of all Europeans.
Madam President, I would also like to thank, in particular, the Belgian Presidency, Mr Verhofstadt, and Mr Michel especially, because I believe they enabled us to keep the game open in terms of the Convention.
I see, in particular, that behind one of the issues, namely, that of the direct election of the Commission President, lies the characteristic and insistent work of the Belgian Presidency. I think, however, that we should not forget, and I am also addressing my fellow Members here, the objective, and, with regard to this, the issue of terrorism, an issue that has already been put on the backburner.
I disagree with you, Mr Lannoye.
There was a paragraph which, under the influence of the British members, I believe, was withdrawn, that placed the Americans at a distance.
I think that we are already forgetting that terrorism is an international phenomenon.
We are forgetting that not only was Afghanistan under the Taliban, but the issues of Syria, Iraq, Somalia and North Korea remain.
However, we are, above all, forgetting that the events of 11 September revealed that terrorism is born of and feeds on dictatorships, on these dictatorial regimes. And we have already forgotten this, since, at the last session, we adopted an association agreement with Egypt, without batting an eyelid, disregarding the warnings and requests for additional information on a number of serious human rights violations, which have also been voiced today.
I would also like to thank our President.
Chairman Poettering reiterated the role played by our President in supporting Commander Massoud. Our own President had invited Mrs Sihem Ben Sedrine here today, who, once again due to despicable, base, mediocre action taken by this dictatorship, which is becoming increasingly dictatorial by the day, will not be able to attend the reception that the President of our Parliament had organised in her honour.
This is the reality of these dictatorships which are at the root of the growth of terrorism, and we are doing nothing, we have already forgotten the lessons of 11 September.
I hope at least, that the next President of the European Parliament will re-extend the invitation originally made by our President, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, and I hope that, for Tunisia, for the Tunisian democrats, for the Egyptian democrats, for all democrats, particularly in Arab countries, our Parliament will in time live up to its objectives and its ambitions.
Madam President, we have all known for a long time that the Intergovernmental Conference on its own is no longer an effective instrument for bringing about a proper treaty amendment.
It is encouraging to hear that a different working method has been opted for at the Laeken Summit.
The Convention has been launched, and its agenda is far wider than the four points imposed at Nice.
That is an achievement on the part of the Belgian Presidency, on which I would warmly congratulate it.
The quality of the triumvirate which will be heading the Convention and its praesidium is also promising.
Nobody will reproach me for the fact that my trust in this leadership is mainly based on the presence in this trio of former Prime Minister and party colleague, Mr Dehaene.
The Laeken Declaration contains more than sixty non-rhetorical questions.
Although everyone involved in Europe since Amsterdam, and Ioanina in fact, knows what the questions are, nobody had expected adequate and complete answers yet.
However, many of us were looking forward to receiving some indicators, and I actually miss them a little in this Laeken Declaration. There has not been the slightest hint of reaching political agreement between Heads of State and Government about the direction which we need to take with Europe.
In fact, wearing my Belgian hat, I could also say that Mr Verhofstadt asks the questions, and Mr Dehaene should make sure the answers are found.
I am left with three questions for the Council Presidency, to which I should like to receive answers.
First of all, do you believe, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you can deepen the European Union even further through this Declaration and with the Convention, to coincide at the latest with the imminent round of enlargement?
Secondly, do you expect that the national parliaments that have made their ratification of the deeply disappointing Nice Treaty dependent on the contents of the Laeken Declaration will now soon embark upon the ratification process for Nice?
Thirdly, I warmly welcome the idea of publishing the Laeken Declaration in dozens of European newspapers, but are you not concerned that people will also want the questions answered and will want to see concrete policy steps taken before they will well and truly feel at home in the ever-expanding Europe?
I should like to finish off by saying that, at the start of the Belgian Presidency, I had asked you to convene an NGO summit, preferably a few weeks before Laeken.
I did not receive a response during that sitting, but you did organise the summit.
This was therefore a matter of actions speaking louder than words.
We had not been used to this for a while in Belgium, and it was a nice surprise when it did happen. Thank you for this.
Mr President, one of the conclusions in the Laeken Declaration is that citizens feel that deals are often cut behind closed doors and away from democratic scrutiny.
That in fact could be an assessment of summits themselves, which are often conducted out of sight and away from public scrutiny until the very end.
One easy way of starting to remedy that process would be to ensure that the European Parliament, just like the European Commission, is represented throughout the summit and not asked to leave after the aperitifs.
I would, however, like to add my congratulations to the President-in-Office of the Council for his management of the summit.
He was absolutely right not to allow the meeting to degenerate into a fight over the seat of agencies but instead to allow the spotlight to fall on the more significant issues.
The Laeken Declaration rightly refers to the twin challenges facing the Union.
My Group has asked me to concentrate on internal matters, and particularly the issue of governance, but I would like to say just a few words about the external challenge.
The Declaration is of course right to say that there must be no weakening in the fight against those who use terror and violence.
But for me the real strength of the Declaration lies in its wider recommendation that the European Union takes the fight against poverty and exclusion seriously.
I wholeheartedly support the aim of the Declaration to "set globalisation into a moral framework" .
As Tony Blair might have put it - "Tough on terrorism but also tough on the causes of terrorism".
Parliament' s key objective at Laeken was to see a Convention launched with a broad-ranging agenda.
It is a pity that the leadership of the Convention is not so broad-ranging. Three men of a certain age.
For me that sends the wrong signals.
They are each very worthy in their own right but collectively they fail to represent Europe' s rich diversity of talent and in particular: how does this demonstrate the Union' s so-called commitment to gender mainstreaming?
(Applause) But at least we have the Convention, and it is now up to all of us to play our part in making it work and involving the public of the Union in the debate about the future of Europe.
However, any fruits of the Convention will not be ripened until well after 2004.
The Laeken Declaration' s objective of good governance, that is connecting better with citizens, reducing bureaucracy and delivering on our objectives more effectively and efficiently, cannot wait.
Laeken must not be seen as an excuse for postponing action on governance but instead create a new impetus for reforms that do not require treaty change.
In particular there are three areas where urgent action is required:
Firstly, the continuation of the reform of the staff structures and administrative procedures inside the Commission.
There is a need for high profile support at a high political level for continuing the work of transforming the Commission into a first-class civil service.
Secondly, the European Parliament itself must reform its own working methods.
I believe that we do a good job in terms of our legislative, budgetary and control functions, but no Parliament can work in the dark.
By reforming our working methods to make ourselves a livelier and more relevant debating chamber, we can shed a little light on our role as the voice of the people in EU decision-making.
Thirdly, we must make progress on better regulation.
I note the Presidency' s conclusions which welcome the report of the Mandelkern Group on the quality of regulatory arrangements and the Commission communication on regulatory simplification and their calls for an action plan for the first half of 2002.
This Parliament, in the report prepared by Sylvia Kaufmann, called for an interinstitutional working group on better regulation.
Notwithstanding what was agreed at Laeken, I hope the Spanish Presidency will re-visit this issue and set up a working group with a mandate to arrive at draft interinstitutional agreements and an action plan agreed by all three institutions to be presented at the Seville Council next June.
Let us be clear that the alternative to an agreed plan is a guerilla war where Parliament is left with no alternative but to defend its prerogatives.
If that happens, we will have a non-stop dogfight where, proposal by proposal, Parliament will defend its rights as a co-legislator.
The Convention has the potential to reform our institutions, to renew our goals and to reconnect Europe with our people, but none of this should have to wait until 2004, the process needs to begin now.
Mr President, may I join in the praise of the Presidents of the Commission and Council for having brokered the deal at Laeken.
To have got a British Prime Minister to have signed up to the prospect of a federal constitution is an extraordinary thing.
It is certainly unprecedented.
I fear though that the size of the podium in this chamber will require strengthening and extension so that it can fit in Valerie Giscard d' Estaing and his entourage.
The European citizen will feel truly privileged that we have such a grand praesidium to service our work.
Thank you for the 60 questions or so.
Frankly, I would have wished for more.
First, there is nothing on strengthening the powers of the Court.
Secondly, there is nothing on revising the formula of a qualified majority in the Council.
Thirdly, there is nothing on strengthening the role of the regions within the political system of the Union and, fourthly and finally, we would have appreciated some critical self-assessment of the functioning and performance of the European Council itself.
But we are blessed with a truly pluralist procedure - an exciting and novel one - and we retain the freedom within the Convention to ask ourselves questions.
We will exploit that freedom.
Madam President, allow me to start by using a military analogy in these times of war.
Mr Verhofstadt, over the past six months, you, together with your colleagues in the federal government and the federal state governments, have been Europe' s Lieutenant-General.
Unfortunately, however, you have been the Lieutenant-General of an ill-disciplined army, an army in which too often the Member States refuse to bow to your supreme authority, in which all too many Member States act at their own discretion and wish to go their own way and in which the Member States only serve their own interests and too often put narrow state nationalism above the general European interest.
You may have been aware of this over the past six months, Mr Verhofstadt, but we experience this on a daily basis in our files.
Credit to you for having succeeded in creating a sense of order in that ill-disciplined army at Laeken.
However, the Council is not only an ill-disciplined army, they are also a bunch of opportunists: typically, they quickly wanted to resolve the location issue on Saturday evening.
Credit to you once again, Mr Verhofstadt, for having nipped this in the bud.
For we want, in fact, to move away from the back-room mentality, we want to move away from closed meetings between officials, between diplomats and between fifteen Heads of Government.
We are in favour of an open method, we want to give the Convention' s hopeful method a chance, we want to throw open the doors to let a fresh breeze in.
You posed the right questions at the Convention.
You rightly stated that the debate should be about the distribution of powers at different policy levels.
You also rightly questioned whether it would not be better to leave the daily running of the Union' s policy to the regions where the constitution regulates this automatically.
However, Mr Verhofstadt, could I also level some form of criticism?
You did not ask, for example, how constitutional regions, including Flanders, Wallonia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Scotland and Wales could emphatically be involved in European decision-making.
In failing to do so, you have ignored the demands of your party colleague, Mr Patrick Dewael, the Prime Minister of Flanders, who, together with some fifty colleagues, had even published a weighty document on this matter in May and in October.
I should like to make three observations with regard to the composition of the Convention.
Firstly, I do not believe that a triumvirate without the presence of one single woman genuinely reflects present-day society.
Secondly, there is an imbalance in the composition of the Convention between the MEPs, on the one hand, and national parliaments, on the other.
You, the Council, are making a mistake here.
In my view, the European Parliament is the institution par excellence where the European idea, where the European general interest, applies, and you are missing an opportunity here.
And my final comment with regard to the composition of the Convention is that the representatives of the constitutional regions are unable to participate directly in the Convention.
They need to take the indirect route of the Committee of the Regions as observers, and that is a sad state of affairs in my view.
Mr Verhofstadt, whatever happens, you can rely on me and my party, with the nine representatives of the European Free Alliance, to make a constructive contribution to this Convention, for Europe must not lead to uniformity. Europe must remain a sparkling diamond with many facets, facets displaying its diversity and its own identity, for only then can the European diamond sparkle in the European firmament.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, in adopting the Laeken Declaration convening the Convention, the summit has made a decision of historical significance for the future of the European Union.
It is particularly noteworthy that none of the numerous open political questions on the future of the European Union have been declared off-limits and that the Convention mandate can also be seen as marking the beginning of the process of developing a European constitution.
A further reason why the convening of the Convention is a milestone in European politics is that it will consign the policy of secret diplomacy behind closed doors, of non-transparent decision-making and haggling in marathon night sittings - as happened most recently at the Nice Summit - to the past, hopefully once and for all!
In my opinion, it is impossible to overestimate the significance of the fact that a majority of the members of the Convention will be democratically-elected members of the national parliaments and the European Parliament, that it will meet in public and talk to all kinds of organisations from civil society, and that the candidate countries will be involved in drafting proposals for the most far-reaching reform in the European Union's history.
This provides the opportunity for controversial issues to be discussed in a genuine pan-European context and thus for us to have a broad-based public debate on the future of the EU.
Since, however, a debate of this kind only comes to life if the pros and cons are discussed openly, I should like to refer once again to a position of this Parliament, namely our call for political plurality to be guaranteed in the composition of the Convention.
The choice of those who will represent their countries, their national parliaments or the European Parliament is of particular importance in this context, and we must ensure at all costs that the Convention does not consist solely of representatives of the large European families of parties.
Diversity of opinion must be delivered, because the European Union is actually at a crossroads and the proposals to be drawn up by the Convention must in their final form really reflect a European position on the future of Europe which is supported by all of us.
If the Convention is to be a success and ultimately if the European Union is to be viable in the future, it will, in my view, be crucial for us to succeed in making the European Union more democratic across the board and in strengthening the rights of individual people.
It is my hope - indeed I am counting on this - that, through the commitment of all of its members and as an independent forum, the Convention will gather its own political momentum during the course of its consultations, so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will not be able simply to disregard the Convention's proposals.
Mr President, the past week has been pivotal for the future of the Union.
Firstly, agreement was reached on the European arrest warrant, a major, sensitive agreement which must be seen as an initial step, to be consolidated by a broader, further-reaching political and institutional project bringing further integration.
In particular, at Laeken, we started to define that political and constitutional Europe in which we firmly believe.
The idea that Europe might be condemned to being just a union of agriculture and trade or just a financial and monetary union is waning.
We are, at last, entering a new phase: an exciting phase, a phase of laying foundations and further integration, in which we must establish European political unity while safeguarding national identities and diversities.
The diversities unite us; they must not be seen as dividing the European peoples, for they have come to represent precious social and cultural assets.
Europe' s strength stems, in actual fact, precisely from its ancient culture, from its diversities as well as its common roots.
In this sense, as a European and an Italian, I can only appreciate the work of the Italian Government at Laeken in enthusiastically upholding Parma' s application to be the site of the Food Authority.
If we want the Europe we are building to be a Europe of excellence, quality and competitiveness in the area of quality, when it comes to the Food Authority, Parma is the natural, most suitable and most prestigious choice, precisely because of Italy' s longstanding gastronomic traditions: it has a tradition of culture and quality, professionalism and rigour, and a history of consolidated scientific excellence which is recognised the world over.
In promoting Parma' s application - energetically, moreover, as Italy did at Laeken - we are not trying to impose unnecessary vetoes or advancing nationalistic claims; rather, this is an attempt to allow the quality, capacity, skills and natural, genuine vocation of a territory to prevail over bureaucracy, sterile bureaucratic agreements and pre-established lists, rather than allowing the latter to prevail as has happened on countless occasions.
The citizens do not want the site of the Food Authority to be purely administrative but to have proven experience and capacity in the field of food safety.
I feel that Parma has that proven experience and capacity.
Finally, my heartfelt thanks go to the President, Mrs Fontaine, who, with great authority and courtesy, has steered the work of this House during this first part of our parliamentary term.
Mr President, some believe that the debate on the future of Europe can be summarised in the development of the Community method, where the Commission has the monopoly on initiative, the Court of Justice has political power and interpretation, and the right to impose European law on one or more Member States is achieved by increasing majority decisions.
This centralised vision of Europe in even more areas runs counter to the will of the people, who want to benefit from each other' s experience.
The people of Ireland, which was the only nation to be consulted by referendum, were not mistaken in rejecting the Treaty of Nice.
The Convention will be nothing more than a sham if it pursues the same objective without acknowledging that the Treaty of Nice is dead and buried.
Unfortunately, the objectives appear to remain fixed.
The conclusions of the Laeken Summit welcome the progress made and the agreements reached on the liberalisation of the postal services, which will bring about a weakening of the social and territorial cohesion of our Member States.
It is unacceptable to impose on everyone the choice made by some Member States to privatise and open up their public services to competition.
This proposal is not likely to bring the people of Europe closer, nor is it a condition for peace on the continent.
We must adopt the opposite approach; in other words, bring Europe closer to the people.
In order to do this, we must listen to them and, once genuinely common concerns have been expressed, debate an appropriate common response.
In my view, the European Summit and the Laeken Declaration proved, in fact, to be a fitting sequel to the Belgian Presidency.
It became a catalogue of hollow phrases, of nothingness, of unanswered questions.
It is very characteristic of the state of affairs in today' s Europe that, actually, only someone like former Commissioner, Mr Van Miert, dared to put his finger on the wound.
What Mr Michel ventured to call the 'Grand Cru Verhofstadt' ultimately turned out to be a cheap table wine.
So there will soon be a Convention which is supposed to give a democratic face to an enforced federal Europe.
But surely this Convention cannot cover up the fact that our institutions are systematically riding roughshod over the subsidiarity principle, that extremely drastic measures are taken without prior referendums, and even that the European Union is once again flouting the sovereignty of the Member States at this summit, for example by again callously ignoring the results of the Irish referendum.
Apparently, European democracy suggests that citizens preferably have no say, and if they do, they have to carry on voting until they agree with what the eurocracy has decided, as was the case in Denmark and is also required from Ireland.
The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt, may well go down in history, albeit as the man who took things to such extremes that even Commission President, Mr Prodi, refused to hold any more press conferences with him, as the once pro-Flemish politician who refused to protect the Dutch language, as the man who abandoned all his principles, who was once known as the advocate of slimmed-down government and of deregulation but who became the partisan of European centralism exercised by a superstate and who turned inventing little rules into a kind of Olympic discipline.
Mr President, the Laeken Council will sadly rank amongst the less impressive meetings of its kind.
It was a missed opportunity and a serious disappointment, like the Belgian Presidency which preceded it.
Why?
Not just because of the consistency of the Foreign Minister, Louis Michel, who for us emerges as an endearing Harry Worth-type figure on the European political stage.
We seem to have passed over his proclamation that the British-led UN peacekeeping force in Afghanistan was to become an EU body.
The key problem is that for this Presidency these last months have been a painful learning curve.
The excessive aspirations of July, often misguided like ideas for a new Euro-tax on all EU citizens or a Tobin tax on capital movements, found themselves on a collision course with reality.
At Laeken the EU's new rapid reaction force was declared operational even though, critically, its access to NATO assets is currently blocked.
Indeed, the precise relationship between the force and NATO remains ambiguous.
The European arrest warrant enjoyed a particularly painful birth with some uncertainty about when, or if ever, it will apply in Italy. The attempt to assign sites for various new EU bodies also descended into farce.
Little progress was made at Laeken, or indeed, throughout the Belgian Presidency, on the competitiveness agenda in Europe.
The Lisbon strategy, which has been grounded since Stockholm, now faces a moment of truth in Barcelona if we are truly to become the dynamic knowledge-based economy that is sought.
Finally let me turn to the Declaration itself.
The text acknowledges the EU's failings in terms of democracy, transparency and closeness to people but seems to come up yet again with solutions on federal lines.
These options represent the wrong route for Europe.
The Convention should learn the lessons of the last decade, reject ambitions for a European super-state, and focus on modest and intelligent reforms which can really deliver a Europe that works.
Christmas aside, much is said in the text, but there is also much that is not said.
The Community patent, GALILEO, immigration and asylum are all absent from the chapter on decisions and Mr Lannoye has mentioned other examples.
What is perhaps more dangerous is the persistent silence on the overall budgetary implications of transforming 'community' Europe, which herald difficult meetings with the people.
And in spite of this, the atmosphere that surrounds the Laeken Declaration is, indisputably, a positive atmosphere.
This tells you how important the positive aspects are compared to those that do not figure in the results.
Other Members, in addition to myself, have reiterated, and will once again reiterate, that the Belgian Presidency, which had ambitious objectives and was tenacious in its action, remained focused - somewhat more than the euro anyhow - both before 11 September and after.
For those who are familiar with international relations, this is incredibly significant, not only for Belgium but for the Union as a whole.
Prime Minister, we appreciate the role that you personally played in the solution found to the almost scandalous problem of the arrest warrant. It was not acceptable for the Prime Ministers and Heads of State of the Council Presidency to be exempt from this issue.
Furthermore, it is obvious that the Socialists attach particular importance to the progress made in social matters: the confirmation of the role of structural indicators in employment, the support for the European social model, particularly through cooperation in the area of pensions, the improved understanding of social exclusion and social involvement are important achievements for the people of Europe.
Lastly, let me turn to the Convention, which has already been the focus of attention of so many Members. I would simply like to say this: the statements made today illustrate the formidable task facing the Convention.
Therefore, its composition is most crucial and, except on one point, the decisions taken, and especially the innovative measures, are important achievements.
The same goes for the representation of the candidate countries.
Full participation, without the right to vote, is more in keeping with the dignity of a State, and this question has, wisely, been linked, in the texts in any case, to that of the regions with legislative power. Contrary to what was said earlier, we also recognise that these regions have the status that they deserve.
Parliament also attaches importance to the role you grant civil society.
And I wish to stress the value of the presidential troika system that you have chosen, which, in my view, meets the current needs much better, and goes far beyond the issues linked to the individuals chosen, individuals that I do not intend to discuss right now. All three are men deserve a great deal of admiration, but the problem, Prime Minister, arises from the fact that they are all men.
And therefore, as many previous speakers have during this festive season, I would like to express the wish that the European summit will one day learn, in as many languages as you like, to understand, appreciate, state, perhaps even conjugate much better, on the threshold of the 21st Century, one little word which is no longer established in poetry alone but in politics as well. That word is 'woman' .
Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, at the end of your Presidency, the situation is now very different from one year ago: the atmosphere has changed completely. We can roll up our sleeves, and you have indeed put three men in charge.
I am interested to see how many members the delegation of the European Parliament will have in the Convention.
We will count them when the time has come.
You have tabled the questions, a great many questions and the right ones, in my view.
Maybe we could add the odd question here and there. Why not?
In my opinion, the Convention should have that flexibility.
You outlined a dream a moment ago.
In my view, it was a very fitting account, a very attractive prospect of what we ought to do, not only we Western Europeans, the Fifteen, but also Eastern Europe and the rest of the world.
However, I would like to ask one more thing, Mr President-in-Office. You have now held the Council Presidency for six months.
We now face seven years in which the Belgian Government will not be President again.
I would ask you to convince all your Ministers of the fact that, during those seven years, European work is of extreme importance, that the government should not only occupy itself with European issues during the Presidency but also mainly outside of that time, for that period is longer and, most of all, certainly as important.
Mr President, the Laeken European Council has dragged us from the dreadful quagmire which Nice had led us into.
Not only from the point of view of the concrete results achieved, but also from the psychological and morale points of view.
Of course, there were frankly discouraging moments at Laeken.
I am convinced that neither Mr Chirac nor Mr Berlusconi have learnt a thing from the experience of Nice.
Furthermore, they were not the only ones who were prepared to risk the solidarity of Community cohesion for the sake of agencies, several of which have neither a legal basis nor any real purpose.
And what a striking contrast we have seen between the stimulating content of the Laeken declaration and the haggling over agencies.
But in reality the European Union is still vacillating between these two poles: on the one hand, the lack of progress resulting from the thinking and the interests of the national States, and on the other the zeal and enthusiasm arising from the desire to complete the construction of the European Union.
The challenge represented by the Laeken declaration, and which must be taken up by the Convention, is precisely to tip the balance in favour of strengthening democracy, efficiency and cohesion on a European level.
The questions posed are good, and it is very good not to have any taboos.
It is a good thing that the Constitution was discussed in the Laeken declaration.
But it is the responses which count and we have not yet won.
Personally, I see at least two elements of concern during these days following Laeken.
The first concerns the Convention.
It is not only through corporatism that I profoundly regret that the balance between the national and European dimensions is being broken and that for 28 governments there are just 16 European parliamentarians.
I do not believe that we will be able to distinguish between the Convention and the IGC unless we manage to change national thinking.
Secondly, the membership of the praesidium.
Why continue with this system whereby only former Heads of State and Government, normally men, and some older than others, can dictate the destiny of Europe?
I would have preferred a parliamentary way of thinking, and we would have preferred the Convention to have chosen its own President, or - better still - its own woman President.
The second element of concern is represented by the episodes of street violence and expulsions, which, though in a different way to Nice or Genoa, also took place in and around Laeken.
I am not sure whether, if there had been more consistent demonstrations in terms of the demonstrators, we would really have prevented serious problems.
The European Parliament has the task of ensuring, in a coherent and untiring fashion, that the strengthening of cooperation in the fields of terrorism and crime does not lead to a weakening of the rights of citizens.
It has to be said that the message and practice stemming from Laeken are contradictory.
However, the future will tell whether the seed sown at Laeken will bear fruit.
For the moment, we must thank the Belgian Presidency for its work and hope that subsequent presidencies will show the same commitment and coherence.
Mr President, I should first like to offer the praise I think is due.
I am extremely pleased that the Presidency has stood by enlargement and the whole programme of enlargement, that there is a continued commitment to concrete negotiations' beginning as from 2002 and that we are aiming to admit the first new Member States in 2004.
That praise, I think, is due.
However, I do not understand the way in which the leadership of the Convention has been put together.
The composition is incredibly one-sided, and we have a huge need for bridge-building in this project.
Where are the critics?
We have had a 'no' vote in Ireland; we have had a 'no' vote in Denmark, admittedly a number of years ago; and we know that there is dissatisfaction among the peoples of Europe.
Where are the critics?
What has become of young people and, especially, women where this issue is concerned?
When Mr Prodi was asked by Danish television what had become of women and young people, he called for honesty and said that, if the EU was to talk with government leaders, it needed men over the age of 30.
If that is the attitude towards how we are to make contact with the people of Europe, then 'thank you for nothing' is what I say.
With regard to the anti-terrorism package, I do not understand why the aim is not to adopt an independent European stance on this issue. I do not understand why there is once again the desire to be the puppy of the United States.
I do not understand why we do not concentrate much more on preventing future terrorism instead of taking the line adopted by the United States.
Mr President, the Laeken Declaration is punctuated by question marks: a sign of the ambiguity which currently exists in relation to the future of the European Union.
Needless to say, the new Convention cannot provide answers to all those questions.
That is why, in my view, priority should be given to improving transparency and a clear demarcation of powers between the European Union and the Member States.
I was pleasantly surprised by the content of the questions concerning this latter point.
It seems that there are no taboo subjects, if even the creeping transfer of powers in the direction of Brussels can be questioned.
I was also surprised, but not pleasantly, by the composition of the Convention' s praesidium: no fewer than twelve people are supposed to make up the total.
I wonder, then, what the role of an ordinary Convention member is.
Not a significant one, I fear.
However, this jeopardises the quality of the proposals which this body makes.
The Convention will be relying on quality. Otherwise, its ideas will simply be put away in a drawer and forgotten about.
Mr President, in defining the agenda for the Convention on the future of the Union, the Laeken Council has deviated from the conclusions of the Nice Council with regard to two points which concern us.
Firstly, whereas Nice declaration No 23 had included in the agenda a point entitled 'The role of national parliaments in the architecture of Europe' , the Laeken Council has watered down that idea under a much vaguer title: 'More democracy, transparency and efficiency in the European Union' .
Under this title, it first of all asks how we can increase the democratic legitimacy of the current institutions and, only in second place, whether the role of the national parliaments needs to be modified.
It is a largely biased approach, since in reality the two questions are just one: recognising a prominent role for national parliaments within the architecture of Europe is the best way to reconcile the Union with its citizens.
Second modification: whereas Nice mentioned the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in a purely neutral way, Laeken includes another idea in the agenda, the idea of a European constitution, that is, a clearly supranational fundamental text rather than a treaty.
It therefore appears, Mr President, that between Nice and Laeken, the federalist pressure groups have taken charge.
They have managed to have modifications adopted, very significantly, which are both aimed at minimising the role of national democracies.
This approach does not correspond with the wishes of our citizens and it will have to be corrected in the years to come.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even considered rather dispassionately, it is possible that the Laeken Summit will one day appear to be a waypoint at which the Europeans stopped stumbling along, found their feet again and set out to find a way out of the blind alley of Nice.
If this proves to be the case - we are just at the beginning of this process - then this would certainly be associated with the Belgian Presidency and your name, Mr Verhofstadt, and I am quite happy to congratulate you on this now in advance, just in case!
There are two reasons for this development, and it is useful to run over them once more.
What caused this to happen?
Certainly the strong, even damning, criticism of the outcome of Nice was a factor.
The European Parliament played a vital role here; this House was the source of the vast majority of the criticism directed towards Nice, although we recognise and acknowledge the fact that the formal conditions for enlargement were agreed on there.
My second point is that the events of 11 September and everything which happened in their wake have made it more than clear that Europe will only be taken seriously in the future if it acts as a community and that we need to get back on track and work towards developing as a community.
These are the two reasons.
Now we have the Convention which we wanted, and we are therefore also responsible for what emerges from it.
We must not overlook this.
The outcome of the Convention will only carry political weight if it is supported by as broad a consensus as possible.
That is why we need to make our contribution in the Convention to producing a draft treaty which has broad support.
Only then will it afterwards stand a chance of also uniting the Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament wanted this Convention, and now we have got it.
We share in this success, and have you to thank for it having been possible.
The Convention's flaws have been alluded to here several times, but we can and will take care that these blemishes are insignificant and will be forgotten by the time the work is done.
My second remark follows on from what Mr Nassauer said: the Convention puts Parliament, too, in a new position of responsibility.
The reform of the institutions is, for the first time, in our hands too.
We bear responsibility no longer only for the demands and visions that we develop here, but also for the compromises and results.
That is something new and we will have to get used to it.
My third point is that the Convention has been given the broad mandate we wanted it to have.
That is an opportunity and a danger in equal measure.
The Convention must not turn itself into an expanded Intergovernmental Conference, but likewise it must not reduce itself to the level of being just a forum for discussion.
It must work towards broad consensus and must concentrate its attention on those strategic proposals for reform that point the way ahead to future developments and open up the road that leads to them.
Fourthly, the word 'constitution' is now to be found for the first time in an official Council document, which is quite something.
It is not certain whether a draft constitution will be the final result, but what we can be sure of is that the Convention must direct all its efforts at what we - borrowing the expression of that great European, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant - might call the Convention's categorical imperative, that every one of its proposals must also be capable of becoming a basic component of a European constitution.
It is towards that goal that it must work.
Fifthly, Europe is becoming ever more important, yet of decreasing interest to its own citizens.
They are, admittedly, not yet opposed to the European Union, but they are no longer so sure why they are meant to be in favour of it.
We want Europe's citizens to regain the knowledge of why we are uniting Europe.
The European Union must stand for a European model of society and for a European world vision.
What we are about is Europe's self-assertion - economic, political and, not least, cultural - and the preservation of a European way of life!
This has acquired an added dimension since 11 September.
The EU could be sunk by this new challenge, but it could grow through it - indeed, I am quite sure that it will.
(Applause)
Madam President, first of all, I would like to apologise to the Members of the European Parliament since I must shortly leave for Canada.
There is another European Union-Canada Summit.
In order to get there on time, I must leave for the airport at 7.00 p.m.
It is for this reason that myself and Romano Prodi, since we are leaving for Canada together, must apologise for not being able to participate in the debate until the end.
I apologise to all the Members, especially those MEPs with whom I have had very intense contacts over recent weeks and months: Mr Brok, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano.
I am sorry that I will not be able to hear them speak, but in any event I hope to continue the contacts we have established in order to prepare this Convention properly.
At the beginning of the debate - and I should like to thank various group leaders for their support and their words of praise for the Belgian Presidency - there were a few jokey comments to the effect that the Convention and its praesidium consist of nothing but Socialists and Christian Democrats, and that the only Liberal among them, namely Mr Giscard d'Estaing, has, in fact, transferred to the Christian-Democrats.
I, for my part, am quite happy for the Socialists and Christian Democrats to dominate the Convention. It may not be strictly my place to say this, but perhaps I am allowed this leeway at the end of the Presidency.
Mr Poettering, there are currently two Liberals in the Council, as opposed to none before. Maybe, with your help, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission will also be Liberals.
So, in fact, we as Liberals are not too badly represented in the European institutions.
Some speakers have questioned the link between the Laeken Declaration and the Nice process. There should not be a common link.
Nice is to be adopted; Nice is to be ratified. This is necessary to allow enlargement to work at a practical level as from 2004.
It would be a big mistake if we did not do this and if Nice were to be once again mixed up with the Laeken Declaration and the future of Europe.
We would then once again talk about the Nice leftovers instead of the future of Europe.
The great advantage of the Convention is that it breaks with traditional methods precisely at this moment.
The old method entailed establishing, after each treaty amendment, that agreement had not been reached on two or three points, and these two or three points would then be transferred to the next Intergovernmental Conference, which would add a few fresh points and which would try to change the Treaty in the same way.
If agreement was not reached at that stage, fresh leftovers would be created.
The past decade of the European Union has been marked by a history of constantly moving from leftover to leftover, the swill becoming lighter and lighter each time, and the fundamental questions losing weight all the time.
This mechanism is now being discontinued.
This time round, fundamental questions will be put forward.
Mrs Thyssen has stated that these are merely questions that I am posing and for which Mr Dehaene will need to provide the answers.
It is actually quite simple.
Mr Dehaene has helped me draft the questions, and I will now return the favour and help him give the answers in the coming months.
This is also what will actually happen.
The Laeken group is a group of which Mr Dehaene and Mr Amato form a part.
This group will always continue to work as a group of friends and, on that basis, a number of additional incentives can be given, involving Mr Delors, Mr Geremek, Mr Miliband and the other members.
(FR) I would also like to say to the President that it was not desire which was lacking when it came to responding immediately to the questions posed.
My colleagues have often said to me, 'no, it is not a question you can ask' .
I would say, 'why?'
'Because the answer is implied in the question' .
Nevertheless, Mrs Thyssen and all the other Members who have spoken can rest assured that I am going to do my best in the Intergovernmental Conference, in the regular contacts I will have with the various members of the praesidium and the Convention, to help to find the answers to the questions posed in the declaration.
With regard to the membership of the praesidium, there has been mention of the absence of women.
I completely agree and I propose that three men and nine women now be designated by the national parliaments and the European Parliament.
All is not lost yet, since only three of the twelve places have been allocated.
I also truly hope that the European Parliament, the national parliaments and the various representatives will be able to do this.
I would like to end by saying something about the relationship between the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
I believe that what is very important is that a praesidium has been created, that that praesidium consists of twelve people and that amongst those twelve people, two will be representatives of the European Parliament.
The same number will represent the national parliaments.
I believe that these two people are going to have to play an important role, because it will be this group of twelve which prepares things, which prepares the agendas.
Not all the decisions can be taken by a Convention of 113 people.
It must be prepared.
The praesidium is going to play a dominating role in this respect and in that praesidium there will naturally be two representatives of the European Parliament.
Finally, I would like to stress that I believe it is very important that for the first time there will also be representation in the Convention from the so-called constitutional regions, but the more exact term is 'regions with legislative powers' .
I am the Prime Minister of a country with a federal structure.
It is the same in Germany, in Austria and in other countries.
Little by little, many other countries are beginning to adopt federalism within their institutional system.
And it is working well, because federalism is the only way we have to allow different communities, different cultures and populations who speak different languages to live together, without giving rise to what happens in other parts of the world, where there is conflict.
I would therefore like to stress that we should not use the word 'federalism' in a negative sense.
I sometimes hear people say that federalism spells disaster.
Quite the opposite.
Throughout the world, federalism demonstrates that it is the only way for communities to live together without conflict, without turning to violence, as is the case in many parts of the world.
(Applause) And it is for that reason that I personally believe it is important and an enormous step forward that the regions with legislative powers can be represented.
I have achieved this because I have also been helped by the President of the Committee of the Regions.
I do not need to tell you that around the Council table there were certain people who found it difficult to include the words 'regions with legislative powers' in the declaration and difficult to recognise, as the European Council, that those regions may have a place and a say.
It has finally been accepted and that is thanks to the President of the Committee of the Regions, Mr Chabert, whom I had asked to send me a letter.
The letter which he had sent me said: the Committee of the Regions must be represented and we must demand that the different members of the Committee of the Regions be represented.
The regions and cities, but also the regions with administrative powers.
I have therefore been able to use the authority of the Committee of the Regions to include these regions in the text for the first time.
I wanted to stress this here this afternoon, since I feel that they have an important role to play.
There will be discussion of the distribution of competences, the new instruments, institutions and the future European constitution.
I personally believe that we must do this together, excluding nobody, and allowing every section of our European Union to express its view.
(Applause)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief, firstly because I do not want Mr Verhofstadt to go without me and I have no desire to swim to Canada, and secondly because I can say with satisfaction that this debate was a debate of great unity, a moment of satisfaction, given that, a few months ago, none of us imagined that a Convention was possible.
I also welcome the fact that the issue of reaching agreement on the agencies, although certainly a negative point, was not blown out of all proportion as it was in the mass media.
I have also noted the suggestions you have made on the subject of the Convention; I have noted the proposals to strengthen the role of the Court of Justice: I will bear them all in mind in the future and I therefore feel that we can now genuinely get down to working hard, all together, to prepare for the forthcoming Convention.
Given that we are working in this atmosphere of cooperation, I would just like to make one request - or rather, reiterate a call that I have already made to the Council - to my friend Mr Verhofstadt, for genuine cooperation in the forthcoming months so that we can reform the institutions without amending the Treaties.
Our proposal on governance is the fruit of many months of cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, work which, in my opinion, has produced sound, tangible results.
We expect similar commitment from the Council, for the preparations for the Convention have to consist of prior work carried out together: our work on governance, which has yielded positive results and certainly cannot progress without equal input from the Council.
Lastly, I would like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Prodi, of course we understand why you are obliged to leave the House at this point.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with Laeken we may have found an antidote to some of the poisons present in the Treaty of Nice.
The convening of a constituent Convention - constituent because this Convention will give rise to the Constitution for the new Europe - means restoring a political soul to Europe, in other words thinking about what is to be the future home of us all.
Parliament must therefore welcome the success of the Summit and make sure that the Convention' s work reaches its appropriate conclusion in an Intergovernmental Conference, which will have to draw up the new Constitutional Treaty, to bring about the European federation.
Genuine, practical federalism, which also respects the regional level, as the Council has rightly said, which respects minority languages and all peoples, great and small, will burst into the history of this new century as part of the process of European integration, and anyone representing the people of the Valle d' Aosta can only rejoice at that.
We have set a positive process in motion and the enemies of the European Union are already aware of this; we must therefore step up our efforts.
Mr President, the Laeken declaration is couched in words which satisfy one and all, weighty words.
The objective and method, the Convention and political negotiation, are indeed cause for satisfaction.
However, as previous speakers have said, the declaration does not contain any convincing references to the social State, what some people somewhat sheepishly call the social model, sustainable development, viable development, autonomy and hence, if I may put it thus, a viable Union profile.
Maybe the lack of political unification is to blame for this degree of cowardice.
But it is interesting that we have said nothing of any import about the war and we have said nothing of any import about enlargement itself.
I should like to make a comment here, if I may. Why does the purely political decision to accept ten new members exclude - politically that is - two from the Balkan peninsula, from the heart and soft underbelly of Europe?
We have left a black hole in the Balkans.
It is unacceptable and I should like an answer.
Unfortunately, I probably will not get one now or even, I fear, from the Convention.
Mr President, the conclusions from the Laeken Summit are by no means surprising in terms either of their rhetoric or their content.
As usual, the rhetoric is high-flown and hollow at one and the same time.
For the umpteenth time, openness and proximity to the people are promised.
The words chosen falsify what really is the case in a way that, in terms of cynical demagogy, would put to shame the ideologues both of the Third Reich and of Stalinism.
The reality has proved to be completely different, for the summit' s declared ambition that the institutions of the EU should be brought closer to the people turns out in reality to mean that the people of the Member States are ever more excluded by the closed institutions of the EU, which have fatally misunderstood the nature of democracy.
Moreover, the renewed missions are being placed in the hands of three pensioners of an age that makes Chinese statesmanship look like a youth rebellion.
There is no doubt that these three worthy men will be able to step up the dynamic of EU integration, but there are more and more of us who doubt that the EU and its ambitions to be a great power are any kind of solution. On the contrary, they constitute the very problem.
Mr President, let me say first of all that I appreciate the way we can talk to each other here in a fairly intimate atmosphere.
There is no doubt that it is easier to ask important questions than to find the answers to them.
The President's statement notwithstanding, all of us can only wish these answers to be found, but I want to make allowances all the same for the fact that Laeken saw a very important task performed, that of getting the Convention on track with a president who is not only distinguished but whose appointment also augurs well for the future.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights was our most recent opportunity to learn that the success of such a process largely depends on who presides over it, so let me say that the youthful attire of the President-in-Office led me to fear that the Convention would be given a rather 'young' and 'dynamic' chair.
Unlike Mrs Frassoni and Mr Bonde, I was therefore rather pleased to learn that we were still going to give preference to the opinions of those older and wiser - something which marks out the higher cultures.
The inauguration of the Convention was, though, the only outstanding achievement.
Speaking from an Austrian point of view, I find Point 59 regrettable on the grounds that it has turned out to be very narrow and does not do justice to the need for Europe-wide safety standards.
Mr President, I would like to focus on two results of Laeken which I believe to be essential.
The first is the recognition that the consolidation of the third pillar of the European Union, the fight against terrorism in particular, has at last been developed in the way the citizens have been demanding.
The terrible attacks have led even the least aware amongst us to realise that terrorism is a problem for all of us, and that it involves all of us, not just the victims directly affected.
And that terror is not only caused by those who pull the trigger or press the detonator, but also by their accomplices, and we should therefore be pleased with the Council' s decision to create a single list of all groups, bodies and people who support terrorism.
Secondly, the decisions adopted in relation to designing the future of the Union seem to me to be very coherent with the demands of the European Parliament.
I am convinced that the flexibility with which the agenda has been set will allow us to strengthen the instruments of the CFSP during the Convention, because the globalised world in which we live demands that Europe should play a new role and we have provided it with the necessary means to do this, such as the Community diplomatic service.
Mr President, I do not believe that the machine has worked properly, but I assume that my speaking time is over.
Mr President, Minister, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, of the huge number of problems dealt with at Laeken, I would also like to focus on the point which brings us most hope, the declaration on the future of the Union.
It is a good and strong declaration, which takes up several of the ideas to which the French Socialist delegation is very committed.
We are happy to see that the praesidium, which will play a determining role, will be reasonably large, twelve people, which is what we wanted, and it will be led by three strong political personalities whose commitment to Europe is beyond question.
And as a French person, I am delighted to see that in the end an eminent countryman of mine will preside over the group; though an eminent countrywoman would clearly have been better perhaps.
We also approve of the fact that the Commission is represented, not by one commissioner, but by two, who as it happens are both perfectly qualified for that task.
Another good piece of news is that the timetable will be flexible, so that the Convention may enjoy greater freedom.
Finally, we welcome the broad mandate that the Heads of State and Government have granted the Convention.
And we congratulate the Belgian Prime Minister on the firmness with which he has managed to apply this open mandate to many issues which go beyond the purely mechanical institutional field.
It is to this end that I would like to request something: the Convention will have to propose institutional reforms aimed at making the mechanisms work better.
This is all very well, but it can and must also make proposals on content, in response to those questions which the citizens often ask without receiving a clear reply.
What is Europe for?
What are its great missions, within its borders, for its inhabitants, but also in the world?
Which policies is it responsible for leading, particularly in the social field?
What are its competences?
What are its duties in relation to its inhabitants and the rest of the world in terms of solidarity, prosperity and security?
Under the guidance of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, the results relating to this declaration are good.
The Presidency has provided strong impetus, very much helped by Parliament as well, which has given it constant encouragement.
The Laeken Council has launched this Convention into orbit, and it can play a decisive role for the future of Europe.
The future will tell whether Laeken has been an historic turning point.
Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt spoke a lot about the need to improve democratic control.
But we do not need to change the Treaties to improve democratic control.
We can do that using the existing Treaties.
I am not talking about applying Article 42 to bring the third pillar matters into the first pillar, although that would be very desirable.
I am talking about instances such as that last week where Parliament was consulted for the fourth time in a year on a text of which half was missing.
We were asked to approve a regulation to freeze the assets of a list of terrorist organisations; the list was not attached.
The regulation referred to two Council texts, neither of which is available to Parliament.
We voted on amendments covering the absent documents in view of the urgency, but if that text is not amended and, in view of this practice, Parliament really should consider recourse to the European Court of Justice unless Council is prepared to treat us in a fairer and more adult way.
Mr President, the writing on the wall states quite clearly that the Laeken Summit has bolstered a European Union in which big business takes precedence over the interests of the workers and the people in general.
The delegates in Laeken Palace did not hear the stentorian voice of the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators from all over Europe: the voice of the poor, of the unemployed, of the people with no job security and of the victims of soul-destroying exploitation who actually create our wealth.
They did not and could not hear their fight and their demand for a different Europe, a Europe of peace and friendship between nations, not a Europe of European armies, intervention and war, a Europe in which social rights and democratic freedoms are respected and strengthened, not a Europe of European arrest warrants, Eurojust and the law on terrorism which use 11 September as a pretext for classifying the social and political fight for a better tomorrow as terrorism.
That is why I believe that the Convention is not the answer; anyway it is an advisory forum and will, I fear, just end up pulling the wool over the people's eyes.
Continuing and developing the unprecedented wave of protest which surrounded Laeken is our only hope and our only way out.
Mr President, I am concerned that the European Constitution is going to be drafted by just 60 people, who it is to be hoped will be worthy of the task but are still a small number to represent hundreds of millions of citizens.
A constituent assembly would have been more appropriate.
In this regard, it is significant that the vice-president is to be Giuliano Amato, who is a member of the Italian and European left but, most importantly, an advocate of that oligarchic desire to have the institutions run just by a few aristocrats, by a small, unelected elite.
We hope that, at least, once the Constitution has been drafted, it will be possible for both national parliaments and this House to amend it, where necessary, unlike the situation with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Mr President, at Laeken, a number of steps forward have, at last, been taken towards the creation of a stronger Europe with wider borders.
The Convention will have to pave the way for a Constitution which establishes the respective competences of the institutions and includes the founding values underlying our Union as well, but it will also have to represent an essential stage in terms of the harmonisation of the laws of our countries, not least in judicial matters.
However, we must make haste and decide before the end of 2003 to avoid the elections getting in the way of the process and the Constitution being adopted slap-bang in the middle of the electoral campaign.
Without the Constitution, without new institutions, it will be difficult to achieve the enlargement which we all, like President Prodi, see as irreversible.
Moreover, I welcome the fact that the Laeken conclusions reserve a chapter for relations with Russia, a country which deserves increasing attention from the Union.
At Laeken, Europe, at last, spoke out authoritatively on major issues such as combating terrorism, and the decision to adopt what has been dubbed the first 'Marshall Plan' for Palestine is confirmation of Europe' s intention not just to wipe out terrorism through military force - as is right and proper - but also to resolve the issues by political means.
The Italian proposal on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian crisis has moved on from declarations of principle to the practical planning stage.
Moreover, we feel that the decision to establish joint control of external borders is extremely positive.
Of course, there is still a great deal left to do.
Not all the issues were resolved at Laeken: I refer to the sites of the agencies, which should be decided on the basis of the specific suitability of the applicant cities and not allocated on the basis of incomprehensible vetoes.
However, it is our duty to be optimistic: the fate of Europe depends not least on our will, on the will of the European Parliament and the national parliaments which represent the people of the Union.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the European Council's Laeken Declarations express the opinion that the European project derives its legitimacy from its democratic, transparent and efficient institutions.
The Council having then put the question - which it asked the Convention to discuss - whether Parliament should play an enhanced role, it will probably not surprise you that I, as a parliamentarian, answer that unreservedly in the affirmative, for this Parliament is the only one of the institutions to be directly elected by the people.
All its sittings are in public and comprehensible - I wish the Council's were - and the speed with which we are capable of reaching decisions - on the European arrest warrant for example - leads me to the conclusion that we are more efficient than the Council and, in many ways, even more so than the Commission.
So, when the Council at Laeken welcomes the Commission's White Paper on European governance and the so-called Mandelkern report and expects an action plan on the subject from the Commission in the first half of 2002, I hope that, when doing so, the Council has in mind the intention of strengthening Parliament's role .
Quite apart from that, we would, as parliamentarians, be happy to discuss new forms of governance with the Commission and the Council.
So, for example, the Commission has proposed an interinstitutional working party, but I gather that the Council has so far found that unacceptable and has declined to take part in it.
I hope we can at least manage, before Barcelona and Seville, to have in-depth discussions with the Council and the Commission on new forms of governance, which will not even be conceivable without Parliament's consent.
I am aware that many governments find us too independent and self-sufficient, and the Commission and the Council are sometimes disturbed by our excessive 'interference' in details.
As a Parliament, we are also prepared to accept new ways of dividing up the work between ourselves, the Commission and the Council, for we too must prepare ourselves for an enlarged EU.
We take the view, though, that any delegation of tasks must involve a call-back mechanism, for the search for new forms of European governance and the consideration of new divisions of competences between the EU and the Member States must not be at the expense of European parliamentary life.
On the contrary, Parliament's role must be solidly entrenched in the European constitution.
Let me make one last comment on what we call civil society.
The European Council has decided to set up a forum, something for which Mr Barnier, in his role as Commissioner, has frequently and with verve expressed his open support.
We welcome the establishment of such a forum, but, just as a forum of this sort supplements the deliberations of the Convention rather than supplanting them, so civil society and discussions within it do not replace Parliament, but add something to it.
It is in this sense that we very much desire dialogue with civil society and with our citizens, and we hope that the Council and the Commission do not see this as over against Parliament, but as an addition to it.
Mr President, the Laeken declaration set the scene for a broad public discussion about the future of Europe.
That is a good thing.
What is not, however, good enough is that three men are being employed to head up this work.
Experience all goes to show that the composition of the Convention will also be one-sided.
The Laeken declaration states, moreover, that deputies may only be allowed to step in if the right member is absent.
Yet deputising is one of the classic opportunities women have for obtaining any kind of representation when it comes to this type of work.
I must therefore call upon the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies to arrange matters in such a way that it is permitted to call in deputies and - rather more ambitiously - call upon them to arrange for everyone to be represented by a deputy of the opposite sex.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at this point I would like to respond to certain comments you have made.
I must also, unfortunately, have to ask you to excuse me, but I did not imagine that we were going to overrun to this extent, and I have another commitment, also relating to this debate on the future of Europe.
I clearly do not agree with all the views expressed by Mr Krarup on the pompous rhetoric of Laeken.
On the contrary, I believe that the Convention method completely opens up the game.
I believe that one of the elements, one of our possible fears in relation to this Laeken declaration, is that it does not commit the members of the Convention to certain closed questions, or in any event does not allow all the issues which are vital to the future of Europe to be dealt with.
The same speaker spoke of a lack of democracy.
I would therefore like to reply to him, as well as to Mr Swoboda, who contrasts the representative or democratic characteristics of the Council with those of the European Parliament.
The European Parliament, Mr Swoboda, is a representative democratic institution, of course, and I respect it fully.
But to therefore reduce the representative nature of the Council is going too far.
(Protests from Mr Swoboda)
That is what I understood you to say, and, though I have misunderstood, all the same I am going to say that I think the Ministers or Prime Ministers who attend Councils can be questioned in each Member State.
There are national parliaments for that.
I can tell you that I am ill-treated in my country, because almost every week, at least when I am there, I am asked what I do in the European institutions.
I believe that this is not the right debate in which to establish a hierarchy in terms of the representativeness of the institutions.
Each institution has its place.
I willingly concede that the important thing is that we establish a balance between the institutions, that one institution does not completely dominate another.
I am very happy to say, for example, that my current experience of the European Parliament has convinced me that it must undoubtedly have more powers and play a more important specific role in the future than it does at the moment.
And in particular - and I am straying from the current debate for a second - in terms of what we can expect if the international coalition continues as it is, if it continues to play a role, if we continue to believe that it is necessary, and I believe that it is necessary in order to combat terrorism, the European Parliament must closely monitor the decisions made by European Councils and also by the Member States of the Union, because as I have said previously, and I will continue to repeat, there are several dangers in this respect.
Firstly there is the danger of corrupting the quality of democracy and of life in our countries.
The second danger, which I am very sensitive to, is that, for a certain number of political regimes, the fight, and I am not talking about European States here, but it does concern us in terms of our relations with these countries, for a certain number of countries with tough regimes, there is a temptation to confuse the fight against terrorism with a fight against the country' s democratic opponents, against the country' s opposition.
We must clearly take this into account.
Thirdly, Mr Lannoye has just mentioned the relationship between the European Union and the United States.
We must also be careful in this respect.
I believe that we should not be automatically led along, without debate, without discussion, without even, at times, consultation, in blind solidarity with the United States.
I believe that the European Union has the right and the duty to express its differences with the United States.
I have total respect for the United States, I believe that we undoubtedly have a special partnership with the United States, but I believe that in the coalition put together after 11 September, it was good that the European Union was there to express a slightly different approach, to express certain guarantees and assurances, and also to play the role that the European Union has played within the Arab countries, within the Islamic world.
I do not therefore think that the European Union will ever become a kind of copy of the United States of America.
I must tell you that I do not want that at all.
Of course, I respect the American model.
In many respects, it is extremely positive, but it is not transposable.
It is not desirable to transpose it.
And I believe that the European Union must retain its own character.
Many questions have concerned the Convention.
I must talk about the regrets concerning the composition of the trio heading the Convention.
I believe that all three of the personalities involved are very committed to the European project and also have an extremely modern, forward-looking and committed view of the European Union and, something which is perhaps important, enjoy great reputations and a network of relations, academic, political and others, which may ensure that if they defend a point of view, they have a good chance of being heard, even by the European Council.
This is of no small importance.
I would like to say that the Convention, which is perhaps the greatest virtue of the Laeken declaration - and I have already had the opportunity to say this in the European Parliament -, will in reality become what the members of the Convention want to make of it.
You have a praesidium which is not there pro forma, because it is a praesidium which counts.
The number of people in this praesidium will ensure that it is heard.
It is very representative of the different components of the Convention and of the European decision-making world.
I therefore believe that with the trio in question, with this praesidium, the meetings will be well-organised, the meetings and the issues will be well-developed, and above all - and this morning I heard Mr Dehaene voice his opinion on this issue on the radio - I think that what will be important is that the options presented by the Convention to the IGC be clear, that they do not leave room for too many interpretations at the IGC.
Of course, the IGC can accept them or refuse them.
But what is certain is that, if these options are well-balanced, if they are specific, if they are well-targeted and if they are strongly supported, there will be little room for the Council to ignore them, otherwise the Council will not be fulfilling its political duty, or in any event it will be taking a risk.
It will be at that point that the political responsibility of the Council will clearly be called into question.
I therefore have great confidence in the way the Convention is going to develop.
I will add another factor, which is that the Laeken declaration offers all of us who believe in a more integrated Europe a fantastic opportunity to engage in a little European pedagogy, in this respect at least.
I am thinking in particular of young people.
We must not only talk of perspectives, which is clearly very important, but at the same time we must try to educate young people in relation to Europe, to explain to them how we work, to explain to them that Europe deals much more directly with their concerns than people believe or than the press indicates.
This is another way to use this Convention.
I think that I have been clear about the Convention.
The idea of a more integrated European diplomatic service has been mentioned.
I believe that the conclusions of the summit contain a passage on consular cooperation.
This is a start.
The opening of common consulates will be a first step and I hope that we will go further.
I share Mrs LalumiÃšre' s view that the Convention should not only examine institutional issues but also the content of policies.
Opinion polls indicate that our citizens are in favour of more resolute European actions in various fields, such as social policy, foreign and defence policy and environmental protection.
I believe that the Convention should examine how we should respond to these expectations, by adjusting the competences and tasks of the Union if necessary.
There has been mention of a social deficit.
I think I can say - Mr Dehousse quite rightly pointed this out previously - that one of the aspects which has clearly been most successful during this Presidency is precisely the firm innovative progress made, because this is important, on a social level.
Think for example of the social indicators, of the quality of employment.
I believe that this is of importance.
Think also of the European social conciliator.
There are a whole series of completely new elements here which are genuine tools for supporting a real social policy which is more than just packaging or a facelift.
The work carried out by Mrs Onckelinks from this point of view, with Mr van den Broek, is absolutely remarkable and they have played a crucial role, in our view at least, in the success of the Belgian Presidency.
This is a fundamentally important element.
To a certain extent this relates to what Mrs LalumiÃšre has requested, which is that we clearly concern ourselves with more than the merely institutional issues.
I said just a moment ago that I fully share that point of view.
Unfortunately I cannot stay here much longer.
I still want to say a word about governance and the reform of the Council.
I agree with Mr Martin on the need to take measures without delay in order to bring the Union closer to its citizens and improve the functioning of the European institutions.
The Convention will discuss measures which will lead to a modification of the Treaties in 2004.
However, the Laeken European Council has highlighted measures which may be taken straight away.
In this context, we have welcomed the White Paper on European Governance, as well as the Secretary-General of the Council' s intention to present proposals to the European Council in Barcelona aimed at improving the functioning of the Council.
The European Council in Seville will draw operational conclusions from it.
I think I have responded as fully as possible to the list of interventions which the Prime Minister has not yet been able to reply to.
I hope that you will forgive me for not being able to stay.
I am really sorry, especially since I enjoy being amongst you, because I have come to know this Parliament.
I have heard many pertinent interventions here, which show a certain tendency towards freedom of expression and autonomy, and I have also noted an element which is rarely seen in national parliaments and that is that different kinds of interventions may be heard coming from a single group.
There is a freedom and a freshness in this which I like very much.
I hope that one day - as I have already said, but I will repeat it - I will be able to return to this House to refresh my spirit.
Mr President, the President of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt, stated in his presentation that in Laeken there were no taboos whatsoever.
However, it is crystal clear that the stateless-nations-taboo is more present today than ever before.
But as Victor Hugo said, "nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come" .
Right now, the idea of self-determination is present in the Basque people' s mind.
The present nation-states were born at a certain moment with an internal trend towards their transformation.
The peoples and cultures of Europe on the contrary have no known date of birth.
More importantly, there is no reason for their disappearance unless we condemn them to such a fate.
As a matter of fact, their disappearance would be not only a loss to humanity but the demolition of the best basis for the political future of Europe.
Mr President, the Representative of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Laeken European Council which concludes the Belgian Presidency of the Union has been a success.
I do not say this out of courtesy or convenience but because I profoundly believe that the Heads of State and Government, over recent days, have sent the signal that the Europeans were waiting for, one of clarity and the rejection of pretence.
The Laeken Summit has achieved its main ambition: to adopt a declaration on the future of Europe, opening the way to the future great reform of the Union.
As the President-in-Office of the Council has stressed, there was no taboo at Laeken, no issue has been avoided, and I hope that this formula will become a reality, since European construction has too often been opaque, or at least the reserve of the initiated.
Please allow me, on behalf of the French delegation of the PPE-DE Group, to express our pleasure at the nomination of Mr ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing as president of the Convention, as well as Mr Giuliano Amato and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as vice-presidents.
These eminent people are renowned for their experience and their determination to persuade people to favour a Europe which fully and democratically carries out its competences, but only its competences, which would be clearly defined.
At a time when Europe has a currency, is being enlarged and is trying to provide globalisation with a soul and with values, it is high time that we reviewed our vision of public life and the relations between our citizens and their institutions at all levels.
A new era was begun at Laeken.
We are delighted.
But there is still a long way to go.
We must therefore continue with our efforts.
Mr President, we are bringing the Belgian Presidency to a close, and that should surely be in the presence of the Council, normally speaking.
The Belgian Presidency has been congratulated on the fact that the Ministers have attended the sittings so regularly, yet we are now evaluating their Presidency without any of the Council members being present.
I would question the validity of continuing this debate.
Whom are we actually addressing?
Well, that is for the subsequent speakers to decide.
Mr President, after 11 September, we succeeded in cutting back on the leeway which terrorists had, by taking numerous and effective European measures.
At the same time, we have realised that the security which we promote by doing this forms part of a greater security and that we essentially touch a deeper, more fundamental issue, namely the great inequality in this world, which often serves as a breeding ground for conflicts.
If security is not shared, it has no chance of succeeding.
One in five people in this world do not have access to basic education or basic health care.
This requires a multilateral approach.
At present, we notice how the United States, which has operated more multilaterally over the past few months, has now started to act more unilaterally again over the past few days by withdrawing from the ABM Treaty, and is also taking a far more unilateral course with regard to a number of other treaties.
It is of the utmost importance for us, as Europe, to try to use this large coalition to exert pressure so that we continue to operate multilaterally: making enormous investments in new technologies and then winding up with too little funding, attention and energy to help fight poverty in the world is, of course, ultimately not the most effective way of achieving shared security.
Aid is needed for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, once again with Europe at the helm, so that not only the military aspect is highlighted, but that shared security is sought via the route of reconstruction.
The same applies, in fact, to the Middle East. Europe must exert pressure and not be frightened of having a military presence within NATO using its own institutional forms and organisation - the Convention will need to create an institutional form for this - but must at the same time also have the courage to commit itself to this shared security.
And I wish this fundamental aspect had been slightly more underlined at the Laeken Summit.
Although reference is made to the unilateral cancellation of the ABM Treaty by the US and to Europe' s leading role as the world' s greatest commercial power, we could, and should, do more about shared security.
I would call on the Presidency and the Commission to continue to take initiatives in this area, also in the coming weeks, both with regard to the Middle East, the Balkans and Afghanistan.
We are on the right track.
There are tendencies towards unilateralism: let us not get drawn into this, let us persuade our allies to adopt a multilateral approach and give Europe a central role in this.
Mr President, it has not been an easy task for the Belgian Presidency.
Despite careful planning and many years of preparation, everything was brutally overturned after 11 September 2001.
The developments in Afghanistan and the fight against terrorism have completely dominated the agenda.
I had intended to congratulate the Belgians on nonetheless having done a very good job.
Perhaps someone could pass that message on to the President-in-Office of the Council.
Where Laeken is concerned, my group is pleased that the declaration was so ambitious.
It poses the right questions and will enable the Convention to work constructively and with an open mind.
Many of the questions formulated concerning, for example, the path towards a constitution and a clearer division of competences, coincide well with the agenda of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
Despite their long experience and considerable commitment, there is nonetheless a certain amount of doubt about the three well-known statesmen appointed to the Bureau.
Will these three gentlemen of quite mature years really be able to enthuse people, especially young people, when it comes to the debate about the future?
It would have been good to have had people of rather more mixed ages and, as many in this House have pointed out, a woman in the Bureau, for more than half of the population of the EU does in fact consist of women.
Mr President, to the outside world, particularly the Netherlands, the Laeken Summit was a meeting of Heads of Government characterised by internal strife.
Strife about who would become the president of the Convention and strife about which country would house which European agency.
These two points completely dominated the Dutch media.
Fortunately, however, something good came out of it as well.
The European Summit has decided on the Convention and not only on the President and two Vice-Presidents, which I am happy about, but also about the tasks given to the Convention.
Luckily, these are very broadly based.
The Convention will need to better distribute and define the Union' s powers and will need to check how the system of treaties and Union legislation can be simplified and in which ways more democracy and transparency can be created in the Union.
And concerning this transparency, I can already say that I, for one, opt for the European Council of Ministers' having the role of a senate, based on the model of the German Federal Council - a ministerial council which, by law, meets in public.
The European Summit has also asked the Convention to develop an idea of a constitution for the Union and to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into it.
This is a very fine initial package.
However, I would say at the same time that, in our view, more is needed.
The Convention will also need to examine how the Second and Third Pillars can be accommodated within Community policy.
Migration policy has already more or less been accommodated in this way, and policy on internal security is now the sector which is experiencing rapid growth at Community level since the dramatic events of 11 September.
However, foreign and security policy is still intergovernmental, and Mr Solana' s role is made almost impossible, given the way the European Union is structured.
We would also like to embed this policy, and it would be better if Mr Solana became Vice-President of the European Commission.
Finally, this time round, the Summit has chosen a president and two vice-presidents for the Convention.
The role could have been even more solid if the Convention itself had been able to choose its president on the recommendation of the Summit.
There might then perhaps even have been a woman amongst them.
As far as we are concerned, the Convention might also come up with the idea of choosing the President of the European Commission in future.
This could be done by the European Parliament.
The Belgian Presidency has faced a large number of problems, but the fact that it has brought the Convention to a conclusion ultimately makes me think positively about a Presidency that has been dogged by many problems.
Mr President, great declarations and little progress, summits come and go and they are all the same.
Apart from the expected launch of the Convention, Laeken has provided few concrete results.
Happily, at Lisbon, Europe had defined new ambitions in terms of economic growth and employment.
In relation to that essential objective, Laeken was content to reiterate the Lisbon decisions.
It is better than nothing but takes us no further.
In terms of fiscal coordination, Laeken takes us to the end of 2002, but it is becoming clear that at Feira, fiscal Europe met with an impasse.
The Feira agreement should lead to the exchange of information between Member States.
The day when each citizen will pay the tax laid down by its own parliament, any desire for fiscal harmonisation, and healthy fiscal competition, will come to nothing.
Each Member State will redefine its own fiscal policy.
The others will have to provide the required information so that each person is taxed according to his nationality.
Certain dependent or associated territories balk at adopting the exchange of information.
Switzerland and other third countries refuse the system because they regard it as violating banking secrecy.
Like Austria, Luxembourg and perhaps some others will not implement Feira without an agreement which extends to important financial markets outside the Union.
Deadlock is still assured.
I appeal to President Prodi to propose a pay-as-you-earn system on savings revenue as a direct European tax.
Such a system would be accepted by the public if it is in full discharge, that is to say that it exempts the citizen from any other additional tax.
A pay-as-you-earn system would prevent the enormous bureaucratic system which an exchange of information would imply, but above all, such a European tax could be payable on European assets in the United States, Switzerland and other countries.
This would increase the Union' s income and allow us to reduce the current national contributions.
Mr President, take this idea on board, and you will really bring progress to Europe.
Mainly thanks to the Belgian Presidency, the discussion on the future of Europe has been broadened to involve MEPs and it is becoming a public discussion.
This is to be welcomed, but there is also a considerable risk of the Convention acquiring Babel-like features, because it is open to all topics and all opinions.
In their Laeken Declaration, the Heads of Government have chosen fine words to say ultimately nothing.
They have presented the many questions which they themselves had not been able to answer for ten years to a Convention which is only being given a few months to come up with the answers.
It also remains to be seen whether the Convention can narrow the gulf between the EU and the people.
People are not interested in the redistribution of power between the institutions.
What people care about is the content of the decisions, rather than the level at which they are adopted.
Europe is not served by a trench war between federalists and intergovernmentalists.
More intensive cooperation in gradual steps is what is required.
It will then transpire that the Community method is the only viable route to take.
The ideological battle about Europe' s future only has losers.
As far as I am concerned, Laeken should have stated this.
Mr President, Laeken has opened the door to the development of a draft constitution on the basis of the Community method.
The mandate is right for it, the procedure is suited to it, and whether something of the sort is achieved or not is up to the Convention itself.
Nor can I join in the criticism levelled at the composition of the praesidium, believing as I do that the people at the top will no longer be in thrall to anyone, but will have only their own conceptions of the Europe of the future.
This represents a great opportunity.
We should not find fault with a person's age if that is a sign of an independence that can contribute much to the matter in hand.
Apart from this, I think it extraordinarily important that the right technical conditions be achieved in this matter.
It is of the essence that the secretariat is appointed by the Council, but with the possibility of consulting the Commission and Parliament.
I believe it would be generous on the part of the Council to offer the Commission and Parliament truly balanced and equal representation on the secretariat in order to achieve the right working conditions on that basis.
The technical aspects at the outset are sometimes decisive as regards the content resulting at the end.
Of all enterprises, the European Council is surely the one most in need of reform, and it is making a start by concentrating on great matters such as the creation of the European Convention, in which it has been successful.
If, though, it loses itself in detail through the General Affairs Council or Councils of Ministers not getting things straight, it makes itself look ridiculous. We again saw this, for example, over the issue of the agencies.
So we can only recommend to future Presidencies of the Council that the precondition for success on the really big issues is that they should not deal with every triviality at a sitting of the European Council.
Mr President, I welcome the outcome of the Laeken summit.
On balance it is a very positive one.
The decision to establish a European Convention paralleled by a forum for civil society is a historic one in its proportions.
Never again will the future of Europe be decided behind closed doors, provided we do our work constructively in the Convention.
I particularly welcome the possibility of a European constitution as a possible outcome.
As has been said by Mr Verhofstadt, there should be no taboos in our debate and the idea of federalism and a constitution for Europe could guarantee the role of the citizens in small states better than any other form of governance.
I endorse wholeheartedly the decision of the European summit to give its support to Yasser Arafat as the leader of the Palestinian people and I condemn without reservation the misuse of the Security Council veto in blocking the appointment of international observers to the Middle East conflict.
These decisions, however, were tarnished by an unseemly squabble among some Member States about the location of European agencies which reflected the worst features of the old way of running Europe.
I am also disappointed the Council did not give its explicit support for a legal framework for public services in the context of competition regulations, as the European Parliament urged.
Finally, I also believe it was a serious mistake to back off from a decision to nominate a European Union peace-keeping force for Afghanistan under a UN mandate.
This unfortunately now leaves this area to the dictates of the interests of the more powerful states on the world stage and fails to provide a political presence and role for European values.
Could I finally say that we should ease up a little on the ageism in relation to the praesidium.
I am more interested in the originality or old age of the ideas of these three individuals rather than their chronological age.
I do think, however, that had we tried, we could have found an older woman who could have also made an important contribution to the praesidium.
Mr President, apart from the fact that it is only partially present in this House, I believe we must acknowledge that the Belgian Presidency has not disappointed and that it has been up to the job of dealing with these clearly very difficult circumstances.
I believe that they have thoroughly understood that the task of a Presidency is to bring together wills, to forge consensus, so that the European Union may move ahead.
The decisions taken in relation to the declaration on the future of Europe, in relation to the Convention method, in relation to making the common security and defence policy operative, the declarations on the Middle East peace process, Afghanistan, etc. and above all, in relation to the fight against terrorism, are going to allow the European Union to move forward and make progress.
What we have to do now is turn declarations into deeds, so that our actions do not remain merely rhetorical, particularly in relation to the fight against terrorism.
I believe that the views of the terrorists and their friends, who very much disliked the decisions taken at Laeken, clearly demonstrate that we are moving in the right direction.
What we now have to do, once we have consolidated the internal aspects of our project, is turn Europe into an international operator capable of comprehensive action with regard to the challenges facing the world, a world in which nations are too big to resolve their small problems and too small to resolve the big problems we are faced with on a global scale.
A European Union which is able to act with one voice and independently in different scenarios and regions and which is able to employ a wide range of political, economic, commercial, civil and military measures which will allow it to achieve its foreign policy objectives.
We therefore congratulate the Belgian Presidency, Mr President.
I believe that we are working in the right direction, and I hope that the declarations of the European Council in Laeken, which has been a good finale to a brilliant Presidency, can quickly be turned into concrete actions which, as I said at the beginning, will allow the European Union to make significant progress in its project of political consolidation.
Mr President, we can celebrate today a number of victories for the European Parliament on things which, not very long ago, we were told would never possibly be agreed at the Laeken European Council.
For a start we have a Convention - and I am particularly pleased at this because I think I was the first one to suggest nearly two years ago now, that the Convention method that was used for drafting the Charter of Rights could equally be used to prepare a revision of the Treaties.
We were told that it would be restricted to just four subjects and now it is clear that the agenda is wide open.
It will produce a single document with recommendations, not just listing every single option that anybody can think of.
It will of course come up with options when there is a division, but it will work towards reaching a broad consensus as the basis for the work of the IGC.
On all that we can be pleased.
The fly in the ointment is the curious decision on the choice of the troika for the praesidium of this Convention.
It is no secret that my group would not have chosen Mr Giscard d' Estaing as its preferred candidate, but as you know, Mr President, we have had experiences of constitutional reports from Mr Giscard d' Estaing in this Parliament.
He produced a report on subsidiarity a number of years ago and from that we can draw some lessons because every single paragraph in his report, if I remember correctly, was amended in committee and then in plenary, by Parliament adopting amendments tabled by yourself.
That might be a working method we might well need to employ in the Convention and is something we can draw some lessons from.
I turn now to the less positive result of the European Council - the farce over the agencies.
That too can be used to learn some lessons.
It shows us what happens when we move away from the Community method to intergovernmentalism.
Instead of a Commission proposal we have every country coming up with its own proposal, feeling forced to defend it in an intergovernmental logic and with no result in the end.
It shows the limits of the European Council which should be setting the strategic objectives for the European Union.
When it has to deal with detail like that it of course fails.
Let no government now turn around to the Parliament and criticise us for being incapable of taking decisions, accuse us of being too slow in taking decisions, when the European Council offers us a spectacle like that, which indeed discredits the European Union in the eyes of its citizens.
Mr President, I shall stop now but not without remarking that I believe this is the last time you will chairing the European Parliament before the presidential election comes and you move on to other higher things and may I wish you all the best of luck for a prosperous and successful New Year in 2002.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, if our goal is to establish a federation of States and the constituent process is to involve the Treaties, the Laeken Declaration establishing a Convention that is to propose institutional reform to the Intergovernmental Conference before the European elections and before enlargement, is a success for Parliament and the Belgian Presidency.
However, the European Parliament must ensure this success does not become an illusion.
This democratic challenge must be supported by a great debate open to all the citizens of the Union.
As I see it, the future of Europe is in the hands, in particular, of the great political families which created the European Community and believe in integration, in the European social model, in European democracy and in European reunification.
However, on certain points of the Laeken agenda, the Community process was slowed down by a cross-fire of vetoes.
This is the weapon of the sceptics and populists.
I refer to the deferral of the financing of Galileo, which President Prodi also mentioned, and to the failure to reach agreement on the locations of the European agencies or on the Community patent.
In any case, as has just been said, these shadows reinforce the need for the Community method and majority decisions; I refer also to the security and defence policy, in which progress has been made, and to foreign policy, which is still poorly defined.
Europe is standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the fight against terrorism, but it is also concentrating on combating the poverty which divides the world, while the situation in the Middle East has reached tragic dimensions.
What should we do?
Is there no way forward?
I support Mr Verhofstadt' s call for a Europe whose actions are consistent with the values of freedom and solidarity, which it enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights in order to make globalisation more humane.
Mr President, when a child is born with just a father, we must not be surprised if it grows up with problems.
Europe has many fathers and we have just missed the opportunity to give it a mother.
I would like to talk about the assessment in Laeken on the subject of the application of justice and home affairs policies.
I agree with the progress made on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions, both in the criminal field and in the civil field, though to a lesser extent.
And I must congratulate you in this respect on the content and the form of the agreement on the European arrest warrant, which affects a large number of offences and which I see as greater justice rather than greater repression.
I believe we should welcome this.
However, with regard to immigration and asylum, I must say that the Council' s text adopts a tone of renunciation which worries me.
The analysis of the situation is sincere of course, but I do not believe that it reaches the right conclusions.
Mr President, we cannot allow fifteen different immigration policies in this borderless Europe for much longer.
I think that we should draw other conclusions from this situation; the conclusion that these policies require greater impetus, that we should rid ourselves once and for all of the shackles of unanimity and that we should increase this Parliament' s participation in such sensitive issues.
Mr President, I believe we have demonstrated that it is possible to work with our Parliament in this field and that we must put an end to the restrictions imposed in Amsterdam.
I hope that the Convention takes note of this and puts it right.
I would also like to end by congratulating the Presidency on the inclusion of diversity and the idea of federalism in the Treaty and on Mr Verhofstadt' s words to this House in this regard.
Mr President, on the day after the Laeken Summit, I would like to express a few regrets and one hope.
I regret that in the field of foreign and defence policy, the Heads of State and Government meeting in Laeken have not been able to show their capacity to act.
So, while we are living through an unprecedented crisis, the European Union will not be able to decide to send a joint force to Afghanistan.
Such a decision would have sent a strong signal of the will of the Europeans, by showing that we are ready to carry out our responsibilities fully, both in a military sense and in a humanitarian or political sense.
Likewise, once again, in the field of common defence, no immediate decision has been taken.
These statements are largely virtual and the issue of automatic access by the Union to NATO' s resources has yet to be sorted out.
The Union' s foreign and defence policy exists more in speeches than in actions, and I regret this.
More than ever, we must build a political and democratic Europe which is capable of carrying weight and influence in the world.
That is why I would now like to express a hope.
The Laeken Summit has decided to create the Convention.
It has provided it with an excellent president and an open agenda.
I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for this, since throughout its mandate it has shown courage and vision, as well as the Commissioner responsible for these issues.
This Convention opens the way to a new future for Europe.
I wish it success, and I hope that in two years time we may have a constitution which all the citizens of the European Union can read and understand, and that we finally establish the principle of directly electing the President of the European Commission.
If we do not want to the European Union of tomorrow to be a mere free trade area, if we really want to carry weight in the world, in the new international order, this is the only possible course.
Mr President, time is short, so my only comment will be on the really historic decision to convene a constituent assembly which has already - albeit inaccurately - been called a Convention.
Ãhe European Parliament has every right to be proud because the idea of a Convention was mooted here, in this House, and took shape in the reports by the European Parliament, mainly from 1997 onwards.
Parliament has insisted ever since that institutional development is a waste of time unless someone else is given the job of drafting new Treaties, i.e. unless a political body takes over the role played hitherto by the bureaucrats.
This is not the time to judge whether or not we have finally achieved our aim; that will depend on the degree to which the proposals tabled by the Convention find their way into the new Treaties, which is why the Convention needs to table specific institutional proposals, assuming of course that it reaches an agreement.
If the Convention tables a selection of alternatives to the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than specific proposals, then it will have little effect on the shape of the new Treaty.
Unfortunately, the instructions to come out of Laeken are rather more open-ended on this point than they should have been.
If you stop to consider that no institutional body in the European Union and no institution in any one Member State has studied or tabled more thoughts on the institutional aspects of the European Union than the European Parliament, then a contingent of 16 delegates is hardly in proportion to its contribution to date.
However, just so that our fellow citizens know where they stand, the Convention will not table a draft Treaty, it will table a draft Constitutional Treaty.
The intergovernmental method will be complemented by the Community method, rather than being abolished, which is perfectly reasonable, given that the European Union is a union of nations and a union of states.
However, the Convention takes the fight for greater democracy and greater rule of law in the European Union to a new level.
It really is a pity, Mr President, that the chairman of the Convention is appointed by the Council.
It would have been more fitting to allow a body made up mainly of members of parliament to elect its own chairman.
Mr President, from the list of speakers it would seem that the rest of you will now have to follow the PPE-DE family' s internal debate, but of course that is perfectly in order.
In my opinion, the Belgian presidential term was a great success in difficult circumstances. In that connection, externally there was Afghanistan, Macedonia, the Middle East and 11 September, and, internally, there were enormous expectations, which mainly focused on the Laeken Summit.
Seen in this light the results of the Laeken summit were good.
They will take the Community forward both ideologically and realistically.
Laeken was a confirmation of the political will that exists with regard to speedy enlargement, with ten new members joining in 2004, provided that these countries themselves are determined to try to bring that about in negotiations.
The Laeken Declaration is a successful mixture of questions regarding problems to be solved and, on the other hand, faith in being able to solve them.
The Convention, which - at least as a group - the PPE-DE was the first to propose, will be starting its work soon, and one thing we know for sure is that its praesidium has experience - some 200 man years of experience in all.
Good luck - the work will not be easy!
I think the best decision taken at the Laeken Summit, however, was that by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, whose personal contribution certainly lies behind Belgium' s success there, as he very quickly put a stop to the row over agencies.
When the Prime Minister of a large country starts imagining that he is at some European Food of the Year ceremony, or awarding Michelin points to some city, or when the President of another large country begins to fantasise about beautiful Swedish models, then that is really a very good reason to end the discussion before the Europeans witnessing it laugh even louder at us than they are doing at present.
Mr President, I would like to continue this internal PPE-DE debate by focussing solely on the Laeken Declaration.
It is right, as the Declaration says, that European institutions should become closer to the citizens, less intrusive, less unwieldy and more efficient and open to democratic scrutiny.
It is also right that a whole series of questions should be asked in terms of simplifying the process of legislation, on clarifying competencies of the Union and indeed restoring perhaps one or two to Member States, as is mentioned.
How to involve the national parliamentarians too is a very important aspect and lastly, it is right, as the President of the Council said, that this is a new departure for Europe as a way of amending Treaties rather than having decisions made behind closed doors and smoke-filled rooms early in the morning.
There is a real doubt, however, that these statements of principle will actually become reality.
Is the agenda, as some feel, already decided in advance?
Will all the voices in the European political spectrum be heard?
Will indeed, above all, the views of ordinary European citizens, be taken into account and listened to in the work of the Convention?
There were some signs under the previous Presidency but not I am afraid under this one, that they did actually care about European citizens.
It had a website - 'Europa' or whatever it was, - but we have not heard much about it under this Presidency.
In the conclusions of the Council relating to the Convention, one paragraph is devoted to the forum and it seems to be more about informing the network of organisations than having their contributions in the work of the Convention.
I therefore make this one appeal today that in the praesidium, and perhaps helped by the Commission, national parliamentarians and others, we really should have a real European debate in the Member States involving European citizens so that when we end up with a constitutional framework, we really have something that Europeans can support.
This is the only occasion in history, that I can think of, where citizens can be consulted before a constitution is drawn up rather than afterwards.
So please, Commissioner, ensure that everything is done to make sure this European debate will actually take place.
Mr President, Laeken has gone better than Nice did last year, and for that the Belgian Presidency is to be thanked, yet the positive outcome has to do with another matter on which Laeken was to give a decision.
Nothing had been decided by last weekend on the central topic of "The future of the Union"; quite rightly, only questions had been asked about it.
Even a cursory analysis of the questions, though, shows that some of them are not questions at all, such as the rhetorical question as to whether it would contribute to greater transparency if the sessions of the Council - at any rate in its legislative capacity - were to be in public.
Now, it goes without saying that legislative Council sessions must be thrown open, but why did something so obvious not become legally binding at Maastricht or Amsterdam or, at the latest, at Nice?
Another question in the catalogue of Laeken declarations makes me similarly pensive.
We have to consider whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be incorporated into the Basic Treaty and whether the European Community should accede to the European Convention on Human Rights.
Does this mean that the results of the last Convention are really nothing more than an option?
I hope not.
I take an even more critical view of questions in the Declaration which were not even put at Laeken.
The question arises for me, as an elected representative from a medium-sized state, how the Convention will ensure that the big states will not dominate in the future.
There has, unfortunately, been a very definite reason for these questions to be asked in recent weeks, and let nobody believe that there will be any less hankering after top-down management in a future Europe of nineteen small and medium-sized States and a small group of large and very large ones.
One last point in the Laeken Declaration prompts me to vehement criticism here and now.
The less than impressive, indeed uncaring, way in which the Council's General Secretariat handled the Convention on Fundamental Rights last time gives little hope for anything good from the Constitutional Convention.
I can only hope that the Council's bureaucracy will prove us wrong by providing us with a quite outstanding service.
Mr President, at the Laeken Summit, the heads of government agreed to set up a constitutional Convention on the future of Europe which includes the possible incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, with its costly, social and economic rights, and the direct election of a European Commission President, which I oppose.
I welcome, however, calls for the EU to become more democratic, transparent and efficient, for an enhanced role for the national parliamentarians and a menu of options to choose from in 2004.
The EU already possesses its own anthem, flag, citizenship, army, currency etc. and a whole host of quasi-federal institutions.
To pretend, as the Labour Government in Britain is already doing, that this Convention is simply an opportunity to limit the power of the Union at the expense of the states is ridiculous.
This Convention is much more reminiscent of the American nation-building exercise in Philadelphia in 1787.
The political elites of Europe are ever more distanced from their electorates.
How representative of European opinion are ValÃ©ry Giscard D'Estaing, Dehaene and Amato?
If this is the court, the jury is a loaded one.
How representative will the Convention be of the peoples of Europe?
We should be preparing urgently for enlargement by solving the Amsterdam leftovers, and reforming the CAP and the structural funds representing 80% of the budget of the EU, not preparing for grand constitutional reform of little relevance to the concerns and aspirations of the electorate.
How will extending QMV to delicate areas like social security and taxation help?
And what has been done to resolve the problems of the much-needed EU patent because of the obsession with multilingualism in the institutions?
In the European Union there is idealism born out of a desire to see a Europe of peace and prosperity, an objective we can all share.
I come from a country with centuries-old, uninterrupted democratic traditions and I want to say two things to the believers in a European super-state.
Firstly, the EU is not the origin but the expression of peace in post-war Europe, which is underpinned by democracy in the nation-states and respect for the rule of law.
Secondly, idealistic political changes instituted by the political elites which do not have the broad support of the people will be like structures built on sand.
Do not run before you can walk.
When the peoples of Europe want a single European state, that will be the time to call for a European Convention, and not before.
I wish you a happy Christmas.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Belgian Presidency has without doubt gone to a great deal of effort, yet the lack of a European Community spirit on the part of the fifteen governments in the European Union when it comes to important and urgent decisions is something that cannot be overcome by just one Presidency.
The brilliant analysis of the situation and the many questions listed could have come from Parliament's reports on Nice, its aftermath, or Laeken, and they give the impression of having been written down on the spot.
These are questions to which Parliament has for years now been demanding answers for the sake of the future of the European Union.
Is everything now again being jeopardised by so much questioning?
Let us take, for example, common suffrage.
The Council has, since July 1998, been examining a European draft electoral law on elections to the European Parliament and has still not come to any conclusion by the end of 2001 - all of two and a half years later.
It is raising the question of whether we want European suffrage.
Looked at as a whole, there is no doubt that the Convention represents an opportunity, yet Parliament contradicts Laeken by demanding that we should negotiate and reach a decision on the basis of one unitary, coherent proposal.
It is equally regrettable that the Heads of State and of Government have again put off until Barcelona and Seville resolutions on the adaptation of the Council's structures and work practices.
Reading the Laeken resolutions reminded me of a saying coined by one of our poets, Hans Magnus Enzensberger: 'He, seated in a common place, / thought up another commonplace.'
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Laeken Declaration on the future of the European Union is a positive step towards a European Union that is more citizen-oriented and more transparent.
A good declaration, however, must not remain mere empty words.
For example, the conclusion of the Lisbon Council that the European Union should be made the world' s most competitive area has to an extent met with a surprising degree of reluctance on the part of Member States to do anything about it.
It is essential from the point of view of the Union' s credibility that words and deeds go hand in hand.
The Union and its institutions have - with good reason - been criticised for being too distant from the people.
In order to promote a more citizen-oriented approach, any preparatory work for revision of the Treaties in the future must be carried out in a more transparent manner.
The European Council must observe the same principles of democracy, efficiency and consistency that we also expect of the other EU institutions.
The expected - and positive - decision of the European Council at Laeken, was to set up a Convention.
So, in this respect, I disagree with my good friend, Charles Tannock.
The problem, however, lies in the fact that three distinguished European statesmen, each with a long life' s work behind them, have now been appointed to lead the Convention.
No women were even shortlisted for the presidency.
Experience is obviously invaluable, but in order to guarantee a citizen-oriented approach we ought now to be thinking about the sort of age and gender distribution there should be among the Convention' s other members so that the EU can really be brought closer to its citizens and in particular the shapers of the future, that is to say, the young.
At Laeken the question of the location of the urgently needed food agency to be set up in the new year was discussed.
In view of the diseases among animals that have recently occurred in practically all Member States, Europeans have the right to expect Heads of State to do their utmost to ensure there is complete safety with regard to food.
The way the matter was dealt with by the Council, however, was more reminiscent of a farce, which, according to the German newspaper Die Welt, put even all the soap operas in the shade.
It is quite indefensible that populist objectives should be able to hamper decision-making in a matter that is crucial to the health and well-being of our citizens.
Mr President, a positive acceleration is taking place in European political integration.
The process of enlargement is a reality, just as the convening of the Convention is a reality; countless steps forward have been taken in the field of justice, as they have in the field of foreign and defence policy.
However, this acceleration in political integration is not being matched by similar acceleration in economic integration, that is, in the creation of the markets on which political integration is based.
It is strange, but we are witnessing a veritable inversion of the Community method.
Indeed, from coal to steel, to the single currency, it has all been a succession of steps forward towards the building of a common home, starting with the foundations and working our way towards the roof.
Now, while we are rushing to build the roof, we are extremely behind in the creation of markets which are crucial for the lives of the Europeans.
There have been too many delays, too many failures, too much egotism: from electricity to gas, from telecommunications to Galileo to the Community patent.
This lack of synchronisation between the physical dimension of the markets and the metaphysical political dimension could cost the process of European integration the citizens' support.
Indeed, the costs of losing political sovereignty are perceived to be too high and the benefits for businesses and consumers are considered to be too low, too limited.
It would be as well, in order to avoid this danger, for European integration to be resumed according to the method of our founding fathers, free from contemptible egotism and without calculated, unnecessary leaps forward.
Mr President, the words 'entrepreneur' or 'employer' occur only once in the Laeken final conclusions, and that in connection with the protection of workers when an employer becomes insolvent.
I believe we have missed an opportunity here.
At the European level, we are engaged in turning the internal market into a domestic market, and Europe is home, after all, to 18 million small and medium-sized enterprises.
I am the President of the European SME-Union, and it is therefore a matter of concern to me that I should point out over and over again that our primary goals should include the safeguarding of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.
At the end of the day, it is the small and medium-sized enterprises that provide two-thirds of all jobs, pay 80% of all taxes and train 85% of young workers.
My second point takes us away from internal affairs to the international arena.
How do we envisage the European Union's future representation in international organisations?
In Parliament, we have now decided on this Committee on NATO.
How are we to proceed in matters affecting the World Trade Organisation?
There are many other areas; how does Europe intend to take a leadership role in the future?
The third point that concerns me is in fact the Council's secretariat.
I believe we should set up a body composed of the best minds in the secretariat as well.
It should be possible for the European Council, the European Parliament and the Commission to be equally represented on it.
Our objective should be for the ideas produced by the best minds to eventually bring us a result at which the citizens of Europe will rejoice.
The first two sentences of the Laeken Declaration about the debilitating effects of the two World Wars confirm my belief that the European Union is a force for good in the world and Britain, like all other Member States, derives great benefit from the existence of the EU.
The remains of my grandfather, like many others, lie somewhere in Flanders on the battlefield of the Somme.
My father fought in Montgomery's army in Flanders for the liberation of Brussels.
I am still in Flanders, the third generation of my humble family, fighting here for Britain's interests.
Can there be any doubt as to which generation has got right the way to work out Europe's relations?
The simple certainties of the 20th century are less clear in the complexities of the 21st century.
As I read on in the Laeken Declaration I recall the saying we have in English that, like the curate's egg, it is good in parts.
I particularly like the reference that we are a continent of liberty and, above all, of diversity.
Unlike the United States of America, Europe is a voluntary association of sovereign independent states.
We must never forget that.
Of course we need European-level institutions but let us also recall the wise words of Jacques Santer: "Europe must do less better".
There needs to be a clearer definition of subsidiarity on "less".
Only go to European level for that which can only be done at European level.
On "better" I urge Commission and Council to look closely at the call of this Parliament for a uniform and compulsory code of good administrative behaviour.
The response I received to a Parliamentary question last week from the Commission was dismissive of Parliament's call made in September for such a uniform and compulsory code.
That is not the right attitude, nor is it the way to get the European public on side.
The case for such a code has been set up by the Ombudsman, Jacob SÃ¶derman.
I am pleased he will be an observer at the Convention but I would say to Commission and Council that you would do well to listen to him as well as to allow him to observe.
As the final speaker from the floor this year, may I wish all the staff, all the Members and all the people of Europe a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year.
Mr President, this debate began over four hours ago, and I can understand that great demands have been made on the attention of the European Parliament.
However, for my part, I have listened carefully to all the speakers, right to the end, and I must say that throughout this debate the dialogue and the speeches in this House have been of a consistently high quality.
Almost all those who have spoken have expressed their satisfaction at the end, not only of this Laeken Council, but also of six months of Belgian Presidency, and I have no problem - quite the contrary - in joining in with your thanks, not only to Guy Verhofstadt and Louis Michel, but to all the Belgian Ministers and all their colleagues.
I should also like to thank them, and why not, for the quality of the relations that have been maintained and even strengthened during the Belgian Presidency, whatever the problems or the difficulties between the Council and our colleagues and the members of the European Commission.
I should just like to say a few words about the Convention and the hopes that it inspires.
First of all, Mr Swoboda and James Elles, and others too perhaps, have raised the issue of the civil society.
I believe it is very important that this new framework is being put in place for the first time on institutional issues, after the initial successful experience of the previous Convention on fundamental rights, though that was a restricted, limited exercise, and probably less sensitive than the one that we are about to begin. I believe it is very important that this Convention should be open, and should be able to take note of what is happening outside it.
One way or another, this forum, this network of non-governmental organisations, regions and associations will have to be able to make its voice heard and, when necessary, heard by the Convention.
I have taken note of the suggestion that the website should be a two-way affair, so that it cannot only disseminate information but also pass on opinions and criticisms.
This also reminds me of an idea which I have already mentioned in this House, that this Convention should be a sort of sounding box, both for governments and for the public.
May I also say that it would be very worthwhile during a period - and I am thinking about the year 2002 - in which six or seven, or maybe more if I am not mistaken, of the countries of the Union will be holding general elections, and therefore we shall have to pay great attention to the quality of the European debate, because we are well aware that, whether national politicians like it or not, the European dimension is bound to form part of the debates in each of our countries.
That is the first point that I wanted to make.
My second point concerns the praesidium, which I shall be part of together with my friend and colleague Antonio Vitorino.
This praesidium, consisting of twelve people, will be led by a trio of the highest quality, three statesmen - and I choose that word advisedly - namely Mr Amato, Mr Dehaene and the President Mr Giscard d' Estaing.
They are three statesmen by virtue, frankly, of their age, but some would also say by virtue of their experience or their wisdom.
I know all three of them, and what I can tell you about them, and in particular about the President of the Convention, is that when it comes to their European convictions, they all have a youthful spirit and a dynamism that I would like to see in a certain number of much more eurosceptic politicians who are in some cases twenty or thirty years younger.
That is what seems important to me, their dynamism and the youthfulness of their convictions, together with their European qualifications and their authority, which is something that we shall need.
What I would like to say, echoing Louis Michel, is that of course there will be the President and the two Vice-Presidents, but they will have to work as colleagues alongside the praesidium, and by listening to and leading the debates of the Convention as a whole.
They will not, therefore, be working alone, but rather in solidarity, which is a very different matter indeed.
The European Council at Laeken - and the Belgian Presidency did very well to achieve such a result - gave this Convention a dynamic mandate, an open mandate, thereby removing the first risk that I had imagined or feared, namely the risk of a closed mandate, a mandate blocked by the four topics of the Treaty of Nice, which would have given rise to great disappointment here, to me personally and also to public opinion, and which would have restricted our work to the legal and the technical, without any political perspective.
However, that did not happen.
The Laeken mandate is an open mandate, and it even allows us to raise almost any issue.
This means, however, that there is another risk, if I may say so.
That risk is that, by being based on such a broad mandate, on such great confidence, the Convention will be transformed into a sort of academic forum producing results which are too far out of line with the mandate that has been laid down.
We must take care not to make this Convention a forum which will cease to be listened to by the European Council.
This is also why the selection of the three people who will be leading this Convention is so important, because the three people in question have the ear and the respect of the European Council.
We have to steer a course between these two dangers.
The first danger has now been removed, but the second one remains.
What I am trying to say is that we shall have to produce work that is responsible and useful, and that can be used by the European Council, which will then have to go on to make the final decisions.
Basically, I believe that this Convention, which is a great opportunity for European debate and for future stages of European integration to be carried out in a more open, more democratic and more transparent way, is itself responsible for proving that the right method has been chosen, so that we can avoid going back to the old method, which was strictly intergovernmental.
Together, we, the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the national parliaments, will bear that responsibility, together with the candidate countries, sitting around the same table and on an equal footing with us, plus of course the active representatives of the Committee of the Regions and of organised civil society.
We shall have the responsibility of ensuring that it works, that it succeeds, because if it does succeed, in a way that is sustainable in the future, then I believe that any future reforms in years to come will no longer be carried out in the old way, but will be carried out using this more transparent and more open method.
We shall also have a second responsibility, that of putting into perspective the institutional issues, and of putting them into a political perspective. The Convention mandate allows us to do this.
It allows us, in particular, in the first few months of 2002, to spend a little time, among ourselves and with others, asking ourselves some fundamental questions. What do we want to do together?
What is the meaning that we wish to give to the European project? What do you expect - and by you I mean not only the institutions but also the Member States, and the governments of the Member States, the Heads of State and Government, and the national parliaments - what do you expect of the European project?
I believe that the President of the Convention intends - and I support him in that intention - to ask each country what it expects of the European project, by using modern technology and perhaps by actually going to the countries in question and visiting each capital city, if the praesidium so wishes.
For two years now, ever since Joschka Fischer, we have heard all the Heads of State and Government and many Ministers making grandiose declarations and powerful speeches.
I think that we must go further, and ask them to explain what they want this European project to mean, what they expect of it, in other words we must demand a sort of political verification.
Only then, after such verification, will it be time to place in that political perspective the institutional work that has been carried out on all the subjects that have been mentioned, including the constitutional process that was adopted at Laeken.
That is what I wanted to say, namely that we must carry out responsible, useful and usable work, and we must prove that from now on we can ensure that the European Union advances and progresses other than by using methods which, in my opinion, belong to the past.
Mr President, I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak at the end of this debate, and I should also like to thank you for the quality of that debate, and at the same time I too would like to wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
The debate is closed.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 17 December 2001.
Before discussing the order of business, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take just a minute of your time to add my sincere tribute to those paid by all Parliamentary groups to our outgoing President, Mrs Fontaine, during the sitting of 17 December.
I was one of those standing against her two years ago, as I am sure you all remember.
I am, therefore, delighted to acknowledge today and thank her for her dignity, impartiality, efficiency and the exceptional elegance with which she has fulfilled her duties in the service of the European Union, thereby increasing the prestige of our Parliament.
(Loud applause)
Order of business
Following the decisions taken by the Conference of Presidents on 10 January, a final draft agenda has been distributed.
I should, nevertheless, like to draw the House' s attention to the fact that the order of business for the current part-session will be established definitively at 9.00 a.m. on Wednesday.
Announcement of candidates for election of President
Election of President of Parliament
We shall now proceed to the election of the President, pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules of Procedure:
Mr Bonde,
Mr Cox,
Mr David W. Martin,
Mr Onesta and
Mr Wurtz.
Good morning colleagues.
This Parliament must continue to be multilingual.
Eleven languages make 110 combinations.
Twenty-two languages make 462 combinations.
Thirty-five languages make 1 090 combinations.
Can you imagine a translation from Finnish, via English and French, to Polish?
With direct translation some will vote for budget line 2 while others are still voting on budget line 1.
With more than one relay our system will not work.
If we do not go for reform, then most of us will no longer be able to use our own language.
In two years we might have ten new Member States.
Our buildings are not prepared for that.
Soon even more countries - from the Ukraine to the Balkans - will be applicant countries.
We risk a Babel-like confusion.
Our next President must dedicate himself to internal reform and successful enlargement.
Indeed our next President will not have much time to travel around.
We need a craftsman, a handyman, rather than a statesman.
All of us will be to blame if we are not prepared for enlargement by 2004.
How we vote today is part of that responsibility.
Every vote for me is a clear signal to Mr Cox and Mr Martin: limit your ambitions to enlargement and internal reform.
Today we lose a lot of time over badly prepared votes.
If journalists ask how we voted, we do not always know.
If we knew, we would not have time to serve our people.
We would then be bad MEPs.
Leave it to the committees to prepare the votes.
Let the plenary deal with the important political issues.
Give us at least one week to consult and consider how we will vote.
Today many Members are not allowed to speak in debates.
If you represent a small delegation in a big group, or an alternative view, the group whips will seldom allow you to speak.
Give every Member the right to speak at least three times a year. Leave one-third of the speaking time for real debates.
Let us corner the commissioner when he or she states that the Commission can accept Amendment No 3 and rejects Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
Today common decision-making takes place between the Commission and the Council.
They share the information.
Even in the conciliation committees our Members have no access to working documents, legal notes or Minutes.
Does "common" really mean "unilateral"?
In the committees the Members discuss draft laws based on outdated drafts. Behind us sit young civil servants from the permanent representations.
The Commission and the Council have all the information we cannot get.
I have been here for 22 years.
In that time as an elected Member, I have never received adequate information from the committee.
To get information I have to find sources like journalists.
Our next President must ensure that all information is available to all of us and, if necessary, take the Commission and the Council to court.
Today, 70% of all laws are passed by junior civil servants in working groups.
Fifteen percent are settled by the ambassadors.
Only 15% reach the level of the ministers who then read manuscripts prepared by civil servants.
Democracy was born in Europe and buried in the Commission and the Council.
Our next President should re-establish democracy.
He should inspire us to discuss whether our future Europe should be the federalist vision of a democratic EU or a Europe of democracies.
Our next President should unite all elected representatives from national parliaments and the European Parliament in moving law-making from behind closed doors into the open, from civil servants to elected Members.
For what is now needed I offer my skills and energy.
But all I ask is to borrow your vote in the first round: firstly, because it might be your only chance to vote for me; secondly, because many votes will test the groups behind Mr Cox and Mr Martin.
This time we need a practical and politically-neutral shop steward to serve all of us.
Give yourself a better choice.
Improve on both Cox and Martin by voting Mr Bonde from office number 007.
By the end of the day we will have a better presidency thanks to those who drafted the "fair chair platform" and created the first real electoral battle in our history.
The next chair will have a real mandate.
He deserves our full support.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, decision time is now upon us.
We have had more candidates, we have had more debate, and we have had more openness.
It represents a change in the method, in the way we have done our business.
It is a good change and I hope it is a signal of an appetite throughout this House to engage in the years which come and the balance of this mandate in a culture of transformation of how we do our business.
The campaign reveals many perspectives, not least about the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates - and I have my share of both.
I read about myself in polite journals that I am loquacious.
I live in Ireland, where we are all loquacious, near Blarney where there is a stone and a castle.
When visitors come there and kiss that stone, they say in Hibernian English that they leave with the gift of the gab, meaning loquacious in polite journals.
I may be that, but the more important part of this campaign is that it has offered the opportunity to listen and to learn.
I have listened and I have learned that there is an appetite for change, that there is a great feeling in this House that we need to do more politics in the best and visionary sense of that word.
I have learned that we want less voting and less technicalities and more capacity to be politicians and to bring our influence to bear.
