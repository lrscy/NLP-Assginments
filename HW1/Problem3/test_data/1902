In this House, there is agreement all round; on the television, there is something really exciting, and I am sure you will understand when I say that I am going to go for the more exciting option.
Â Â  Mr President, what we are debating can be regarded as a technical matter, but what we are actually concerned with here are two very fundamental issues that we have taken up in the European Parliament.
One of these is the safety of aviation as a means of transport, and one that is in increasing use every day.
More and more people are dependent on aviation in their everyday lives, but is also important for industry.
Also at issue are the precise limits of human ability under difficult and dangerous conditions.
To what extent is it possible to work difficult hours and still maintain a high level of safety?
It is questions such as these that the European Parliament has found important and that have caused us to devote so much time to this issue.
I would like to thank MrÂ Stockmann for the truly excellent cooperation from which we have benefited and for the high-quality compromise that we have now reached.
I am also amongst those who believe that we should vote in favour of the compromise, as we do need regulations at European level.
Pilots and cabin crew are the key personnel in the air when it comes to safety.
For us as passengers it is never acceptable for safety to be interfered with in order to keep prices down or in order for companies to be able to drive each other out of business.
Pilotsâ working conditions have been quite carefully examined in the past, and competition must not be allowed to cause a deterioration of those conditions.
For this reason, the review after two years is very important.
Regulations on working time must be backed up medically and scientifically within EASA by Europeâs foremost experts in the field of working time, rest, sleep and fatigue.
Cabin crew must also have sound knowledge and training, and this applies to all cabin crew.
Their working duties have changed and become increasingly important in the wake of 9/11.
We must therefore also contribute to achieving high safety levels and high levels of competence for cabin crew, and we are doing this through the compromise.
As a final point, the agreements in place differ between Member States.
I think it important that those Member States that have better legislation or collective agreements should not be forced to fit in with a lowest common denominator.
We need non-regression.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation for MrÂ Stockmannâs report.
He deals with a very broad and important subject which concerns the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation.
We should pay particular attention to a comprehensive approach to a question which is of significant importance to the proper functioning of air transport, and should include safety standards and healthy competition.
The need for a detailed approach is demonstrated by the document itself, which consists of around 480 pages.
The procedures presented in the regulation are specific and precise.
They refer to the aircraft itself, including its navigational and communications equipment and procedures for technical staff.
They also apply to the flight parameters and the air crew.
The legislation deals with the issue of certificates, limitations on flight time and staff duties, as well as vital rest times for staff.
They also cover matters dealing with airports and regulations for the activities of air operators, including issues relating to aircraft fuel.
Moreover, the regulation deals with the question of meteorological conditions and guidelines on procedures to be followed in the event of limited visibility or other dangerous situations.
There is a clear attempt to maintain where they already exist, and to introduce where they are not yet entirely compulsory, unified principles and criteria for action and implementation of the appropriate technical conditions in order to guarantee the highest possible level of air transport safety.
The very intensive growth of air transport which we have witnessed requires absolute compliance with procedures and maintenance of strict technical discipline.
It is therefore necessary to harmonise operating regulations relating to commercial air transport.
It is also important to ensure that EU regulations are respected in all Member States and that carriers and airline operators from outside the EU and which fly to EU Member States be obliged to respect them unequivocally.
I have some knowledge of the matter, as I hold a PhD in technical sciences specialising in aviation, and have had the opportunity to teach aviation students at RzeszÃ³w Polytechnic, including future airline pilots.
This allows me to state that the compromise solution proposed is responsible and to the point.
Of course, it will also be very important to implement systematic and comprehensive monitoring of the legislation adopted.
In this context I support the compromise solution achieved and call for it to be adopted.
Â Â  Mr President, Michael Ende did not give his âNever-Ending Storyâ a proper ending, and we, in this House, have done markedly better.
Now that MrsÂ Sommer has produced her report, we have almost given the EU-OPS regulation one.
MrÂ Simpson and MrÂ Stockmann have done a very good job, for which both of them deserve thanks.
The labour law, social security and, above all, safety regulations applicable to air transport need to be properly brought up to date, but MrÂ Gewalt has already, and rightly, pointed out that the role of the European legislator in all these areas is a limited one.
All this has taken a while, but we now have before us a good report, and one that â as many Members have confirmed â represents the best possible compromise between the airlines and the trade unions.
The amendment makes full provision for the flying times, working times and rest periods of the cockpit and cabin crew and limits their maximum time on duty in the air to 13 and 11 hours respectively.
It is now up to the interested parties in the industry â the companies and the trade unions â to do the best they can with these requirements, and it is for the Commission to do more work in this area and to guarantee, by means of appropriate safety regulations, that the people currently setting off on holiday can feel safe when it is by air that they do so.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, my colleague, MrÂ Stockmann, for being generous enough to acknowledge the value of MrÂ Simpsonâs initial work.
I would like to pay a warm tribute to him tonight for having made such a success of it.
His tenacity and flexibility have helped to achieve the great success that we all wanted to see.

I can still remember how, at the beginning of this debate, which I experienced with MrÂ Simpson in a different capacity, we were presented with a text to harmonise the technical rules and administrative procedures for civil aviation, that is to say, to move on from the JAR-OPS to the EU-OPS, and we were surprised to find that it was a text with a black hole in it: it lacked the sub-section Q, relating to restrictions on flight time and activity and to rest requirements.
That began one of those fascinating stories of European integration which, if at some point it is taken on by a good story-teller or film-maker, will surely help to restore our citizens' passion for Europe.
There was a text in a drawer in the Commission which was growing in the darkness, which was improving, but we did not really know what it contained.
There was a group of European pilots and cabin staff who wanted that text to finally be adopted and there were certain airlines that did not think it was a priority, under pressure from growing competition, to operate the sector in a manner that would lead to the emergence of new competitors and that would make any proposed restrictions a serious burden, even if they were intended to improve safety.
Furthermore, they had the support of their Member States.
Finding a solution seemed difficult, but we have almost found one, thanks to the passionate and joint work of everybody and to the European Parliamentâs will to approve a complete text, with essential aspects for safety, aimed at people, pilots and cabin staff and with requirements on training, professional recognition and strict respect for flying and rest times, which must be regulated and harmonised in order to fully guarantee safety, without delay, in a sector which is growing exponentially and which is fully open and competitive.
We therefore welcome this prior commitment tonight, which will become a first step in consolidating the European citizens' confidence in the civil aviation sector.
It also represents a mandate for the European Air Safety Agency to exercise responsibility, and we hope that the agency will soon apply all of this Parliament's recommendations.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Stockmann, for the outstanding work he has done in negotiating a more than satisfactory agreement with the Council and the Commission.
We can be delighted at this result for a number of reasons.
Firstly, this agreement concludes a matter that has been on the table for six years, and it is a good thing to thus be able to avoid the conciliation procedure and a further delay, even though six years is far too long for an area like air safety in which it is crucial to act quickly.
Secondly, the amendments on which the Council and the draftsmen came to an agreement take up the bulk of the requests that we made to the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
That seems important to me, especially when it comes to the non-reducing clauses, which guarantee that this text will be unable to bring about a reduction in safety in the Member States in which the standards are higher than the basic standards featuring in the regulation.
Finally, I am particularly pleased about the provisions that deal with the issue of cabin crew.
Together with MrÂ Savary and a number of our fellow Members, we have tabled two amendments relating to the concerns expressed by this profession.
I am delighted to observe that the compromise amendments take account of these remarks and I am convinced that the regulation thus amended is a coherent and balanced text: I hope that we adopt it tomorrow by a very large majority.
I should like to point out off the record to our German and Italian fellow Members that I purposely wanted to be brief in order to enable them to follow the last few minutes of this evening's important event.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Vice-President, I would like to start by seizing this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Stockmann, most warmly for this fine report; it is a particular cause for rejoicing that he has managed, despite the problematic underlying issues, the various interests at stake and the length of time that has elapsed, to safely guide this report through to the point where it can be voted on.
There are various reasons why this âEU-OPSâ regulation represents an important milestone in the history of air safety: the amount of air traffic in Europe is continuing its constant upward trend; European airspace is one of the most overloaded of the areas in the world through which aircraft pass; and, if the safety of air passengers is to continue to be guaranteed everywhere, then the further development of uniformly high standards of safety is a matter of urgent necessity.
The black list, which was published a few months ago thanks to MrsÂ de Veyrac, has already set high standards for airlines â mainly those from outside Europe â and similarly high standards now need to be applied to the European ones.
Pilots from certain EU Member States will have the pressure taken off them as a result of the new framework conditions established by EU-OPS in respect of limits on working and rest time, and that in turn will improve passenger safety.
The European Air Safety Agency (EASA) will be producing a medical/scientific study on this, which will serve as a basis for the Commissionâs proposed revisions.
In my own report I will be discussing at length the EASAâs functions and areas of responsibility.
I would like to take this early opportunity to observe that uppermost in my mind is the safety of the passengers and of all the crew, and that I will not lose sight of that while drafting my report.
MrÂ Stockmann has already made a considerable contribution in this respect, and has, in doing so, made civil aviation a good deal safer already.
I will endeavour to play my part in ensuring that firm arrangements are made for the allocation of powers to, and coordination of, the various air safety agencies, with it being clearly indicated who shall be required to comply with the agenciesâ instructions.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, we need to conserve our strength, so I will be very brief.
I should like straightaway to thank Parliament for accepting a compromise negotiated among the three institutions and I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Stockmann.
Parliamentâs contribution has enabled us to make significant progress.
It has thus enabled us to identify the areas in which work needs to be done, particularly in cooperation with the European Aviation Safety Agency.
I should like to state in this connection that, in line with the compromise amendment tabled, we are going to carefully examine the specific circumstances of night flights.
As regards controls, we have two levels of these: those managed by the European Aviation Safety Agency, which are designed to see whether the European rules are being applied properly by the Member States, and those managed by the Member States.
We are making sure that the controls are enhanced.
MrÂ President, I hope that this text will be adopted by a large majority and will thus make it possible to improve air safety in Europe, to guarantee fair competition and to make it easier for staff to move around within the Community.
I wish to thank Parliament once again for its contribution.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0174/2006) by MrÂ SeppÃ€nen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council directive on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste and nuclear spent fuel (COM(2005)0673 C6-0031/2006 2005/0272(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, the proposal that is the subject of MrÂ SeppÃ€nenâs report aims at modifying and replacing Directive 92/3/Euratom, which lays down a Community uniform administrative procedure applicable to the shipment of radioactive waste.
I would first like to recall the aims of this proposal, which are: to ensure consistency with other Community legislation on radiation protection; to ensure consistency with international conventions; to clarify the procedures; to simplify the structure and wording of the existing directive; and to enhance certainty, firstly by explicitly including transfers of spent fuel for re-processing â the same control procedure is now applied to all shipments of spent fuel, independently of the intended use â and secondly by generalising the automatic consent procedure.
The consent of Member State of transit and of destination is assumed after a reasonable deadline.
This proposal takes into consideration the experience of application of the existing directive.
It further takes fully into account the opinion given by the European Economic and Social Committee on 9 June 2005, as well as the informal discussions held at the Council and in Parliament during 2005.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr SeppÃ€nen, for the excellent report he prepared, which has received the strong support of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
The amendments mainly seek to clarify the Commissionâs proposal, and are therefore welcome.
I am therefore confident that the Council will take duly into consideration the content of Parliamentâs opinion, insofar as it might contribute to improving the directive.
The Commission will present positively the inclusion in the directive of the amendments in the SeppÃ€nen report.
I would like to encourage you to adopt the recommendation submitted by the ITRE Committee, as this represents the best way to promote our common objectives.
It enhances certainty with regard to the Community uniform procedure which is applicable to the control of shipments of radioactive waste and nuclear spent fuel.
I look forward to the forthcoming debate.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I thank you for your interesting view.
This report was adopted by the committee with a very large majority, and I wish to thank the committee members, who tabled many good amendments to the proposal, for their very high levels of cooperation.
During the drafting process, I thought it was important for us to insist that it should be written into Union legislation that each Member State should have the right to ban the importation of nuclear spent fuel for disposal.
This principle is written into the IAEA Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste.
The European Parliament endorsed the adoption of the Joint Convention at one point, and Euratom is a party to it.
Thus there is general acceptance in the Union of the principle that a Member State need not take delivery against its will of spent fuel from other countries for disposal in its own soil.
Although the issue is a straightforward one in principle, in practice it is not.
There has been resistance in the Commission to the idea that this right of a Member State should be written into Community legislation.
The Commission may well be encumbered by the sort of thinking that proposes that the free movement of goods, written into the Treaty, should also apply to spent fuel for disposal.
According to this way of thinking, nuclear spent fuel is just the same as any other good.
Because, according to the Community treaties, goods must be allowed to move freely within the Union, the Member States should not be accorded the right in the Unionâs primary legislation to ban the importation from other countries of nuclear spent fuel when it is storing its own nuclear spent waste in its own soil.
Even in this sector, there would seem to be a craving for free trade.
The members of our committee supported the rapporteur on this.
The right of Member States to ban the importation of nuclear spent fuel has now been written into the articles of the directive in Parliamentâs report.
As it has been written into the articles, the provision is legally binding.
If it had merely been written into the preamble, it would not have had the same legal status: it would just be describing political will, without any legal force.
This principle and the entire report were adopted by the committee with such a degree of consensus that the report would not have needed to be opened at all for amendments in plenary.
I nevertheless supported the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in its request to have a plenary debate on amending the directive.
In my opinion, they should make known their reasons why Member States should deal with the disposal of nuclear spent fuel themselves, without allowing radioactive waste or spent fuel to be exported outside the Union for reprocessing or disposal.
I would justify this request with reference to the Unionâs expertise in nuclear technology, which is of a high standard, and its strict regulations on safety.
I fear that there are lower standards and laxer legislation in possible external recipient countries.
If nuclear power is to be used, one is taking huge radioactive risks, and those risks have to be controlled in those countries which produce nuclear energy.
Problems that can possibly be solved together within the Union cannot be transferred to third countries outside it.
For this reason, I support the many amendments tabled by the Greens, even if there was not enough general sympathy for them on the committee.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would like to thank the Commission for its willingness to withdraw the first proposal and to take account in its second one of what was said in the debate in this House, as a consequence of which we have met each other halfway.
The same goes for the rapporteur, who was prepared â although he has since become rather less so â to work together with the major groups and the Commission in finding a rational way forward.
The report we now have before us is a sensible one, and it is one to which we can give our support, although we do not think that the amendments tabled by the Greens are worthy of it.
Taken as a whole MrÂ SeppÃ€nenâs draft report enjoys the support of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but we will reject the substance of the amendments that were, contrary to our original agreement, resubmitted, and we do so on the basis of Articles 31 and 32 of the Euratom Treaty, which have to do with health and safety.
I would like to point out that this is not a codecision procedure, and that we are only to be consulted.
Account has been taken of new considerations, such as, for example, the extended scope for spent fuel rods, disposal and reprocessing or the automatic consent process for the transport of material within the Community and out of it.
We cannot agree to what the Greens have proposed.
AmendmentÂ 23, in particular, which envisages the requirement for the most extensive information in advance, cannot be seen as anything other than an incitement to widespread demonstrations, and MrsÂ Harms stressed that they would happen.
Having failed to get this sort of thing accepted once before, she has now taken it up again.
We would be dealing much more honestly with one another if we were to find common ground on the still open issue of final disposal rather than adopting hardened positions according to which one side of this House is right and the other is getting everything wrong.
I want to express my thanks to MrÂ SeppÃ€nen for his willingness to meet us halfway, and I believe that we can very largely agree to the report in its present form.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissionâs proposal on the directive concerning the control of shipments of radioactive waste is balanced and takes account of many of the suggestions made by Parliament during the debate on the previous proposal.
I commend this attempt to update the previous directive and to clarify it from the procedural and terminological point of view.
The inclusion of nuclear spent fuel in the remit of the directive is equally commendable.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is therefore substantially in agreement with this text and would like to compliment MrÂ SeppÃ€nen on his report and his contribution.
We have requested a separate vote on AmendmentÂ 6 because we do not think it possible to exclude the restrictions and controls that are to be found throughout the directive from the legislative provisions of the transit countriesâ regulations.
The amendments proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance express a concern that we can share.
Nevertheless, I think that the Commissionâs text â ArticleÂ 13, to be precise â already sets limits to exports, in particular to those countries that do not have sufficient technical, legal and administrative resources at their disposal to guarantee safe disposal of radioactive waste.
We shall therefore vote against the Greensâ amendments.
I also agree with the structure of the proposal and should like to thank the Commission and MrÂ SeppÃ€nen for their work.
Â Â  . Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on the hard work he has put into successfully preparing an excellent report that deals with such a difficult and controversial subject.
The amendments submitted in this report undoubtedly significantly improve the Commissionâs latest proposal and certainly constitute an important improvement to the original directive on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste.
One of the most noteworthy contributions made by the rapporteur in substantially improving the Commissionâs position is his stance in firmly establishing the right of every country to prohibit foreign nuclear spent fuel from being finally stored in repositories in or on its soil.
This right is fundamental and paramount.
In my view, only a very small number of somewhat equivocal issues remain as yet unresolved.
I shall mention only two such problem areas, which in fact are interrelated.
The exact definition of nuclear waste and nuclear spent fuel is still not entirely clear, so that some nuclear waste may, depending on its intended use, sometimes be regarded as nuclear spent fuel and vice versa.
This may lead to confusion.
In any event, and oddly enough, both of these hazardous materials are still legally speaking considered to be goods so far as EU legislation is concerned.
As a consequence of this, a Member State, after receiving only a simple notification, is on occasion obliged to have extremely dangerous consignments travelling through its territory by land, sea or air and subjecting its citizens to the potential perils of a catastrophic nuclear contamination accident. This happens without that state having the right to prevent such shipments from taking place in the first place.
I know that coming up with a solution to this problem and implementing it is not at all easy, but somehow we must find a way whereby Member States can have the last word, after being fully informed, in clearly reasoned decisions to accept or not the transportation of nuclear material â or any other hazardous material for that matter âthrough their territory.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank MrÂ SeppÃ€nen for being so very aware of the problems as regards the market conditions for such a difficult commodity as nuclear waste or spent fuel rods.
I would like, once more, to explain two amendments from my group that are of particular concern to me, namely Amendments 24 and 25, which deal specifically with the export of nuclear waste and spent fuel rods to third countries, and my particular concern is with exports to Russia.
Those who make it their business to know about these things will already have heard the names of Mayak or Chelyabinsk, sites in the Urals where, for decades, not only Soviet waste but also, and increasingly, European waste is reprocessed or accepted for storage, and where incidents keep occurring.
It is not only, however, when accidents occur, but also in the normal course of operations, that enormous amounts of radioactivity are discharged, causing serious pollution in the rivers and lakes of the Urals, to a considerably greater extent, moreover, than that seen in some parts of the exclusion zone around Chernobyl.
The situation we have ended up in makes dual standards impossible; since such facilities could not be operated in the EU, Europeans should not be sending their waste there for storage, disposal or reprocessing, and it can no longer be really demonstrated that reprocessing â that is, the further recovery of these nuclear materials â is still going on there, since no comprehensible summary whatever of what is reprocessed and reused is available to the public.
If we continue to allow thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste from the European Union to be exported to Russia, then we are taking upon ourselves a responsibility even and ever greater than that which â I emphasise, since it is not only now that the export is starting â we already bear for the lamentably poor state of the environment in the region around Mayak and Chelyabinsk and of the health of the people who live there.
I am positively convinced that the responsibility for resolving the problems with nuclear waste should generally be accepted by those countries that dump these problems on the world.
It is not Russia that is responsible for our nuclear waste, but rather our own countries themselves.
Â Â  . â Mr President, first of all, of course, I must congratulate my group colleague MrÂ SeppÃ€nen on his outstanding report; he is right to stress the primary responsibility that is incumbent on the Member States where the storage or processing of nuclear waste is concerned, and they certainly have one when it comes to refusing to accept waste from outside their own borders.
While that is a fundamental right that must under no circumstances be undermined by European regulation, I do believe that national responsibility goes even further, in that those who produce nuclear waste can never shrug off the responsibility for ensuring that it is processed and stored in a proper manner, even if that is done in another country.
The way in which EU Member States now ship their rubbish to such countries as Russia, only for it to be there stored under grossly unsatisfactory conditions, is nothing short of scandalous.
Europeâs negligence with nuclear waste makes victims of the local population and of the environment.
If countries choose to use such a dangerous and environmentally-unfriendly source of energy as nuclear power, they should be required to clear up their own refuse themselves rather than dumping it on the people of poorer countries outside the EU.
Those who really do want to do something practical to address the problem of nuclear waste in Europe should first give their attention to where it comes from, or else they will simply be fighting a running battle.
It is particularly disappointing to see how nuclear power, after a period deservedly spent on the fringes of the energy debate, is now creeping back on to the European agenda, for, being neither environmentally friendly, safe, nor good value, it is not an acceptable alternative, and the problem with waste is a good example of why it is not one.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that when I look at the report, which clearly identifies radioactive waste as deadly, I wonder why we still see nuclear power as an option, even, as I have seen in some new lobbying efforts, passing off nuclear energy as 'green'.
This directive focuses only on Member States which are active participants in the production of nuclear energy and on those that accept the waste.
Ireland neither produces nuclear waste nor reprocesses it.
We are not factored into this report, yet we need to be protected because we have Sellafield, a British reprocessing plant, very close to our shores.
The Irish Sea â the narrow strip of water that separates us from Sellafield â has, because of Sellafield, become the most radioactive body of water in the world.
Sellafield is expanding and preparing to take more and more radioactive waste for reprocessing.
Any waste coming from continental Europe will most likely be shipped through the Irish Sea, putting us at additional risk.
We in Ireland seem to have no say in this.
We are seen as passive bystanders.
No one looks for our consent.
We are able to reject the fuel, but not to reject the risks when our neighbours accept it.
We have, as a country, chosen to remain nuclear-free.
That should be respected, both in terms of accepting waste and in terms of the risk of waste being transported through our waters.
In the area of smoking, legislators have come to recognise the significance of passive smoking and have taken measures to defend the people who are near the smoker.
We need to recognise the effects and risks of reprocessing, shipment and reshipment on everyone, not just the countries of origin and destination that are making money from the nuclear business.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that, after more than a year and a half in Parliament, MrÂ SeppÃ€nenâs report is finally being voted on in plenary.
In committee we have achieved a broad majority consensus on drawing up the amendments necessary to improve the Commissionâs proposal, which we believe the Council is prepared to accept.
In particular, I would like to stress the new system for notification and authorisation of shipments of radioactive waste and spent fuel which I believe maximises the use of the automatic consent procedure, which was originally stressed by the European Economic and Social Committee as an essential element for the proper functioning of the internal market.
Furthermore, the amendments voted for in committee fully conform to the proposalâs initial objective, which is to bring the legislation in force into line with the Joint Convention of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
To this end, Parliament has insisted on faithfully reproducing the definitions of the Convention, as well as the scope of the directive.
With regard to the amendments presented by MrsÂ Harms, I would like to make a couple of comments: firstly, that the Convention makes the conditions allowing Member States to export radioactive waste and spent fuel very clear, and secondly, the fact that her insistence that the information on shipments of these substances should be made public largely contradicts her argument in committee when she warned of the danger of those substances falling into untrustworthy hands.
I am sure that MrsÂ Harms appreciates the risk that would be caused by that sensitive information being accessible to everybody.
Mr President, I would like to thank MrÂ SeppÃ€nen for his excellent work and all of the shadow rapporteurs for their own excellent efforts and their cooperation throughout the process and I would like to reiterate my support for the amendments approved in committee.
Let us hope that the House is aware that what is to be voted on tomorrow is not a question of âyesâ or ânoâ to nuclear power, but rather a proposal to make the transport of these substances safer.
Â Â  I would like to congratulate the draftsman and stress that the directive being debated is important for each country in the European Union, especially those operating nuclear power stations.
The Commission's proposals to cooperate in the transportation and burial of nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel reflect the spirit of EU solidarity and look to the future.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that radioactive waste transportation inspections and the advance authorisation system must become stricter.
Having shut down Ignalina nuclear power station's first reactor and with plans to shut down the second in three yearsâ time, Lithuania faces a storage problem with spent nuclear fuel.
At the moment, waste is being buried temporarily in special areas.
If it is decided that a new modern nuclear power station should be built at Ignalina with the help of neighbouring countries, the directive being debated would become even more relevant for the entire region.
I would also like to stress the need to encourage scientific research into the neutralisation of nuclear waste.
This could also be a priority for the EUâs 7th framework programme for research.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, France stirred up a wave of indignation when it classified the shipment of radioactive waste as an official secret.
It was thus denying local elected representatives and local communities the right to be informed of the fact that trains containing highly dangerous radioactive material were travelling across their land.
As recently as 16Â May 2006, a member of French civil society was kept in police custody because he was in possession of an impact study concerning the EPR project's ability to withstand a disaster involving the loss of an airliner also classified as an official secret.
By adopting, with vague words, the French idea that 'information regarding shipments (âŠ) is handled with due care and protected against any misuseâ, Parliamentâs Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is in fact proposing to institutionalise official secrets at European level.
Is the European Parliament, the all-round world champion in promoting and demanding transparency and democratic control on the international stage, going to go back on what it has said and done and make an exception of the nuclear issue?
Our Parliament would lose a great deal of credibility if it were to make obscurantism the rule where highly radioactive waste is concerned.
We know that burying is not the solution when it comes to managing nuclear waste.
That is why we reject the plan to build a European nuclear dump in Bure, in my region, or anywhere else.
Furthermore, going along with the proposal to delegate the management of nuclear waste to third countries â Ukraine or Russia for instance â is irresponsible.
The idea is ethically and morally reprehensible when it comes to nuclear waste which, let us not forget, must be monitored forever.
In the meantime, the acceptable solution â and this is the response that I wish to give to my fellow Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - consists in storing the waste within nuclear power stations.
That is the only place in which it is secure, and that is without mentioning the fact that this move would stop the process whereby waste is toured the length and breadth of Europe by road or rail.
Finally, the question is: how long will Europeans have to wait for transparency of information to be applied to the nuclear sector?
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, unless we ensure the stability of our system, adopt clear rules and meet our international commitments in the field of energy, all talk of economic growth, a rise in employment and an increase in the competitiveness of the European Union will not be rooted in solid reality.
Whether we like it or not, the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy objectives is inextricably linked to the question of energy, including nuclear energy.
In fact, nuclear energy lies behind a good 30 per cent of the electric power generated by 154 reactors in Europe.
When confronted with these figures, the opponents of nuclear energy, and indeed members of the public as well, raise concerns about nuclear waste.
The time is now ripe to amend the existing 1992 Directive on the Supervision and Control of Shipments of Radioactive Waste and Nuclear Spent Fuel in line with the development of contemporary society, which is exactly what the Commission proposal does.
Particularly praiseworthy are the simplification of the current Directive, the clear definition of procedures and the definition of the use of languages.
Moreover, the rapid development of technology today facilitates the re-use and material recovery of as much as 96 per cent of all highly radioactive waste.
For this reason, I support the proposal for the harmonisation of nuclear spent fuel management procedures, regardless of which procedures will be used in the coming period.
I firmly believe that this document deserves our support.
Allow me, finally, to express a hope that we will act coherently and constructively and that we will abide by the opinion of the competent Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
I also hope that we will not unnecessarily weigh down the above Directive in the European Parliament with additional text or amendments, making it hard to implement before we have even begun.
Â Â  On the subject of health and safety, ArticlesÂ 31 and 32 of the Euratom Treaty are not only providing a basis for the law in the process of being amended, but they also constitute an obligation for us.
Bearing in mind the health and safety of Europe's citizens, we must keep nuclear legislation up to date.
In accepting the SeppÃ€nen report, I firmly believe that we are doing enough to meet this obligation we have, and that we are making Directive 92/3/Euratom more effective.
I feel that it is extremely important that the legislation is on the correct middle course, in several respects.
First of all, it ensures the close monitoring of radioactive waste and of the spent fuel, which is now being re-processed, without the application of unjustified restrictions and bans.
Secondly, it guarantees citizens' safety, without imposing, in exchange, a disproportionate burden on economic operators.
Finally, although the regulation widens the scope of the legislation, it does not break away from the principle of subsidiarity.
In other words, although the new legislation provides people with new guarantees, Member States remain responsible for creating regulations specific to national particularities, as well as for ensuring the operation of the authorities that guarantee the enforcement of these regulations.
However, the latter also means that apart from jointly refining the legislation providing a stable basis for safety, it is also necessary to ensure the effective operation of the national authorities that constitute this framework, so that every citizen in the European Union can enjoy the greater safety offered by the new directive.
All the above is vitally important for the future of Europe's energy supply too, because we should be aware that the success of this complex operation is also the key to ensuring that people have confidence in nuclear energy.
Â Â  () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank the Commission for taking this initiative, for it is timely that it should give some thought to the essential things in the European Union, among them safety standards and the extreme risks involved in this technology, and that there should be awareness of the fact that the currently existing safety standards differ to the utmost degree and are, in many cases, in need of better monitoring, of, that is to say, what is termed a peer review or of some other means whereby they may be reviewed objectively and transparently.
As I see it, the question arises of what the position is in this area as regards consultation between the Commission, Parliament, and the relevant Member States, or of what is going on as regards the new strategy, according to which the Councilâs nuclear working group is, in effect, seizing powers exclusively for itself and treating our other partners in the European decision-making process in a manner that has no place in the present time.
We should be trying to establish a balance by taking, right now, responsibility for monitoring and transparency, which are becoming ever more necessary in this extremely sensitive area, rather than waiting for an accident to happen somewhere and only then looking for the responsible or guilty parties.
We should also be taking competition seriously, considering such questions as which costs arise from the removal and disposal of waste and also in connection with the safety and security of transports and the standards according to which these things are done.
This is where the European Union needs to act, and I would ask you all, bearing in mind the fact that the Euratom Treaty has been in place for fifty years, to embark upon a serious debate and put issues of safety and transparency centre stage.
Â Â  . Mr President, as todayâs debate has shown, there is broad support for the rapporteurâs report.
I should like to thank Mr SeppÃ€nen again for his excellent report, which has the support of a strong majority in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
Concerning the issue of the prohibition of any export of radioactive waste and spent fuel out of the Community, I would recall Article 13(1)(c) of the proposed directive, which further prohibits exports of radioactive waste and spent fuel to countries that do not possess the necessary administrative and technical capacity for safely managing the spent fuel or radioactive waste.
The Commission will issue strict criteria for deciding that.
It is for Member States to decide whether to authorise a shipment to a third country on a case-by-case basis, following strong guidance to be issued by the Commission.
That is the answer to the question that arose during the debate.
I strongly believe that we need as much transparency as possible when we deal with energy issues.
That also applies to nuclear energy.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the Council Statement on the presentation of the programme of the Finnish Presidency.
We welcome the Prime Minister of Finland and his Secretary of State for European Affairs, as well as the President of the Commission.
Mr Vanhanen has the floor first, on behalf of the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, MrÂ President and MadamÂ Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, honourable guests, I warmly thank you for this opportunity to come and discuss the priorities and main objectives of the Finnish Presidency with the European Parliament.
It is an exacting task to discharge the responsibilities of the Presidency in the European Union, but at the same time it is a great honour and privilege, and Finland welcomes the challenge.
As the country to hold the Presidency, our collaboration with the European Parliament has got off to a good start.
I would like to thank the President and all the other Members of the European Parliament who attended the meeting between the Finnish Government and Parliament in Helsinki.
Furthermore, several parliamentary committees and political groups have visited Finland and engaged in productive discussions regarding the aims of our Presidency.
Ever since Finland joined the EU it has supported efforts to make the work of the Unionâs institutions more effective and improve the close cooperation that exists between them.
As the country to hold the Presidency, we will work in close and effective cooperation with the European Parliament.
By that I do not just refer to Parliamentâs role in the codecision procedure as a legislator on an equal footing with the Council, but in a wider context, promoting the key aims of the Union.
Finlandâs own national parliament, the , is celebrating a special anniversary.
This year it is 100 years since the unicameral parliament was founded and universal suffrage established.
Everyone, men and women alike, at the same time had the right to vote and the right to stand for election.
We are proud of this landmark in the history of our democracy.
In Finland, the parliament is closely involved in the handling of EU affairs, and it has a lot of influence.
Perhaps this experience that we have of fruitful cooperation with our parliament has in turn made it so natural for us Finns to engage in close cooperation with the European Parliament too.
There is no overlap in the work of the European Parliament and that of the national parliaments: each has its own role to play in Union affairs.
Basically, however, they have the same fundamental mission: to strengthen democracy in the Union.
During its Presidency, Finland will endeavour to persuade the Union to look outwards and ahead.
We must reflect on what sort of a Union we want to see 10 to 20 years from now, and how that is to be achieved.
As Europeans, we need to identify the historical forces of change in our time, and respond to and embrace them.
It is a major challenge for the EU to face up to the reality of globalisation.
The world that surrounds the Union is changing and if we are not careful we will lag further and further behind.
That would be disastrous, above all for the future of our children and future generations.
For their sake, Europe must stop looking inwards and consider its position in the global context in the longer term.
The world around us will not wait.
Our future requires us to take concrete action now, even though its effects will only be visible later on.
In recent years participation in decision-making in the Union has left something to be desired and the public are more critical about that than before.
I nevertheless dismiss the pessimistic talk of a crisis in the Union; instead, I believe that the problems we have at present can be overcome.
The agreement reached on the Financial Framework and progress with the Services Directive are examples of the Union being able to take important decisions when the political will is there.
I believe that it is there in all the Unionâs institutions.
The European Union is a community of values, which exists for the people.
That is why its reduced legitimacy and its diminished justification and credibility in the eyes of the people must be taken seriously.
This perception that the Unionâs legitimacy is suffering is partly due to the fact that the public does not know what the Union does for them.
Many issues that have a real impact on peopleâs lives, such as the right to reside, work and study anywhere in the EU, are taken as a matter of course.
People forget that they are possible precisely on account of the Union.
Lack of information, however, does not explain everything: the Union has also to be able to improve the way it does things.
It needs to deliver results, the effects of which the people can see in their own lives.
The Unionâs basic premise, peace and stability in Europe, is still relevant.
I was personally reminded of that on my trip to Croatia a few weeks ago: they want to join the Union so that they and their children will never again need to witness another war.
Many other people, who have lived their whole lives in peace, tend, however, to take peace and stability for granted.
As a result, that no longer seems enough on its own to give the Union legitimacy.
As many of you have often said, the Union must be able to demonstrate the benefits it offers to its citizens in other ways too, and more tangibly.
The best way to demonstrate the necessity of the Union is to deal with its basic tasks effectively, especially its legislative work.
That we can and must do right away on the basis of the existing Treaties.
Europe cannot wait around for new rules on decision-making: it needs to start improving the way it functions straight away.
The Union needs to show that it can achieve results that impact on human lives and not just quarrel about institutional matters.
Improved effectiveness will mean that bold decisions will need to be taken by Europeâs leaders and decision-makers.
We cannot just think about the here and now, or future elections; we have to think about the interests of future generations.
That is why decisions also need to be taken which will perhaps be painful now, but which will help shape the future.
There must also be a willingness to compromise on national points of view and consider Europe as a whole.
The Union must focus on the essential, and work effectively for it. That means the sort of action that results in added value compared to what the Member States could do alone.
This added value can be achieved in the areas of welfare, security and freedom.
If we are to realise these aims we need to start with the right approach.
Transparency is essential: our citizens need to know how the decisions that affect them are made.
The growing political debate in Europe is in the interests of everyone. You also have a crucial role to play in this.
I am pleased that we in the European Council decided to increase the transparency of Council sittings.
Finland, as the country to hold the Presidency, will implement comprehensively the principles adopted by the European Council to increase the transparency of the Councilâs work.
Finland will aim to contribute to the issue of transparency in other ways too, in all its practical work and activities.
We shall aim to ensure that all essential information is available at our EU Presidency website as quickly as possible.
Sometimes practical solutions like this do more to provide genuine access to information than mere political statements.
During its Presidency, Finland will steer its resources towards better regulation, that is to say, quality of legislation, and attention to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
This will not merely be a case of pruning legislation.
In the European Union we need new legislation, but we must keep existing legislation up-to-date.
This way the Union can influence and react dynamically to the changes in the world around it.
In this we support the work of the Commission.
The Presidency will invest time and effort in ensuring that decision-making takes careful account of the economic, social and environmental effects of legislative proposals.
Our goal will also be to expedite the implementation of Commission proposals that aim to simplify and update legislation.
The work of the Council will be based on the Annual Work Programme for 2006, which we drafted together with Austria.
Cooperation between successive Presidencies is very important for continuity.
With Austria it has gone well, and we intend to continue the cooperation in just the same positive spirit with Germany, which succeeds us.
The Finnish Presidency is committed to working through the Union agenda and all the issues on it effectively, efficiently and impartially.
I shall briefly mention here the issues that the Finnish Presidency intends to highlight in particular, but that does not mean that we would not attend to other matters just as diligently.
There is need for progress in all sectors.
Finland wants to promote the debate on the Unionâs future.
Connected with this debate are the very real issues of the future of the Unionâs Constitutional Treaty and EU enlargement.
I am pleased that the European Council decided in June that, with regard to the Constitutional Treaty, it was time to move on from mere reflection to a more proactive stage.
This twin-track approach is the right one: we will improve the way the Union functions in line with the current Treaties, whilst at the same time we start to ponder the future of the Constitutional Treaty.
During its Presidency, Finland will start consultations relating to the future of the Constitutional Treaty.
These consultations with the Member States and EU institutions will form the basis of a report to be produced during the first half of 2007, when Germany has the Presidency.
I am convinced that the Treaty negotiated with the Member States is essential for an expanding Union.
In Finland the Government presented a proposal on the ratification of the Treaty to the Finnish Parliament at the start of June, and Parliament will deliberate on the matter in its autumn session.
In this way, Finland is adopting a position on the negotiated Treaty.
Union enlargement is one of the key issues for the Finnish Presidency.
I am personally convinced that the enlargement of the Union has been a success story.
Not only is enlargement a crucial tool for strengthening stability and democracy, it is also one of Europeâs strategic responses to the challenges of globalisation.
Recent analyses show that the latest round of enlargement was of clear benefit to both the new and the old Member States.
In June the European Council held an important debate on the Unionâs absorption capacity.
I am very pleased that this was not set as a new accession criterion.
No new accession criteria should be set for applicant countries, but at the same time the existing criteria must be adhered to unconditionally.
The bottom line is that the Union should remain an open Community.
European states that meet the membership criteria should be able to join.
During our Presidency a decision will be taken on the accession date for Romania and Bulgaria.
Membership negotiations with Turkey and Croatia will also be taken forward on the basis of the progress they have made and the Commission reports.
The Finnish Presidency will also support the European Perspective of the Western Balkans.
The current year will in many ways be crucial for the future of the Western Balkans.
The process concerning the status of Kosovo is likely to reach a conclusive phase in the autumn.
The Presidency hopes that the parties will achieve results in the exacting negotiations entered into under Martti Ahtisaari by the end of the year.
A vital area during the Finnish Presidency will be the competitiveness of the Union and its Member States and their success in global competition.
These we will make efforts to address over a broad spectrum during our Presidency in the various formations of the Council.
A fundamental question is where Europe will find the foundations for economic growth.
Finlandâs answer is that it will be found in such areas as innovation, energy solutions, the quality of work and productivity, openness in global trade, immigration and a competent social security system.
It is the Member States which have the principal responsibility for competitiveness. The onus is on them.
The Union must have its own part to play too.
Finland will strive to achieve results with regard to the Seventh Framework Programme for research.
The same goes for the regulation on chemicals, REACH, the Services Directive, the Working Time Directive and the regulation on international roaming.
We want to make headway in developing a wide-ranging innovation policy.
In Council legislation work and at the meeting of the Heads of State and Government in Lahti we will focus on initiatives designed to create a favourable environment for generating innovation and adopting it effectively.
We are talking about a demand-driven innovation policy.
The Heads of State and Government at Lahti can expedite the necessary decision-making process.
If there is to be a wide-ranging innovation policy there will have to be more effective cooperation and decision-making in the Union, for example, in standardisation, in the protection of intellectual property, and in the development of the financial markets.
It will be just as important to add momentum to student and researcher mobility, enhance cooperation between universities and expedite the creation of European centres of excellence.
I would also like to stress how important the positive effect of competition resulting from an open global economy is on innovation.
Europe needs to boost the mobility of its intellectual and material resources.
The cornerstone of innovation policy is the Unionâs internal market and its further development.
The obstacles to an internal market that functions effectively must be removed, so that the benefits of economic integration can be fully felt.
The internal market is the very foundation of the EU. This should not be forgotten.
The market in services is of major importance in this, and it is excellent that we are nearing a settlement on the Services Directive.
The role of the European Parliament has been crucial.
I hope that the directive can be finally adopted immediately at second reading in the European Parliament.
External relations regarding energy are also on the agenda at the meeting of the Heads of State and Government in Lahti.
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has been invited to the dinner that takes place after the meeting, where he and EU leaders will have an opportunity for some informal discussions.
Europeâs economic success depends very much on securing a reliable supply of energy at a reasonable price.
All Member States are affected by the challenges of rising energy prices, reliability of supply and climate change.
Energy policy choices are largely national affairs.
The European Union, however, needs common energy policy guidelines, and, in particular, a coherent policy on external relations with regard to energy.
During the Finnish Presidency we want to promote the strategic debate on how we need to make our objectives on energy policy visible in the Unionâs external relations.
Energy consumption and the choice of energy sources are closely related to the most serious threat to the environment of our time, climate change.
With regard to climate policy, it is especially important to promote the discussions on the development of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change after 2012.
The Finnish Presidency will try internationally to promote discussion that could result in the EUâs objective of establishing an ambitious regime for climate change that covers all major countries.
A comprehensive approach would not only work to promote a response to the climate challenge which is as effective as possible but would protect EU competitiveness.
Both these issues, energy and climate change, will be high on the agenda at summits with third countries during the Finnish Presidency, including the 10th ASEM Summit between the EU and Asian countries, to take place in Helsinki.
I am well aware that millions of Europeans fear global competition and that, as a result, they also oppose many changes.
This fear was in evidence in the debate on the Services Directive, for example.
It needs to be taken seriously.
I would stress that we should not try and boost competitiveness in Europe no matter what the cost and regardless of the consequences.
There needs to be a balance between reform, social security and environmental sustainability.
Frequently, however, new working methods and modern technology benefit both economic growth and social welfare, and reduce emissions into the environment.
To preserve Europeâs welfare societies we will need to boost competitiveness, reduce unemployment, and improve labour productivity.
The results are to be achieved through close cooperation with the social partners.
A new balance between flexibility and security is the goal here.
Finland will therefore host an extraordinary social summit just prior to the Lahti meeting of Heads of State and Government, where these issues will be discussed.
The Unionâs external relations are linked to the economy, as its external action is based on its economic strength.
We are an attractive trading partner, and that means that we have influence.
The EU has become a global actor, which cannot afford to pause to reflect when dealing with external affairs.
During the Finnish Presidency, the EUâs international role will be consolidated and the coherence in the way it acts and functions will be reinforced.
The Union has a far more comprehensive range of tools at its disposal than many other global players.
They must be used with consistency, whether it is regarding policy on external relations, trade, development cooperation or human rights.
The voice of the Union will only be heard around the world as one of unity if the Union is united.
We intend to develop the Unionâs crisis management further.
Rapid deployment troops must be fully ready to respond by the start of 2007.
Coordination of civil and military crisis management will continue.
EU relations with Russia and the Northern Dimension will be priority areas during the Finnish Presidency.
The Western Balkans, transatlantic relations and Asia will also be high on the agenda.
EU-Russian relations will not just be limited to the issues of trade and energy: the aim is for a broad-based partnership, in which European values and global interests unite us.
The goal will be Russiaâs ever closer involvement in democratic European cooperation in the various sectors of society.
For that we need more dialogue between the EU countries and Russia, as well as student exchanges, cultural collaborations, and the active involvement of civil society.
During the Finnish Presidency there will be discussions regarding the new framework for the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which expires at the end of next year.
Regarding the Northern Dimension, we have now come a long way: the political framework agreement is to be signed in the autumn.
The development of the Northern Dimension is also of value in respect of other forms of cooperation in the Baltic region.
In addition to all this, we will obviously devote our efforts to the crises in the Middle East and other regions.
We are very concerned about the situation in the Palestinian territories, on which important separate talks are being held today.
In external relations the unexpected is the rule rather than the exception.
Finland is also ready to take its presidential responsibilities seriously should the unexpected occur.
During the Finnish Presidency, a thorough political evaluation will be carried out on the progress achieved in the area of freedom, security and justice.
We need concrete action, effective decision-making and the rigid implementation nationally of the decisions that have already been taken.
In 1999 the Tampere Summit showed the way for the ambitious and democratic development of justice and home affairs.
Now, in 2006, the assessment of the Hague Programme will provide an opportunity actively to push ahead with European cooperation in this area.
The public expect effective action on the part of the European Union in the fight against international criminality, people trafficking and terrorism.
During the Finnish Presidency the political will of the Member States to commit to more effective decision-making, especially in the area of policing and crime, will be put to the test.
The work can be improved if the Member States are ready to switch to a system of qualified majority decisions and communitisation in this area.
The most recent European Council called on us to consider this in conjunction with the Commission.
I would like to emphasise that cooperation on policing and crime is not just a way of scoring points.
We do not intend to get the Constitutional Treaty through by the backdoor, because the changes can be implemented on the basis of the Treaty of Nice.
Finland would also like to endorse the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition in judicial cooperation.
If judgments and decisions by the legal authorities in another Member State are implemented as they stand, this can be a very real way of boosting the efficiency of large-scale, cross-border criminal investigations and speeding up legal proceedings.
A good example of this is the European arrest warrant, which has resulted in shortening the time it has taken to extradite suspects from more than six months to as little as just one day.
Recent events, such as those in the Canary Islands and Malta, have once again made illegal immigration headline news.
We need to take a thorough look at the range of options that the Union has, including agreement on common policies on legal immigration.
More effective border control is just one part of the solution, albeit an important one.
The importance of cooperation with the countries of origin and transit involved in illegal immigration cannot be overstated.
We need to ensure that the Unionâs common asylum system is in place by 2010.
The Union must be able to guarantee protection to those who need it, with reference to comparable procedures and legislation.
Attention also needs to be paid to the external dimension of questions relating to migration and partnership with our neighbours.
As I said at the beginning, cooperation between the institutions at both European and national level must be developed further.
Today I would like to thank you in particular for this opportunity to present the priorities of the Finnish Presidency and discuss with you how they may be promoted.
I await your comments with interest both today and at any time in the future, in this plenary and in other contexts.
The debate on Europeâs development is an important one, regardless of the political differences.
The leaders of the political groups in the European Parliament, for example at the public meeting in Helsinki at the start of June, have demonstrated the will and ability to move forward with the European agenda.
We in Finland too are used to engaging in productive cross-party political cooperation.
It is also a natural thing to do at European level.
I hope that working together, as we will be during the next six months, will produce the best possible results.
I look forward to being here again in the European Parliament in connection with the summits that are to be held during the Finnish Presidency.
We live in a time of enormous challenges.
The Union needs to look to the future, boldly embrace reform, and demonstrate the political will needed to develop Europe.
I believe that in many cases the right answer is more Europe, not less.
As it is about to begin, this Presidency has already been described as a sort of transitional phase. It would deal with the day-to-day business and prepare for a time when the preconditions for tackling the Unionâs major issues are close at hand.
It needs to be said very clearly, however, that, although the European Union might be in something of a wait-and-see mood, the rest of the world around us is not going to come to a halt.
It would be the wrong way to treat Europeâs future generations if we were to close our eyes to the historic challenges we face and just wait around for a better time to come.
That time is here and now.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am delighted that, after the excellent Austrian Presidency, we can now work in tandem with the Finns.
In Helsinki a few days ago, Prime Minister Vanhanen and I agreed that our two teams should work as one.
Let us join efforts between the Presidency, the Commission and Parliament.
Europe needs the clear, dynamic harmony which Finland brings.
I welcome the presentation by the Prime Minister, MrÂ Vanhanen.
He has shown that the next six months present an opportunity to demonstrate what we mean when we talk about a Europe of results, to deliver on important dossiers of concern to our citizens, to move towards the next stage in the constitutional question, to steer the discussion on enlargement.
In short, to follow the twin-track approach which I outlined to this House last month â an approach that was endorsed by the European Council â to move from a period of reflection to a period of engagement.
Let me pick up just some of the themes raised by Prime Minister Vanhanen.
I shall start with a simple, important point concerning enlargement.
It is one of the most successful policies of the European Union, an extraordinary achievement in exporting freedom and opportunity across our continent.
Many of us here today have benefited from this policy.
We should be proud of our enlargement policy.
I was very pleased that the last European Council reaffirmed that we will honour existing commitments.
However, on enlargement, as on so much of European policy-making, there is a popular debate with which we must engage.
I welcome that debate.
I want that debate.
It is important to show that Europe does not enlarge by default, that enlargement is a conscious choice that is of benefit to all, that far from being a negative factor, an enlarged Europe is a precondition for a powerful Europe, for a Europe that really counts in the world.
That is why this autumn the Commission will report on the enlargement process as a whole, to set up the debate at the December European Council.
This will include the analysis of the capacity of an enlarged Europe to function properly.
This will be a serious, rigorous exercise.
Nothing else will satisfy the public demand for more certainty and confidence.
We must take the same serious and correct approach to Turkey.
I welcome the fact that negotiations are under way.
It will be a long road, sometimes a very bumpy one.
What matters is that we are open, honest and fair.
Turkey must fulfil its commitments, just as the European Union must fulfil its commitments.
Turkeyâs commitments include respect for the Ankara Protocol.
Each Presidency brings its own particular expertise to the European Union.
In Finlandâs case it also brings a deep knowledge of and cooperation with its neighbours, including Russia.
I strongly support the emphasis placed by the Presidency on the relationship with Russia.
Earlier this week the Commission adopted a recommendation for a comprehensive agreement that we hope will bring â because we believe it is in our interests as well as Russiaâs â a new quality to the European Unionâs relations with Russia, building on the existing partnership and cooperation agreement.
We are proposing to move towards a free trade area to be completed once Russia accedes to the WTO.
At the same time, we propose a partnership approach for energy, based on mutual interests and agreed principles.
Next week Prime Minister Vanhanen and I will travel to St Petersburg for the G8 Summit to determine, I hope, a new framework for the global energy challenges which require a global response.
For energy, as for climate change, we need this global response.
We will follow this up in turn at the October and December European summits.
It is clear that on Russia â as on so many external issues â Europe has greater power when it works in a united and coherent way, and I hope the Member States will approach this issue precisely in that way.
The Commission looks forward to the Finnish Presidency taking forward the negotiations on the next generation of Northern Dimension partnerships.
The ultimate result should be a shared policy with common ownership by all players, including Russia.
The Northern Dimension will become a permanent forum on northern issues and concerns.
In this context, the Commission has taken good note of this Parliamentâs aspiration to establish a parliamentary forum.
The European economy is picking up pace.
This is good news and we should build on it.
I welcome the Finnish Presidencyâs intention to drive forward the new Lisbon Strategy and to focus on research, innovation and education â the knowledge triangle.
In this area, as well as in others, we must move from reflection to engagement, to real delivery.
Political support must now be translated into concrete actions which create a more innovative climate in Europe.
My Commission will prepare a short paper on innovation to prepare for the Lahti informal summit.
We must promote the European Research Area, including the European Institute of Technology, which should be a flagship project and symbol of the knowledge-based European economy.
We must accelerate the drive to ensure open and interoperable standards and promote those standards worldwide.
We must promote effective mechanisms â like venture capital â to finance innovation by European companies, having in mind also small and medium-sized companies.
Last week the Commission adopted proposals for an ambitious programme for increased security and more efficient justice for Europeâs citizens in a way that respects and protects their rights.
This is a key feature of our Europe of Results agenda.
I share the Finnish Presidencyâs determination to move this dossier forward.
The European Union will return to Tampere for the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council in September, to deepen European integration in this crucial area.
The case for deeper and more dynamic European action is clear: against those who plot against our values, freedom and democracy; against those who traffic in human beings, especially women and children; against illegal migration and those who exploit people in the workplace.
We should not wait for the next tragedy in order to advance European integration in these areas: we must act now to prevent it.
We must implement better what already exists.
For example, everybody agrees that sexual exploitation of children is a repugnant crime, yet only five countries have transposed the framework directive.
Everybody agrees on the need to act against terrorism and organised crime, yet several Member States have not transposed effectively key legislation, such as the framework decision on terrorism.
To achieve our goals, we must improve our procedures.
It is not coherent to proclaim the ends â on the fight against crime, terrorism, illegal immigration â but not provide the means.
The Commission believes the Community method, including proper European democratic scrutiny by this Parliament, should be spread to police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and legal migration.
That is what we said in our Citizensâ Agenda paper of 10Â May.
We are therefore now proposing to use the existing Treaty articles to make this change.
The Commission is opening the interinstitutional debate and based on the results of that debate we will present formal proposals.
I very much welcome the clear remarks made just now by Prime Minister Vanhanen.
We know there are political sensitivities, and we are ready to address those political sensitivities, but our procedures must catch up with reality.
Any step we take to improve our cooperation in security and justice matters must be matched with an extended protection of the individual citizenâs human and civic rights.
This is for us a question of principle.
Law is the source of strength of the European Union, not intergovernmental backroom deals outside Parliamentary scrutiny and judicial review.
That is why I also welcome the commitment of the Finnish Presidency to everything associated with the transparency agenda.
Transparency, subsidiarity, better regulation should not be seen, as sometimes they are seen, as just technical matters; they are political matters.
It is the democratic accountability agenda of our Union and we, the European Commission, stand ready to move forward on all those issues â transparency, better regulation and real subsidiarity â because this is a question of democratic accountability.
I have picked out only a few of the priorities of the Finnish Presidency.
There are other priorities we fully share, including matters of immediate concern such as the deadlock in the Doha trade round.
The last few presidencies have helped the European Union resolve internal problems or lay the path towards their resolution.
Now we need a change of gear from reflection to engagement, to a Europe which is looking forwards and outwards.
I welcome this.
An open Europe, a more self confident Europe, a forward-looking Europe is what we need.
Let us renew our energies to engage more deeply, more coherently and more effectively with the world around us.
By exporting our values, by promoting our interests in the world, we can strengthen our identity and confidence.
I look forward to doing just that in the next six months with the Finnish Presidency and with Prime Minister Vanhanen.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the world is going crazy about football, but Europe has already won.
The world champion will be from the European Union, and the four best teams come from its Member States.
The President of the Commission has just been talking about self-confidence.
So let me say that self-confidence is what we should have â but without being cocky.
Peaceful competition â which is what the footballers are now teaching us about â is a wonderful thing, and that peaceful competition and fair play are what we need in Europe and throughout the world.
If we take them as the basis for our actions, we will be successful.
Who better to embody that truth than Finland?
Mr Vanhanen, the meeting we group chairmen had with you in Helsinki was a good one, being effective, professional, transparent and unspectacular, for it is generally the case that failure is the lot of those who announce â or seek â something spectacular, for they cannot come up with what they promised.
Europe is like a chain; so, too, are the presidencies.
We have had an Austrian Presidency; the Presidency is now held by the Finns.
After them will come German, Portuguese, Slovenian and then French Presidencies.
Every link in this chain must be strong.
It is when this continuity is present that all presidencies are successful.
Experience shows that it is not just the presidencies held by the so-called big countries that are successful, but, very often, on the contrary, the smaller countries were.
We wish the Finns much success and are right behind you.
It is on 25 March 2007 that we will be commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, and this date falls within the German Presidency rather than the Finnish.
We very much welcome the Commissionâs proposal that there should be a joint statement by the European Council, the Commission and Parliament.
Our group proposes that work on preparing the substance of this statement and the organisational aspects of it should begin under the Finnish Presidency, and we propose that a working group be set up to deal with the preparations at the political level.
While the next presidency must of course be involved in this, the work must be started now, under the Finnish Presidency.
It is not only the Summit that is to be held on 25 March, important though that of course is, and in respect of which the German Federal Chancellor has extended an invitation to Berlin, but there is also some sort of event to be staged in Rome, where the Treaties of Rome were signed fifty years ago, and I am given to understand that the Catholic Church wants to organise something.
I would be very glad, my good Mr Cohn-Bendit, if the Greens, with whom we are in friendly competition where the unification of Europe is concerned, were to get involved in the same way as business and the trade unions are, for this Europe is something in which we all share, and is not the property of any one political family; it is for that reason that everyone should get involved.
When Mr Schulz comes to make his speech, he will tell us all about how the Greens should behave.
I am always reticent about giving advice and do not want to use my speaking time to answer Mr Schulzâ interjections.
Something that you, Mr President of the European Council, will have to address is the relationship with Russia.
While that is something that we, of course, very much welcome, we also argue that we need Russia to be a solid, stable, and â it is to be hoped â democratic partner.
It has to be said, though, that we have to stop making it a matter of policy to give the Russians hugs and pats on the shoulder; while we say âyesâ to shared interests, including in energy supply, we also have to tell the Russians that human rights have to be guaranteed.
A few days ago, I had a visit from the lawyer acting for the industrialist Mr Khodorkovsky.
The way in which this man is being treated in Russian jails is quite unacceptable, and there are many other examples of this sort of thing.
Where these things are concerned, we have to make our voices heard.
Mr President of the European Council, the President of the Finnish Parliament, Mr Lipponen, told the conference of parliamentarians that we, the Austrian Presidency, and the Commission organised in Brussels, that there is also to be a conference of Members of this House and members of the national parliaments.
This is something of which we are very much in favour, believing as we do that we in this House and the national parliaments must work much more closely together.
If we do this, dismantle certain prejudices that exist, and work together on the European project, then success will be ours.
On behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish your Presidency much success.
Where our shared future in Europe and in the world are at stake, we will be right behind you.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to pay tribute to the Italian football team, I shall begin my speech in Italian.
MrÂ President, you see before you an unhappy German group chairman, but a happy socialist one.
Most of my colleagues from Italy are not here this morning.
Their absence is excusable.
In his speech, Mr Vanhanen said that âwe need more Europe', and he was right, for the things your presidency has chosen as the headings for the chapters in its programme â such things as the challenge of globalisation, the new Lisbon strategy, energy, partnership â all these things are now beyond the capacity of nation states to resolve.
Not one single EU Member State, be it large or small, can now handle the challenges, whether economic, environmental or social, that we face today, and it is for that reason that we have to develop the European Union further, the reason why we have to entrench it.
Indeed, there are those who say that we want to offer our people, who face this global challenge, the framework that Europe needs in order to keep its head above water in international competition, and what they need is more Europe.
For the sake of consistency, though, if they are to have this âmore Europeâ, they have to supply the framework that Europe needs.
In this Union of 25 â which will soon comprise 27 states â we cannot resolve the challenges that you rightly described with the means at our disposal; it is not possible.
That is why your decision, as a consequence of what you described, to ratify the Constitution, was a way of saying, âwe need this instrumentâ and was, as such, a logical, right and therefore consistent decision to take.
In so doing, you have sent out the right signal at the very outset of your presidency, and that is something of which we Social Democrats are very much in favour.
Mr President of the Commission, you said, âwe want to be a team with the Finnish Presidency of the Councilâ.
That is terrific, and we are right there with you on that, but, in his speech just now, Mr Vanhanen had this to say:
âI am convinced that an enlarging Union needs the Constitutional Treaty that was negotiated by its Member States.â
â Enlargement and the Constitution are two sides of the same coin.
I now read in a report from Reuters â I have no idea as to whether it is true or false; you can explain that to us â that you, after the meeting with Mr Vanhanen, what one might call the teambuilding in Helsinki, told a press conference that we could also enlarge on the basis of the Treaty of Nice.
The Reuters report may well be wrong, and in that case you should tell us what the truth of the matter is.
I am grateful for the opportunity given to us to talk about the third pillar.
The deficit that you described, and also the examples that the President of the Commission adduced of the failure to transpose legislation on security policy and third-pillar cooperation, are things that need to be dealt with.
Nowhere are the European people more in favour of power at the European level than when it comes to the combating of organised crime, a well-ordered immigration policy, a safe asylum policy and properly secured borders, but nowhere â as MrÂ Barroso rightly said â are we less effective than in these areas.
You are right to say that we need the âpasserelleâ clause, but that has nothing to do with any âcherry-pickingâ approach to the Constitution.
You only have to read the Treaty of Nice to see that it already provides for a transfer from the third pillar to the first, subject to unanimous approval by the Council, five years following its entry into force, and so we are acting within the bounds set by a valid Treaty.
While we are on this subject, let me make a final observation.
When talking about the third pillar, we are talking about the chapter that also describes citizensâ freedoms and rights in Europe.
When talking about the Constitution, we are also talking about the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but then we must, even now, start asking the Presidents of the Council and the Commission to be more pro-active in dealing with the populist development in Europe, of which we in this House are made aware on a daily basis.
We now have, in the European Union, governments â and that is bad enough â that are supported by right-wing populist parties, some of them openly racist and xenophobic, and these are sitting in the European Council â not as backbenchers in some parliament or other, but as active members of European institutions.
I myself saw an example of this during yesterdayâs debate on Francoism, in which one of the speakers was a non-attached Member of this House, whose son is the Deputy Prime Minister of Poland; here, in this House, he openly defended the Franco regime.
This is not some sort of random event; the fact is that more and more governments in the European Union are starting, through their failure to take action against it, to make populism respectable, and that constitutes a serious threat to fundamental freedoms in Europe.
I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to take a more serious approach to addressing this issue, not least at Council level, for when democracy is threatened, it is most often from within rather than from without.
Â Â  . Mr President, with the Finnish Presidencyâs emphasis on productivity, accountability and transparency, âFinlandiaâ is music to Liberal ears.
The programme you have presented today, President-in-Office, reflects both the strong reforming tendencies of your government and the egalitarian and innovative impulses of a nation which repeatedly tops the league tables for education, innovation and development.
Liberal values will be on the march with your Presidency.
I would like to refer to just a few areas which my group feels to be important.
First, the market-driven programme.
Priorities like completing the internal market, particularly in services and the energy sector, are key goals for us in the months ahead, as are efforts to deliver a directive on the portability of supplementary pensions and promoting market openings for new technologies.
The latter will pay more long-term dividends than any government-funded initiatives on research and development, and provide the growth and jobs and prosperity that our Union desperately needs.
As regards Article 42 â justice and home affairs â your Presidency is right to focus on areas where European Union legislation adds value to citizensâ lives, but in the modern world a wanted man can be halfway across Europe before the policeman has his boots on.
It beggars belief that the law still has borders, when criminals do not.
For too long, key initiatives on police and judicial cooperation have been stalled in the Council, and even those decisions taken lack the democratic scrutiny that protects our human rights and civil liberties, as we have seen with the inadequacies of data protection legislation.
President-in-Office, the time has come to heed our call to apply the footbridge clause provided for in Article 42 and to make policy in justice and home affairs democratically.
The transparency initiative, which has found one of its key supporters in your Presidency, is one way out of this anti-democratic cul-de-sac.
Liberals and Democrats seek your assurance that safeguard clauses will be used sparingly or not at all.
But true transparency requires that the transposition, implementation and enforcement of legislation be given much more attention than it has to date.
Three years ago, we demanded that Member States draw up concordance tables showing how they transposed EU directives into national law.
Let citizens see for themselves which parts of the law come from Brussels and which reflect the hobbyhorses of national governments.
Otherwise, poor implementation and gold-plating will continue to fuel the fire of Brussels-bashers.
Yet, since your Presidency started three days ago, I see changes are already afoot.
The comitology decision, which gives Parliament the right of recall, giving us equal powers to Council to make sure the law is applied, is a very important step.
With greater power comes greater responsibility and I hope that our House will bear that in mind when it meets today to discuss much-needed parliamentary reform.
President-in-Office, you have a big agenda: the agenda of dealing with Asia and the ASEM Summit; the agenda of dealing with Russia.
We wish you success in this and we ask you to think not just of engagement, but of promotion of European values, of human rights and democracy, so essential to the development of our world.
We wish you success in finding a way forward to an agreement in the WTO, so valuable to our economy and that of developing countries, and we wish you great success with enlargement, though we know that is also in the hands of another very competent Finn, Commissioner Rehn, who is here with us today.
In conclusion, you spoke about public fears of globalisation.
These can best be overcome by developing a European consciousness.
As LÃ¶nnrot did for Finland in the Kalevala, we need to draw on aspects of our common history to create a common consciousness.
I wish you the wisdom of VÃ€inÃ€mÃ¶inen.
I hope that for the peopleâs lasting pleasure you compose mighty songs for Europeâs children.
For his peopleâs lasting pleasure, mighty songs for Suomiâs children.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, your speech, MrÂ President-in-Office, has left me quite stunned.
You decorated all your proposals with words like âwe must, âwe have toâ and âwe need toâ, and, in itself, everything you said is true, but at no point did you tell us how and why you plan to reach these targets, and you never told us how they would be prioritised.
So, let us start by assessing the situation in Europe â and in this I am repeating some of what MrÂ Schulz said.
We are currently facing a worrying development in Europe: in Slovakia, the social democrats are allying themselves with the extreme right to form a government; similar developments are taking place in Poland; and in the Netherlands, the centre-right government, in an attempt to hold on to power, is forming an alliance with the populist extreme right.
It is the same trend, and, indeed, when you say that 'Europe is a combination of values and the capacity to take action', what do you think the relationship is between values and action?
You have not said anything about that.
Allow me, like MrÂ Poettering, to return to another problem, that of Russia and energy.
At the moment, Europe is giving the impression that it is under MrÂ Putin's thumb, because it is afraid of losing its energy, and when we are afraid of losing our energy, we no longer have any energy at all!
That is the reality of the situation in Europe, and I saw no trace of this observation in the Finnish position.
Do you remember the commotion caused in Finland when a member of your Green party said that the Duma was not democratic?
Something that is self-evident to all caused a scandal in Finland.
I would therefore advise caution.
In addition, you talked about illegal immigration, but, before we talk about illegal immigration, we need to discuss the need to organise legal immigration.
Until we are able to organise legal immigration, we will continue to have illegal immigration.
You referred to the Council of Europe and its discussions on the possibilities for enlarging Europe, but why did you not refer to its discussions on the CIA and the situation where a major international secret service institution can operate in Europe without anyone being informed â neither the European Union nor the European governments?
Why did you not mention the French or German secret services, who have illegally been to interrogate people in Guantanamo?
That is the reality of Europe.
These are the issues you need to talk about if you want to save the rule of law in Europe.
Even so, the Presidency needs to seize with both hands the reality of the European Union, and not content itself with making an assessment like the ones we can read every day in the newspapers.
You have not given Europe a direction.
That is what your speech was lacking.
Â Â  . Mr President, during the previous Finnish Presidency seven years ago significant steps were taken towards federalising the Union.
At the time a basis was created for establishing an area of freedom, security and justice; in other words, the communitisation of the Member Statesâ civil legislation.
That policy is now being continued.
During the previous term the militarisation of the Union was also begun and military institutions established for it, under whose leadership preparations are in place for military operations in Africa early next year.
Training for these is going on in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, although no one is going to the source of the chaos in the eastern parts of the country.
In major political issues during the Presidency the Finnish Government will not obtain the backing of its own people.
An indication of that is the resistance to the Governmentâs proposal to ratify the defunct EU Constitution in the Finnish Parliament this autumn.
According to an opinion poll, just 22% of the Finnish people are in favour of ratification, as proposed by the government.
This Constitution will never come into force anywhere.
Its ratification is a waste of time, although that is what the Commission, among other bodies, wants.
Commissioner Olli Rehn, after all, has adopted a position on this on behalf of the Commission, although the matter does not fall within the Commissionâs competence.
Commissioner Rehnâs attitude does not befit a Member of the European Commission.
Some Member States, furthermore, have proposed to Finland that the Constitution should be ratified.
Finlandâs acceptance is a sign of subservience.
Neither is Finland showing any regard for the power of the people or democracy in France or the Netherlands.
According to an opinion poll, the Finnish people oppose any military alliance for the country.
The Finnish Government is making a mockery of the will of the people in this matter too by making the supply of EU combat forces one priority area.
MrÂ Vanhanenâs Government has yielded to the EUâs will by abolishing the requirement under national law for a UN mandate as a condition for the mobilisation of a combat force division.
The UN is being prepared for illegal wars with no UN mandate, even though, from the legal standpoint internationally, a precondition for legal military action is in fact a UN mandate.
Our group opposes these attempts at the militarization of the EU and involving the EU in illegal wars.
Civil servants in Finland are trained in dealing effectively with matters relating to EU enlargement, Structural Funds programmes, the REACH regulation, the Seventh Framework Programme on science and research and many other day-to-day issues on the EUâs agenda.
These also include the directive on services and free trade, which our group has viewed critically.
Openness and transparency, which Finland says it promotes, would be increased by Finlandâs own decision to make known in public the recipients of EU agricultural aid.
Our group actively supports the policy on Russia and thinks that Commission President Barrosoâs proposal for a free trade agreement with Russia is an interesting start and one which the Presidency needs to respond to.
We wish Finland success in all the various matters it has to deal with on a daily basis.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to welcome the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission to the Chamber.
When the incoming Presidency sets out its programme, it can often sound a little stale or bored and the reaction to it is also stale.
That is why it is unfortunate that some of the brilliant ideas from the Presidency on the future it envisages for the European Union have not been taken up properly.
Looking at the different Presidency programmes â whether the Finnish Presidency, the previous Austrian Presidency or even the advance programme for the German Presidency â we can often see continuity in one area, but we can also see the individuality of the country taking over the Presidency.
One of the key elements we in the European Union must focus on is our relationship with the countries to the east of the existing European Union borders.
You, President-in-Office, have proved your ability and skill in building up the relationship with Russia.
It is not just about energy, but also about neighbourhood policy, cooperation and geopolitical stability, because there are so many issues in the former states of the Soviet Union that can create uncertainty and instability within the European Union.
We have to be careful of that and we look to you to utilise your resources and skills in those areas.
Secondly, on the question of transparency and openness â and people often speak about transparency without fully realising or understanding what it means â the most transparent thing Parliament, the institutions and the Presidency can do is to deliver on their commitments.
That is why, President-in-Office, the ideas being proposed on improving justice and home affairs, promoting alternative energy â although I might disagree with you on other aspects of climate change and their solutions â and new ways of creating biofuels, bio-energy and bioethanol are the way forward.
You and some of your ministers will need to be courageous in standing up to the lobby groups that want to push us down a single road.
The best approach is the multi-track approach, taking the best from each individual part.
The President of the Commission rightly referred to the importance of research and technology and innovation for the European economy.
If we in Europe are not ahead of the rest of the world in our ability to create new ideas and new innovations, we will lose.
No matter how good our tax regimes or infrastructure, if we do not have the brains, intelligence and capacity to utilise and exploit those ideas, then we will fail.
I think some of the ideas your Presidency is putting forward on research and development will yield dividends for us.
The protection of intellectual property should be one of your concerns.
Finally, I have not so far mentioned football, but I have to mention one aspect and that is that football is a game of two halves and even extra time.
It may be that we need extra time rather than applying the clause under Article 42 immediately.
Let us ensure that we have consensus in the Council before moving forward.
Â Â  . Mr President, listening to MrÂ Vanhanenâs speech I experienced that dÃ©jÃ  vu moment â we have been here before, because it is the same speech with every incoming Presidency.
I started to ask myself, Mr Vanhanen, who do you really represent?
Are you here today giving us the express will of your own nation?
Well, I wonder, because the last comprehensive Eurobarometer poll carried out in autumn 2005 showed that only 38% of your fellow countrymen think membership of the European Union has been a good thing.
Therefore the message from them is pretty clear: they do not want more Europe.
And yet here you are today telling us that the medicine the rest of us need is that we must have more Europe, we must have the Constitution, we must press ahead.
What you represent is the professional political class in Europe, who of course are all in favour of the European Union.
My view is that it was an absolute democratic disgrace that, at the recent Brussels Summit, all 25 Heads of State and Government agreed to end the period of reflection and to begin to implement the Constitution against the wishes that the Dutch and French people expressed in their referendums last year.
So public opinion does not matter a damn, does it?
It is business as usual and you are going to press on with enlargement; you are going to press on with a common asylum policy despite the fact that your own countrymen and virtually nobody else wants it; and I heard you say you are going to press for âbetter regulationâ.
Do not make me laugh!
The fact is, this is already a bureaucratic, over-regulated model and there will not be any real economic growth until we deregulate and free up our businesses.
If you were a democrat and not an EU nationalist, you would put a case for free and fair open referendums, so that the peoples of Europe could express their will.
I will not be holding my breath.
Â Â  Mr President, I ask that Mr Farageâs description of the President of the European Council as ânot a democratâ be recorded in the Minutes.
Â Â  Mr President, the statements made by the Finnish Presidency appear to indicate that it wishes, and I quote 'to restore the hugely deflated public confidence in the EUâs organisationsâ.
Although that is, of course, a very commendable goal, it is just a little strange that the source of such sentiments should be the Finnish Government which wants the Finnish Parliament to ratify the moribund European Constitution no matter what, even though this Constitution, following the French and Dutch referendums, is no longer of any legal or democratic-political value whatsoever.
That is in any case a bad start for restoring confidence, but it gets even worse now that the Finnish Presidency has announced that it would consider any breakdown in the accession negotiations with Turkey as, and I quote 'personal failureâ.
It is obvious, though, not only that Turkey is not a European country and can never become one geographically, politically, economically, historically, culturally and so on, but also that the majority of European citizens do not want this Turkish accession at all.
Instead, they seek to restore and further develop the best possible friendly relations and economic contacts with our neighbour Turkey.
The fact that the Finnish Presidency is now personally committed to promoting this Turkish accession come what may is at odds with the overblown declarations about restoring confidence and respecting the democratic views in Europe.
It also unmasks as a lie the European claim that the negotiations can still be open-ended.
In view of the fact that Turkish accession is being rammed down our throats, I would urge you to stop the nonsense about democracy and respect for public opinion.
Â Â  Mr President, Prime Minister, Finland is taking over the helm of the EU at a time when the Union needs leadership more than anything.
That is why it was a pleasure to listen to Prime Minister Vanhanenâs message on Finlandâs objectives.
Finland is thoroughly prepared to succeed in its Presidency.
That has been visible, for example, in the way we Finnish Members have been contacted.
That is a good thing, because it is Finlandâs, and not just its Governmentâs, Presidency.
Finland has proposed that the Union should put time and effort into innovation and competitiveness, transparency, energy, the Northern Dimension and external relations, as well as finding a solution regarding the fate of the Constitution.
These are aims that I could not agree with more.
After all, a united and competitive Europe has always traditionally been the goal of the Finnish National Coalition/Conservative Party and the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Finland, however, should take a look in the mirror when it comes to progress on the European Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The governmentâs approach in particular to the European defence dimension has been woefully inconsistent.
The Finnish Government has normally taken a critical view of closer defence cooperation.
Our Government has only yielded when it has realised it was in a minority in the Council.
In the end, it was demonstrated in practical terms that the development which the Government had been opposing was the right one and good for Europe as a whole, and not just Finland.
Prime Minister, security is not created through isolation.
Closer cooperation is needed if we are to improve the security of the European people and global stability.
Our citizens also expect that.
As you said, the EU has become a superpower, which cannot afford to pause to reflect in its external action.
What then could the Council do under a Finnish leadership?
There are several concrete proposals on security in the Constitutional Treaty. They include a solidarity clause, enhanced cooperation on crisis management, closer defence material cooperation, and the obligation to assist other Member States in the event of a military attack, that is to say, mutual defence.
Most of these have already been introduced in one way or another, though not the security guarantee clause.
The development, however, has become tangled.
It is high time we implemented Maastrichtâs lofty goal: a Common Foreign and Security Policy, an essential component of which is also a common defence system.
If I can quote the wise words of the Prime Minister, we should not just wait around for a better time to come.
That time is here and now.
Â Â  Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, Finlandâs success during its Presidency might be measured by how well Finland chairs the debate on Russia and negotiates with that country.
Surely not many will accuse us any longer today of Finlandisation!
Energy is a weapon of foreign policy, but it is also a weapon in the struggle for global resources, for energy.
The energy issue has become a sensitive barometer of the relationship between the European Union and Russia, one which could also lead to conflict.
We want security of supply, and Russia wants a reliable customer.
Is this such an impossible equation to balance?
That is what Finland is now trying to do, as Finland and Russia have been operating that way for many years now.
One or two revolutions notwithstanding, the oil has been flowing as normal.
The Russians have begun to take a positive view of the Northern Dimension, but now have doubts about the new European Neighbourhood Policy, because they do not want to be compared with countries in the south or the northern Sahara.
The Northern Dimension must become an important forum for northern issues.
The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement needs to be reformed.
It was out of date when it started, and, just as MrÂ Poettering said, we want a stable, democratic and developing Russia.
Russia cannot be forced into it, however, and we all have experience of that.
During its Presidency, Finland will not be like MrÂ Berlusconi: there will be less play-acting and a little more honesty.
Â Â  Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Finnish Presidency will freshen up a tired EU.
That, at least, is what we Finns want to believe.
History has shown that the presidencies of small countries have often brought with them a breath of fresh air.
Now the Northern breeze is very welcome.
Its coolness is invigorating.
Close, tangible cooperation with Russia is important for the entire EU, both economically and politically.
As a neighbouring country, Finland has a special interest in getting talks under way and making rapid progress with them.
Despite the fact that we share a border, Finland is not one of those countries which are suspected of promoting its own interests at the expense of a common European policy.
Concrete action is expected of the Finnish Presidency in energy policy, environmental policy, and, in particular, cooperation in the Baltic region in all its respects.
Secondly, I would like to raise the issue of transparency.
The Prime Minister said that transparency is essential.
What is most important with regard to transparency is public access to documents, because the openness of meetings can sometimes be rather deceiving.
Only through transparency will EU policy be comprehensible to people and will the public and national decision-makers be able to monitor it, and this monitorability and accountability are important.
The EU must have the support and approval of its citizens, and, for that, transparency, monitoring and accountability are important factors.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Prime Minister, I am sorry but your approach is more that of a careful civil servant or an apprentice rather than a leader, let alone visionary.
Your basic position is to attend to processes which are already well under way in the Union, which is vitally important, admittedly, but not enough.
A leader must face up to the challenges which global and European developments bring with them.
You barely acknowledged the importance of climate change.
There is not even a mention of climate change in the list of priorities for the Finnish Presidency, even though it concerns the future, not only of Europe, but of all humanity.
It really is not enough to list the meetings which are on the agenda.
We need a proactive, creative approach on the part of the EU President. Otherwise, there will definitely not be any global agreement on how we are to continue protecting the climate after Kyoto, which is to say after 2012, which is already quite close.
The inclusion of new countries in particular needs a completely different approach from the one you just proposed.
One of our greatest challenges is the explosive growth in the flow of illegal refugees.
You merely proposed more effective border controls, police cooperation and asylum procedures.
This is very discouraging indeed.
Europe needs to develop an immigration policy fast, so that people from elsewhere in the world can move here to work completely legally.
It is wrong and cruel to regard poor immigrants as illegal workers without rights.
One internal challenge which we face is discrimination against minorities, such as homosexuals, and I hate all the fuss that was stirred up which the European Parliament intervened in on two occasions this year and asked the Finnish Presidency to do something about.
You did not say anything about this.
Why not?
Where is your leaderâs approach?
In the Council, do you intend to take forward the decision that was taken on the fight against racism and xenophobia?
You spoke too of transparency, which is welcome, but there are contradictions in what you say.
Before, Finland said it would promote transparency, but in the Finnish weekend newspapers you say that you do not intend to increase transparency.
Today you spoke about developing internet search services.
What, then, is your policy on transparency?
Is it just technical trickery or the development of the transparency of decision-making itself?
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already said on other occasions that, until we change our liberalist approach, we will struggle to get out of the crisis that Europe is in.
It is this approach that is jeopardising the social and environmental objectives, which we are nevertheless trying to achieve.
Let us take energy: energy cannot be regarded as a commodity like any other, it is the key issue of the future, which requires us to go down the road of the Kyoto Protocol and far beyond, to switch to renewable sources, by abandoning fossil fuels, and not to run the unacceptable risks of nuclear energy use; it requires fairness and solidarity and not conflicts, trade wars or even, as is sometimes the case, military wars; it requires another vision of the economy, of society, of politics and of democracy.
Europe is talking about an energy community, and that is a good idea, but, in order to exist, that community requires the aforesaid choices to be made, and made together with the others â from Russia to South America and to Africa â and not against them.
In a few daysâ time, the G8 will take place in St Petersburg, and, even though we find the venue very controversial and unacceptable, Europe must present those proposals there, as they go hand in hand with the concept of energy as a common resource of the future.
Â Â  Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, in the debate on the programme of the Finnish Presidency I would like to draw attention to a significant obstacle in relations between the EU and Russia.
Finland, which has traditionally had good relations with Russia, needs to make headway on at least two matters.
The first is Russiaâs use of fuel supplies as levers of political influence, both on the EU Member States, and on other countries.
Russia, which wants good relations with the EU, must put a stop to such practices, and this is something that the EU should demand at the next summit.
Secondly, Russia is applying for membership of the World Trade Organisation, in which the EU is a major player, yet she is blocking the import of many products to her markets, thereby infringing WTO standards.
A telling example of this is Russiaâs ban on imports of Polish foodstuffs for the past seven months.
Although Poland has since eliminated all of the grounds for which these exports were blocked, the Russian side has failed to raise the restrictions.
Given this situation, it should be impossible for EU representatives to agree to Russian WTO membership without that country finally resolving the issue of access to its markets, including access for goods of Polish origin.
I hope that the Finnish Presidency will make efforts to resolve the above issues.
Â Â  MrÂ President, my dear fellow member of the Convention Prime Minister Vanhanen, I think it was brave of MrÂ Vanhanen to offer to begin the ratification process for a treaty that should have been dead and buried after the referendums in France and the Netherlands.
Why is there now a lack of courage in Finland?
Why does he not dare put the Constitution to a referendum?
On the same day as we visited the Prime Minister in Helsinki he got his President to sign the draft Constitution, to which she is opposed.
This happened just a few hours after Finnish television had published an opinion poll showing that only 22% of Finns back the Constitution, while 48% oppose it.
I think that MrÂ Vanhanen should be hiding behind his prime ministerial gown.
At the Convention, the Prime Minister worked for transparency, democracy and proximity to the people and supported the call for the Constitution to be put to referendums in every Member State.
Make the requirement for a referendum in every Member State a condition of acceptance by Finland, thus putting into practice the transparency you heralded.
Put all the documents from the entire legislation process on the website.
Open up all meetings to the public unless a majority of the countries actively request this not to be done.
The Prime Minister signed the draft at the Convention with his own hand, in common with all the other elected representatives there.
Put it to the next meeting of the Council of Ministers.
Twenty of the 25 governments have also signed up.
The draft can be adopted by a simple majority of the 25 Member States.
Promises ought to be kept.
I call on our Finnish President-in-Office to be brave and stand by his signature.
I am sure that the Prime Minister would only make enemies in the EUâs secret COREPER government.
The peoples of the whole of Europe would love him if he were the one to open the locked doors to this remote Union.
I hope that there will be something to say thank you for in December.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
I fully agree with the priorities of the Finnish Presidency and, in particular, with the emphasis placed on reviving the role of our institutions, both at European level and at international level.
As regards the first aspect, as regards, that is, the institutionsâ relationship with the citizens, there are many strategies that can be undertaken: dialogue, democracy, debate, as the Commission is proposing, are certainly among these, but I feel that three actions in particular could really send out a strong signal to Europeans regarding our political will.
They are: i) to conclude the period of reflection in order to relaunch the constitutional process in practice; ii) to make the decision-making process and, I would add, the administrative process, more transparent â in this connection, I am grateful to the Finnish Presidency for its commitment along these lines, a commitment that, I hope, will have concrete results; iii) to try to find a convincing and practicable solution to the issue of Parliamentâs having two seats, a problem that certainly does not contribute to the image of efficiency and circumspection that we want to present to our citizens.
On an international level, as PrimeÂ Minister Matti Vanhanen has declared, the EU is a community of values and its starting points are peace and stability.
One of the commitments the EU has made in the eyes of the international community is to promote these values outside, as well as inside, its borders.
I therefore hope that the Council will be able to support the requests that will come from Parliament in this connection, regarding the instruments that must finance international cooperation and the promotion of democracy and of human rights.
In this sector, too, it is in fact important to guarantee a strong, consistent and effective commitment in addition, once again, to transparency in decision making and in the implementation process, so as to ensure that we give due credibility to our actions.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to begin by wishing the Prime Minister well as he embarks on his work.
His profile in the this week said that he had built his own house and loves gardening.
With someone so practical in his approach to life, I am sure we can also look forward to a very practical Presidency.
The new Presidency wants to develop a transparent and effective Union.
The issues of transparency and openness are ones the British Conservatives have been championing for many years.
The opening of Council meetings, despite the crass attempts by the new British Foreign Secretary to preserve secrecy, is a step in the right direction.
We will watch carefully to see that the letter and spirit of openness is upheld in the coming months.
I also welcome the Presidencyâs wish to scrutinise the effects of legislation and improve its clarity.
However, we have long argued for proper assessments of whether some legislation is actually required at all.
The initial presumption must always, in my view, be against legislating.
Proper impact assessments should also be undertaken before embarking on new laws and I hope the Presidency will make progress on less legislation and less regulation being an essential part of the reform agenda that I would like to see Europe develop.
I welcome the support for a collegiate approach to the Presidency.
It certainly makes sense for two or three incoming Presidencies to get together to agree priorities and to pursue plans based on a longer-term programme.
Six-monthly stop and start policies often do not work when we need long-term planning and reform.
I hope the Presidency will work closely with President Barroso on the economic reform agenda.
There is no room for complacency.
The drive to make Europe more competitive does not begin and end with summit conclusions.
The need for reform is as urgent as ever and I hope the Presidency will champion the kind of liberalising and reformist economic agenda that we have long urged.
Finally, can we please sort out the vexed question of the seat of this Parliament once and for all?
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, The Finnish Presidency of the Council â as Mr Vanhanen has again demonstrated today â is one with a very sober approach, and, though it might sometimes be rather too cool in its utterances, I can say, thinking of the problems that it will have to deal with, that things are going to hot up quite a bit from time to time.
One problem to which both you and the President of the Commission alluded is the issue of Turkey.
You will be aware that we regard the opening of negotiations with Turkey and the progress of those negotiations as very serious matters, but you will also be aware of our absolute insistence on Turkey discharging its legal obligations, Although we would wish â and it is good that Commissioner Rehn is here to hear this â to see, in parallel with this but not dependent on it, everything possible being done to give the Turkish population of Northern Cyprus a better chance of doing as they desire and drawing closer to the European Union, with the Cypriot Government also doing everything in its power to open up new ways and new channels in order to foster new trust between the two ethnic groups.
If you succeed in doing both these things, that is to say, getting Turkey to do what the law requires of it while also moving things forward in Cyprus, that would be a very great triumph indeed.
Turning to South-Eastern Europe, I can do no other than confirm that we would also like to see you taking further steps to show all of them â including the Serbs â the road to Europe at this very difficult stage.
Let me turn, thirdly, to Russia.
It is only right that you should place both energy and Russia high up your agenda.
There are two things that we regard as vitally important.
Firstly, where energy is concerned, a legally binding framework needs to be agreed on by Russia and the European Union, and, if not the energy charter â concerning which Mr Barroso has announced new initiatives â then it must be some other legally binding framework that is transparent to both parties and valid in both of them.
Secondly, it is vitally important that Russia should pursue a neighbourhood policy similar to Europeâs.
We both have interests in our common neighbours, but, while we offer them one thing or another, Russia often brings political pressure to bear on them.
I would like to see you get Moscow, too, to offer its neighbours something.
In that way, we could end up competing with one another in terms of what we can offer, rather than there being offers from one side and political pressure from the other.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have a request for you, MrÂ Vanhanen, now that your work on extending the competence of the EU is to be taken further.
I fully support your proposal to change cooperation in legal affairs so that we will now have majority decision-making.
This would indeed mean stepping up our joint effort to combat terrorism and the terrible trade in women.
As I say, I have a request for you, MrÂ Vanhanen, from one Liberal to another, so to speak.
Make sure that we do not end up on a slippery slope.
There are many worrying signs. Examples include the cases involving data protection, the handing over of passenger lists, the CIA flights and now the most recent case involving the company Swift, which has allowed American authorities to monitor European bank transfers.
We must be vigilant in ensuring that our fundamental freedoms are not violated and that we do not compromise our rights unduly for the sake of the fight against terrorism.
By this I mean that we must not unduly compromise our freedom for the sake of our own security.
There is a very fine balance to be struck here, so think about this when you get down to work.
Work well, and with zeal!
Mr Barroso, from one small country to another: have a good match tonight and may the best team win!
Â Â  Mr President, President-in-Office, as a representative of the European Free Alliance stateless nations, such as Scotland, Wales and Catalonia, I note that Finland, as well as leading the EU and celebrating a hundred years of restored independence, was the first nation in the world to grant full political rights to women.
As more and more small countries such as Catalonia, Montenegro and my own, Scotland, seek to reassert our right to independence, we look to Finland and the other small Member States of the EU as role models.
I welcome your stated commitment to transparency and subsidiarity.
However, if we are really to restore public credibility in the European Union, as we both want, we must do more than simply retable the existing Constitution text.
EU credibility in Scotland, for instance, will not improve if the disastrous common fisheries policy is further entrenched.
This wasteful trek that we must make to Strasbourg each month does not help.
I also welcome the President-in-Officeâs stated intention to consult on the Constitution, but we need to consult not only each other in the institutions but also the public and take note of what they say.
Â Â  MrÂ President, following on from the Austrians, we now, with the Finns, have for the second time the Council Presidency occupied by a neutral EU Member State, or perhaps I should say a formally neutral EU Member State, for, when I look at the Finnish Presidencyâs programme as regards foreign policy, and military policy in particular, things are exactly as they were, and, in some respects, even more so.
With the official purpose of providing security for elections, 2Â 000 EU soldiers are to be deployed in the Congo, yet we know â and the German defence minister has himself said â what this is actually all about; it is actually all about safeguarding Germanyâs and the EU's economic interests, and now â or so I see from the plan â the Sudan is the next country to get the treatment, this time with NATO involvement.
The EU is constantly embarking on new military adventures, and that I do regard as fatal.
The âbattle groupâ is to be put into service during the Finnish Presidency â something I regard as problematic â and, lamentably, we are still pushing the constitutional treaty even though it has been pronounced dead.
Why do we not, at long last, give up on it?
I would urge you to do an about-turn, and commit yourself to a truly civilian Europe, with no more billions of taxpayersâ money being spent on militarisation, and to act like a state that really is neutral.
Â Â  Although the debate about Europeâs future requires an ambitious and decisive presidency in the second half of 2006, this morningâs presentation makes me fear the worst.
Allow me to start with ambition, or the lack of it.
I criticise you for clinging onto the rejected European constitution.
By doing so, you, the Finnish President, prevent a fresh, ambitious debate about the future of the European Union from being initiated.
That is not all, though.
The Finnish Presidency, which trumpets its commitment to transparency, is keeping Europe painfully divided.
While you know that the text of the twice rejected constitution should at least be amended, you have the intention of ratifying this European constitution during your presidency.
How can this be justified to the citizen, and â more to the point â the Dutch citizen?
I am also concerned about your lack of decisiveness.
Will you really mind the shop single-handedly while we wait for Chancellor Merkel?
How decisive is a presidency which, by way of an interview given by its Foreign Affairs Minister to the , indicates from as early as 1 July that it does not expect a great deal from the consultation round with the Member States?
I do not often experience the pleasure of agreeing with the analysis of Mr Leinen, chairman of our Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
I do, however, share his view that the Council is sending out a confusing message.
The Finnish Presidency must unambiguously choose between the rejected constitution or a new treaty framework.
My preferred choice, by the way, would be the more ambitious second option.
I would therefore call on the Finnish Presidency to display now the ambition and real decisiveness that are called for.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased that the Finnish Prime Minister mentioned more effective European institutions today.
This is a major issue at the moment, when the European Union is at a crossroads.
In my view we should not restrict the competences of the Council, but increase those of the European Parliament as the body elected by the citizens, and restrict the competences of the Commission, in whose election the citizens have had no say.
I am pleased with the Finnish Presidencyâs support for the idea of greater transparency for European institutions, as transparency is a vital issue.
It is a good thing that the Presidency has been positive in assessing the latest EU enlargement; I believe that in the coming six months there will be a good atmosphere for the next gradual and sensible expansion of EU structures.
When the President of the Council speaks of the need to work towards greater European competitiveness, I hope that this is not mere words, and that the Council will translate this promise into concrete action, for instance in the services sector, and that there will be an end to all the restrictions that the unfortunate Services Directive in its current form imposes in this field.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you are not in the easiest of positions, MrÂ Vanhanen, sandwiched between an Austrian Presidency that had a respectable record and a German Presidency that is already attracting some significant attacks.
This suffocating position should have given you greater determination to be daring, so that Finland can be the Presidency of practical invention and of long-term progress.
Unfortunately, instead of surprising us, you have disappointed us.
Your speech was lacking in spirit.
We were treated to a catalogue, a hotchpotch of ideas in which you took great care not to leave out a single facet of European policy, but that is not what we are expecting from you: what we want is concrete action.
I will give you a few examples: you should concern yourself with the cost of calling abroad using a mobile phone, which penalises so many Europeans; and you should also provide real support for the implementation of Galileo.
What we expect from you is that you use your influence in the Council to achieve more proactive developments in judicial and police cooperation.
You also have another task, that of the European Union's own funding, because it has been unable to provide itself with a budget.
The Council has been unable to give itself a budget that matches the ambitions publicised by the European Union.
It would be a great shame if we had to return to the leitmotif of 'we cannot go any further, the Council is standing in the way'.
Nevertheless, why do you not share with us your experience of a true forestry policy?
Wood is a renewable resource, and it thus meets criteria that are of interest to Europe in the context of climate change.
You spoke about energy, but what we ask is that you be strong: strong when confronted with Russia, because power is all that Russia understands.
Then, when we talk about Europe's borders, listen to the European Parliament, which is concerned about taking account of the European Union's absorption capacity.
To conclude, and this may be the only positive note in my speech, I would like to lend you my support in your government's declared desire to show greater firmness with regard to Turkey on the issue of Cyprus, because the Turkish invasion is the only barrier to reunification of the island.
As you can see, there is much to do if your Presidency is not to be a wait-and-see Presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the Finnish Presidency, which I assume will be carried out with the usual Finnish efficiency and professionalism.
Finland has a lot to teach us, particularly in relation to the importance of investment in high-quality education and also how to balance economic efficiency and social justice.
I welcome the President-in-Officeâs speech, which boils down to three points.
There are three priorities for the Council at the moment: action, action and action.
Citizens do not love processes, they love outcomes, and we will be judged by our outcomes.
On Friday we, in the United Kingdom, will mark the anniversary of the horrific events of 7 July 2005, when 52 of our citizens were blown up in a terrorist attack.
I well remember the sympathy and solidarity that I received from my colleagues here in the European Parliament at that time last year, and that which we showed to our Spanish colleagues the year before at the time of the Madrid bombings.
Our citizens expect Europe to make them secure.
We had another event on 21 July, which fortunately was unsuccessful.
However, because of the European Arrest Warrant one of the suspects was brought back to the United Kingdom from Italy in a matter of weeks.
That is precisely the sort of action our citizens want to see.
We need to deliver on better security cooperation.
We also need to deliver on better security as a whole.
We still have great shortfalls in our crisis management capabilities.
That is because Member States say they will do something and then do not deliver.
Let us make delivery by Member States our absolute priority.
Similarly, on migration policy, let us have a fair, effective policy that links development and migration policy, one that makes our borders much more secure.
Let us, on energy, recognise that we have a single market.
Let us follow through on that logic.
Let us drive forward the whole single market agenda, which is still too incomplete.
I welcome your commitment to better regulation, President-in-Office, but as you have heard today the biggest gain in better regulation will be to stop the European Parliament wandering around Europe, so that we can better focus on legislation.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to thank Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen for his comprehensive presentation.
I would especially like to endorse his concern regarding the justification of the Unionâs existence, its legitimacy.
The virtual collapse of the Constitutional Treaty in the referenda that were held reflects not so much the immense control the people have over legislation but the suspicion and distrust which they feel with regard to the European Union.
There is good cause for this.
The huge amount of EU legislation, with all its meticulous detail, the vast and ineffective bureaucracy and the wholly disproportionate amount of monitoring and supervision make the Union objectionable.
That is why the Prime Ministerâs promise to invest more time and energy in better legislation, in particular, is important.
I agree with Prime Minister Vanhanen that the Union must focus on the essential and do that effectively.
Regarding the Constitutional Treaty, Finland has a splendid opportunity to take the initiative and show real leadership by initiating consultations regarding the extent to which it can be taken forward and what it should contain.
If the EU is to succeed in the context of global competition it will have to be made more competitive.
Research, product development and training are crucial.
Hopefully, the Presidency will quickly succeed in simultaneously introducing legislation and programmes so that the meagre resources contained in the financial frameworks can start to be used.
Finally, I would like to mention agriculture, although there is no separate mention of it in the programme.
In practice it is the only area of policy in which the EU regulates the private citizenâs level of income.
Our largest industrial sector, the food industry, is also dependent on it.
Hopefully, the Presidency will succeed in protecting our agriculture at WTO talks, where it is the object of furious attack.
At the same time I hope that the preconditions for sustainable and competitive agriculture are assured everywhere in Europe, including the peripheral regions, in accordance with the decisions of the European Council.
I wish my country, Finland, every success in its Presidency.
Â Â  â Mr President, there is no need to delude ourselves that anything will change during the Finnish Presidency.
It will continue to implement the same reactionary, anti-grassroots policy and militarisation of Europe for the next six months, as its programme confirms.
Its first choice is cooperation to resuscitate the European constitution, even though it was condemned and rejected by the people of France and the Netherlands.
Promotion of competitiveness to increase the profitability of Euro-unifying capital through even more oppressive exploitation of the workers.
Tax relief for capital and new taxes for the workers within the framework of the development of European Union regulations.
Green Paper on employment law in order to abolish every legal right won by the working-class movement through its struggles.
As for relations with Russia, they are the much sought after counterpart to competition with the USA.
However, what are particularly insulting are the pressures which the Finnish Presidency says it is preparing to exert on the Member States to start trading directly with occupied northern Cyprus, ignoring the fact that there is an occupying army and ignoring the pseudo-state in order to satisfy unacceptable Turkish demands.
We must not allow this.
We shall support any action by the working-class movement against this policy.
Â Â  Mr President, in recent debates I have heard two definitions of the Finnish Presidency.
The first was that if the EU does not actually regress in the next six months the Finnish Presidency will have been a success.
The other definition was that Finlandâs principle task is to prepare for Germanyâs forthcoming Presidency.
It is not like that, however: Finland has a lot more to offer Europe and the Europeans.
The especially important priorities, Russia and energy, are areas where Finland has much expertise.
It is with regard to these issues that the EU must take the biggest step forward.
We totally lack a common policy on Russia and we cannot negotiate with Russia on an equal footing before we have one.
Prime Minister, you were quite right also to mention that here in Parliament there are many issues in progress which should be brought honourably to completion.
They include REACH and the Financial Regulation and many other matters which are those very small steps which will help the EU to move forward.
You also mentioned enlargement, which I see as one of the most important issues and an immense challenge.
It is in fact impossible to push forward enlargement which is too fast and against the will of the people and the Constitution at one and the same time.
The Romanian and Bulgarian issue will come up during the Finnish Presidency and it is important to show our citizens that the criteria are being adhered to.
The importance of this still obviously needs stressing, especially with regard to Turkey.
The criteria must be adhered to for the people to have confidence in the EU.
What the people expect more than anything is obviously deeds and vision.
The old view of why the EU exists is no longer enough for our citizens.
Accordingly, it is time we established a new, common, definite idea of what the EU will like be in 10 or 20 yearsâ time.
This is the issue that I think would be absolutely right for this Finnish Presidency to begin work on.
It certainly will not be brought to completion but it is important to start working on it in order for the relationship between the people and the EU institutions to be able to continue in a positive mood.
Â Â  Mr President, the President-in-Office is famous in Finland for cooperation and consensus.
I sincerely hope, President-in-Office, that when you meet the social partners at the social summit in October, you will make real progress, because no progress can be made on the wealth and values of the European Union Member States without broad, consensus-based cooperation.
President-in-Office, when we talk about flexicurity, which I am happy that you and President Barroso have embraced as an important basis for cooperation, it is extremely important that it is not just flexibility â which Mr de Villepin in France would like to see â but both flexibility and security in a combined and globalised modern version.
That can only be done in cooperation with the social partners, which I hope you will take the lead on.
You have all the prerequisites to do it and I am sure you will.
As I have emphasised this morning, my second appeal to you is that you combat crime, terrorism and human trafficking.
Since you relaunched the Finnish Presidency in Tampere, this must now be the time to turn that into reality.
I hope that, using the clause, we shall see the Finnish Presidency ending up with a very clear result for all our citizens.
