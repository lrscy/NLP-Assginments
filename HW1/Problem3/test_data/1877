Liability for defective products
The next item is the report (A5-0061/2000) by Mr MacCormick, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Commission Green Paper 'Liability for defective products' (COM(1999)396 - C5-0184/1999 - 1999/2158(COS)).
It is an honour and a pleasure to have the opportunity to present this report to Parliament today.
It is on the very important subject of product liability on which the European Community first introduced legislation as long ago as 1985 in the form of a directive.
This was transposed in a somewhat leisurely way, and in some cases we might even say in a shockingly slow way, by Member States.
So it is only fairly recently that there has been across the Union experience of the working of the product liability regime, which of course is not absolutely uniform in any event across the countries, because there are areas where different views may be taken consistent with the directive.
This legislation substitutes distributive justice, in a sense, for corrective justice in this very important area of the law of civil liability.
The idea is that if a defective product is sold and used and injures in any way a consumer, the consumer should be entitled to compensation without proof of fault on the producer' s part, merely proof of causation of the damage by the defective product.
This is a very good idea.
It helps to spread the risks of injury widely and ensure compensation.
Of course, it does not in itself ensure product safety.
That is better done by other regimes regulating various industries, and we have a good regulatory regime in most of our industries in the European Union now.
Moreover, it should not be thought that this is the only basis upon which people who are injured can be helped.
We have other systems of distributive justice on this side of the Atlantic, not paralleled in, for example, the United States of America, which has a different but somewhat tougher product liability law than we have.
There, however, it is a kind of forensic lottery, as academics have called it, because many people who are injured get nothing at all and some people who are injured get enormous damages.
It is generally, and rightly, thought that plaintiffs' lawyers are the people who do best out of the deal.
We should stick to our own view on social security as the main basis for help, but then have this product liability regime as well.
The Green Paper raised the question of whether this scheme should be extended and whether some changes should be made.
This was in response to debates in Parliament last year, which led to the amendment of the directive to include primary agricultural products.
It seems to me that the Green Paper, although it has started the debate well, will not finish it completely.
It gave a useful summary of the way the law has developed and been applied, and then asked a series of questions of interested parties and required replies in by the end of November last year.
That is a good way of finding out if there are alarming and urgent matters needing swift action.
It is a bad way of producing a thorough and scientific study of the impact of a body of law on civil society and on life in our Union.
We need more and deeper study for that purpose.
In the meantime we could take this view, and my report suggests that we take this view: unless the evidence produced shows a strong factually-based need for early change, we should have further and deeper reflection on the matter, and we should have a debate that ranges wider than the debate triggered by the Green Paper itself.
There is a great deal of very interesting work of a scholarly and scientific kind and there could be more if it was known that this was properly under consideration.
I know that this approach has disappointed some colleagues, particularly those who raised the debate last year, and it has been suggested that the Parliament would simply walk away from important issues if we left it at that.
I would not myself like to leave it at that.
I have therefore suggested some compromise amendments which suggest that there must be a further and deeper dialogue about this which pays close attention to the points which have been raised without prejudging what is the right answer to them.
I do not think it should be prejudged.
I would not myself like to be a party to imposing on Europe the "tort tax" under which Americans have made themselves suffer.
So I suggest that we urge the Commission to hold a longer and deeper dialogue about this; not to precipitate action but to measured consideration.
We have a good law and the saying "if a thing ain' t broken, don' t fix it; but do not be complacent about it either" applies here.
Mr President, yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, an American court awarded the nicotine victim Leslie Whiteley compensation of no less than USD 44 million.
A week ago, the European Council in Lisbon spoke out in favour of a Europe of innovation.
Under these circumstances the question which arises is, do we need to review our European liability law?
Do we want to mimic the Americans in our liability law?
How can we formulate a liability law which promotes rather than hinders innovation?
We welcome the fact that the Commission has initially submitted a Green Paper on this issue because we consider it sensible to start by evaluating experience with the present directive before we start laying down new rules.
As the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we are in favour, in the interests of legal security, of a clear division between compensation and punitive sanctions, a division not possible under American law.
In the interests of medium-sized enterprises, we want to prevent incalculable liability risks and avoid excessive compensation for parties which have suffered minor damage at the expense of consumers as a whole since, at the end of the day, it is they who must pay for such compensation in the form of higher prices.
We want a liability law which promotes innovation and does not conceal incalculable liability risks for companies launching new products.
In evaluating the opinions submitted on the Green Paper, we should like the Commission to have a free rein when it assesses the need to reform the product liability directive.
We would like you to evaluate the reports which you receive impartially.
We think, at first glance, that the present liability law achieves a fair balance between the interests of consumers on the one hand and the interests of product manufacturers on the other.
Companies must assume liability for damage to consumers without fault.
At the same time, liability is statute barred after ten years and capped at EUR 75 million.
We therefore take the view that a review should only be started if there is clear proof of the need to amend the directive.
Caution and level-headedness are needed.
Millions of cases are affected day after day.
We wish the Commission every success in evaluating the results of the Green Paper.
Mr President, our honourable friend, Mr MacCormick, has made a thorough and critical appraisal of the Green Paper on civil liability for defective products and he deserves our thanks for his work and for his cooperative contribution.
I should just like to make a few more comments on behalf of my group on a number of necessary amendments on which both we and the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party reached extensive agreement in the run-up.
I refer to the checks which your department needs to carry out, Commissioner Bolkestein, and the question of the burden of proof which, according to Article 4, rests solely on the injured party.
My group believes the Commission should check if prima facie evidence and circumstantial evidence can also be taken into account at all levels at which evidence is taken.
This is particularly important because the product world is becoming more and more complex and it is becoming more and more difficult for individual persons who have suffered damage to provide proof in this area.
There is also the question of derogations from general manufacturer' s liability, especially the so-called development risk.
We need to examine if these derogations are expedient and conducive to the balance between manufacturers and consumers.
This applies in particular in the case of foodstuffs and medication.
We do not want to see the consumer alone bear the risks inherent in technical progress.
In my view, applying the directive solely to private use and consumption is a questionable move.
The Commission should consider if the directive should not be extended to commercial goods.
The material damage sustained by a company is, in principle, no different from the material damage sustained by a private individual.
And the smaller the enterprise, the heavier the burden of this unequal treatment.
Harmonisation of laws at Community level would be in keeping with the purpose of the product liability directive, especially as increasing flexibility in the world of work is tending more and more to blur the clear distinction between the private world and the world of work.
We also need to think about the way in which liability is statute-barred.
It is clear from the case of BSE that a standard ten-year limitation on liability may be insufficient under certain circumstances.
We could perhaps consider gearing the limitation period to the type of product.
However, it is not only these individual points which are important; we also need to seize every opportunity to harmonise product liability still further in the form of comprehensive consumer protection in the European Union.
If we supplement the MacCormick report in this direction, the European Parliament will have done a good job in the eyes of the consumer.
Which is why we have been elected.
Mr President, I would like to welcome what is a very well considered report, which invites us to stand back and take stock before embarking on further legislation in this field - a refreshing welcome from the tendency of this House sometimes to rush, or to be pushed to rush, at complex legislation.
I would particularly like to focus my comments on the issues raised by this report on the further harmonisation of private law.
In our enthusiasm we sometimes forget what a sensitive subject the harmonisation of private law is; it touches the national legal traditions in our Member States, legal traditions born of our differing histories and cultures of separate nations and jurisdictions.
Professor MacCormick will be acutely aware of this in Scotland, with its own legal heritage.
I am not in any way opposed to further harmonisation, it can be helpful to the good functioning of the internal market, but imposed legislative harmonisation needs to be carefully and openly considered, or we may find we have left our citizens behind in this project.
The traditional push towards harmonisation has been the internal market to which we can now add the aspirations of Tampere for a single area of European justice.
But harmonisation must respect subsidiarity - we have no need to rush towards uniformity of civil law in this area of product liability.
We should be aware that uniformity can stifle innovation and prevent adaptation to local or national circumstances and problems.
It is a truism that European law has been able to benefit from the ability to draw on rich comparative material of varying legal traditions in our different Member States.
It would be dangerous to stifle this by uniformity.
Let me suggest that the aspirations of Tampere can be better met in the public law area of the intended Charter of Fundamental Rights than by further imposed legislation which harmonises our private law traditions.
Research seems to show that our traditions are tending to converge slowly.
Let us perhaps be prepared to assist and guide that convergence and respect the conditionality of the further harmonisation which is integral to Professor MacCormick' s proposals.
Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in giving a warm welcome to Professor MacCormick' s very realistic report.
In considering the whole issue of product liability we have to say that the current directive appears to have functioned well.
There is not a great deal of evidence that consumers are at the moment being seriously disadvantaged.
I would argue quite strongly that we have achieved a very fair and reasonable balance of interests.
I want to pick up the point made by my colleague Mr Wuermeling that we must take particular care about development risks in the environment within which we now find ourselves.
It was a crucial issue at the Lisbon Summit and new product innovation is one of the key competitive aspects of European business.
If our regulations on product liability stifle competitiveness and innovation, I suggest that consumers will be at a major disadvantage as well.
Consumers will be the ones to lose out, if a flow of competitive and innovative products is stifled.
So let me echo Mr MacCormick: there is a need for much more clearly-based factual evidence before we make changes to this legislation.
Mr President, I am afraid that my opinions will differ from those of Mr Harbour or Mr Wuermeling, because, although the 1985 directive on civil liability was a milestone in the field of consumer protection and furthermore a chapter in which the Commission played a very important role and adopted a strikingly progressive approach, I think that, at the same time, several years have passed since it was adopted.
I therefore feel that it is notable and praiseworthy that the Commission has decided to review it.
This Green Paper represents a first step towards this review.
We must bear in mind the fact that in 1985 certain principles that are today considered to be fundamental were not incorporated, and at that time could not be incorporated into the text of the directive, because debate on the subject had not reached a sufficiently advanced level.
Amongst these principles, the first we should highlight is the importance of the manufacturer accepting, at least in certain areas, the development risks.
I come from a country, Spain, where consumer legislation dictates that the manufacturer bears responsibility for development risks.
There have been no bankruptcies among insurance companies or manufacturers, nor has technical progress been hampered as a result.
For too long the consumer has had to bear the full cost of this risk in the cause of progress.
The second principle consists of removing the burden of proof from the party that has suffered the damage.
We are talking about an objective responsibility and therefore the burden of proof imposed on the victim must be made as light as possible.
The third principle concerns setting levels of compensation.
The directive does provide for this eventuality, but we must bear in mind the fact that judicial bodies are used to seeing this setting of compensation as interference by legislative authority in its duties and this issue must therefore also be reviewed.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Electricity
The next item is the report (A5-0078/2000) by Mr Turmes, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on electricity from renewable sources and the internal electricity market (SEC(1999)0470 - C5-0342/1999 - 2000/2002(COS)).
Mr President, what is the purpose of a directive on renewable forms of energy, or an own-initiative report from Parliament?
I think we must place this report, and also the directive which is in the pipeline, in the context of the European Union' s energy policy with its three objectives of competitive pricing, security of supply and environmental protection.
Since 29 February 2000, we have had a common electricity market but, regrettably, still with considerable distortions of competition which still, unfortunately, work to the disadvantage of both renewable energy cogeneration and energy management and the forms of energy of the future.
The reasons for this are energy prices which do not incorporate the external costs, with the sizeable subsidies which are still available to the nuclear sector as well as the fossil-fuel sector.
The directive which is currently being prepared should, in my opinion, have two objectives.
Firstly, the current imperfect market must be adjusted as necessary in order to protect the still tender shoots of the plant which is renewable energy, and also to lay the foundations for renewable energies so that they head in the direction that they need to before the year 2030 or 2040, when they must be capable of providing the greater part of the European Community energy mix.
We have many reasons to move in this direction.
Firstly, the protection of the environment, but also the creation of jobs.
We have studies, backed up with figures, to show that renewable energies create more jobs than conventional forms of energy.
We know that we must make Europe ready for a world renewable energy market and there are also geostrategic advantages to our reducing our dependence on regions which are often in crisis.
What must the cornerstones of this forthcoming directive be?
It must, in the first place, be based on the Treaty articles relating to both the internal market and the environment.
It must have ambitious, clearly defined objectives at European level in the order of those given in the Commission White Paper, i.e. 12% for energy and 23% for electricity.
After setting these objectives at the European level, there must be 'burden sharing' negotiations between the Commission and the Member States in order for reciprocal agreement to be reached on the specific national objectives which, when added together, will combine to form the European objective.
As regards the instruments to be implemented, my report advocates subsidiarity.
I believe it is too early to pass judgement on the various instruments that can be classified.
On the one hand, there are the fixed-price systems which have launched the renewable energy industry in Europe.
On the other hand, there are the trading systems which have just been created in the Netherlands and Denmark, where there are still many administrative and technical problems to resolve.
We therefore propose that the Commission makes an assessment of the various instruments in 2005, and that, until that date, subsidiarity should be maintained and the Commission should refrain from regulating subsidies to the renewable sector.
I would argue that it is pointless to make cuts in subsidies to the renewable sector when there are much larger subsidies going to the nuclear and fossil-fuel sectors.
There is one last point which I wish to put forward, namely the need for a system for labelling and providing information on all forms of electricity.
In an internal market, the consumer should be informed, and this information should be provided for every form of energy, not just green electricity.
I would like to thank all the people who contributed to this report, which is the result of a real team effort, and I await their comments with interest.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent piece of work.
We have what are per se excellent basic documents in the field of renewable energy sources, such as the White Paper referred to, which contains a brilliant critical analysis.
But, on balance, everyone is in favour.
Everyone says yes, we need these new sources of energy.
They are a fundamental component of the 21st century, of the 21st century way of thinking.
But everyone has slightly different ideas and, as a result, we often fail to find a standard line which will allow us to achieve these objectives.
The second point is that we tend to polarise, and that causes problems.
On the one hand, we say, there are the advocates of renewable energy sources, ecologically-minded, forward-looking people. On the other hand, there are the energy suppliers, oil traders and oil producers, who want exactly the opposite.
All we are doing is fanning the flames of enmity.
I think we should put this enmity behind us and acknowledge that these renewable sources of energy only have one enemy.
That enemy is our ignorance of the fantastic opportunities which they offer us.
First, there are ecological advantages and, secondly, there are job opportunities.
Thirdly, I think that whatever we invest in this area is neither subsidy nor promotion but sensible investment from a national economic point of view.
We must recognise that.
Fourthly, we must bear in mind that sources of fossil fuels have been accompanied recently by price fluctuations ranging from 10 to 30 dollars a barrel.
Fifthly, more and more studies are implying that actual sources of fossil fuels are much smaller than we perceive them to be today.
Sixthly, we are conducting discussions throughout the world - and we can see this happening from Chechnya via the Gulf to Africa - about earth' s remaining resources.
If we now recognise that you are also a bringer of peace, then we will probably have made a huge step if we accept this report tomorrow.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has basically been in agreement on this question since 1996.
It was Parliament, may I remind you, which had to push the previous Commission in the direction of this policy.
It did not start with the White Paper, but with an initiative by Parliament, and I remember because I was the rapporteur at the time.
We need a much higher proportion of primary energy used.
We have already come a long way, but not far enough by a long chalk.
We need it for climatic reasons and for industrial policy reasons, because there is a global market to fill here.
In this respect, I should like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of the committee and note that, consequently, 80% of the resolutions tabled are therefore uncontested.
For the rest, an aside: everyone still here this evening must have not renewable sources of energy but an inexhaustible supply of energy!
We are represented in accordance with the subject matter!
Unfortunately, I note that the report contains a number of statements which are incorrect, which violate the Treaty or which are politically untenable.
For example, elevating the feed-in system to a universal panacea is wrong.
It is true, of course, that the countries with feed-in systems have made a great deal of progress, but that is not on account of the feed-in system but because of the financing which is in place there.
We must make a distinction between these causes.
As a result, we and the Commission are of the opinion that the Member States should now be allowed to experiment.
It is too early to see one system as a universal panacea and dismiss another.
Secondly, the report also contradicts the Treaty at certain points.
This applies in particular to the statements on aid policy.
It is true that renewable energy needs aid now, and probably will for some time to come, in order to get started.
That is quite right and it complies with the Treaty.
But it is certainly not right to give them the same aid as all other forms of energy because they make a totally different contribution to the energy mix, and it is not right to link aid for one to the lifetime of the others.
My third comment also concerns a point at which the resolution does not comply with the Treaty.
We here in the European Union cannot impose mandatory obligations on the Member States.
The European Union has no legal basis and no credentials for doing so and, because of that, it cannot impose sanctions.
Anyway, that is precisely what the Lisbon Council has just agreed to reject in connection with the job markets.
That is why it is right to regard this as a matter of economic policy of common interest; hence the burden sharing negotiations.
More importantly, I cannot agree when there is talk of the curse of the lowest bidder.
Statements like this show disdain for the consumer and disregard the principle of supply and demand.
In addition, as I am sure you will understand, we cannot get excited about new forms of bureaucracy, even if it comes along in the jewel-studded cloak of an EU agency.
That is why, Madam Vice-President, I have three recommendations to make to the Commission.
First: you should use your directive, the draft of which we are waiting for, to promote the use of all renewable sources of energy and, if possible, you could suggest a uniform development framework.
Secondly: as far as financial assistance is concerned, a distinction should be made between everyone and those who need this financial assistance.
The distinction is easy to make.
Thirdly, and I consider this extremely important in the interests of investors: if a new system should replace the systems currently being tried out in Europe, either in the Member States or in the Union, it should not, of course, penalise those who have already made investments.
They need permanent protection.
We want both the competition and energy departments of the Commission to make a clear statement on that to the markets.
Mr President, I too should like to thank Mr Turmes on behalf of my Group for the excellent and detailed work contained in his report.
We certainly have no lack of reports.
We have had the Mombaur report, the Rothe report, the former member, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, drafted a report, Mrs Ahern drafted a report and, if I remember correctly, I also drafted a report on this subject once.
So there is no shortage of reports and they have all been translated into every possible language.
What we need now are initiatives to implement our decisions.
We have decided that the share of renewable sources of energy should rise from 6% to 12%.
At present, if I remember the figures correctly, we are not yet even quite at 6%, but at 5.4%.
In any case, I am merely repeating the Commission' s figures.
How can we do this?
Biomass and hydroelectric power account for 95% of renewable energy sources in the European Union.
Wind, solar energy, photovoltaic energy etc. only account for 5%!
In other words, if we decide to double these figures and if we come up against purely physical limits with hydroelectric power, if we cannot build more large power stations as and where we please, and there is a limit to what we can do in the Alps, then we have to think of something else, for example a bridge with agricultural policy.
I should like to ask you, Commissioner, to build a bridge with agricultural policy, to enter into an alliance.
If, for example, the enlargement of the European Union encompasses countries such as Poland, which have large agricultural areas and a high proportion of their population working in agriculture, most of whom will become unemployed over the next 10 or 20 years as these countries engage in intensive farming, then there is room for manoeuvre here.
There is, of course, the question of how we can finance this, but at least we have technical room for manoeuvre.
As far as renewable sources of energy and financing them at national level is concerned, I have just a few brief comments.
The systems are so different that they must, at all costs, be made compatible in the medium term, so that we can create a real European market here.
Secondly, aid must be degressive.
Not radically degressive perhaps, otherwise there is no end result, but it must show a downward trend in order to ensure that the best technologies are used, because there is constant technical progress even with renewable sources of energy.
I can easily imagine, and here I do not share Mr Mombaur' s view, that we may need to consider sanctions, otherwise the whole thing makes no sense.
For example, we undertook at Kyoto to adhere to certain quotas.
No one can be punished for failing to keep to the quotas.
Had we introduced the euro like that, if no sanctions had been imposed for failing to comply with requirements, the euro would not have been a success.
In the case of renewable sources of energy or the CO2 policy, nothing will be achieved in the long run without sanctions.
We cannot enter into commitments willy-nilly and then fail to honour them.
I keep coming back to this: without sanctions, this joint energy policy, because in the final analysis that is what it is, will not function.
It is perhaps an unpleasant thought, but it will not function otherwise.
Mr President, I would like to reiterate the thanks to the rapporteur for the extremely cooperative manner in which he has embarked upon this important report and I am pleased to participate in the intimate gathering of renewable fanatics so late at night.
Three points - firstly, the whole issue of a level playing field.
It seems to us essential that if we are going to give renewable energies the breathing space and the momentum that they merit, it is right to try and aim for a level playing field.
That requires, above and beyond everything else, downward pressure on the unacceptably high and legally dubious levels of subsidies which continue to flow to fossil energy sources in the European Union, notably, but not excusably, the coal industry in a number of large Member States.
As long as those market distorting subsidies to fossil fuels continue we cannot realistically talk about a fair or level playing field in the European Union.
In that context we join with the rapporteur in feeling that some kind of special provisions concerning subsidies are merited as long as those market distorting subsidies continue elsewhere.
On targets, I very much side with Mr Linkohr.
We cannot be serious about this without trying to add teeth in some form, moral, financial or otherwise to the concept of targets.
We were not very happy with the early versions from the rapporteur because we felt the targets were there to almost micro-manage the market in renewable energy sources.
That is neither viable nor desirable, but a mixture of the pressure towards targets, combined with competition between effective renewable energy industries, seems to us to be the long-term approach we should all adopt.
Finally, I would make a plea on behalf of my group: let us not set up yet another agency.
Paragraph 22 of this report calls for the establishment of a European sustainable energy agency.
This Parliament and the European institutions have been spawning a blizzard of new agencies all over the European Union.
It does not necessary help us to follow the policies which we wish to follow - it could actually have the effect of ghettoising the policy altogether.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his hard work and particularly the excellent definition of renewables.
This directive should be solely directed towards supporting new renewable technologies that are not yet commercially viable.
The directive, as some of the speakers have already said, needs to have binding targets in order for the Member States and the entire EU to achieve a significant increase in the share of renewable energies in the total energy market.
I note that the Commission is proposing a review in 2005 but I would urge that you also ask the Member States to make annual reports on achieving the targets in the White Paper.
I would also like the directive not to establish any ceiling or limitation on direct support mechanisms chosen by the individual Member States.
It should also encourage fair and non-discriminatory network access as its most important item.
The directive should also contain mechanisms to discourage, as we have already heard, the Member States from their market distorting subsidies to traditional forms of energy, particularly fossil fuels and nuclear.
There are a lot of covert subsidies to the nuclear sector that have been there for a long time and that are long overdue for a considerable review if not a total ban.
Attempts to say that support for renewable energy is a distortion of the market in the context of the vast subsidies for nuclear and fossil fuels that exist in the European Union are totally spurious.
I hope that the Commissioner will really take that point to heart.
The directive should explicitly propose a system of support and advantages for the small and medium-sized companies in decentralised production and distribution of renewable energies.
It should include incentives allowing the Member States to clearly support advantages for the regions, especially rural areas, in respect to labour intensive green production.
Most importantly, the directive should propose mechanisms for the internalisation of external costs of traditional energy production.
Finally, I would urge that it is important that some of the undertakings by Member States to include renewables in the energy mix in the electricity sector be at least equal to the total EU commitment made in the White Paper on renewable energy, as endorsed by the Council and this Parliament.
I would like to make particular reference to the unsatisfactory rate of uptake in the UK, Ireland and France.
Here we can clearly see from empirical studies that network access is by far the best way to achieve high percentages of renewable energy rather than the other methods that have been undertaken in those countries.
Mr President, I believe that all of us are in agreement that the development of renewable energy sources is the way forward.
If we are serious about this, we must be prepared to make funds available for research and development in this area, both at national and European levels.
Parliament recently voted to maintain and increase funding for the SAVE programme.
In my own country of Ireland a total of EUR 125 million has been devoted to developing an environmentally sustainable energy sector.
I am pleased that the rapporteur identifies the links between the issue of renewable energy sources and wider policy considerations.
The creation of an internal market in electricity should provide consumers of electricity with real choice.
The introduction of an element of competition in any industry should lead to more favourable pricing for the consumer.
While it is desirable to create a level playing field it may also be necessary to provide subsidies for certain types of energy in order to promote other objectives.
Clearly the development of renewables is linked to environmental objectives as well as issues of employment, regional development and the promotion of local initiatives.
I would like to see the development of small local initiatives which would strengthen rural development by the provision of, say, 20 to 30 jobs per project.
Such projects should not only be open to the business sector and local groups such as small locally-based co-ops should be assisted in creating such local enterprises.
This report states that support for renewable energy projects must not be viewed as a straightforward subsidy under the state aid rules.
What is important is that Member States be allowed to continue subsidising renewable energy sources which are not yet economically viable.
Apart from the obvious environmental and other benefits, this can actually be justified on competition grounds.
It is clear that there are serious distortions in the energy market with many hidden subsidies to both coal and oil generated energy.
It would be virtually impossible to quantify these subsidies which have been embedded in the industry over decades of generator construction.
We still face a significant challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto protocol while, at the same time, promoting growth within our economies.
I believe that, while each Member State must work towards the 12% target of renewables, the imposition of a single binding target would not be helpful because of the great differences in the structure of the energy market between Member States.
All I have said so far is on the positive side but, on the negative side, the report specifically calls for peat to be excluded.
Peat power plants work very well indeed in my country and make an important contribution to Ireland' s energy supply.
In addition to that, the report emphatically calls for the European imposition of an energy tax.
I am totally opposed to this approach and I reject this taxation.
Therefore, I regret to say that my final vote on this project will be seriously affected.
Mr President, the need to promote the development of sources of renewable energy becomes a crucial matter every time that issues such as the Kyoto protocol and meeting our commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions are raised or when we talk about sustainability in energy policy.
Also, on everyone' s mind is the fact that supporting renewable energies is one of the most important ways of achieving effective results, particularly with regard to controlling carbon dioxide emissions and to attaining the objective proposed in the White Paper, to reach a level of 12% renewable energy by 2010.
Since we are aware of this need, there is a set of relevant facts that we should consider.
Firstly, it should be said that renewable energies currently have the disadvantage of being less efficient in economic terms, which means that, in the first phase, support mechanisms are needed which will make them viable from a business point of view.
Secondly, any support mechanism that is considered must be realistic and consistent, but must, above all, fit into a stable and appropriate legal framework if it is to achieve the desired effect.
In order for any action related to the development of new projects for investment in these technologies to be launched, it will require a legal basis which will ensure that the laws on which it is based are transparent.
Thirdly, renewable energies are characterised by the different situations from which the various Member States are starting, which means that any solution will have to adapt to these differences.
Fourthly, we must not place too many limits on the concept of renewable energy, although it does seem reasonable to impose certain restrictions on support actions for plants whose size and performance require them.
I shall finish by saying that the report by Mr Turmes, on which this House is about to vote, addresses my main concerns sufficiently.
Its content provides the necessary balance for us to be able to rate it positively, but our final position will depend on the outcome with regard to certain key points.
I would not like to finish without congratulating the rapporteur on his willingness to enter into dialogue and for his vigorous and thorough work.
Mr President, I have an interest, though not a financial one, in this subject in that I am chairman of the Northern Energy Initiative, a company which operates in the north-east of England, and has within it a renewable energy agency whose objective is to promote the development of renewable energies.
The UK has a low proportion of electricity from renewable sources, I believe amongst the lowest.
Yet the studies in my home region have demonstrated considerable potential for renewable projects: wind, including offshore, small hydro, landfill gas, waste incineration, biofuels and photovoltaics.
It is important to have EU and national targets, but it is also important to have a European directive which will support efforts at local and regional level, where many of the decisions are actually taken.
In general terms, there is a need to build up an awareness amongst architects and potential customers of the technologies that are available.
Support for demonstration projects should be included in any directive.
Larger developments often fail to get planning permission, sometimes because of public opposition.
More proactive planning guidance, preferably linked to regional renewable targets, and feasibility studies would be helpful additions to the directive.
Access to the grid system at fair prices is crucial.
The disincentive of high capital costs of connection to the grid from remote renewable sites and the prevention of transmission penalties are other issues which the directive should tackle.
I hope that the Commission will take note of these points.
I would urge support for the amendment to assist the promotion of renewables in the remote islands of the Community.
I am sure that this was an oversight in the drafting of the text.
I have to say that the British Labour Members will vote against the exclusion of waste incineration from the definition of renewables, on the understanding that this refers to material which cannot be recycled.
Mr President, the chief aim of an internal electricity market must be fair play.
This aim is clearly visible in the Commission' s preparatory act.
In his report, Mr Turmes, does not in all respects advocate the same way of thinking, however.
The report does contain many good ideas.
The recorded aim of the Commission with regard to the promotion of renewables obviously has to be supported.
We really do have to invest in research into energy sources.
However, we must remember that a free energy market will have to be based in the future on viable, free competition, and not on favouring renewable energy sources by discriminating against the others.
All forms of electric power must have free access to the market.
The harmonisation of taxation and aid schemes is a different matter.
Electricity producers must be able to determine the prices at which they wish to sell.
If the Union starts messing about with the burgeoning electricity markets, for example, by imposing rules controlling the electrical supply, or with guarantees of minimum prices or quotas, we can say goodbye to the free market.
Renewables can be made more competitive by increasing consumer choice.
In this respect the certification of electricity is an idea to be supported.
If we wish to pay more for electricity produced from wind power than from other sources, for example, then we should be allowed to do so.
To no good purpose, the report tries to define renewable energy by raising the question of peat as a special area.
The position with regard to peat cannot be determined according to the same standards as biogases, for example.
For that reason, peat must occupy its own energy class in future, so that its taxation can be determined on a level that is reasonable.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on being open to dialogue on all areas connected to the report and to the amendments.
I think we must consider all matters related to renewable energies to be extremely important, bearing in mind the fact that we want to leave behind us a world which future generations will find inhabitable.
It is curious that we are slowly killing ourselves and yet the earth' s contamination is not causing the alarm bells to ring.
What can we do about it?
I think that first we must seek out all renewable energies and take advantage of them, encourage them, promote them and provide the appropriate incentives to make them viable, and at the same time penalise energies that contaminate.
I know that this is all easy to say and difficult to do, but unless we act immediately, within a few generations, we will be stretched to the limit.
My opinion is that we should start by differentiating between compensation and subsidies.
It is common knowledge that most traditional sources of energy, apart from those using water, wind etc., cause a great deal of serious environmental damage, in many cases, such as CO2, acid rain, oil slicks etc. This damage is usually repaired by public administrations, by means of programmes for restoring and caring for the environment.
In the case of renewables which do not cause any harm to the surrounding environment, I believe it would be reasonable to compensate them while there is no tax on emissions of polluting particles such as CO2.
Therefore, as long as public administrations continue to take responsibility for repairing the damage caused by thermal or nuclear power stations, we will be subsidising these sources of energy at the expense of renewables.
I would finally like to mention the establishment of an appropriate legal framework for this kind of energy, which would foster its rapid development, bearing in mind that, in the long term, renewables must become predominant.
Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, to summarise today' s debate, there are basically three issues at stake here.
First, the sustainability of energy sources.
Secondly, security of supply, which has a quite special effect as far as Europe is concerned, not least because of the unstable political situations in the countries which currently supply energy to Europe.
Thirdly, of course, the economy, because energy is a fundamental factor in our international competitiveness and we must therefore ensure that we have an economical supply of energy.
I personally come from Upper Austria and, at present, Upper Austria has broken the energy-saving and energy-renewing records.
Where I come from, renewable energy takes top priority, and Upper Austria has an energy savings agency which runs like clockwork.
The principle of subsidiarity applies here and I think that it was this energy savings agency which inaugurated the energy savings fair held a few days ago, thereby meeting the need for education and information for the public as a whole.
I also think that research and development in this area need greater support.
In the final analysis, we should endeavour in Europe to apply the best practice, i.e. to see where there are models - at this energy savings fair in Wels we presented a thick directory of best practice models - and, at the same time, to use benchmarking to show where we have taken the lead in Europe and where progress is being made elsewhere in the world.
I think that this management system is particularly significant for the future of energy supplies in Europe.
Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate Mr Turmes on the report which he has prepared, as it will be of great use to the Commission' s work.
I would like to remind you that in April last year the Commission approved a working paper on electricity from renewable sources, whose main objective was to present a thorough overview of the support programmes of the different Member States in the field of renewable energies, as well as to highlight certain conclusions and possible options for the adoption of Community measures in this area.
On that occasion the Commission indicated in its working paper that it had not reached a final conclusion and that a final decision would be adopted on all the issues involved in the light of reactions to the paper itself.
In this respect, Parliament' s contribution is an extremely important element in this process.
This House has always been forthright in its support for active policies designed to promote renewable energies.
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to Mr Turmes for his work.
Furthermore, and as Mr Linkohr has pointed out, it must be said that it is Parliament that has, in part, forced the Commission to undertake more concrete action in the area of renewable energies and that Parliament has always been a leader and a driving force in this area.
We all agree that renewable energies have to play a key role in guaranteeing our supply of energy, as well as making us less dependent on imports and in fulfilling the commitments we gave in Kyoto.
However, they can also help the EU' s technological development and enable us to export clean technologies to other parts of the world.
I must point out that Mr Turmes' s report fully concurs with these views.
The Commission is already giving its support to the production of wind, solar and biomass energy, small hydroelectric stations and geothermal energy, that is all sources of renewable energy, with the exception of large hydraulic power stations, which we feel we should not support because they have sufficient options available to them. Furthermore, they have some extremely negative aspects from an environmental point of view, as constructing a dam always involves flooding a valley.
I must, however, say to Mr Turmes that, despite what I have just said, we cannot consider peat to be a renewable energy.
The ALTENER programme is enabling magnificent work to take place and Parliament has always been an ally of the Commission. It has always cooperated with the efforts of the Commission and, I repeat, has even been a driving force in making the Commission' s proposals more ambitious.
We are now faced with a considerable challenge, which is to establish the most appropriate mechanisms for supporting the development of green electricity in an internal market, an open single electricity market, which is what we are trying to achieve in the European Union.
I can assure you that all issues that have been highlighted here will be carefully considered in relation to the directive on which discussions will begin in the next few days.
Going into specific issues, almost all of the points made in Mr Turmes' s report deserve our support and fully concur with our own studies.
Some aspects are more open to debate, but they also deserve thorough study, even if they must be rejected, in some cases because they are not sufficiently based on fact or because the problems they present are greater than the solutions they propose.
I must repeat that the report stresses the importance of the objective of doubling, from 6% to 12%, the proportion of renewable energy sources in the gross domestic consumption of energy.
In the proposal for a directive, we hope to include some objectives chosen by countries, that is, individual objectives for each country in the European Union. These would not be compulsory objectives, but ones which can produce results, at least from the political point of view, and I think that this would be a very important step.
I agree with Mr Turmes on the need to protect the different national systems in force at the time that this directive is adopted.
This is what we will do, which does not mean that, in five years time, there should not be a review of the different systems and that we should not commit ourselves to those which have proved to be the most effective and which have resulted in greater development of renewable energies in those countries.
In any event, as you know, on 2 December 1999, in the Energy Council, I gave a questionnaire to the Member States, so I could see what stage we had reached, what stage the issue had reached, and so I could present a directive that could obtain sufficient consensus to quickly conclude its passage through both Parliament and the Council.
The result of this questionnaire, which has been studied by the services, is a document, in my opinion, of extremely high quality, which I hope will enable us to get through the Parliamentary and Council procedures reasonably quickly.
Let us state quite clearly that the proposal simply and straightforwardly seeks to stimulate production in the EU of electricity from renewable energies.
I would like to point out that I have taken careful note of Mr Linkohr' s words on agricultural policy and the possibility of encouraging non-food production.
As a former agriculture minister, I am sensitive to these issues and this is one which, to a certain extent, is also covered in this proposal.
I would also like to point out that our objective in all of this is to have a safer and more reliable supply of energy, which treats the EU' s environment with greater respect.
To conclude, Mr President, other speakers have mentioned repayment.
Mr Vidal-Quadras and Mr Valdivielso both mentioned this a while ago.
Renewable energies today are not competitive in relation to traditional energies, particularly as traditional energies have certain external costs which, of course, are not internalised.
Support must be given to renewable energies.
My personal view - although there are other ideas on this subject - is that, as things stand, we cannot write off other energies, for reasons of competitiveness and growth.
We can, however, support renewable energies, precisely because they are obviously based on respect for the environment and on reducing emissions.
In this respect, we must be able to ensure that those who do commit themselves to renewables have a fair return on their investments.
We obviously have to create a stable framework that will enable investors to make investments which require a sufficient number of years to cover their repayment.
This is one of the issues under discussion in the Commission and which has proved to be more difficult in some cases, together with certain other aspects. But, ultimately, everyone in the Commission agrees on the need to encourage green energy.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the speakers, and to assure them that this element of stability, which will enable decisions relating to medium-term investments to be taken, will also feature in the proposal for a directive that I hope to be able to present to you soon.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, I think anyone reading page 6 of the Minutes might get the wrong impression from the juxtaposition of my speech and Mr Vander Taelen' s.
I want to stress two points.
First, Mr Vander Taelen may disapprove of my position on the European Union, but it can in no way justify the wholly unfounded personal attacks against me by the Chairman of the Canadian parliamentary delegation.
Anyway, Mr Vander Taelen admitted he did not personally witness the incident.
Secondly, I simply cannot understand how Mr Vander Taelen could have got the impression I was against enlargement.
I have never said that.
On the contrary, I have stated time and again in this House that enlargement is an historic necessity.
I have just pointed out that the institutions in their present form undoubtedly constitute an obstacle to enlargement, but that is an entirely different issue.
Of course I am in favour of the enlargement of the European Union to the East.
Thank you, Mr Berthu.
We will scrupulously check whether there are grounds for amending the Minutes so that everything is as it should be.
Are there any further comments?
Madam President, although I was not the speaker, it was Mr Katiforis, I see that in the Minutes, he is reported as having said that the Turkish authorities had also drawn up a list of Greek people living in Turkey.
He did not say that.
He simply said "of Greek citizens" , in other words people who are resident in Greece.
I say this because Mr Katiforis is not here and so that the Minutes can be corrected accordingly.
Absolutely.
I remember that too.
That will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Madam President, this is not about the Minutes but about a point of order.
I was contacted several times yesterday and have already been contacted several times today, by people from the press who have got wind of the fact that the Court of Auditors sent you a report yesterday on the funding of the political groups.
I am aware that this is a very tricky business and that we must prevent any half-baked stories from getting into the papers.
The question on quite a few people' s lips is: what is to become of this report?
Will it be made public?
I understand that the chairmen of the groups have been able to have a look at the report.
I would like to ask you what you are intending to do with it.
Will you find a way of making it available to the press or to those who favour doing so, appending a few comments, yes or no?
I believe we must adopt an open and transparent strategy here, so that we can say in all candour how we dealt with the funding that was made available to the groups.
It is standard procedure, Mr Staes.
The Court of Auditors sent me this preliminary report and it is going out to consultation.
I have in fact circulated the report to the Chairment of the groups asking them to let me have their comments so that we can forward them to the Court of Auditors.
After that has been done, the Court of Auditors will draw up its final report.
I do not think it is up to the President of Parliament to issue this report to the press.
This is not a lack of transparency.
It is not up to me to do it.
I have done what I had to do, which was to send it to each Group Chairman concerned.
Madam President, I learned yesterday that Mr Akim Birdal, the former chairman of the Turkish Committee on Human Rights has been reimprisoned.
Mr Birdal had asked to be released on health grounds, after being attacked.
That request was refused and he is in prison because, some time ago, he dared to suggest seeking a political solution to the Kurdish question.
I think it would be very welcome if you, as President of the European Parliament, were to approach the Turkish Government, in whatever way you consider appropriate, and ask for this man of honour to be freed.
Quite, Mr Wurtz.
We raised this matter yesterday and I am completely in agreement about approaching the Turkish Government along those lines.
The "Echelon" system
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the existence of an artificial intelligence system allowing the United States of America to intercept and monitor all telephone and electronic communications within the European Union, a system called 'Echelon' .
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from the letter sent by this House to the Council and from the hearing of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs regarding data protection in the European Union, you have today invited the Council and Commission to comment on the possible existence of the Echelon system. This system is suspected of intercepting telecommunications beyond the bounds of any legal framework of justice and home affairs activities.
I must thank you for having invited the Council to speak on this issue. This gives us the opportunity not only to clarify our position but also to inform you about all the measures taken by the Council on the lawful interception of telecommunications.
The European Union must respect the fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and which result from the common constitutional traditions of the Member States on general principles of Community law.
The Council will do everything to safeguard these principles, particularly with regard to the right of every person to respect for their private and family life, their home or their correspondence, in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights which forms the cornerstone of our political work.
It is common knowledge that work is in progress, in which this House is fully involved, and whose aim is to produce a Charter of Fundamental Rights which must apply within the Union.
This is why the Council presidency wants to firmly state its position on the possible existence of a system for intercepting telecommunications in the European Union, beyond the bounds of any legal framework.
The Council cannot accept the creation or existence of such a system which does not respect the laws of the Member States and which violates the fundamental principles aimed at protecting human dignity. I must stress this very firmly.
Having said this, the presidency considers that everything must be done to create an area of freedom, security and justice at European level.
Our aim is to build a more open and secure Europe founded on an attachment to our common fundamental values.
In this respect, it will sometimes be necessary to allow telecommunications to be intercepted when strictly essential to protect these values and in the interests of justice.
This interception, which must be in proportion and have clearly defined limits, must pursue specific aims such as combating organised crime.
When exercising this right which is fully enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, the presidency considers that the case law of the European Court of Human Rights must also be respected to ensure that the right balance is achieved between interference in private life and the public interest.
In certain clearly specified and truly exceptional cases, the interception of telecommunications may be justified under these conditions.
We want to act on this point with total transparency so that the European Parliament is kept fully informed of the progress of work within the Council on the lawful interception of telecommunications.
There are also some other areas which we want to tackle. These were listed in the letter, which I have mentioned, as set out by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, and they were also contained in the letter, which your President has just sent to the Council.
These areas are police cooperation, judicial cooperation in criminal matters, Europol, Schengen and the initial discussions currently in progress on data protection within the Third Pillar.
The Committee raised these matters and I have been asked to comment on them in the letter from your President.
In the area of police cooperation, the Council adopted a resolution on 17 January 1995 on the lawful interception of telecommunications.
This resolution, published in the Official Journal, contains a list of specifications for the Member States authorising them to lawfully intercept telecommunications with regard to network operators and service providers.
This list allows each Member State to adapt its own national legislation so as to identify and overcome the difficulties in introducing technical specifications for interception in modern telecommunications systems.
In November 1995, a code of conduct containing this same list of specifications indicated in the resolution was established between the Fifteen and Norway.
The governments of the United States of America, Canada and Australia informed the Council that they would not sign this code of conduct but that they would follow an identical policy.
In 1999, the Council submitted an initiative on the lawful interception of telecommunications with regard to new technologies for assessment.
Immediately after the start of this work, the Council consulted the European Parliament on this proposal on which this House issued an opinion in May 1999.
The Council is continuing the work on this issue but has not yet adopted a final position.
In its meeting on 28 May 1998, the Council adopted conclusions on encryption and law enforcement to guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of digital communications which present considerable advantages for electronic commerce and the private lives of individuals and which can also help to prevent fraud and other crimes.
However, we are aware of the concerns about the negative aspects, which the proliferation of encryption services for confidentiality purposes may have in the fight against certain forms of crime.
This is why it was decided to closely monitor the degree of use of encryption technologies, particularly by and for organised crime.
These measures must be proportional and carefully balanced with regard to other important interests, particularly bearing in mind the need to protect the fundamental rights specified in the European Convention on Human Rights and the operation of the internal market, with the aim of ensuring the development of electronic commerce.
In the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, particular attention should be paid to the draft convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters between the Member States.
Over four years of negotiations on this draft convention are nearly complete.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council, in its meeting on 27 March, examined the most important remaining questions, including those on the interception of telecommunications.
I am very pleased to announce that a full political agreement on measures for interception was achieved at this meeting.
We therefore hope that the adoption of the act establishing the convention will take place during the Justice and Home Affairs Council in May.
Measures have also been specified on data protection in the Europol Convention.
It must be stressed that Europol does not have powers of investigation and does not carry out work of an operational nature.
Rather, Europol' s mission is to analyse the data supplied by the Member States or third parties.
It cannot gather this data directly. I will clarify this for you.
It is the responsibility of each Member State to send data to Europol.
Therefore, any supervision of data protection is carried out in the Member State of origin with full respect for the Council of Europe Convention of January 1981 and the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe of September 1987.
In this way the general rules on the protection of data sent to Europol by the Member States are respected.
The convention therefore states that the latter must answer the question of whether the data has been properly gathered in the Member States.
So it is the responsibility of each Member State to correct, delete or amend data sent to Europol where it becomes apparent that this data is incorrect or infringes the rules established in this respect.
It must be stressed that Europol cannot, on its own, determine if the data sent by a Member State has been properly gathered.
Each national supervisory authority has an essential role to play in this area.
I must also speak briefly about the data protection rules within the Schengen Information System.
This system provides for an authority responsible for protecting personal data.
This common supervisory authority is composed of the supervisory authorities of the various Member States and ensures respect for the system' s principles on data protection, particularly those on the content of the data obtained and the use of this data. Full protection of the interests of individuals is therefore ensured in accordance with the instruments ratified by the Member States.
Finally, I must mention data protection within the Third Pillar.
The Member States and the Commission are examining this issue in order to determine to what extent data protection should be provided in a horizontal perspective for the whole of the Third Pillar.
Various aspects of this debate are being carefully considered, such as, for example, the questions of whether a common supervisory authority for all the instruments of the Third Pillar should be created or whether it would be sensible to create a common secretariat for these authorities.
Furthermore, the Portuguese presidency intends to submit in due course, for the Council' s consideration, initial ideas on the possibility of developing general principles on data protection, which would apply to all the instruments of the Third Pillar.
These ideas are still being developed.
However, I can tell you that the Portuguese presidency, with full respect for the Community mechanisms, will duly inform the European Parliament about future developments in this work.
This, briefly, is the Council' s position on the work in progress or already concluded in the area of the lawful interception of telecommunications.
To conclude, I must say that we fully understand the political concerns underlying this Parliament initiative.
The presidency wishes to stress that it is ready to closely monitor Parliament' s work in this area as it considers that there is every reason not to compromise when principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms of individuals are at stake.
Mr President, the Commission has taken note of the recent debate with concern.
We received a letter by Madame Fontaine to Mr Prodi yesterday asking the Commission to focus its statement on certain questions.
I will try to cover most of them.
Respect for human rights and the rule of law constitute the foundations of the European Union.
The European Convention on Human Rights recognises the right to privacy as one of those rights.
All Member States of the European Union are signatories of the Convention.
The specific competencies attributed to the Community are defined in the Treaty.
The Commission can only act within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the Treaty.
The Community has a clear competence in the field of data protection and in research and technological development.
The Union has competencies under the so-called Third Pillar Framework with regard to law enforcement and the fight against crime.
National security questions belong to the exclusive competence of the Member States.
The Lisbon Summit last week set out ambitious targets to turn Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
Exploiting the full potential of information technology and the Internet are key elements in achieving this goal.
Electronic communications play an increasingly important role in everyday life of European citizens.
A well-functioning electronic communications infrastructure has become crucial for our economies.
A pre-condition for achieving the Lisbon targets is that citizens and enterprises can trust in electronic communications.
A key tool to secure the confidentiality of electronic communications is encryption or cryptography.
Encryption means the transformation of data into a form unreadable by anyone without a decryption key.
When the European Parliament considered the issue of interception of telecommunications in 1998, its resolution underlined the importance of encryption.
The European research efforts and relatively open access to markets have created conditions that have enabled European enterprises to develop a world-class expertise and high-quality encryption products.
It is worth noting that the United States government has recently taken steps to relax its export controls regime for encryption products.
The current rules for intra-community trade are laid down in the so-called dual-use regulation.
For external trade, the Wassenaar arrangement imposes export controls on strong encryption products.
The aim of export controls is to try to avoid undesired proliferation of these products to certain countries and to criminal organisations.
The Commission recognises the need to balance availability of encryption products with concerns of public security and the fight against crime.
The Lisbon European Council called on the Council and the Parliament to adopt - as rapidly as possible - still this year - the dual-use export control regime.
The Commission hopes that the revision of dual-use regulation can be completed during the Portuguese presidency.
Moreover, the budget for research for security and confidence-enhancing technologies has been increased in the 5th Framework Programme.
The Commission considers that enhancing the security of communications over the Internet by using encryption is a priority.
The introduction of such products is not without complexities.
Software whose source code is not open, leaves the user in uncertainty.
The possibility of built-in circumvention of encryption cannot be excluded.
Secondly, effective use of encryption requires a safe key management system.
As far as the Commission' s own communications infrastructure is concerned, the Commission is working on introducing stronger European encryption products for its electronic communications.
Let me now turn to data protection.
The Data Protection Directive of 24 October 1995 requires Member States to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data.
In addition, Member States are under obligation to set up a Supervisory Authority responsible for monitoring the application of the provisions of this Directive.
The data protection Directive is complemented by the Directive for data protection and privacy in the telecommunications sector.
This Directive also concerns legal persons and requires providers of public telecommunications services to ensure the security and confidentiality of communications.
Both these directives exclude from their scope activities that fall outside Community competence.
Article 1 of the telecommunications data protection directive reads: "This Directive shall not apply to the activities which fall outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union, and in any case to activities concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when activities relate to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law" .
As you know, the titles V and VI referred to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and to Justice and Home Affairs in the Maastricht Treaty.
This wording of the directive reflects the wording of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
When adopting these Directives, the Council and the Parliament sought to strike a balance between the right to privacy and the legitimate needs of law enforcement and public security.
At the same time, activities outside Community competencies had to be excluded.
The Commission has not been entirely satisfied with the transposition of the data protection Directives.
As regards the general data protection directive, the Commission has launched infringement procedures against six Member States.
With regard to the telecom data protection directive, the Commission has also opened infringement proceedings against six Member States.
As to the activities under the so-called Third Pillar, of which the President of the Council spoke with Mr Prodi today, a number of actions are under way with regard to law enforcement and the fight against crime, which include the issue of lawful interception of telecommunications for the purposes of criminal investigations.
As mentioned, the communications intelligence activities by intelligence agencies of Member States fall outside the scope of Community Law.
The Commission has been asked whether it can confirm the existence of the activities described in the report of Mr Campbell.
It is the very nature of intelligence activities that those who are not involved in these activities are not able to confirm, nor deny their existence.
However, it is clear that technological possibilities to intercept electronic communications exist.
And there is no evidence to say that the available technologies are not used.
Due to the recent allegations presented in the public debate, the Commission has sought clarification from the Member State that has been mentioned in this context.
We have received a letter from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the European Union. The letter states that the British intelligence agencies work within a legal framework laid down by the United Kingdom Parliament, and which sets out explicitly the purposes for which interception may be authorised, namely national security, safeguarding the nation' s economic well-being and the prevention and detection of serious crime.
Further, the letter states that the European Commission of Human Rights has held that the system set out under British law is in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights.
The UK legislation also foresees a special Parliamentary oversight committee.
The Commission has also sought clarification from the United States government.
We have yesterday received a letter from the United States Department of State, which states that the US intelligence community is not engaged in industrial espionage.
Further, the letter states that the United States government and the intelligence community do not accept tasking from private firms and do not collect proprietary, commercial, technical, or financial information for the benefit of private firms.
President, let me reiterate that the Commission attaches the utmost importance to the respect of human rights and the rule of law.
The Commission will not fail to fulfil its obligation under the Treaty if Community law is breached.
Madam President, first of all, I am delighted that the Council and the Commission have delivered a clear opinion today regarding the Echelon problem.
In the past, a great many parliamentary questions have been simply ignored.
The present statement is therefore a step in the right direction, albeit only the first of what need to be quite a few such steps.
We must now calmly consider what measures are to be taken in order to protect the European economy effectively.
Less helpful in this regard are the hasty proposals tabled by the four smaller groups in this House.
When I read in the proposal put forward by the Technical Group of Independent Members about fears of a "Super Echelon" which will apparently use surveillance techniques to gain control of the whole of the information society, then this shows with how little understanding of the facts the present state of affairs is being approached.
What we have here is not Huxley' s "brave new world" taking shape, but merely industrial espionage.
With its proposal to establish a committee of inquiry, an alliance of Greens and of Members from the Left and Right of the political spectrum clearly want, however, to use Parliament as an arena for James Bond-style games.
Who, I wonder, would call for a committee of inquiry?
The American President or the head of the British secret service, who is not even known in Britain?
What is this committee supposed to find out?
The fact that Echelon exists and is also used for industrial espionage is something which we have known at least since the interview with former CIA Director Mr Woolsey on 7 March of this year.
No, the time for investigations and debate is past. Now, we must act.
In addition to frank words with our American and British friends, we need a European encryption system, independent of the United States, with which to protect our data.
We must put this subject on the agenda of the next session of the World Trade Conference.
We must develop a code of conduct which guarantees compensation in the event of espionage systems' being misused, and we must make it clearer to our businesses than we have done so far that they themselves are called upon to safeguard their own data through encryption.
In contrast to a committee of inquiry, which in this case would serve no purpose, this would be a constructive initiative.
Madam President, I have issued this statement on behalf of Mr von Boetticher who, because of a bereavement, had to travel back to Germany yesterday.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in a difficult situation regarding the decision which we now have to make after hearing the Council and the Commission.
Just how difficult the situation is, you can see from two remarks made in the last three minutes.
Mrs Klamt says that we all know that the United States of America engages in industrial espionage.
The Commissioner has just explained to us that of course the United States does not engage in industrial espionage; they clarified this in writing only yesterday.
So what is to be done, then?
After everything we have been told at the hearing in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the indication is, of course, that we should continue with the strategy which, as Social Democrats, we have believed to be correct.
In the Committee, there were accusations against the Council and the Commission to the effect that individual EU citizens were insufficiently protected against the interception and monitoring of communications, that the competitive disadvantages to which the Echelon system is exposing the European economy are not being combated sufficiently in the context of the Community law governing the EU institutions and that no adequate counter-strategies are being developed.
We then said that we wanted to hear what the Council and the Commission had to say before deciding how to proceed further.
I should like to say that what I have heard this morning from both institutions gives rise to more questions than answers.
The Social Democratic Group will therefore do what it already decided to do weeks ago in the light of present knowledge.
Bearing in mind the statements by both institutions, we shall make decisions next week on the following issues. (In fact, there are no two ways about it, we shall have to make these decisions.)
Do we want a committee of inquiry?
Do we want a non-permanent committee?
Do we want an own-initiative report? Do we want to take other measures in order to shed more light on the outstanding issues, to obtain more answers and, above all, to examine whether Community law has been broken?
Precisely how we go about this, we shall decide next week, but one thing I would state clearly here is that, if we continue to adopt what, as I see it, is a dilatory approach to the problem, as I heard outlined by our partner institutions this morning, we shall not do justice to the political problem, or to the political drama, behind the questions raised here.
I do not know whether we were well advised to say that we wanted a committee of inquiry because, if such a committee were to be set up, its legal basis would have to be impeccably clarified. In this regard, too, there are still questions to be answered.
I was therefore of the opinion that it was too early for a committee of inquiry.
I do not, however, want to exclude the possibility of our reaching conclusions in the course of the debate which will lead our Social Democrats to say, here in Parliament, that, even if there is the merest hint of suspicion that Community law has been broken and that citizens' freedoms and the competitiveness of our industry and economy are not being adequately protected, then we shall act most decisively.
First I would like to thank the President of the Council for his statement that the system we are debating is unacceptable in principle.
That is something, at least.
Having said that, I was expecting the Council to give us some details about the problem we are trying to deal with today.
I have to say I am disappointed.
To use a sporting metaphor, the representatives of the Council and the Commission have been doing what I call the fencing side-step.
It is very effective in fencing, but I dislike it in politics.
I have no regrets whatsoever about having taken the initiative, with my group, in calling for a parliamentary committee of inquiry into this matter.
I think the stature of the European Parliament will be enhanced by adopting such an initiative and I hope the whole of Parliament will support that position.
I also want to point out that while speeches on the principle are of course interesting, we have to have the courage to talk about the facts.
Eighteen months ago, during a debate in this same Parliament, when Mr Bangemann was the Commissioner responsible, he said, in answer to a number of questions from Members, that if the system existed it would represent a serious problem for human rights and the operation of the European Union.
We have since discovered that this system does exist, but we do not know exactly how it works.
There is good reason to believe that a European Union Member State - the United Kingdom, to make no bones about it - is collaborating in the system.
I expected the Council Presidency to make a statement about that.
Is the British Government being open about it?
Is it collaborating in the system or not?
I think we have a right to know.
The Commission is responsible for ensuring that Community law is observed.
We have good reason to believe that Community law is being flouted in this case.
Directives are obviously fine if they are applied, but what use are they if there is clearly technology available for by-passing them?
Especially when we know that certain Member States are probably collaborating in order to by-pass them.
I am really very worried.
If this Parliament seeks to represent the people of Europe, it really must clarify this situation.
We will not be doing that if we routinely wait for initiatives from the Council and the Commission.
I want to remind the House that we passed a resolution eighteen months ago calling for a proper open debate on this type of monitoring technology.
In view of what I have just heard, there is no genuinely open debate.
Secondly, we said effective economic protection systems and encryption must be adopted.
Now we are told the same thing all over again, eighteen months later.
Are we going to pass another resolution in Strasbourg repeating the 1998 resolution?
I honestly believe that it is now too late for that.
Therefore, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we must move into a higher gear and it is this Parliament' s duty, as the third institution of the Union, to spearhead the attack.
Madam President, I actually think the speeches from the Council and the Commission were most enlightening.
The United States now acknowledges the existence of the 'Echelon' system.
Tongues are being loosened in certain Union governments.
The press is crammed full of details about this all-pervasive electronic monitoring network.
And yet, how embarrassed the Council and the Commission sounded!
What tangled comments they made to avoid answering our questions.
I did not hear the slightest explanation of why it was necessary to wait for Members of Parliament to discover this massive scandal nearly two years ago, and then recently for them to provide proof that their revelations were in fact true, before the Council would agree, in a very implicit and convoluted way, that there is indeed a problem.
Let me restate the problem: by virtue of privileged and very special links, a strategic ally and a Member State are covertly joining forces to monitor private communications and spy on companies in other Union countries.
Where is this taking us?
With friends like that, who needs enemies?
You will understand, Mr President, Commissioner, that with the truth now established, we feel entitled to ask you further regarding a number of questions that are on everyone' s mind today.
First, what do you know about the type of information this system intercepts, the ultimate recipients the information is sent to, and the reliability of the protection that exists in Europe for people' s privacy and firms' strategic data?
Secondly, apart from the formal exchange of correspondence the Commissioner mentioned, what serious action has it undertaken with regard to the United States Government on this matter and with what outcome?
Thirdly, what can you tell us about the role played by the United Kingdom in this system, or at least the role it intends to play in the future?
Whether people like it or not, the 'Echelon' file is now open and it will remain open.
After the European Parliament, the matter has been taken up by other parliaments and indeed the United States Congress, which I have contacted, because what we are doing is not anti-American.
Our fellow citizens have been alerted.
So I want to warn Members who are still hesitant that trying to stop this movement now would be a rearguard action, and would probably be severely condemned by democratic opinion.
On the other hand - and I have listened carefully to what has been said, particularly by the spokespersons for the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party - expectations would be fulfilled if we were to make progress together on truth, transparency and ethics in international relations.
In tabling the call for a committee of inquiry, over a quarter of the Members of this Parliament have made that choice.
I think Parliament will increase its stature by taking up this case by a majority.
Madam President, I shall be very brief as I only have one minute.
I will simply say that the revelation that the 'Echelon' electronic espionage network exists, and that it was set up by the United States national security agency, demonstrates utter disdain for the rights, freedoms and sovereignty of European countries.
We would rather not believe this affair is indicative of a general attitude towards the European Union.
Under the circumstances we are stunned by the Council' s statement.
The presidency began by stating an excellent principle - no communications interception system is admissible if it does not respect the principles of human dignity and the legislation of Member States - but the end of his statement was extremely muddled.
It dealt with data transmission inside Europe, the Schengen Information System and Europol, none of which were really relevant.
Actually, the question to the Council is extremely simple: are we going to demand the cessation of the 'Echelon' network' s activities, which violate human rights and freedoms?
Or if this 'Echelon' network is really intended to combat international organised crime, Madam President, we must insist on being involved in it. We must shoulder our share of the burden and create an international organisation for that purpose.
Otherwise the network should be closed down, and we are in favour of the parliamentary committee of inquiry called for by several groups in the European Parliament, including the Union for a Europe of Nations Group.
Madam President, so the country of the Statue of Liberty, Jefferson, Lincoln, and human rights is listening in on all world communications by cable, satellite, telephone, fax, e-mail or mobile phone!
That is obviously a shock, not in terms of our technical knowledge of encryption, but in terms of our political beliefs.
We have believed in the great market as if it were God, and competition and competitiveness, all under the governance of the WTO.
With Mr Monti, and Mr Van Miert before him, we have done everything possible to keep competition pure and perfect, even against the interests of our own businesses, our banks, our airlines, our insurance companies, CrÃ©dit Lyonnais, Rhone-Poulenc.
And now we find out that people are cheating and spying on this market, creating distortions of competition.
This Parliament, which wanted to use OLAF to spy on Members for the sake of protecting Europe' s financial interests, is discovering that we are being spied on by the United States against our financial interests, even as regards the WTO negotiations.
We thought Mr Haider' s Austria was endangering our freedom.
But it is through Mr Tony Blair' s Britain, Glyn Ford' s Britain, that fifteen thousand agents, stationed in Gibraltar, Cyprus, and even on British territory, are spying on us.
So, Madam President, are you still prepared to go to London?
Will you ever go to Sydney again?
Will you ever go to Ottawa or Wellington again?
And we thought there was solidarity in Europe.
Now we find that Britain' s solidarity extends across the Atlantic and across the Pacific Ocean.
We thought we were building Europe, making Europe stronger.
But stronger than whom?
Stronger in opposition to Iraq?
In opposition to the Serbs?
Stronger in opposition to nations and nationalism?
But with 'Echelon' , we find that Boeing belongs to a specific nation, Rayton belongs to a specific nation, and they are having people spy on Airbus or Thomson because those companies do not belong to the same nation.
'Echelon' brings us face to face with nationalism, but it is the ethnic nationalism of the Anglo-Saxon ethnic group, which includes Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, the United States and Canada.
It is an ethnic group with a religious base, the holy alliance of Adam Smith and Calvin.
So is the Catholic Europe of Gasperi, Schuman and Adenauer going to apologise?
Apologise to the people spied on, for all that evangelism?
'Echelon' is the French word for rung, and I am afraid this 'Echelon' is taking us down to the bottom rung and we will end up at dignity level zero.
Poor old European Commission!
Poor old European Council of Ministers!
Poor old European Union!
We are conditioned by the circumstances of our birth.
Something born of a Harvard University lecture theatre under the presidency of the American, General Marshall, is bound to end up obeying its creator.
Mr President, Mr Gomes for the Council and Mr Liikanen for the Commission this morning have both made very clear statements.
As a UK Member of this Parliament I understand other Members' concerns.
This morning, and in recent days in particular, we have read and heard a lot of allegations.
Even today we have heard talk of James Bond, of American espionage and we have had the rantings of the madman to my left a few moments ago.
But today, and in the Citizens' Rights Committee, we have had few real facts because of the secrecy.
That is, after all, the nature of intelligence and military information work.
If it was not secret and we all knew about it, it would not serve the purpose for which it would be intended and necessary.
Members will therefore understand that it is the practice in the United Kingdom Government, like, I imagine, most or all other governments, not to comment on alleged interception whether the allegations are based on trivia or something perhaps more substantial.
As Mr Liikanen has said, everything done in the United Kingdom is in line with a proper legal framework.
Everything is subject to close parliamentary scrutiny in the House of Commons.
We have very tight controls, both independent controls and control that emanates from the Secretary of State with the full consent of the United Kingdom Government.
Finally and importantly, I want to reiterate that everything that has been conducted, or will be conducted, is in complete conformity with United Kingdom law, with United States law and, most importantly, is done with complete respect for, and in complete conformity with, the European Convention on Human Rights.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, having heard all the speeches made today, we are all convinced that there is a system controlled by the American secret services which can intercept practically all forms of voice and data communications around the world.
What we are not sure about is whether this system has been redirected, not at purely military and defence objectives, but at commercial, industrial and technological targets. We fear and suspect this, however.
I therefore have three questions.
The first is to the Council and the Commission. What does the term 'fair trade' mean when major American companies can gain unlawful advantages thanks to privileged information provided by this system?
Secondly, what do civil liberties, a principle on everyone' s lips, mean to us when the privacy of our Heads of State, our elected representatives and our people can be violated other than for reasons of combating crime and without a court order, as required by our laws?
How do the Council and the Commission think the USA would react if it knew that Europe could intercept the communications of its president, elected representatives and people?
Finally, how can we defend ourselves against this threat?
The Commissioner has spoken of work on cryptography, which was also mentioned in Parliament' s last recommendation.
However, what specifically has been done to reinforce the cryptography system and to invest in European technology which is our best defence against this threat?
What comments might the Council and the Commission have on France' s recent decision to remove commercial closed source code systems from its public computer systems, thus allowing open source code systems to be used, which is intended, as indicated by the French Defence Minister, to guarantee that no nation and no defence systems are at the mercy of a single person or a single company?
Mr President, Echelon is a source of concern for the people of Europe, not only because it may have been used for unlawful purposes, but, above all, because of the risks inherent in its very nature, for it is an automatic, general, indiscriminate interception system, about the existence of which we can be in no doubt.
We need tighter controls to guarantee the fundamental rights of the people and to protect European companies, and we need political initiatives which ensure that the Member States cooperate more closely and keep each other informed of agreements concluded with third countries on this matter. Legislation must be updated and harmonised and supervisory authorities simplified and consolidated and, of course, new technologies are needed to protect telecommunications from disproportionate and unjustified interference.
This is a complex assembly of measures which have only been timidly, belatedly and in part announced by the Council and the Commission.
Parliament must also support all the measures necessary to ascertain the truth, and be constantly, intensely vigilant even when all this has died down, for without transparent authorities and guaranteed individual rights, there can be no faith in democracy.
Mr President, because so many questions have unfortunately remained unanswered today, I should like to ask a number of further questions and request that the Council and the Commission answer these.
Is it true - and this is a matter for the Commission and the Council - that representatives of the Commission and the Council have been working, under the chairmanship of the Americans, on Echelon-compatible European telecommunications standards, including interception options, and this within the framework of ILETS, a so-called institute?
This then provided us with the notorious Infopol documents.
How great is the damage which has already been caused to the European economy?
Are there companies in addition to Thomson and the Airbus consortium which have sustained damage?
What will the Council and the Commission do, and how will they deal with those Member States of the European Union who are spying on their partners in the Union in order - as, in fact, has been admitted - to protect their economic well-being?
How will the Commission and the Council respond to the answer from the Americans, which was read out today and which clearly contradicts what, for example, ex-CIA director Mr Woolsey has stated?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have noted your concerns with great interest.
I should like to quickly make the following points.
Firstly, I did refer, more than once, specifically to the Echelon system. I unequivocally condemned this and stated that the Council cannot accept the creation or existence of a system for intercepting telecommunications which does not respect the laws of the Member States.
Mr Wiebenga said that I did not clearly and specifically condemn Echelon.
I did do so and I do so again.
It is clearly apparent from this debate that the key issue is not whether or not a system for intercepting telecommunications exists but what use is made of this system.

In this respect I must add the following comment in response to Mr van Velzen. The Council has no information allowing it to conclude that any company, including the companies mentioned, has benefited or been damaged as a result of telecommunications being intercepted by this system.
If we had any specific information on this, the Council would not hesitate to adopt a clear position.
I can only answer the Member' s second question in writing, as I do not have precise information on this.
I would also like to tell this House that the concerns voiced here are of course shared by the presidency.
Therefore, at the next Justice and Home Affairs Council on 29 to 30 May, the Portuguese presidency will ensure that the Council debates this issue so that we can adopt a position.
We will keep Parliament constantly informed of developments in this respect.
President, can I first thank Parliament for the discussion.
I think there is one point which has been raised by a few Parliamentarians which is fundamentally important, namely to guarantee that there will be strong European encryption products.
It is very important to increase the awareness of the European citizens and companies that electronic communications need to be encrypted to guarantee confidentiality.
Here, there have been programmes for eighteen months.
The European research programmes have been relatively successful and it is recognised also in the discussions in other countries that European competence in this area is confirmed.
Secondly, to the question of Mr van Velzen on the software and data privacy in telecommunications. As Mr van Velzen knows, we are working now with the review of telecommunications legislation and this issue must be analysed in that context and I will reply to you very soon in writing where I will reply to the rest of the issues.
Mrs Berger asked whether some companies have been losing contracts because of espionage.
No companies have contacted the Commission on that issue.
As to the question about the United States and the UK: the reason why we asked for clarification recently was the interviews which were given by a former official of the intelligence agency of the United States.
For that reason we contacted the United States government and asked for clarification and what I said here was their reply to that very issue.
Finally, these are very important and sensitive areas and we must be very firm that confidentiality and privacy in telephone and telecommunications can be guaranteed.
The European Court of Human Rights took a decision some time ago when they said "tapping and other forms of interception of telephone conversations represent a serious interference with private life and correspondence and must accordingly be based on a law that is particularly precise.
It is essential to have clear, detailed rules on the subject especially as the technology available for users is continually becoming more sophisticated" .
I think this decision is very clear.
The Commission will, in all its actions, respect these principles and we will not fail to act under the obligations of the Treaty if any Community law is breached.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I have received four motions for resolutions pursuant to Article 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the next part-session.
Decision by the Patent Office on the cloning of human beings
The next item is the statement from the Commission on the decision by the European Patent Office on the cloning of human beings.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come before you here today to make a statement on European Patent No EP 69 53 51 which was granted by the European Patent Office to the University of Edinburgh on 8 December 1999.
After the granting of this patent, a number of concerns have been raised, both here in Parliament and also by organisations such as Greenpeace, about the true scope of this patent.
On behalf of the Commission, I should like to say that the Commission shares these concerns.
It seems clear to everyone involved that this patent should not have been granted in the form it was.
The European Patent Office has issued a press statement to that effect.
I know that there have been some among you here today who believe that the European Patent Office has, at best, been economical with the truth or at worst has sought to seriously mislead the public.
You have a joint motion before you today which includes such charges.
May I point out that the European Patent Office is not a Community body; its existence and its actions are derived from an international agreement to which all the Member States of the European Union and four other countries are a party, but not the Community itself.
Therefore, I cannot give you authoritative information on the actions of the European Patent Office in this particular case.
However, given my experience of the European Patent Office, which I visited in Munich recently, I personally should be very surprised if this unfortunate occurrence was anything other than a mistake during the examination process.
Irrespective of the cause of the problem, it is clear, as I have mentioned just now, that the patent should not have been granted in its current form.
Therefore the question is: what does the Commission intend to do about it?
That is the reason why I am here today.
The motion before you calls on Parliament itself and the other institutions of the European Union formally to oppose this patent within the 9-month period during which an opposition is allowed under the rules governing the granting of European patents.
Some oppositions to this patent have already been filed.
However, if the European Patent Office follows its usual rules for oppositions then this is unlikely to bring any changes to this patent before December 2000 and perhaps even later than that.
Such a delay in correcting what is, in effect, an admitted error, is clearly undesirable.
I have therefore written to the European Patent Office in Munich requesting that it should explore every possibility to bring about a speedier resolution of this issue.
I am pleased to say that the European Patent Office has agreed, given the particular nature of this case, to form a so-called opposition body immediately, an opposition body which will, shortly after having been constituted, issue a first communication indicating a preliminary opinion.
Now, the European Patent Office said that such a preliminary opinion will be without prejudice to the final ruling of the opposition division in this case.
But the Office assures me that proceedings will speedily lead to conclusions, subject to respecting the rights of the parties to be heard.
I am sure that, like me, Members of this assembly, Mr President, will welcome this willingness on the part of the European Patent Office to respond to some of the concerns raised by this Parliament and as a direct result of the approach taken by the Commission.
I am happy to make available to you, President, copies of both my letter to the European Patent Office and its reply to the Commission.
Of course, I shall inform you, as soon as possible, about the conclusions which the legal service of the Commission will formulate having studied precisely the reply of the European Patent Office to the letter which I sent it recently
Let me therefore conclude by reiterating that the Commission, like everyone else, regrets that this patent has been granted in its present form.
We have taken action which - based upon the full cooperation of the European Patent Office - will, I believe, bring about a speedy resolution of this unfortunate occurrence.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the granting of a patent on genetically modified human embryos and on a technique which might possibly lead to the cloning of human beings is a huge scandal.
This is a flagrant violation of human dignity.
The event shows how important it was for the European Parliament, in debating the directive on the patenting of biotechnological inventions, to have made it a cornerstone of the directive that there can be no question of patenting techniques for cloning human beings and for manipulating human genetic material, still less of patenting the human being in all phases of his development.
Many people said at the time that these clarifications were quite unnecessary and that a patent of this kind would never be granted anyway.
We now see how important these clarifications were.
The European Patent Office has incorporated the European Union' s directive into its own directives.
It is not, in fact, bound directly by the Council' s and Parliament' s directive but has incorporated word for word what we decided upon at the time into its implementing rules.
What has happened in this connection is therefore a flagrant breach of the European Patent Office' s own rules.
Nor can I feel any sympathy or understanding for those who say that, oh, there was nothing very untoward about the granting of this patent, that we should not be getting so worked up about it and that, what is more, the technique in question may potentially have a lot to offer.
Then, there was a press statement from Europabio, which was not very helpful in this regard and, following which, I wrote a letter to the chairman of Europabio pointing out that such an ambivalent position on the patent involved was not at all helpful in furthering people' s understanding of biotechnology.
It must also meet with vigorous protest in the European Parliament.
It is not, however, a question of the directive we adopted in 1998 being a bad one.
It is a question of its needing to be applied better.
There has been a breach of this directive, and we ought not, therefore, to bring the directive into question but instead to make sure that the directive is applied both in the European Patent Office and also through being transposed into national law.
We stated clearly at the time that we are in favour of biotechnology and approve of the opportunities it presents, but we want to see clear, ethically based limits.
There is also something else which requires clarification. The European Parliament has always taken a clear stand, not only against the patenting of techniques which violate human dignity, but also against such techniques themselves.
Parliament has always repudiated the cloning of human beings, the manipulation of human genetic material and the use of embryos in research. Take, for example, Mr Tannert' s report on the relevant research programme in these areas.
The Group of the European People' s Party has therefore tabled Amendment No 4 in order once again to make it clear that we are not going back on this.
We shall, in any case, vote in favour of this resolution because the European Parliament must send out a clear signal in this regard.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European Patent No EP 69 53 51, granted by the European Parliament and concerning the genetic manipulation of human cells and human embryos has triggered understandable feelings of horror among the public.
As soon as the course of events became known, my group tabled an oral question on the matter in order to obtain clarification of the questions of principle which had been raised and of the inevitable consequences.
However, the question disappeared without trace in the course of this House' s business.
Instead of the required answers, we have today received an explanation from the Commission which cannot be the last word as far as the European Parliament is concerned.
Why do I mention this?
Quite simply because this dreadful patent and the run-up to it, together with the disappearance of a parliamentary question, show how we ought not to deal with biotechnology, that is to say in a careless and slipshod manner.
That would lead to a disastrous situation in which the principles of the inviolability of the human being and of human dignity would be completely lost.
Clearly, everything must be done in order to completely do away with Patent No EP 69 53 51 and any similar gaffes.
Clearly we must move as quickly as possible to close the legal loophole constituted by the flawed European patent.
Clearly, we must quickly create a route to independent patent jurisdiction which is open to everyone. Or do we want further to abandon a powerful authority to a form of self-monitoring which still does not even begin to operate satisfactorily?
Obviously, the development of biotechnology and of all new techniques must be subject to increased public supervision.
In this way, the European Parliament is confronted with a special task requiring the preparation of an annual report on the work of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies.
It is just as clear to my group and to myself that the genetic inheritance of humanity must remain common property and should not be sold off on the floor of the stock exchange.
We only use biotechnology in a responsible way when we respect its ethical limits and make the genetic code accessible to researchers throughout the world.
Finally, it must be made unequivocally clear once and for all that our Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions excludes not only the patentability of the human being, of parts of the human genetic make-up and of interference with the genome, but also forbids the cloning of human beings at all phases of their development.
Moreover, everyone must adhere to this.
Mr President, European Patent No EP 69 53 51 has been a great shock to us.
It amounts to deliberately awarding a patent for the breeding of human beings.
The genetically modified human being would himself be degraded to the status of a product of genetic technology, and that would be a flagrant affront to human dignity.
We are therefore delighted that, in its motion for a resolution, Parliament has taken up the proposal tabled by the Greens to the effect that we, as a Parliament, should submit a complaint to the Patent Office in Munich and that Parliament should join us in our criticism of the structural problems of the European Patent Office, because if transparency and an ethical approach are to be allowed to come into their own, we require independent supervision of the European Patent Office.
This patent is no isolated case, however.
It is only the tip of the iceberg or a Pandora' s box which has been open for a long time.
The Patent Office has awarded a whole range of patents on human genetic make-up and thus breached the regulations of the European Patent Agreement.
Parts of the human genetic make-up have, quite intolerably, been declared to be, and commercialised as, the invention and the property of third parties.
We must vehemently oppose this commercialisation of human genes and these flagrant violations of human dignity.
This also means, however, that we need to investigate the patenting of parts of the human genetic make-up and of genes themselves, which is also made possible by the directive on patenting.
That is because we need a moratorium on the patenting of human genes and of parts of the human genetic make-up so that its social and ethical consequences, which are now everywhere to be seen, can be examined. For this patent must be a lesson and also a last warning to us to the effect that we really have to adopt a different approach in dealing with this issue.
I would also have expected more from the Commission today in terms of more criticism and also of more questions about the background to the directive on patenting which also virtually legitimises past practice on the part of the Patent Office.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group supports the joint resolution on the offending decision by the European Patent office.
I am also delighted that the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - and I want to thank Mr Liese - has adopted Article 1 of our motion for a resolution as an amendment, reaffirming the primacy of the dignity of human life over any considerations of research or profit.
In their defence the officers of the Patent Office refer to the language problem.
But the English wording of the patent undermines that explanation because Article 11 explicitly mentions that the term 'animal' includes all animal cells, especially of mammalian species, including human cells.
So that seems to contradict the linguistic explanations given by the Office and the fear remains that the mistake is not just a technical one, as they apparently want to make out.
An inquiry to identify responsibility for such a mistake is essential, sanctions must be applied and, above all, adequate measures must be taken by the Member States of the European Patents Convention and the Office itself to prevent such incidents recurring.
But it is not just a matter of applying the legal rules in force in the Union, or indeed those of the Office itself.
It is a matter of defending the dignity of the human being, from conception to natural death.
We know very well that cloning is an attack on that dignity, especially when it involves embryonic reduction in the secrecy of laboratories.
We know the creation of clones to provide healthy cells for the benefit of the original is an affront to that dignity.
Each person is unique; there is something sacred in each human being.
The contempt for human beings, and life generally, that now exists can only feed the worst excesses of irresponsible scientists.
It is a good thing that, at least for the space of a short debate, we have remembered everyone' s fundamental right to their own unique identity.
Mr President, the public alarm at the granting of this patent is, I feel, totally justified.
In the first place, at this stage, it is in the general interest to avoid patents being issued on human chromosomes, in order not to close any doors to the endeavours of scientific research to find new treatment methods and to use knowledge gained about the human genome to improve health, which is an end that should be placed over and above the albeit legitimate protection of the economic interests of researchers.
Secondly, there is a deficiency in the law: it is not possible for the European Patent Office not to have any links with the Commission or be part of the structure of the European Union.
Thirdly and most importantly, we are considering an issue which is at the very root of our civilisation.
Christianity has taught us the value of the dignity of every human being; the tradition of the left enshrines the concept that the human person, man, is not a commodity and cannot be treated as such.
Well, we are now clearly running the risk of turning human beings into commodities, at least in part, and this affects the very roots of our civilisation - in terms of Christianity and also of the enlightenment and Marxism.
We must be united, determined and resolute in our reaction, remembering that the embryo is a unique human being.
Whatever our attitude to abortion, even those of us who consider abortion to be lawful have always agreed on one point: the right of the mother prevails over the right of the embryo, but the right of the embryo does exist. It yields solely and exclusively before the right of the mother, not before the right of a multinational to make money.
Mr President, I would thank the Commission for its statement and would urge it to file an official objection to this patent.
The Council should give the Commission the mandate to do this.
In justification of this, I would point out that it must be the Commission' s job to enforce the directive on bio-patents.
It is debatable whether this directive, for which I was the rapporteur, is in fact a suitable tool for managing the problems involved.
It would have been helpful if whoever was giving vent to his indignation had taken the trouble to read the patent.
He would then have seen that the patent infringes the directive on bio-patents on two counts, firstly because the patent protection extends to include a procedure for modifying human genetic material and, secondly, because the patent protection extends to include the use of embryos for commercial and industrial purposes.
These are two clear infringements of the directive on bio-patents.
How one might now use this as an opportunity to again cast doubt upon the directive without having read the patent or the directive, I really cannot imagine.
Hence, my request to Parliament to the effect that we should not again cast doubt upon the directive, as Mrs Breyer thinks we have to.
This is, in fact, the first text in the world to offer a satisfactory solution to the problems involved in patent protection and bio-technological inventions and, what is more, the first text in the world to win universal approval.
It is now, therefore, a question not of again bringing the directive into question but of enforcing it.
Mr President, I must begin by explaining that I have no association at all with Edinburgh University, but I think that it is important to stress their bona fides.
It is, after all, one of my own country' s most distinguished universities.
When they sought and obtained this patent, which they did for entirely lawful purposes, they did so in good faith.
They have no interest in cloning humans: rather what they are interested in is being able to work on human tissue to help find remedies for, for example, Alzheimer' s Disease and leukaemia and what they are doing breaks no law in the United Kingdom.
As has been explained, the patent in question was examined prior to the coming into effect of the 1998 directive in September 1999, but it was issued after that date and, as has been said, a mistake was made in the form in which it was granted.
I have seen no evidence at all at this stage of anything more than error on the part of the Patent Office.
Of course, I would like to add that that is something which is of serious concern.
But until there is something more, I think it appropriate that the wilder claims and suggestions should be ignored.
My understanding is that the patent error can be corrected either by the patent owner applying to correct the document or by a third party filing an opposition which I understand has already been done.
I have been told by the university' s advisors that it will not resist so long as the disclaimer which may be added to the patent continues to allow them to carry out their lawful work on human tissue.
In other words, what we are talking about here is an amendment to cut out the offending elements of the patent, thereby rendering it lawful, and not its revocation in its entirety.
I believe that the work which is being carried out in Edinburgh is not permitted by national law in some other Member States.
But what this Parliament and the Community institutions and international bodies should not do is attempt to legislate for national parliaments in areas which are national competences, and in my view any attempt to do so should be resisted strongly as a matter of overriding constitutional principle.
Mr President, may I begin by thanking Members of this Parliament very much indeed for the questions that they have put and the comments that they have made.
Perhaps you will allow me to pass a few comments on what the various Members of this Parliament have said.
May I begin by saying in reply to Mr Rothley that indeed the Commission has reserved to itself the right to oppose the patent in a formal way.
As I have said earlier this morning, I wrote a letter on behalf of the Commission to the European Patent Office.
I have no objection whatsoever to making that letter public.
The penultimate paragraph reads as follows: "In this context, I have to inform that the College of Commissioners has already decided to take more formal action, notably to file an opposition by the Commission or the Community in case no pragmatic solution can be reached" .
In other words, whereas we prefer a negotiated settlement because it will be quicker than the nine months which is foreseen by the Patent Office rules, we have retained for ourselves the right formula to oppose the patents if no progress is made along this quicker route.
So, as far as that goes, Mr Rothley may rest assured that the Commission has reserved that right to itself.
I should then like to support Mr Liese who has emphasised that there is nothing wrong with the directive.
I agree with him.
I think that the directive is a good one.
Indeed, Mr Rothley himself has said that the directive is the first of its kind in the world and that it has received universal acclaim.
Certainly if I look at paragraph five of the directive where it says that certain processes are not to be considered patentable, then it seems to me that the directive is perfectly clear.
Mr Blokland has said that the directive is unclear and inconsistent and certainly the Commission will be very interested in a substantiated view of that statement.
It was also mentioned by Frau Gebhardt that the cloning of human beings should be forbidden.
Well, President, it is forbidden.
May I draw the attention of Mrs Gebhardt to the fact that the directive specifically forbids that.
It seems to me that that is all we need to do, provided, of course, that the directive is properly applied.
The last issue I should like to deal with is the matter of the Community patent.
Several speakers this morning have spoken about the European patents.
Now, a European patent is what the European Patent Office grants.
The proper term to use is a Community patent.
In other words it is one application made to the European Patent Office in Munich but that office would then grant a Community patent and that would apply at one go to the whole European Union.
We are working on that.
I should like to say to Frau Gebhardt and Mr De Clercq who mentioned this that we are certainly working hard at realising the possibility of having a Community patent.
It is not an easy thing, principally because the European Patent Office is not a Community institution.
So what we want the European Patent Office to do is something on behalf of the European Commission while the Office itself is not a Community institution.
That presents us with certain legal problems and we are trying to solve them.
It is indeed true that the language problems are considerable.
The average cost of a patent is about EUR 30 000, much higher than in the United States, and that is because 40% of those costs are taken up by language problems - the translation costs - and we are trying to get to grips with that problem.
Lastly, it is the intention of the Commission to issue a document to substantiate the construction of a European patent before the summer and I look forward to entering into a dialogue with Parliament on the substance of that document.
Mr President, I just wanted some further clarification.
Mr Bolkestein, I am very sorry if you have not been listening very carefully or if the translation was not very precise, but I have not put forward a demand that cloning should be prohibited.
Not so.
Having kept a critical eye on the way in which the legislation relating to the directive on biotechnological inventions was developing, I am perfectly aware of what this contains.
I would merely ask you to be aware of this.
What I in fact said is that I should like absolute clarification that these are in fact the contents.
That is a quite different statement from the one you attributed to me.
I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Article 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 10.55 a.m. and resumed at 11.05 a.m.)
Vote
Mr President, I know that there are to be no votes on the opinions which have been submitted by the various committees.
The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities has tabled a special opinion.
I just want to point out that what is most important in this opinion is, of course, the view that proper resources should be set aside for mainstreaming.
A mistake has nonetheless crept into our opinion.
I do not want there to be a mistake here, even if we are not voting on it.
The last part of section 4 of our opinion, following the words "Community action programmes should cooperate" , is to be deleted.
The Committee voted to remove this section, but it has nonetheless been included by mistake.
I want this part to be removed and I want to give notice of the fact now, before we proceed to the vote.

Joint motion for a resolution on Mediterranean policy
Concerning Amendments Nos 4 and 5:
Mr President, the oral amendment which I am about to read out replaces Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 5.
There was consensus among all the groups tabling the joint motion.
It supplements Paragraph 16 and reads: "Favours the convening of a Euro-Mediterranean conference on agriculture, with the participation of representatives of the institutions, members of the agri-foodstuffs industry and representatives of farmers' and consumers' organisations" .

Joint motion for a resolution on the decision of the European Patent Office on the cloning of human beings
Concerning Amendment No 4:
Mr President, excuse me if I am a bit hoarse, but I have a cold.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested a split vote on this amendment.
I think that the first part of the amendment is uncontroversial, but there is a linguistic problem in the second part.
I think it is a translation-related problem.
It was the intention of the European People' s Party not to open a new debate but merely to re-confirm what Parliament had already decided recently, for example in the context of the Fifth Framework Programme on Research or in that of the Tannert report on the specific Framework Programme on Research.
It is therefore important for us to adapt the German language version to the wording also chosen for the Fifth Framework Programme on Research.
In this case, the English text is the original, and the German should read 'verbrauchende Embryonenforschung' , which are the words also decided upon by Parliament for the Framework Programme on Research.
It is not, therefore, a question of tightening up Parliament' s position but of emphasising what we have already decided.
The German must therefore read 'verbrauchende Embryonenforschung' .
I just wanted to explain that my group will nevertheless be voting against this amendment, because I think that discussion of embryo research has no place here.
We are therefore voting against the amendment, even with this correction.
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Haug report (A5-0070/2000)
Mr President, I voted against the Haug report on the budget guidelines for the 2001 budgetary procedure for reasons which may seem futile to the other Members present, but which hold great importance for me, for I was elected to this Parliament to represent the Pensioners' Party and I intend to do everything possible, and the impossible as well, to draw attention to the requests, needs and requirements of the elderly.
There are approximately 120 million elderly people in Europe, most of whom receive a pension, although there are a few, less fortunate people who do not, but these guidelines make no provision whatsoever for a European Union policy for pensioners and the elderly.
This is why I oppose this procedure, and I hope that I will be able to improve conditions for pensioners and the elderly during the next few years.
Mr President, I have naturally voted for the Haug report on the budgetary guidelines, but I would particularly like to stress the welcome reinstatement of natural disasters, confirmed by this morning' s vote.
As I have said here several times, I do not think the European Union can want to make its presence felt and to be more visible to its people than it has been up to now, whilst, at the same time, turning its back on their difficulties and misfortunes when these occur.
So it is with great pleasure that I have voted for paragraphs 21 and 34.
My hope is that they will be implemented rapidly, particularly for the forestry sector, which is experiencing structural difficulties and has experienced a drastic reduction in supply.
I think that the Union' s natural role would be to dedicate itself to this, and I hope we can build on this report to make Parliament and the Commission aware of the need for intervention.
- (SV) We have voted against a number of points in Mrs Haug' s report on the guidelines for the 2001 budgetary procedure.
The biggest challenge confronting the European Union over the next few years is enlargement to include the countries in Eastern and Central Europe.
Enlargement will be an expensive business in many ways.
It is therefore important that the EU should set aside large sums in this connection, and not only accession aid.
In spite of this, enlargement is not mentioned in Mrs Haug' s report.
Instead, "the social and cultural dimension of Europe" is chosen as the most important point to be taken up in the guidelines for the 2001 budget.
We think that the EU should devote its energies to those problems which the Member States cannot solve themselves, that is to say the cross-border issues.
Cultural policy and social policy are very important political areas but ought not, on the whole, to be subjects of common legislation.
Aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo is taken up in Mrs Haug' s report as another priority area, which is something we support wholeheartedly.
However, we think that the resources needed for Kosovo should be found from the aid given to tobacco cultivation and to other production in the context of the common agricultural policy.
As liberals, we believe that agricultural policy should be adapted to the market and made less bureaucratic.
If Parliament is serious about enlargement eastwards, efforts must be made to cut back considerably on the costs of agriculture.
All direct aid given to agricultural production ought to gradually be abolished.
The EU plays an important role when it comes to employment, especially through the single market.
We would nonetheless emphasise that unemployment cannot be reduced only by means of political decisions at European level.
We are convinced that measures in the Member States, such as reduced social costs, flexible labour law and a good business climate, are what lead to increased employment and dynamic development throughout the Union.
. (ES) I would like to congratulate Mrs Haug on her excellent work and say that I agree with her when she highlights job creation as a priority for the Union.
The Committee on Fisheries does not want more money.
We simply wish to be named in the guidelines, because what is not named does not exist, and fishing exists, and is even a common policy.
Fishing is crucial to maintaining employment and the economy in the peripheral European regions which depend on it.
This industry also generates numerous land-based jobs, in the processing industry and in the dockyards.
The cheapest jobs are those which do not have to be created because they have not already disappeared.
It is better to support activities that already create employment than to have to invest huge amounts, later on, in the creation of new industries.
We in the Committee on Fisheries believe that the international fisheries agreements deserve explicit budgetary support, so that the Community fleet may continue its activities and the economies of the fishing regions do not reach crisis point.
In the process of reaching an agreement we will therefore see to it that the Union' s support for fishing is consolidated and increased.
During the current budgetary procedure we will also highlight our concern that fishing resources be conserved and working and safety conditions in that industry improved.
The Haug report reveals that there is a serious risk that what happened before will be repeated in the 2001 budgetary procedure.
Strict compliance with the Stability Pact requires an approach involving budgetary restriction. This affects the commitment to the European Union' s traditional priorities and, in particular, to basic challenges such as combating unemployment, promoting economic and social cohesion, adequately preparing for enlargement and establishing the policy for cooperation that is so essential.
It is imperative that new priorities are given new financial resources.
In the current situation, the financing of Kosovo' s reconstruction and the Stability Pact for the Balkans requires a comprehensive review of the financial perspective.
Under no circumstances can the approach contained in the report of a cut, albeit fair, in all the budgetary categories be accepted in order to respond to the current requirements.
We do not agree with this approach and therefore cannot approve the report.
Ferber report (A5-0068/2000)
Mr President, I abstained from the vote on Mr Ferber' s report on the other sections of the 2001 budget because, although it was excellent, it does not focus sufficiently on reducing the costs of the bureaucratic machinery of the European Union, and of the European Parliament, in particular, in addition to that of the Commission.
There is too much staff-related expenditure.
The European Parliament' s bureaucracy is a steamroller which takes up too great a part of our all too modest economic means, and I have an albeit vague suspicion that this is partly responsible for the sluggishness of the European Union in financial matters as well.
Haug and Ferber reports (A5-0070 and 0068/2000)

The French Members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group reject the Haug and Ferber reports on the guidelines for the budgetary procedure. They reflect political choices our delegation finds unacceptable.
We condemn the priority accorded by the rapporteur to the financing of policies newly introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group denounces the federalist integration promoted throughout this report, which calls for growing Community powers in justice and home affairs.
Our group likewise condemns the desire expressed by the alliance of the large Socialist, Christian Democrat and Conservative groups in the European Parliament to use agriculture, the appropriations under heading 1 of the financial perspective, as a source of financing for areas now falling within the remit of European Union 'foreign policy' .
We consider it iniquitous to seek to finance the reconstruction of Kosovo on the backs of the farmers, and unacceptable to try to make people believe the problem should be framed as a conflict of duty. Such trickery deserves to be denounced.
On the contrary, Europe must maintain agricultural spending and possibly moderate spending on other budget headings, where there are margins.
In fact everyone now agrees in acknowledging that the EUR 360 million sought for Kosovo for the year 2000 represents a sum, a godsend for some people, that this region of former Yugoslavia, with ever-growing centrifugal forces at work, is in no position to assimilate.
It can also be observed in this region of Europe that the donors other than the European Union countries, in their reluctance to shoulder their financial commitments, starting with the United States, are taking the view that the money is arriving too late and coordination is poor. And this is at a time when the Balkans is still a veritable powder keg where there is increasing evidence that trends are moving in the opposite direction to what we were hoping and the sound of tanks is more often heard than the sound of mechanical diggers.
Similarly, regardless of the substance of the agreement, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group denounces the rethink of last year' s Berlin Summit, represented by the ongoing demands for revision of the 2000-2006 financial perspective and the various headings, at a time when there are no precise figures for the European Commission' s ambitious programme for the Balkans (EUR 5.5 billion).
There are no justifiable grounds for this demand for revision of the financial perspective and, assuming that the 2001 budget is adopted with the maximum amounts authorised in Berlin, that would permit a 5-6% increase in the available sums.
It is right to oppose this poor solution and, acting responsibly, especially on behalf of the voters who gave us their support, we must certainly ensure that the budget for Europe remains in line with the evolution of national budgets, in particular as regards payment appropriations.
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group is equally opposed, out of concern for consistency, to any annual financing of the EUR 5.5 billion sought for the Balkans by increasing the ceiling on external expenditure by Europe and lowering the ceilings for the agricultural headings, on the deceitful pretext that the appropriations would not be taken from agriculture, but that it would be appropriate to release margins for 2001 and 2002.
It should be remembered here that, in 2003, the mid-term analysis planned at the Berlin Summit in the context of Agenda 2000 will be known.
There is a great risk that, when the time comes, this dubious practice will be claimed by many as an acquired right, and it will therefore constitute an extremely dangerous precedent as far as the farmers of our countries are concerned.
The Commission' s figures for the Balkans are highly political and do not correspond to any specific study, while, for its part, the Council of Ministers thinks it is possible at the moment to finance the programmes and aid for the Balkans within the ceilings of heading 4: 'External actions' .
So, first of all, and with great urgency, indeed before the draft budget for 2001 appears at the end of April, we must demand and obtain from the European Commission precisely calculated estimates for real needs, as well as strict multiannual budgetary planning, respecting certain conditions.
It is unacceptable and irresponsible that, ten months after the end of the conflict, we still do not have any reliable estimates of the region' s needs.
In conclusion, let us bear in mind that the European Union' s budget for heading 4 on external actions is far from representing just the concerns of Europeans, concerns which do not seem to be reflected in the budgetary guidelines. Taking natural disasters as an example, it is deplorable that there should no longer be specific reference to vital reforestation.
Thus, the importance of the position of France, the country which suffered the most during the recent storms, is being dramatically played down, and likened to other situations with which it has nothing in common.
