I find it regrettable that there are still a few States even today who are limiting the rights of their nationals as European citizens.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to add another important comment, which is that the Charter and the Lisbon Treaty strengthen the Union as a supranational democracy of States and citizens, and that is the first response in an era of political globalisation.
We are doing it at regional level, but I believe that it is an example which we should follow for our own future and for that of mankind as a whole.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are preparing the summit, and I do not expect this summit to spring any surprises.
I do expect it, however, to open doors to the future and to position the European Union on many issues.
The first door it must open is the door to ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.
We expect ratification to be effected quickly in all Member States and the result of the 2009 elections to the European Parliament to be taken into account in the appointment of office-holders pursuant to the new Treaty.
I also expect, however, that clearing the way for ratification will also mean that the Council and Commission finally begin to communicate and provide information on the content of the Treaty in the Member States.
Do not remain silent about the reasons why we support this Treaty.
We welcome it because it strengthens our citizens, our parliaments, democracy and the European Union.
The second door we are opening is the door to freedom.
Schengen will be discussed.
We are pleased that more Member States now fulfil the Schengen criteria, because meeting the Schengen criteria means more freedom within the European Union and greater freedom for citizens of the European Union.
Thirdly, the door will, I hope, be opened to enable the European Union to assume more global responsibility.
Let me therefore say plainly that the scope for a negotiated solution to the Kosovo question has been exhausted and that the European Union must jointly assume responsibility for Kosovo.
It is our unequivocal view that the future of Kosovo and Serbia lies in the European Union and that we must make every effort to ensure that people's desire to be free and to live in peace with each other is satisfied.
My last point concerns the door to research and technology.
Implement the Galileo decision, which could only be taken because the European Union shouldered its financial responsibility.
(PT) Mr President, President of the Council, the Portuguese Presidency is leaving a legacy that is highly stimulating but also fraught with responsibilities.
It is this political legacy that this week's summit will be called upon to consolidate and develop.
The signing of the Lisbon Treaty tomorrow, the solemn ratification of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the three institutions of the European Union in a few minutes' time, the establishment of a strategic partnership with Brazil without detriment to the European Union's special relations with Mercosur, the resumption of regular strategic summits with Africa, and lastly the boost given to the Lisbon Strategy and many matters of decisive importance for the future of Europe: these are notable achievements but they will only be of use if they produce the policies and achieve the objectives that are essential to make Europe stronger, more cohesive, more united and more decisive for world stability.
This is, in short, the responsibility that the Member States, the European Council, the Commission and Parliament too inherit from the Portuguese Presidency.
But it is also the incentive that will enable us all to emerge from the institutional crisis that has held Europe back and impeded the process of European integration for the past two years.
To repeat what I have already said many times, my sincere congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency and I hope the forthcoming Slovene Presidency will continue on the same lines and develop what has been done.
The sole aim of the forthcoming Brussels summit should be to create the necessary political conditions for that to happen.
(ES) Mr President, I am pleased that the Lisbon Treaty is to be signed tomorrow.
This will end a period of some uncertainty in which outsiders perceived the Union as suffering from a certain paralysis.
I therefore congratulate the Portuguese Presidency.
Once the Treaty is signed, I hope there will be no reason to sit back.
It is a time for the Union, and hence the European Council, to look outward and to be decisive in tackling the problems faced by citizens.
I will single out three.
Economic growth: the European Council must not become complacent.
The signs are not good: the euro is fairly strong, making exports difficult; inflation is falling; the dollar is fairly weak and oil continues to be expensive.
All the studies - the most recent being that of the OECD - are lowering their forecasts of economic growth in Europe for 2007 and 2008.
Secondly, illegal immigration: this is a serious problem which the Conference of Euromed Ministers, among others, has been trying to tackle during this six-month period.
In the action plan approved at the Africa Summit I also saw references to readmission agreements and other instruments, but will those undertakings be honoured?
How long has the European Union been negotiating readmission agreements with certain Mediterranean countries?
Moreover, illegal immigration does not just depend on cooperation with third countries; we too need to fulfil our commitments, for example with respect to FRONTEX.
Furthermore, the effective enlargement of Schengen, which the European Council is to confirm on Friday, also means extended external borders.
I hope that the authorities and officials responsible for those new borders will be up to coping with the illegal immigration network.
Finally, terrorism: the threat persists.
There are the recent threats from Al Qaeda leaders; there are yesterday's bloody attacks in Algiers; and I would remind you of what happened in France last week with ETA.
I am pleased that, during the Portuguese Presidency, there have been efforts to fill the post of European counter-terrorism coordinator, which has been inexplicably vacant for over six months.
If by chance there was a lack of powers or resources, the reform of the Treaty was surely a lost opportunity to strengthen this post.
Finally, I hope that the European Council will insist on rapid processing of the recent Commission proposal to amend the framework decision on terrorism to include condoning as an offence.
(FR) Mr President, 2007 - this year of the German and Portuguese Presidencies - will go down in the history of European integration as the year of the ultimate snub to the peoples of Europe and to democracy.
The treaty that will be signed tomorrow in Lisbon is neither simplified nor consensual.
It is nothing more nor less than a rehash of the Constitutional Treaty, to which the French nation said 'no'.
Yet most of you, along with Mr Giscard d'Estaing, are noisily celebrating.
To those of my French colleagues who support this Constitution-with-a-makeover I must therefore address a very solemn warning.
The provisions of the treaty create a new state.
That state is being imposed upon our people against their will and it will therefore have no legitimacy.
The consequence is quite specific, and quite dreadful: the organs of the European Union and the texts that they produce will have to be regarded as unlawful.
Soon, therefore, we shall have a pressing duty incumbent on us under international law: the duty of disobedience.
I have nothing further to say.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to refer briefly in my closing statement to an issue which has been raised several times and which is of the utmost importance, which is naturally on the European Union's external agenda and will most probably continue to be a priority in the coming weeks and months.
I refer to the question of Kosovo.
I should like to explain briefly the Portuguese Presidency's position on this vital issue.
In our view it was most important, after the Ahtisaari plan was presented to the Security Council, for the European Union, Russia and the United States to form a Troika in order to seek, again in very close contact with the parties, possible solutions on which the parties could agree.
There were two main objectives, the objective of trying to explore certain aspects of the Ahtisaari plan that could and should be explored.
On the other hand, we are sure, we and the European Union, that we have done all that we could to make it possible for an agreed solution to be reached on the future of Kosovo.
We had 120 days to do it.
We now know, and it is a matter of public knowledge on which the Troika too has reported, that it proved impossible for the parties to agree on the future status of Kosovo, but all is not lost.
In the first place, we must record the excellent climate, the excellent atmosphere between the parties to the Troika and in the relations between the Troika and the parties.
In the second place, as we hoped and expected, it was possible to explore some of the aspects highlighted in the Ahtisaari report and new points of agreement naturally emerged on that basis.
In the third place, a most important aspect and one which has perhaps not received due attention is the fact that the parties agreed not to resort to violent solutions to settle the question of the future status of Kosovo.
We attach great importance to this political commitment and we only hope, naturally, that it will be respected.
The process has been referred to the United Nations again and will be debated again in the Security Council.
The United Nations, let us not forget, has a fundamental role in this matter.
But if it proves impossible at United Nations level for the members of the Security Council to agree on a solution that will determine the future status of Kosovo, we have no doubt that the international community and the European Union in particular will itself have to take decisions which we all know will be complex and perhaps difficult ones.
Three observations in this connection are of fundamental concern to the Portuguese Presidency and will be of fundamental concern to Portugal as a Member State of the European Union after 1 January.
Naturally, the first concern is to preserve the unity of the Member States.
In our view, it is essential that when we are called upon to decide and if we take a decision it must be a joint decision.
We must present a united front.
In our view, this is absolutely essential.
What we would not like or wish to see, what we would do everything possible to avoid, is for Europe to be divided on the question of Kosovo as it has been in the past on so many international situations, difficult international issues carrying great responsibilities.
Unity must therefore be our watchword.
Secondly, the European Union must assume its responsibilities because Kosovo is above all a European problem, our problem, and while it is clear that we rely on all our international partners in seeking a solution to this question too, Europe cannot turn its back on Kosovo, it must fully assume its responsibilities for a European problem and, at the conclusion of the Presidency, I consider that the European Union is perfectly aware of this fact and perfectly aware that it has a leading role to play in this matter.
Thirdly, we must not be precipitate, we must consider carefully the consequences of any decisions we may take, we must naturally seek a consensus if possible in all circumstances and in all situations, and we must also naturally take a clear position on this question and convey that position in a very transparent and very obvious form to all partners who are also involved in the question of Kosovo in any way.
Finally, any solution to the question of the future status of Kosovo must always and in all circumstances respect the values and principles that are fundamental to the European Union: peace and regional stability of course and also, obviously, respect for the law, respect for democracy, respect for human rights.
There is no other frame of reference for the solution to the problem of Kosovo and we must not, under any circumstances, forget that the European Union offered the countries of the Western Balkans and Serbia in particular firm and unequivocal European prospects, and we must work with the parties to that end also.
The parties must know that their natural vocation is to be in Europe.
Let us hope that the European Union, in solving the difficult question of Kosovo - and, let us have no illusions, this is a complex and a difficult question - we have no alternative, as I say, that the European Union, in all circumstances and despite any differences there may be on particular issues, must maintain its unity.
This is fundamental and essential to the credibility of the European Union and its external actions.
That, in brief, is what I wanted to say to you about Kosovo.
Finally, Mr President, I hope you will forgive and I am sure you will understand if I end on a personal note: this is the last time I shall attend a debate in the European Parliament as the representative of the Portuguese Presidency.
This is therefore a farewell and a farewell that cannot pass without an expression of recognition and gratitude for the support I have always received in this House from the President and from all the Members.
I have learned with you and I have learned through you how important this Parliament is in strengthening democracy in our Union and also, naturally, in strengthening the legality of the decisions that we take here with a view, obviously, to creating a freer and more prosperous Union for the citizens of Europe.
So thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
I should also, naturally, like to thank the Commissioners and the members of their staff, and the President of the Commission, who often participated with me in these debates and with whom I was able to establish much common ground in our work, objectives and efforts.
Thank you, Commission.
I should also, I am sure they will understand, like to thank the officials of the European Parliament and especially, if they will forgive me, my compatriots who work here.
Finally, and I hope I have not forgotten anyone, I should like to thank my interpreters, the Portuguese interpreters, of whom I am very proud.
I will end with the English expression: "I will miss you all" or, in Portuguese: "JÃ¡ sinto saudadesâ.
Thank you very much.
Obrigado, Mr President-in-Office.
We shall see each other again in Lisbon tomorrow, of course, and next week you will be here again to accompany the President of the Council, JosÃ© SÃ³crates, but since this was your last speech here in plenary, I should like to express our very sincere thanks to you and to reaffirm that our cooperation with you has been a great pleasure and, above all, a great success.
Thank you, Manuel Lobo Antunes.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you very much for this wide-ranging debate, which I think will provide valuable input to the meeting in Lisbon and to the summit in Brussels.
I would like to focus on a few areas that have been raised this morning, starting with the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter.
First of all, I think that the Portuguese Presidency, like the German Presidency before it, deserves great credit for getting us to this point.
The signature in Lisbon tomorrow will underline the commitment of all signatories to achieving ratification of the Treaty.
I would also like to use this opportunity to again thank the Parliament representatives for the important role that they have played in allowing the Union to solve its institutional difficulties.
Of course, the Commission has also actively engaged throughout this long procedure, not least through the Citizens' Agenda and the 'twin-track approach', which President Barroso referred to earlier on.
Do not forget, those of you who say that, after all, the Union works even without these changes, that there are a number of new elements in this Reform Treaty that will help us and explicitly allow us to tackle more effectively climate change and the whole energy challenge, as well as providing for more openness through public Council meetings and the increased role of national parliaments.
So I think it will also help us to become more transparent, more open and more democratic.
Whatever ratification procedure is decided by the different Member States, we all have an obligation to communicate with citizens.
Of course we will have to do that in partnership and also respecting the different needs and wishes expressed by Member States about this debate.
I think today's proclamation of the Charter is also symbolic of another important achievement of the negotiations, a symbol of the fact that - except for special arrangements in two of our Member States and as long as the Treaty enters into force - the Charter will be legally binding, guaranteeing the fundamental rights of Europe's citizens.
The second point I would like to comment on is the 'Reflection Group', because I think we must make sure that it focuses on the policy challenges of the future and not mainly on the institutions.
It needs to focus on the expectations of Europe's people, and I also hope that this group will be representative of the diversity of the Europe of today.
My third comment concerns migration.
I think that an integrated approach to migration involves a mix of European Union and national policies.
It requires coherence between our policies on legal and illegal migration.
It involves actions in development policies, social integration, freedom of movement, border security and visas, to name a few.
It is excellent that this Council will also be discussing these questions globally, but I think that Parliament can make a substantial contribution to this discussion.
The Lisbon Strategy, as the President said, is delivering, and I think this should be a cause for celebration on all sides of this House.
Equally, there is a consensus on the need for actions to address all aspects of sustainable development as part of the strategy.
This includes flexicurity, social inclusion and climate change.
If we can agree on the policy direction, we will be able to generate real political commitment to solve the real problems that have been mentioned by some of you.
Finally, let me also say, on the issue of Kosovo, mentioned by many in this House, that the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by a number of Members on the situation in Kosovo, and the European Union has done everything possible to reach a negotiated solution, but it is clear now that the status quo is unsustainable and that the UN Security Council will have to address this when it looks at it on 19 December.
The European Council will have to take stock of the situation, and it should reaffirm the European Union's commitment to solving Kosovo's status and to playing a leading role in implementing a settlement, the framework being, as many of you have mentioned, the European perspective for the whole region.
Finally, this Council, together with the signature of the Treaty and the proclamation of the Charter, does not, perhaps, draw a line under the events of 2005, but it marks the beginning of a new phase of the development of the European Union.
We have learnt the lessons of 2005, and I hope that we can enter the next 50 years of the Union with, hopefully, much more confidence.
That concludes this item.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, preparations for the EU's December summit in Brussels are taking place in a better atmosphere than was expected.
That is obviously due to the approval of the Reform Treaty and the prospect of its untroubled adoption in Lisbon.
The compromise reached in Poland -which consisted in maintaining the previous government's line on the Charter of Fundamental Rights so as not to endanger the whole treaty - has played its part.
It must be stressed, however, that the atmosphere created around the new treaty has exaggeratedly linked its adoption or non-adoption with the European Union's chances of survival.
Following enlargement in 2004 and the admission of Bulgaria and Romania - i.e. with 27 Member States - the Union functioned on the basis of the Treaty of Nice.
That it was functioning effectively was proved by the adoption of the Financial Perspective for 2007-13.
Admittedly, it was adopted with some difficulty, but agreement was reached about money, which seems to be the most difficult issue and is therefore a test of the usefulness of the existing institutional rules.
Despite this and other agreements, an impression of crisis in the EU was created artificially.
That in turn had repercussions in terms of the declining confidence of citizens in the European institutions and the advisability of further enlargement.
This dangerous spiral, halted to some extent in the second half of 2007, should serve as a lesson and a warning for the future.
in writing. - (RO) The signing of the new Treaty in the European Council of 13-14 December achieves a reform of the European institutions but, mainly, it increases the European citizens' power to state their opinion on the European legislation.
After the new Treaty is ratified, the Parliaments of the Member States will include the legislative proposals of the Commission into their own agenda, thus increasing the degree of democracy in the Union.
We would have wished a chapter of this treaty to be the very European Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Unfortunately, it is only an appendix of the Treaty, but the legal basis for making its provisions mandatory is thus created.
The six chapters of the Charter guarantee the right to dignity, freedom, solidarity, equality, justice and citizenship.
The adoption of its provisions will make impossible any future discrimination of European citizens on criteria of nationality, ethnicity, religion, age, gender, etc.
The Treaty also offers the Union the possibility to promote the fight against climate changes at an international level and guarantees adequate social protection to all its citizens.
The Union is not based only on economic criteria.
We have to build a Social Europe, based upon solidarity, economic, social and territorial cohesion.
The adoption of the new Treaty requires unanimity in the Council and its ratification by all signatory States by June 2009.

- Report: Pedro Gueirrero
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (PT) I should like to begin this short statement by welcoming the decision by the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries to produce a report on the Common Organisation of the Markets in fisheries and aquaculture products.
It is known and recognised that this COM has still not realised the objectives for which it was created, namely to ensure stable markets for fisheries products and to secure a fair income for producers.
That being so, we appreciate the European Commission's albeit tardy decision to undertake an in-depth evaluation of the existing COM and call on it to carry out its urgent revision in order to boost its contribution to guaranteeing incomes in the sector, ensuring market stability, improving the marketing of fisheries products and increasing the value-added generated, notably by a significant increase in financial resources.
Despite the fact that some of our initial proposals did not obtain the necessary consensus in the Committee on Fisheries, we consider that the report now put to the vote contains valuable measures, such as measures to determine whether the existing intervention mechanisms are the most suitable ones and whether they are sufficiently flexible to meet the relevant needs in the various Member States; to introduce a compensatory payment for sardines like the one already existing for tuna; to meet the need for the Structural Funds to contribute to the modernisation and creation of support infrastructures for producers in the context of production/marketing; to provide genuine support for the creation and funding of producers' organisations and above all for small-scale coastal and traditional fisheries; to ensure the application to imported fisheries products sold on the internal market of the same rules and requirements as those applied to Community fisheries products.
These are matters which, though they may not mean much to some Members, are most important for fishermen.

(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on Amendment 27:
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the basis of Rule 151(3), you, as President, can decide on the admissibility of paragraph 6, on which we are about to vote.
That recital states that terrorism can no longer be eradicated.
Can this House really make it official that terrorism cannot be eradicated?
I feel that there must either be a translation error in some texts, or a very serious political misjudgement, and for those reasons I ask you, Madam President, to decide on the admissibility of that paragraph.
Ms Muscardini, all the admissibility checks have been done by the services, and it was open to amendments, so I am afraid we are where we are now.
- Before the vote on Amendment 33:
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask whether the proposer of the amendment would agree to remove the two phrases which currently read: 'in some rare instances' and 'which may not be lawful' from the sentence.

Proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
Mr President of the European Council, JosÃ© SÃ³crates, Mr President of the European Commission, JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to welcome you here to the heart of European democracy, to the European Parliament, today on the occasion of the formal signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
This is indeed a happy day, particularly for the citizens of the European Union.
Fifty years after the founding fathers created the European Communities out of the ruins of a shattered continent, our intention today is to proclaim solemnly the common values that form the core of our European identity.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights that we proclaim today symbolises the momentous journey towards a Union of the people of Europe which we have been making together over the past fifty years.
This Charter is proof that, when we laid the foundations of the European Union, we had learned the most important lesson from European history, and today we continue to regard respect for the dignity of each and every human being, preservation of the freedom that has been won and of peace and democracy and application of the rule of law as the driving forces of European unification.
Freedom cannot develop without respect for the rights of others, and peace cannot flourish without fair accommodation of each other's interests.
Freedom, peace, justice and social welfare are achievable only as an integral whole; none of these goals can be obtained at the expense of the others.
The founding fathers understood this and established Europe as a community based on the rule of law.
The European Union is not governed by the concept that might is right but by the principle that power emanates from the law.
Therein lies the true modernity and vision of our Union, a community rooted in shared values.
Only true justice can guarantee peace for all of us.
This vision of the founding fathers has come to fruition.
Far more than that, in the struggle between two systems, in which freedom and democracy were pitted against dictatorship and oppression of the individual, it proved to be the stronger and the more successful vision.
The miracle of our generation has been the end to the division of our continent.
The fall of the Iron Curtain and the accession of twelve countries to the European Union were possible because the voice of freedom and democracy and the power of equal rights for all were stronger than those of inhuman ideologies in the twentieth century.
The Berlin Declaration, which was adopted on 25 March of this year to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome, states an important fact when it says that 'We, the citizens of the European Union, have united for the better', for it is indeed our good fortune that freedom, democracy and human rights have become a reality for all of us in the European Union.
Today's solemn proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights gives us a great obligation and opportunity to bring home the real essence of European unification to the people of the European Union, who number almost 500 million, and to future generations.
The essence of the European Union, ladies and gentlemen, transcends economic cost-benefit calculations.
While these are important and will continue to influence our lives in the EU, we are first and foremost a community based on shared values, and solidarity, freedom and equal rights are part and parcel of our everyday existence.
These common values, central to which is respect for inviolable human dignity, as enshrined in Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, form the foundations of European unification.
(Applause)
For this reason, the European Parliament has regarded legally binding recognition of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a vital component of any agreement on the reform of the European treaties, and the European Parliament has got its way on this point.
The reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 6 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which the Heads of State or Government will be signing tomorrow, lends the Charter the same legally binding character that the Treaties themselves possess.
That 21st-century Europe should possess a comprehensive catalogue of human rights and fundamental freedoms which are equally binding and legally enforceable for all citizens of the Union is perfectly natural; more than that, it is the very core of our perception of the European identity.
(Applause)
People and human dignity are at the heart of our policies.
In this way the European Union constitutes a framework that enables us, as citizens of the Union, to build our common future in peace.
Without the firm foundations of our shared values, of which we must be ever mindful, the European Union would have no future.
Nor would we have any grounds to insist on respect for human rights in the wider world if we failed to recognise our own values as legally binding in the European Union.
(Applause)
Nor shall we let anyone, whether inside or outside the European Union, set limits on our resolute defence of human rights.
We in the European Parliament have a moral and political duty to defend human dignity at all times.
(Applause)
In our world of today, we Europeans must project ourselves as a community united by shared values and stand up for human dignity, and we must seek intercultural dialogue.
We can do that with confidence, and we must do it with untiring commitment - and no one will stop us.
(Applause)
In the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the new open and democratic convention method was used for the first time in the history of European unification.
That method proved highly successful, and the convention became the model and the starting point for the entire reform process.
The European Parliament has played a particularly active part in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and has brought decisive influence to bear on the substance of the text.
The Charter is the first instrument to enshrine economic and social rights with the same status as political rights and personal freedoms.
It protects fundamental rights within the sphere of activity of the Union and in the application of Community law.
It also gives all citizens of the European Union a right of recourse to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
We hope that the day might come when the Charter of Fundamental Rights is legally binding on all Member States.
(Applause)
Human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible.
I therefore appeal to all Member States of the European Union without exception to subscribe, in the interests of all citizens of the Union, to this European consensus.
Today's solemn proclamation should also be an occasion for all European citizens who can assert their own rights on the basis of the Charter to reflect on their duty to the community of Europeans, the wider world and future generations.
There are no rights without responsibilities.
Solidarity is what unites us.
(Applause)
We are creating a people's Europe and giving our European Union a solid foundation of common fundamental democratic rights.
Today's solemn proclamation shows that our community based on shared values is alive and growing.
Today that set of common values will be embedded in the lives and minds of the population of the Union.
This day is a great triumph for the citizens of the European Union, and all of us can rejoice at that with heart and soul.
(Loud applause)
(Uproar in the Chamber)
(Several Members protest loudly and display banners and placards.)
Please remove these placards now.
Show some courtesy to our guest here in the European Parliament.
Mr President of the European Council, may I now ask you to address us.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President of the European Parliament, President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen.
Today, in a solemn sitting of the European Parliament, we are proclaiming the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and I should like to state clearly to you that this day - 12 December - will now be a fundamental date in the history of European integration.
A fundamental date in the history of Europe.
(Applause)
(Uproar in the NI and IND/DEM ranks)
Be patient, please.
You should at least have the decency to let our speaker deliver his address.
Mr President, the floor is yours.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) However much some may shout to try to stop others from speaking, this is a fundamental date in the history of Europe.
And I want to say to you too that this date, this ceremony, is probably the most important ceremony in which I have had the honour of participating. The most important ceremony of my entire political career.
I feel deeply honoured as a European to sign a Charter and to proclaim a Charter of Fundamental Rights and I feel particularly honoured that this Charter is being proclaimed during the Portuguese Presidency.
I feel honoured as a European and I feel honoured as a Portuguese citizen, especially as it was during our Presidency in 2000 that the Convention which gave rise to this Charter started its work.
That is why I want to say to the European Parliament that it is an honour for my country to be associated in this way with an important step in the project of European citizenship.
This Charter represents a commitment to values that gave birth to European civilisation, values anchored in the defence of human dignity, and we are here to proclaim that we are true to those values, values that have their source in the constitutional tradition common to the Member States of the Union and also in international legal instruments, as in the case of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.
And to emphasise this compatibility, the Treaty of Lisbon itself provides for the Union to accede to the Council of Europe Convention and thus recognises what the protection of fundamental rights now represents in modern democracies.
This is why today is a such an exceptional day because from today on, though some may not like it, fundamental rights will be formally and irreversibly established as part of the Union's common heritage, a moral heritage, a political heritage, a heritage of citizenship and of the best aspects of European civilization.
But this Charter is also an instrument for political action, an instrument for the institutions because the Charter will shape their activities.
They will be duty bound to respect the rights and principles set out in the Charter and promote the application of those rights and principles, but it is also an instrument for action by the citizens because it shows that the project of the Union is a project of citizenship and it shows that the Union is at the service of its citizens and that it protects and promotes their rights.
The Charter embodies, in the European context, the projection of human dignity and the rule of social rights.
This is why it also has a social component, because it projects human dignity in the world of work, in the world of employment, in the world of health, in the field of social security and welfare, and also human dignity with regard to protection of the environment.
It is the Charter of equality and solidarity, the Charter of the battle against discrimination of any kind, and it is a Charter for equality because it enshrines a special attention, the special attention that we pay to children and young people, to equality between men and women, to the role of old people, and to the substantial issues of protecting personal rights and personal data.
I must also draw attention to the freedoms that are enshrined in the Charter, the freedoms connected with European citizenship and the political rights associated with it, and the economic freedoms based on the Treaty of Rome, whose 50th anniversary we are celebrating this year.
We are therefore true to our tradition and we repeat the ban on the death penalty, and I especially welcome the decision taken by the Council last week to mark the European Day against the Death Penalty.
Finally, I should like to point out that the Charter covers the rights of citizens and the rights of people, addressing a body that extends beyond the actual citizens of the Member States, and this is no less important because it represents, as of today, a fundamental element in our conviction that a better world is a world in which these rights and freedoms are universally respected.
This Charter, as of today, will be at the service of the external policy of the European Union which aims to establish a world in which all these rights and freedoms are universally respected and guaranteed.
It will therefore act as a pointer, a pointer to the position of the European Union on the international stage and in any action that is proposed to secure global respect for fundamental rights.
This is why the citizens of Europe can, in this way, recognise themselves in a Union that is their Union.
They can recognise the rights that the Union guarantees them and realise that Europe is a project of peace and democracy, a project in which the rights of the individual are fully respected.
It is our moral authority and it is the sentiment of this ceremony that unites the three institutions.
We are proclaiming this Charter on the eve of the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon, a Charter which has the legal status of a basic law and a legal status which is equal to that of the Treaties, for the benefit of many and to the displeasure of some.
This Charter is in the Treaty.
(Standing ovation)
(Renewed uproar in the NI and IND/DEM ranks)
You should at least have the decency to let our guest finish speaking.
Loudness is not an argument.
Leave the Chamber!
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) In this globalised world, in which many claim that economic and financial rules are absolute, the fact that twenty-seven European States are reiterating in the context of the Union this firm commitment to values and objectives designed to protect and safeguard fundamental rights is a signal contribution to the regulation of globalisation itself.
Fundamental rights are a common tradition of democratic states under the rule of law, ways of limiting the power of the authorities and fundamental instruments for the protection of the individual.
In binding the institutions and states of the Union, the Charter limits the power of the authorities in the name of protecting the interests of the citizens and their organisations.
And in formalising this limitation on the power of the authorities, the limits on its application will strictly observe the principle of subsidiarity and strengthen the eminently democratic nature of the Union itself.
The defence of fundamental rights is clearly a value that is essential to the European identity, that is part of our genetic code, an element that structures the whole European project and enables Europe to be defined as a Union of values, and the unconditional affirmation of these values is what the world expects of Europe.
This is the Europe I want to belong to, a Europe that defends these values.
And we are well aware, I and all the Members, that the battle for fundamental rights is a daily task and probably an endless task, a task for states, a task for civil societies, a task for industrial undertakings and trade unions, a task for each and every citizen.
That is why, in proclaiming the Charter, we rejoice in the agreement reached on the Charter, in the recognition of its legal value on an equal footing with the very Treaties establishing the Union.
But in addition to marking a day for rejoicing, the proclamation of this Charter represents an agreement by the institutions of the Union to be respected and applied daily in its actions.
Only in this way will we live up to Europe's history, only in this way will we be worthy heirs of the best features of our collective identity and our common tradition: a collective identity and a common tradition that do honour to a Europe that fights for the rights, the freedoms and the guarantees of its citizens.
I thank you all.
(Renewed standing ovation, with the exception of the GUE/NGL, the NI and the IND/DEM)
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to convey some information to you, and I ask you to provide now for the necessary calm.
The King of Jordan is in the European Parliament and will address us immediately after the solemn proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Please ensure, not least out of consideration for our guest from Jordan, that we have no more interruptions so that we can complete this proclamation in a dignified manner.
President of the Commission. - (PT) Mr President of the European Parliament, Prime Minister of Portugal and President of the Council of the European Union, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Presidents of the three political institutions of the European Union - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - are signing here, in Strasbourg, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It is, for me, a great personal honour to participate in an act of such high significance.
The proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights enshrines a culture of law in Europe.
In the European Union, which is above all a community under the rule of law, institutional changes require the reinforcement of respect for fundamental rights.
Honourable Members, today the three European institutions reaffirm their commitment - the commitment they made in December 2000 when the Charter was proclaimed for the first time.
But, seven years later, we go a crucial step further.
The Charter of 2000 was not legally binding.
With tomorrow's signing of the Treaty of Lisbon, and then ratification, the Charter will be part of the Union's primary law and will have the same legal value as the Treaties themselves.
This progress will have very concrete benefits for European citizens.
Let me illustrate this point by looking briefly at the content of the Charter.
The 54 articles cover rights that until now had to be recognised by the Court of Justice on a case-by-case basis.
Now they are brought together.
The Charter, recognising the basic principles of human dignity, incorporates first of all the classic civil liberties already included in the European Convention on Human Rights: freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, equality before the law and the principle of non-discrimination.
The Charter also confirms economic and social rights.
It includes the right to property and the freedom to conduct business, but, at the same time, the rights of workers and of social partners, and it enshrines topics such as social security and social assistance.
The Charter also covers the new challenges facing society today.
It therefore includes guarantees on data protection, on bioethics and on good administration, known as 'third-generation rights'.
These will be highly relevant in many of our areas of activity, be it in research policy, in the area of freedom, security and justice or in our permanent quest for good governance.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will help to anchor the European Union within a genuine culture of fundamental rights.
By signing the Charter today, we - the Presidents of the Union's three political institutions - are undertaking, as a priority, to respect those rights in all that we do.
That commitment might, on the face of it, seem easy to uphold, but in reality it will be an ongoing challenge to ensure that civil liberties are fully respected in all EU policies, whether in legislating for the internal market, managing immigration or endeavouring to combat terrorism.
The Charter is the first legally binding document ever produced at international level which brings together in a single text not only civil and political rights but also economic and social rights, making them all subject to the same system of legal supervision.
It is undoubtedly a major achievement and one that the European Union should be proud of.
It is, I believe, particularly significant that this should be possible now in the new enlarged Europe, a Europe formerly divided by totalitarian and authoritarian regimes which disregarded human rights, whereas the Europe that we have today is a Europe united around the values of freedom and solidarity.
(Applause)
If we work together to promote the culture of human rights, we shall make a crucial contribution to achieving a Europe genuinely rooted in values - tangible values that are credible in the eyes of ordinary people.
Strengthened by the Charter, Europe has become more determined to promote its values at world level.
Ever since the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Europe has led the way in the fight for basic rights.
From now on it will be better equipped to pursue that fight successfully in the interests of freedom, peace and democracy.
(Standing ovation)
(Several Members loudly voice their opposition, waving flags and banners and chanting: 'Referendum!')
(The President of the House, JosÃ© SÃ³crates and JosÃ© Manuel Barroso proceed to sign the Charter of Fundamental Rights)
Formal sitting - Jordan
Honourable Members, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a particular honour for the European Parliament to welcome to Strasbourg today His Majesty Abdullah II, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
We bid Your Majesty a warm welcome to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
I also welcome the high-ranking delegation accompanying King Abdullah, particularly the Speakers of both Houses of the Jordanian Parliament.
(Applause)
Today's visit by the King of Jordan is the third since 2002, when His Majesty first addressed the European Parliament.
In November 2004 the King visited the Conference of Presidents in Brussels.
His visit and his speech in the European Parliament today are both a sign of the strong partnership between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the European Parliament and an encouraging signal for our common future in the Mediterranean region.
Your Majesty, I had prepared a far longer speech, but since we had to ask you to wait for a while, I shall cut my speech short and simply say that it is wonderful to have you here with us, and it now gives me great pleasure to invite you to address us.
(Applause)
King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. - Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim, Mr President, Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your warm welcome and, on behalf of the people of Jordan, I am honoured to come before this distinguished institution again.
My friends, a changing Europe and a changing Middle East are here today.
A Europe of expanding membership and a visionary mission: for cooperation across borders and growth without barriers.
A Middle East of new horizons and growing hope: for peace among neighbours, opportunities for our people and a future for our youth.
These trends do not take place in isolation.
The achievement of the hopes of our regions will advance stability and create new possibilities for security and prosperity worldwide.
It is deeply in our interest to succeed.
And a critical opportunity is before us.
Two weeks ago, with the support of the European Union and nations from both our regions, Israelis and Palestinians met at Annapolis.
They pledged all-out negotiations toward a peace treaty in 2008 and immediate steps to implement their obligations under the Road Map.
For the first time in years, we see movement towards a permanent settlement and an independent, sovereign, viable Palestinian state.
(Applause)
This progress is the work of many friends of peace, including leaders in Europe and the Arab states.
We believed that, after years of worsening crisis, a change of strategy was required.
We urged a new commitment to the two-state goal and a targeted process that could achieve it - with tight timelines, measurable requirements and milestones for action.
Second chances are rare, but I believe we have come to one.
Very real challenges lie ahead, but Annapolis has created a new spark of hope.
We can and must fan that spark into a blaze of confidence, action and tangible results.
As our near neighbour, Europe shares our interest in solving this, the central crisis of our age.
All sides respect Europe's neutral role and model of regional progress and peace.
For years, you have been our partner in the search for solutions.
And you will be our partner, too, in the benefits of success: a vibrant zone of peace and prosperity throughout our shared hemisphere.
These realities give Europe an important and prominent role in the future of peace.
I speak especially of the European Union, and you, the voices of Europe, here in the European Parliament.
And I have come here today to urge your active engagement, to seek your specific, practical skills and investment in the future, and to offer Jordan's own commitment in the days of work that lie ahead.
My friends, there are major areas where action must begin now.
The first is to support the negotiations and their goal: a final settlement creating an end to conflict, security for both Palestine and Israel, and at long last, a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state.
(Applause)
We must not underestimate the difficult days ahead.
The issues are complex and decades old.
Real grievances must be faced - and left behind.
On the positive side, Israelis and Palestinians understand their deep, shared stake in ending the conflict.
And a great amount of work has already been done.
From Oslo, through the Road Map, through the Geneva Accords, and other initiatives, the parameters of the solutions are in focus.
I believe the parties can get to the endgame.
But for this to happen, it is vital that the international community be engaged.
Europe has a unique experience of the mechanisms and process of post-conflict recovery and reconciliation.
This includes creating a security framework that can offer assurance to both sides.
European peacekeeping forces have played a constructive role in Lebanon.
Your commitment can help bring great trust to a Palestinian-Israeli settlement.
On the ground, there is a need, not only for resources but for partnership - to boost economic opportunities, create confidence that the political process works, and help create the conditions that will sustain peace.
Both Palestinians and Israelis need to see tangible results, and quickly.
That means security from violence and an end to occupation; but it also means better conditions of life.
In the occupied territories, the humanitarian situation for Palestinians remains dire.
People need access to jobs and education, effective public services and more.
Such action will provide a major infusion of hope and be a powerful counter-argument to extremist predictions that nothing can change.
Next week, donor nations and institutions will meet in Paris to make commitments and plan the way forward.
European nations and the European Union are already providing help, a commitment respected by people throughout the region.
A second and related imperative is to understand and articulate the potential of peace.
We must begin now to re-envision the future: a region where conflict has given way to cooperation, where a regional economy brings together the capabilities and resources of 22 countries - more than 300 million people, from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean - and where cross-border partnerships advance development, health, the environment and more.
It is a future that empowers people to be full participants in global progress.
And it will unleash a new scope of partnership with our European neighbours, in science, technology and trade.
This promising future is why we must move swiftly on a comprehensive settlement, with action on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
Indeed, the entire Arab world has recognized the importance of moving forward.
The Arab peace initiative was affirmed, unanimously, last spring.
And it has received the support of Muslim countries beyond the region.
The opportunity is here, at long last, for a sovereign, independent, and viable Palestinian state and full, normal relations between Israel and 57 Arab and Muslim nations.
This means acceptance; acceptance by key countries, with billions of citizens, representing almost a third of the membership of the United Nations.
And that opens a shared future of security, peace and new partnerships.
Achieving such a peace will also make a substantial impact on other issues.
Within the region, it will create new strategic space, allowing the resolution of other serious issues, from poverty to proliferation.
Aggressive forces will no longer be able to exploit the Palestinian cause to serve their own ambitions and interests.
(Applause)
Resources and attention will be freed to advance the region's potential through development and reform.
We in Jordan are ready to meet that future.
We have pressed forward with our reform programme, despite regional instability.
In the last decade, we have achieved significant gains: strong economic growth, rising per capita incomes, and a model education system.
And Europe has been an important partner, through private-sector investments, as well as official assistance.
Allow me to say that we deeply appreciate the support and friendship of this Parliament and the European Union.
(Applause)
And we believe that in the days after peace, our partnership can only soar higher.
My friends, today we can think of a larger neighbourhood, one that stretches from north of the Baltic Sea to south of the Mediterranean, one that is shared by Europe and the Middle East.
It is the basis of the Euromed partnership, our region-to-region platform for cooperation and development.
It is a relationship with great shared interests and unlimited potential.
And it is up to us to develop our partnership to its fullest.
Today, young Europeans are coming to adulthood who never knew a divided Europe.
Their young counterparts, Palestinian and Israeli, have no such positive experience.
They have grown up in a world of division and conflict.
Now, together, we have an opportunity to remove the barriers to their future, and leave the past behind.
Today, the European Parliament represents significantly more Member States than when I spoke before Parliament only five years ago.
That is the result of a region-wide commitment to increase the zone of partnership and progress.
The Middle East is tackling the same important task.
Now, together, we can help that work succeed.
Today, a renewed peace process has begun.
We have seen such beginnings fail in the past.
But this time, a unique confluence of events has created new openings for success.
Now, together, we can and we must, fulfil the promise of peace.
(Applause)
My friends, we in Jordan know that when an olive tree takes life, planting is only the first step.
A hundred processes are then activated to create the cells and structures of life.
Roots emerge, growth occurs, and a core of strength ensures survival.
From outside comes water and support to sustain life and create new fruit.
In the arena of the Middle East, a new olive branch has just been planted.
Now the real work must begin.
It is in our hands to create the process and structures that will give peace roots, help it grow and sustain it into the future.
I urge you to share in this effort.
Our partnership can create an historic transformation and a rich harvest - years of peace and prosperity that will benefit our peoples and our world.
(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)
Your Majesty, we thank you for your visit to the European Parliament.
We thank you for this great speech.
We are all - and the applause showed this - deeply touched by your convictions.
There are few personalities, few leaders, who are as committed as you to peace in the Middle East.
You call us friends, and I say to you, on behalf of the European Parliament: We are at your side to create a Palestinian State that can live in safety...
(Applause)
... and to have a State of Israel that can live in safety.
We in the European Parliament believe in the dignity of the human being, and the dignity of the human being applies to each human being in this world.
(Applause)
Your Majesty, we want close cooperation with your country and you are one of the very few who have visited the European Parliament more than once.
We in the European Parliament and the European Union want a strong partnership, relationship and, if possible, friendship with all countries in the Middle East.
We are at your side.
Let us work together.
Shukran jazilan.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in consideration of the formal sitting with the King of Jordan, all my fellow chairs of the political groups have no doubt been unable to take the opportunity to make a statement under our Rules of Procedure about the preceding occurrences.
I should like to do that now.
I believe I speak on behalf of many Members when I express my thanks first of all to the President of this House, to Mr Barroso and to Mr SÃ³crates for the dignified way in which they defended this solemn act, the signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
They had the overwhelming majority of this House behind them.
(Applause)
There are, however, two things I wish to say to the House, and I say them entirely in a personal capacity and not on behalf of my group. I speak for myself.
I should like to draw the attention of the House to a matter to which I am privy as chair of a political group.
It is not normal practice to report on the deliberations of the Conference of Presidents, but you should certainly know, ladies and gentlemen, that the only group chairman who asked at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents for an invitation to attend the formal signing of the Treaty in Lisbon was Mr Bonde.
I believe the House should know that.
No other group chair made that request.
Mr Bonde, who makes such a racket here, was determined to be there at the signing of the Treaty.
These are the kind of double standards we have to live with here.
Another comment I wish to make is that I learned at grammar school in Germany about the way in which the tactic of collective chanting was used to shout down political opponents in the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic.
The political group that introduced the practice was the one led by Adolf Hitler.
Today's occurrences reminded me of that.
Thank you.
(Loud applause)
(FR) I shall be quite brief.
I too was extremely shocked earlier today.
This is a debating chamber where democracy rules, and there is no need for a carry-on such as we witnessed this morning for the benefit of the TV cameras.
Communication is something to which all of us here are entitled.
To those responsible for this morning's commotion in a chamber dedicated to democracy and freedom, I would simply say that they behaved disgracefully.
We will discuss it again this afternoon in the Conference of Presidents, with a view to preventing any deterioration of the situation.
(Loud applause)
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express - both in a personal capacity and I hope, given what we witnessed, on behalf of my entire group - the strongest possible condemnation of the disgraceful, chauvinist, anti-European demonstration that was staged here earlier today.
(Applause)
My group is certainly in favour of a referendum on the new treaty and it has questions and misgivings about certain articles of the Charter.
But all that is quite unrelated to what took place here this morning and it is important that there should be no confusion.
For our part, we support a Community of values, we support the promotion of fundamental rights, we support a Europe of democracy and there is no place in our vision for chauvinism and bad behaviour!
(Loud applause)
Madam President, on a point of order, I wish to make a formal request to safeguard the dignity of our House.
The behaviour of certain Members of this House in shouting down representatives of Parliament, the Commission and the Council during the signing ceremony was intolerable and must not be tolerated.
It brings the worst of the football stadium into Europe's highest Chamber and recalls the actions of the Communists in the Russian Diet and the National Socialists in the German Reichstag.
(Applause)
My formal request, Madam President, is this: my group demands that in future the Presidency use the powers granted to it under our Rules of Procedure to evict from the Chamber Members behaving in that fashion.
(Loud applause)
(FR) Ladies and gentlemen, I think I need hardly add that we, like all our colleagues, were quite appalled by the demonstration earlier.
I would say this, however: 'Do not over-dramatise!
There may be 50 nutcases in the chamber but there are 700 Members who oppose them, so do not inflate the fact that 50 lame-brains disrupted the signing ceremony into an affair of state.
Let us calm down and, Graham, let us not insist that those responsible be thrown out.
In my view, a free Parliament is a Parliament that can tolerate a few nutcases, irksome though they might be.
(Applause)
Madam President, on behalf of my own Group, whilst we all welcome the opportunity of a robust engagement, which should be allowed within any parliamentary assembly, what happened this morning went beyond what should be allowed to take place in any democratic institution.
However, rather than prolong this argument, could we please get on with the vote and get to our lunch as soon as possible as well.
Madam President, I was attacked personally by Mr Schulz; therefore, I think we should go to the vote.
I took part in a peaceful manifestation against a celebration of a Charter which was part of a Constitution where I cannot even get the consolidated text and see the relevance and the meaning, and you cannot either.
What you are going to sign tomorrow is a Treaty none of you has read it, simply because it is not possible to read it.
You take over our voting time to celebrate a victory over democracy, and, therefore, I will not attack my colleagues, but I have to say to Mr Schulz that I did not take part in a crime.
I understand it entirely, but we have a different tradition in Denmark, so I was there with my T-shirt, calling for a referendum, and I think all of us should call for a referendum.
This is the democratic norm you are defending.
(BG) I am taking the floor pursuant to that provision of the rules which gives me the right to personal explanation because Mr. Cohn-Bendit insulted people in this hall.
These are personal insults for which, Mr. Cohn-Bendit, you have no right to hide behind your parliamentary immunity.
Say that you relinquish your immunity and then insult Members of Parliament!
As to what happened here, it is only the freedom of expression which every Member of this Parliament has.
I would like to address Mr. Daul.
Mr. Daul, if you want Members of Parliament to be forcibly taken out of this hall, aren't you like Hitler who did exactly the same in the German Reichstag?
The greatest democracy is direct democracy.
And we raised our voice, we exercised out right to free expression, to direct democracy rather than circumvent the European nations as you did.
What is going on here is the dictatorship of the new proletariat taking shape in the new Union.
Which, this time, is not Soviet but European.
(FR) Madam President, my name was cited in the call for the lifting of parliamentary immunity and expulsion from the Chamber.
May I suggest, ladies and gentlemen, that you begin by getting Members' names right before you address the House.
I am now going to move to the vote, but I would just make one comment before I do so.
On 29 November 2007 this House approved the Charter of Fundamental Rights by 534 votes to 85, with 21 abstentions.

(DE) Madam President, today we finally saw the introduction of a transitional period for existing nutritional and health claims on the labels of food intended for children.
The Commission had forgotten that and tried to leave Parliament holding the baby.
We have prevented it from doing so.
We have compelled the Commission to make a statement acknowledging the need to introduce transitional periods for claims relating to children's health and development too.
The only problem, however, is that the Commission's long-standing refusal to present a proposal to this effect has distorted competition.
Products have already been taken off the market because the Regulation has entered into force in the meantime.
It has been a seriously botched job on the part of the Commission.
In addition, I tabled a motion on behalf of my group for the deletion of Article 4.
That was a political demonstration.
We stand by our opinion that this Regulation is senseless.
It is not possible to produce nutrient profiles for all foodstuffs.
Almost half of the Members of this House share that view.
EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, has now stated that it cannot see itself being able to provide nutrient profiles for all products.
Nonsensical red tape - a superfluous piece of legislation!
(FI) Madam President, I think it is very important that we should try and have health claims on products, but it is right that we need to ensure that they are true and based on knowledge.
It is not appropriate for a company to produce the research and 'commercial arguments' itself, as if that were enough to win the arguments about health.
In other words, the research and knowledge must be found to be proper and correct and therefore reliable.
It is very important to ensure that nutrition and health claims are correct and that this would also enable someone to switch to a healthier diet.
This is especially important with children and young people because we know the serious problems which there are at present in Europe with obesity, type II diabetes and other related conditions.
We need to make sure that the nutritional value is good and that the health claims are true.
(CS) Madam President, I voted against the report on the liberalisation of the secondary market in spare parts.
It is an inconsistent strategy.
On the one hand we insist that the industry develop cars that are increasingly safe and we combat industrial piracy.
However, in contradiction to this Parliament has today legalised the production of copies of spare parts, which allegedly makes them cheaper.
Consumers, however, will not be guaranteed an uncompromised standard of safety in the repaired vehicle.
Liberalisation supporters, mainly from the UK, affirm that SMEs will benefit from this policy.
The majority of cheap copies of patent spare parts today, however, are produced in Asia, not in Europe.
In spite of this, in the 10 Member States where design has not been protected to date, the cost of spare parts is 7% higher than in the remaining 17.
The latter continue to protect design like Japan and other major car industry leaders.
I would like to draw attention to the fact that in the case of an accident both car users and pedestrians will be now be more at risk because of non-original spare parts of a lower quality.
This directive is unfortunately an example of inconsistent EU strategy.
(CS) Madam President, I would also like to express my disagreement with limiting legal protection of industrial design for spare parts.
We are witnessing an unprecedented level of interference in the area of industrial rights.
If there are abuses of monopolies by industrial rights owners, ordinary legal instruments such as licence requirements can be applied.
The creation of an industrial design incurs significant costs, which is why legal protection is pertinent from an economic point of view, too.
Its abolition will not lead to liberalisation of the spare parts market as expected by the Commission, but in all likelihood to an increase in the price of the end product.
The foreseeable reaction of producers to the presence of independent producers in the spare parts market will be to offset their losses through higher prices.
It is also of concern that the lower cost of independent producers' spare parts will result in lower levels of safety and quality.
What troubles me is that in the final analyses it will be the customer who will be placed at risk.
(DE) Madam President, I wish to say that I voted for the Castiglione report and that I believe it to be a very balanced report, particularly if we consider the way it started out, with 800 amendments tabled in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
The efforts of both the rapporteur and numerous Members have undoubtedly borne fruit in a sector beset with severe difficulties; it is absolutely essential that we give winegrowers the prospect of better times ahead.
I believe this report lays the foundations for progress, and I hope that the European Commission, acting in the spirit of the new Treaties, will take due account - full account, if at all possible - of the decisions of the European Parliament.
(EN) Madam President, today's vote on the reform of the wine market is a resounding success for the European Parliament and for the various vine-growing regions and wine producers.
For example, we were able to ensure that it will remain permissible to enrich wines with sucrose.
Parliament also rejected the Commission's plans to enact provisions at this stage prescribing the lifting of the ban on new planting in 2014.
In this case we proposed a practicable solution whereby the decision on liberalisation would not be taken until a study had been presented in 2012.
With regard to the labelling of individual wines, we also reached an agreement that takes due account of the various designation systems used in Europe.
We succeeded, moreover, in incorporating a safeguard into the wine-market regulations which protects the Bocksbeutel, the specially shaped bottles used in my home region of Franconia.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have presented a very balanced framework today which will be a good basis for the forthcoming negotiations in the Council.
The ball is now in the Council's court; we in Parliament have performed our task and performed it very well.
(PL) Madam President, I am delighted that the European Parliament has supported the Committee on Agriculture's proposal, and especially the Polish Members' amendment authorising the use of sales designations such as 'fruit wine', 'apple wine' or 'currant wine'.
Such wines have been produced in my country since the 13th century - for almost 800 years - and I am pleased that the European Parliament has recognised the reality and the fact.
In conclusion, I would congratulate the President on her excellent conduct of the proceedings, especially in today's heated - sometimes over-heated - atmosphere.
Madam President, I pay tribute to you as a true representative of the British school of parliamentary behaviour.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the vote on the common organisation of the market in wine, I should like to point out that I voted for Amendment 294, tabled by Mr Lavarra of the PSE and of which I am co-signatory, because I consider that consumers have the right to know whether saccharose has been added to the wine they are drinking and because product traceability is now a general principle advocated by the Union and I do not see why it should not be applied in the wine sector.
For the same reason, I voted for Amendment 310, tabled by the UEN Group; neither has an impact on the compromise that Mr Castiglione has worked so hard to achieve.
Lastly, as to the differing line that I have taken on these issues with respect to the Group to which I belong, citizens' interests mean that the only political stance which I feel I have to obey is one of accepting any proposal which protects those interests, whatever the Group from which it comes.
(LT) The Commission's position on the Council regulation on the Common Market Organisation for Wine discriminates against certain countries, especially the new Member States.
The project to promote EU wines in third countries is intended to boost trade, but for some reason it happens to be linked to the areas of previously exploited vineyards and data on average wine production over the last three years.
The Commission intends to support wine exports and certain labels.
Producers and exporters in the countries supported would benefit from competitive advantage.
The fact that wine producers in Lithuania and some other countries with no vineyards are not receiving any support is unacceptable.
I voted against the report.
(CS) I supported the reform of the wine market, which will improve the quality and competitiveness of European wines.
This primarily concerns Italy, where illegal vineyards should be grubbed-up and subsidies for overproduction of poor-quality wines should be discontinued.
The reform, however, must not favour Southern producers over Northern ones.
I am categorically against any grubbing-up of vines in Moravia, where everything that is produced is used and where traditional wine production is of great importance both culturally and for tourism in the area.
I object to a ban on sugaring in Eastern Europe, including Moravia, unless wine acidification, practised in Southern countries, is also banned.
I do not understand why Moravian winegrowers should buy expensive must from Southern countries, only to replace a 200-year-old tradition of sugaring, thereby changing the traditional bouquet and taste of their quality wines.
This is contrary to the principles of competition in the internal market and I cannot but disagree with it.
I thank those colleagues who during voting time stood behind us and in doing so let common sense prevail.
The Commission will now have to conform.
(CS) We have seen the southern European states that have a strong viticulture sector defend tooth and nail their wine surpluses.
In the meantime, due to excessive subsidies, the low prices of surplus wine are pushing quality wines from other Member States out of the market.
I object to the fact that while the Commission treats the European wine industry leaders with kid gloves, countries like the Czech Republic are treated in a strict and even harsh manner.
How else can we interpret the proposal to maintain the frequent use of must in the southern parts of the EU, while banning the addition of sucrose.
I am therefore very pleased that Parliament approached the reform responsibly and brought to it an element of equal and just treatment.
By supporting the addition of sucrose, Parliament benefited the Czech Republic among other countries, demonstrating its impartiality and resistance to influences based on conflicting national interests.
I understand that a reform of the wine market is necessary.
I do not doubt the fundamental goals, rather the manner in which they are being achieved.
I highlight the importance of maintaining the principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination.
(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against Mr Castiglione's report like the other Members from the Czech Republic who belong to the Czech Civic Democratic Party (ODS).
A reform approached in this way will be of no benefit to Czech, Moravian or, for that matter, European wine-growing.
Instead of liberalisation and a reduction in regulation and the administrative burden, which would be of real help to the wine sector, there is a tendency towards more regulations, restrictions and orders.
Central planning has never shown to produce positive results; nor will it do so in the wine sector.
That is the reason why I did not support this report.
Madam President, my constituency of south-east England is the fastest-growing wine-producing region in Europe.
The consequence of climate change is that a greater acreage of England is now given over to viticulture than at any time since the reign of Henry II, during the last period of European warming.
Home Counties winegrowers have never looked to the EU for subsidy.
Kent and Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire are planted with commercially viable vineyards that stand or fall by the quality of their produce.
Yet their very success now threatens to count against them as they approach the limit of permissible commercial cultivation.
Having remained outside the European regulatory regime and having eschewed the handouts, they now find that they are to be regulated anyway.
Just as we do not ask Brussels for money, so we do not want Brussels restrictions.
All English wine-producers ask is to be left free to compete.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I gave a definite 'no' to a document further impaired by the adoption of various amendments which have made it worse, and in particular because of the introduction of sugaring which we had managed to stave off for years, taking the view that sugaring is no more than a way of making up for nature.
The majority of this House rejected must aid which, even though it is no more than a financial measure, would nevertheless have mitigated the damage brought about by allowing sugaring.
This is a victory for the countries of the North and a defeat for the countries of the Mediterranean area which have been unable to defend the highly vocational nature of their territories.
This CMO is detrimental to the quality and the typical and genuine nature of products, and damaging for wine growers, producers and consumers.
(ES) Madam President, I think that it has been very positive today, the fact that we have given a charter of rights to the alliance of civilisations which were supported in their time by President Zapatero and the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
I believe that this is a good start.
Moreover, I believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights which we have signed today enshrines the true nature of our civilisation and not the integrismo of those who came here today to oppose it, an attitude which is regrettable and violent.
It is also regrettable and violent when Islamic radicals adopt this same dogged adherence to ingrained traditions.
These two forms of radicalism, are what we need to eradicate in order to have peace and not terrorism.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out that I voted against, although in error I voted for - and I give official notification of that - the report on terrorism.
A hypocritical report, a report which shows the cowardly attitude of the Europe of institutions towards terrorism.
It does not even have the courage to call it by its name: Islamic terrorism.
Then, this House voted against an amendment tabled by myself and other UEN Members in which we called Europe's attention to Al-Qaeda's infiltration of the Maghreb.
We obviously tabled it a few days ago, and unfortunately yesterday's events proved us right beyond our most pessimistic forecasts.
The Islamic butchery of Al-Qaeda has hit the poor people of Algiers, and also causes the Islamic butchery of those people, who are probably themselves Islamic.
It is shameful that this is happening at Europe's door and this House throws out an amendment which calls for retaliatory action, because Europe cannot close its eyes to the threat on its doorstep.
(BG) I abstained in the vote on the resolution against terrorism because, of course, I do not support the development of terrorism but I cannot support such a document either, which, to my mind, only spreads further panic among European citizens and further contributes to the attainment of the ultimate goal of terrorism, i.e. terror itself.
Still, I was satisfied with the proposed amendments by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, which were adopted, stating that everything has to be treated from the cause, as the ancient proverb goes that each illness has to be treated from the cause.
Therefore, if, for instance, we fail to exert pressure on Israel to stop its segregationist policy and the building of its wall separating the Arabs and depriving them of basic human rights they have, we shall contribute much more to the fight against terrorism than we could by tapping telephones and organizing surveillance of web sites.
Still, the amendments proposed against by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group should not have been rejected as it called for attention to the development of terrorism inside Europe because in my country banned terrorist organizations develop under the umbrella of the ruling MRF party.
(FI) Madam President, I think this resolution is fine but slightly inconsistent as you get the impression in some places that one is, as it were, surrendering to terrorism.
In other words, it does not seem to accept the idea that terrorism should be eliminated entirely, that it should be pulled up by the roots; and Mrs Muscardini of the UEN Group raised this point in her oral amendment.
To me this is one of those issues which perhaps should have been examined in more detail when this report was being discussed.
I think the European Union line should be absolutely clear on terrorism.
We promote democracy, human rights and freedom of expression, and can under no circumstances approve of terrorism.
I would also have liked to see more weight given to the importance of education when addressing its causes.
For example, the fight against terrorism in the Palestinian Autonomous Territories should mainly be based on education, so that future generations can be educated and brought up free of hatred and can therefore learn to live in peaceful coexistence with their neighbours.
(DE) Madam President, in the fight against terrorism, we must deploy all means that are effective, available and compatible with the rule of law.
If the Union wants to win that fight, it must cooperate with partners.
I voted against this resolution because of its anti-American tone.
Instead of standing up against terrorism, the author and many others take a stand against partnership with the United States in the fight against terrorism.
Another reason why I voted against the draft resolution is that it calls on the Commission and the Council to bring detainees from GuantÃ¡namo to Europe.
That would amount to importing terrorism into Europe.
It would be a misguided act.
The third reason why I voted against the resolution is that it rejects measures which are demonstrably usable in the fight against terrorism, namely the extension of passenger name records to Europe and a reinforcement of Europol.
Written explanations of vote
in writing. - (PT) The Aviation Agreement with Morocco is the second agreement relating to the so-called 'common European airspace' and the first concluded, in this context, with a country outside the continent of Europe.
On a more prominent political note we regret the fact that this agreement - as also unacceptably happened in the case of fisheries - does not explicitly make it clear that 'territory under the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco means territory under Moroccan sovereignty in accordance with International Law', thus ensuring respect for international law and the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Saharan people.
Moroccan sovereignty over the territory of Western Sahara is not legally recognised under international law, as the International Court of Justice at The Hague emphasised in its opinion delivered in October 1975.
Morocco, which is occupying the territory of Western Sahara illegally, consequently has no sovereignty or jurisdiction over that territory.
Moreover, this agreement is based almost exclusively on support for two aims which we oppose: the opening of markets and the harmonization of regulations to promote competition in air transport.
in writing. - (PT) In June and July this year, the Commission received the third and fourth applications for mobilisation of this Fund.
The applications related to two German undertakings and a Finnish one, all operating in the telecommunications sector, in the manufacture of mobile phones to be precise.
Both applications are connected with the relocation of production to third countries, causing 4 211 workers to be laid off.
So far, in addition to these two applications and two French requests which have already been approved, the Commission has received further applications from Italy, Malta, Spain and Portugal.
These applications will have to be approved early next year.
As we have mentioned, the existence of this fund cannot serve to 'cushion' the unacceptable social and economic costs of relocation of undertakings and the associated redundancies.
We therefore insist that a regulatory framework must be established to prevent and penalise relocations of undertakings.
We consider that any grant of public aid to undertakings must be conditional upon long-term commitments by those undertakings in terms of regional development and employment, and they must not be granted any aid that may be used to promote relocations.
Equally, it is essential to strengthen the role of workers' representatives on the boards of directors of undertakings and in the taking of management decisions of a structural nature.
in writing. - (CS) The total funds taken from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund represent around 3.6% and involve only three countries.
Globalisation, however, affects all human activity to a greater or lesser extent.
The low level of use of these funds invites at least two questions: first, are the effects of globalisation so limit, and second, do we know how to obtain resources from the Fund?
In other words, firstly we can ask whether we need this Fund.
If we think we do, then, secondly, we need to provide a better definition of the potential effects of globalisation and review the rules for obtaining funding so that the Fund becomes accessible and intelligible to other countries and their more problematic regions.
Indication of economic, social and other elements would also help in this regard.
Justification, such as 'unexpectedness' on the part of the Commission, is difficult to accept.
Based on the above doubts, I voted against the proposal.
in writing. - (PT) The mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument, along with the amendment of the Interinstitutional Agreement, is an integral part of the draft Community budget for 2008.
Thus, in addition to the correction of 1 600 million in the multiannual financial framework, with the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument it is also proposed to supplement the funding for the European global navigation satellite system programmes (EGNOS-GALILEO) by approximately EUR 200 million.
Moreover, through the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument, the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) is also to receive a further EUR 70 million in funding.
It should be noted that the rapporteur emphasises that 'external actions in general, and the CFSP in particular, are not sufficiently catered for in the long term compared to the demands now identified'.
He explains that the 'demands identified' include reinforcement of the EU 'missions' in Kosovo and Afghanistan.
In this way, added impetus is given to the EU's increasing interference and military intervention in support of NATO operations, both in the Balkans - an example being the preparations to support the 'unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo', in violation of international law -, and in Central Asia, notably by funding these 'missions' out of the Community budget.
These are political and military objectives with which we clearly disagree.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument, like revision of the financial perspective, is the natural outcome of the conciliation agreement of 23 November concerning the budget for 2008.
The Flexibility Instrument is intended in principle to safeguard the budget plan in exceptional circumstances that are difficult to foresee.
In my modest experience, however, use of this exceptional instrument rarely meets the criteria laid down in the interinstitutional agreement.
Such is the case with the draft budget for 2008.
Both the EUR 200 million to finance the Galileo programme in 2008 and the sum of EUR 70 million under Heading IV, to cover increasing needs in the CFSP area, are solutions to problems that were foreseeable.
Despite the reservations of the European Parliament delegation, which pointed to a lack of adequate funding for satellite navigation and insufficient funding in relation to the European Union's international ambitions, it did not succeed in convincing the Council of the need to increase the relevant budget allocations.
In its final form, the financial perspective boded difficulties that manifested themselves in preparing the budget for 2008.
The truth of the matter is that, in the course of the conciliation procedure, Parliament resolved problems created by the Council.
Given the misrepresentation of this situation in the media, we should draw the right conclusions for the future.
in writing. - (SV) We cannot endorse a system in which taxpayers' money is used to market European agricultural products in third countries.
We think that restraint should be exercised in such ventures, particularly in developing countries, since we risk damaging domestic industry.
We think that the EU should be encouraging local agriculture in these countries, not undermining farmers there.
Thriving local production can mean a chance for these countries to develop economically and a way forward for democratic development.
in writing. - (PT) Simplifying the European legislation on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries is most important for the development of a simpler and more manageable CAP.
I approve the Commission's proposal to improve the system, in particular the regulatory consolidation involving the merging of the two regulations relating to the internal market and to third countries.
I am voting for the Golik report, and would highlight the reference it makes to the need to pay more attention to the issues of information and promotion in the WTO negotiations.
in writing. - (EL) In view of the fact that the discussions at the WTO and the commitments will result in the abolition of export refunds, cuts in Community aid amounting to EUR 20.1 billion, and price cuts of 48% - 73% for most EU agricultural products, there will be severe repercussions on agricultural income.
With the proposal for a regulation, the Commission aims to counteract the negative consequences arising in the past from GATT and the previous CAP reforms, which will be intensified to a greater degree with the WTO and expected CAP reforms.
The consequences will be felt mainly in the distribution of agricultural products, both to third countries and to EU countries, since import duties and internal aid for Community agriculture will be drastically reduced at the same time.
Promotion and information programmes are therefore being proposed.
However, the funds allocated to those programmes can do nothing to counteract the consequences.
The result will be an aggravation of the problems of distributing Community agricultural produce to third countries and also within the EU, a reduction in prices paid to the producer, and outright disaster for small and medium-sized farmers, who already earn only a borderline agricultural income.
On the other hand, the programmes will be of benefit mainly to large agricultural enterprises with competitive production costs.
in writing. - (PT) The Common Organisation of the Market (CMO) in fisheries and aquaculture products, one of the four pillars of the Common Fisheries Policy, is to be the subject of in-depth restructuring.
The priorities are revision of aspects relating to consumer information on fisheries products and a more equitable distribution of the value added to the products along the whole marketing process (with special emphasis on the initial point of sale).
The EU is also to find solutions to counteract the 'social dumping' which is now common practice in some third countries and which is reducing our fisheries products' ability to compete.
National interests are protected in this report and it therefore deserves to have my vote.
in writing. - (PT) We welcome the approval of the report on the CMO in fisheries products, which sends a clear signal to the European Commission that an ambitious revision of this CMO is urgently needed in order to increase its contribution to guaranteeing incomes in the sector, improving the marketing of fisheries products and increasing the added value of these products, notably by means of a substantial increase in funding.
Given that the CMO should provide an effective response to the objectives for which it was established and that the insecurity of incomes in the fisheries sector is attributable largely to the form of marketing in the sector, the price formation at the initial point of sale and the irregular nature of fishing, we regret that the Committee on Fisheries rejected our proposals which really go to the heart of the matter, including among others:
the introduction of maximum rates of profit;
the need for public aid and the establishment of effective market intervention mechanisms;
the consideration of production costs in the definition of guide prices;
the introduction of financial compensation for voluntary temporary reductions in the catch or the fishing effort.
We shall nevertheless continue to put the case for these fair measures.
in writing. - The common organisation of the market in fisheries products is intended to ensure stability in the market and security of income for those involved in the sector.
These aims and, indeed, the aims set out in the EC Treaty are worthy and should have led to prosperity in Europe's fishing communities.
Unfortunately, the past two and a half decades of centralised Brussels control in the form of the CFP have been disastrous for those communities.
A thriving market with job security are not achievable within the context of the CFP, and control of fisheries management must be returned to the nations dependent on fisheries.
in writing. - (PT) As we have pointed out, the national authorities have long complied and ensured compliance with the requirements in force under international agreements in the area of civil aviation.
Cooperation between the EU Member States and between those states and other countries is already a reality, a reality that could be further encouraged and developed but which already ensures respect for each country's sovereignty, for workers and their rights (guaranteeing social harmonisation, in particular, by the application of the most favourable conditions), and for the rights of users.
However, the powers of each Member State in the area of civil aviation are gradually being transferred to the EU, a process that is particularly negative when it occurs in an area in which there are no clearly defined limits.
Essentially, the establishment of the European Aviation Safety Agency signifies another 'step' in that direction.
It should be stressed that this agency will be responsible for exercising powers that are at present exercised by each of the national authorities.
Basically, this is a measure designed to bring about what has been called the 'single European sky' and the liberalisation of air transport and air navigation at EU level.
This liberalisation for the sake of financial profitability calls into question workers' rights, quality of services and safety levels.
in writing. - The Leichtfried report marks the culmination of complex negotiations involving the Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The extension of the powers of the EASA is an important development for aviation safety in Europe and my group was able to support the final compromise.
in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I confirm my previous vote for the Leichtfried report.
The negotiations between Parliament and the Council, with the assistance of the Commission, have led to this text which, although it does not completely satisfy some of the demands which I have supported, is a good compromise.
I should like to stress the important role that the European Aviation Safety Agency will play as regards the monitoring not just of aviation but also of company practices.
The Agency will be responsible for renewing and issuing certificates and licences and for monitoring the application of uniform safety standards.
It will also be able to impose fines if safety is not properly implemented.
I am therefore pleased by the compromise reached with Amendment 15 which makes the Agency fully independent and impartial, including in matters relating to the revocation of licences and the imposition of fines.
I should also like to stress that staff will have a major role to play in the development and the work of this body.
As a result, I fully share the rapporteur's concern to improve the status of this work, possibly by drawing on the potential offered by the European Union's Staff Regulations.
in writing. - I shall be voting for this report and I must congratulate the rapporteur on what is a technical issue of great importance.
I would however like to make a few points.
Regarding cabin crew licensing, clearly this issue causes some concern in certain Member States and has resulted in a determined lobbying effort by the cabin crew trade unions.
I believe the rapporteur has found a compromise that allays fears held by some Member States, yet recognises the importance of the role cabin crew play.
Some airlines frankly abuse cabin crew by not only treating them as mere 'waiters in the sky' but by employing them on contracts that pay minimum rates, for maximum hours, after paying for their own training.
Secondly it is important to recognise that EU-OPS, as approved by this Parliament, now come under EASA competence.
But I would take the opportunity to remind the Commission and EASA that flight and duty times as contained in Subpart Q of the EU-OPS Regulation cannot be changed until a study into fatigue has been commissioned and the wider industry consulted.
Finally I hope now that other aspects of aviation safety and security can be introduced EU wide, including cockpit door and baggage hold surveillance.
in writing. - (PT) As is generally the case with regulations in this area, the specific objectives of this report are based on harmonisation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States in order to promote the development of the European internal market, in this case with respect to nutrition and health claims made on foods.
The proposal consists of two amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods, and the purpose of the proposal is to provide for an adequate transitional period for health claims referring to children's development and health.
Nutrition claims which have been used in a Member State before 1 January 2006 in compliance with the national provisions applicable and which are not included in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 may continue to be used for three years after the Regulation comes into force.
Health claims other than those referring to children's development and health also benefit from transitional measures detailed in Article 28(5) and (6) of the Regulation.
Similar transitional measures are now provided for claims referring to children's development and health.
in writing. - I voted to approve this report because of the checks that need to be made to ensure the health and nutritional claims made.
Whilst healthy eating for many is essential for a prolonged and active life it is also essential that adequate information is provided to the consumer.
For too long claims made by some manufacturers of popular consumer products have led to consumers being misled over the nutritional and health properties of these products.
I call on the Commission to devote as much time as needed to ensure adequate clarity for European citizens.
in writing. - (NL) Liberalisation of the market in car parts has been the subject of heated debate ever since 1993.
I think the abolition of design rights in respect of visible car parts is long overdue.
So I wholeheartedly support the Commission proposal, because at present there is no properly functioning single market in these parts.
When functional items such as wing mirrors and lights have to be replaced, the parts needed to restore the car to its previous condition must be readily available.
I am for European liberalisation as swiftly as possible, so I favour a transitional period that is as short as possible - five years.
I shall of course be voting against amendments which make it possible for Member States to drag their feet over liberalisation during the transitional period.
in writing. - (PT) This report contains some amendments to the proposal for a directive to liberalise the secondary market in spare parts, applicable to the motor vehicle industry, the machinery industry and the capital goods and consumer goods industries.
The Commission proposal advocates unprotected markets, whereas this report advocates a transitional period of 5 years for countries where there is market protection, as in the case of Portugal.
We know that, on the one hand, protected markets lead to large undertakings having a monopoly on the trade in spare parts since, in protected markets, the consumer has to buy a replacement for a defective or damaged part from the original producer.
The argument used is that the design of the product must not be altered, the best known example being that of the motor vehicle industry, although this proposal for a directive also applies to other industries.
But there are practical cases where the replacement of a simple part requires a whole combination of parts, with the associated costs for the consumer.
In the meantime, on the other hand, there are factories in Portugal connected with the motor vehicle industry in particular, which continue to operate thanks to their production of spare parts for the well-known makes and for which the 'liberalisation' of the market could cause serious problems.
in writing. - (FR) In the Lehne report on the legal protection of designs, I decided to support and lend my signature to an amendment proposing an eight-year transition period before complete liberalisation of intellectual property rights on component parts of complex products, such as motor vehicles, used for the purpose of restoring their original appearance.
So far, impact studies have not shown any significant reduction in the consumer price of these parts in the Member States where the system has already been liberalised.
I am also convinced that the European Union is undermining its own interests here.
Other parts of the world are engaged in protecting their manufacturing by means of industrial property rights, and the European Union - while declaring its desire to protect consumers and to combat counterfeiting - is making the wrong choice.
The issues at stake are economic balance in the automotive sector and the safety of European vehicle users.
in writing. - (FR) The directive on the legal protection of designs and models, as submitted to the House, proposes complete liberalisation of the market in component parts, notably in the motor vehicles sector.
The rapporteur's text alters the proposal significantly by advocating that Member States be permitted to retain legislation strictly protecting designs and models for a further five years.
Retaining the manufacturers' monopoly on the production of component parts is a means of preventing the loss of Community jobs to countries like Turkey, Brazil and Korea, where production costs and quality are lower.
Over-hasty liberalisation of this sector could also entail major risks, notably in terms of safety.
If vehicle manufacturers are to have no responsibility for the production of component parts, there will be nothing to guarantee their compliance with specifications and no assurance of quality.
Surely we must put vehicle users' protection and safety before any economic or political considerations.
So, having attacked the postal service, the railways and the energy and electricity sectors, Brussels now has vehicle manufacturers in its sights.
There would seem to be no limit to the logic of ultra-globalism and forced deregulation for ideological reasons.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, the internal market is a highly complex structure that has balanced the interests of the various groups dependent on it for many years in succession.
The aim of this directive is to achieve complete liberalisation of the secondary market in spare parts.
On the one side, therefore, we have broad groups of manufacturers of spare parts who are demanding that their rights in respect of free competition and the prohibition of a market monopoly be taken into account; on the other, we have car manufacturers (and here we are obviously focusing on the automobile industry) who base the defence of their spare parts production on the legal protection of designs.
In this situation, which at first sight seems insoluble, I support the approach of the rapporteur, who proposes a system under which designs would be protected for a limited period.
In practice, the protection period would be closely based on the life cycle of the complex product.
I also agree with the rapporteur that upon the introduction of a new protected design, the protection of spare parts involved in the old design should lapse.
It should also lapse when a design that does not have a replacement ceases to be manufactured.
That proposal seems to me the most suitable arrangement and the one that will best protect the interests of the groups involved.
I also support the proposal for a transitional arrangement whereby Member States under whose legislation design protection exists for component parts may retain such design protection for five years after the entry into force of the directive.
in writing. - I supported the compromise package and rejected those amendments seeking to extend the transitional period for the "repair clause".
in writing. - I support a competitive European market for spare parts.
This will help drive down costs for consumers and boost business for small and medium enterprises.
As a result, I support the Commission proposal, which would open spare parts markets to competition.
As such, I am unable to support amendments which increase the time allowed for the market to be liberalised for up to 8 years.
This would slow the progress of achieving our goal of a competitive market for spare parts.
in writing. - (SV) We vote against the report and the Commission proposal for the following reasons:
We had hoped that the reform would mean a saving for the Union's taxpayers and that the wine industry would be decoupled from financing through the common agricultural policy.
In the long term, we think that Community subsidies for European wine manufacturing financed by taxes must cease.
We think that it is reprehensible to use taxpayers' money in order to market European wines.
It is in conflict with Parliament's alcohol strategy, which promotes a restrictive view on the marketing of alcoholic beverages.
In that context, to increase spending on marketing measures is an unfortunate reflection of double standards.
We are also opposed to the proposals which advocate the use of European taxpayers' money to market wines in third countries.
We think that caution should be exercised in the marketing of European wines, particularly in developing countries, since it poses the risk of stifling domestic industries.
The Union should not undermine local producers in developing countries but, instead, support them.
in writing. - (IT) Madam President, I am voting against this report, not because of Mr Castiglione's general approach which includes some positive points such as imposing quantitative limits and environmental compatibility on grubbing-up, banning the use of must from outside the EU and extending measures which can be managed independently by the Member States.
In my opinion, however, endorsing the practice of sugaring and the provision under which this practice does not have to be indicated on the information label for consumers are critical points.
The passage on the so-called fruit wines is also entirely questionable, as is the report's general approach in relation to must.
I hope, as an Italian, that Minister De Castro and his colleagues will be able to negotiate a legislative reference framework that is more respectful of quality and consumers' rights.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, I fully support Mr Castiglione's report on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in wine.
The creation of a wine market governed by simple and effective rules on production and principles of healthy competition on the Community market will not only improve the quality of European products; it will also raise the fruit farmers' standard of living.
It is also important that consumers should be aware of the production cycle of a given product and its precise origin.
Furthermore, these arrangements will be decidedly beneficial for the production of fruit wine in my own country, and that is the main reason why I support the report.
in writing. - (PT) We are voting against this report because it does not significantly alter the most important aspects of the European Commission's bad proposal for the vineyard and wine sector.
As we have always said, we disagree with this liberal position, which claims to be a move towards dismantling the common organisation of the market in the wine sector.
The European Parliament itself examined this and went so far as to allow the addition of sugar and increase the possible rate compared with the levels then in force.
But one of the most serious aspects is the fact that it leaves the whole question of liberalisation of planting rights from 2013 open, although the rapporteur recognises that this will only serve to concentrate production in the hands of the biggest wine-growers, who already enjoy the benefit of substantial public aid and other privileges.
Equally, we regret that the proposals we made to maintain planting rights and support the restructuring of wine-producing areas, especially family farms, small and medium-sized wine-growers and wine cooperatives were not adopted, although we note with satisfaction that some proposals were approved, notably the proposal advocating the distillation of alcohol intended for drinking.
in writing. - (PT) Although I agree with the need to reform the CMO in the wine sector and broadly speaking support the European Commission's proposal, I consider that the Castiglione report has made an important contribution, proposing some amendments which substantially improve the Commission's document.
I note, among other positive aspects, the introduction of the possibility of continuing aid for the distillation of alcohol intended for drinking.
I voted for Amendments 33 and 223 because I consider that the liberalisation of the sector should not be abrupt, and I rejected Amendments 314, 347, 293 and 217 because I do not agree with the introduction of the possibility of continuing the procedure of enrichment with sugar, a practice that could cause imbalances between producers, and I therefore support the European Commission's original text here.
in writing. - (FR) I welcome the general thrust of this report with its thorough overhaul of the European Commission proposal, which had included, by the way, a massive grubbing-up operation affecting 400 000 hectares of vines.
That proposal ignored the social realities of the wine-growing sector and would have resulted in further land lying fallow, to the detriment of the landscape.
The report views grubbing-up as a potentially useful measure, to be proposed on a voluntary basis.
Another positive proposal concerns the possible implementation of restructuring measures in the wine industry.
The European wine industry needs powerful, successful operators in order to withstand international competition.
On the other hand, the proposals on crisis prevention, while necessary, do not go far enough.
Given the extent to which production fluctuates, the proposed measures would be merely palliative.
What is lacking is a proper crisis-management mechanism that adds something new to the existing measures.
Lastly, I am sorry there is no provision for indication on the label of enrichment through the addition of sucrose: this would have been a straightforward, transparent means of information for the consumer.
in writing. - (DE) In the common organisation of the wine market, the Commission seeks to take account of the special characteristics of wine-producing regions by delegating more responsibility and creating more scope for initiative.
Today the European Parliament has set down these very aims on paper.
We have absolute confidence in our proposals, which were adopted by all Members of Parliament from all Member States.
Viniculture in Europe is part of our heritage.
The cradle of global wine production is here in Europe.
Viniculture means business, income and jobs.
It is not the task of the Commission to seek market balance by limiting our production or by changing the rules to make production impossible.
It is, however, the Commission's task to safeguard our share of global markets and to ensure that our products enjoy the international prestige they merit.
The aim must not be to restrict the market but to open up new markets.
Why should we alter winemaking methods for wines that are selling well?
Our winemaking methods are rooted in ancient cultures and traditions.
Today the European Parliament has clearly reaffirmed its support for more market measures, national budgets and scope for regional initiative, for socially sensitive phasing-out of intervention measures and for the preservation of existing oenological practices, in other words the addition of sucrose and rectified concentrated must (RCM), with these additives being placed on an equal footing by means of additional RCM subsidies.
I hope that our proposals will be incorporated into the new common organisation of the market in wine.
in writing. - (DE) In years when conditions are unfavourable for vine-growing and when there is too little sunshine, the fructose content of grapes is insufficient to produce the volume of alcohol required for fermentation.
For this reason we add sugar, which does not alter the taste of the wine.
The crucial point is that the sugar is added before fermentation and not afterwards, which means that it is not a matter of sweetening sour wine, and the addition of sugar is only permissible for table wines and vins de pays.
This should remain the case in future.
The Commission's plans to replace beet sugar, which has hitherto been the standard additive, with grape must from the southern regions with production surpluses, do not stand up to scrutiny.
Apart from the impassioned debate among experts regarding variations in flavour, there is also an environmental argument.
It does not make sense to me to transport grape must all the way across Europe to areas that already have their own supply of sugar beet.
in writing. - (SV) The amendments to the report which we had to consider in today's vote are quite ludicrous.
An example: the amount of sugar to be contained in different kinds of wine should in fact be left to the consumers who buy the products themselves to decide.
It should not be determined in decision-making processes between the EU institutions.
Producers in other parts of the world have managed to produce wines which appeal to the tastes of European consumers and at the same time are cheaper than European wines.
According to the majority in the European Parliament, this must be combated by pumping more money into the agricultural policy and by conducting various campaigns.
There is no doubt that excellent wines are produced in Europe.
The question of principle is whether it is right for poorer countries to be crowded out in order to favour European wine production.
It is important to have a perspective which takes all factors into account, including the public health interest, when wine production is discussed.
This is lacking in the report.
For these reasons I have voted to reject the Commission proposal and the European Parliament report on the matter.
Wine producers should operate in a free market and not, as at present, receive huge subsidies from the EU.
in writing. - (DE) With its proposal for the reform of wine production, the Commission seems to have come up with yet another piÃšce de rÃ©sistance.
On the one hand, it is trying to dry out Europe's wine lakes by giving financial rewards for reductions in the total vineyard area, while on the other hand it intends to allow vine-planting everywhere after 2013.
If the growing restrictions are lifted, however, labour-intensive hillside vineyards will become unviable.
As if it were not enough to make these wine producers fear for their existence, the planned sugaring ban would deprive the whole of northern Europe of its harvest in years with relatively little sunshine, while the abolition of aid for concentrated grape must would ultimately make wine production impossible in southern Europe too.
Add to that the mooted ban on the designation 'table wine', which would inevitably result in a surfeit of varietal wines of the lowest category, and it becomes impossible to avoid the notion that the planners of this reform simply lack the necessary expertise and sensitivity.
The Castiglione report is an improvement on these proposals, which is why I have voted for it.
in writing. - (FR) My colleagues and I backed Giuseppe Castiglione's report on the common organisation of the market in wine by a large majority.
In particular, I supported four amendments that I consider essential not only for safeguarding the European wine-growing industry, especially in Burgundy and Franche ComtÃ©, but also for making it more competitive.
I voted in favour of Amendment 271, opposing the Commission plan to put an end to chaptalisation.
It is, in fact, vitally important that we should maintain the wine-making traditions of chaptalisation that are carried on in many regions of Europe, including Burgundy and Franche ComtÃ© - which I happen to represent.
I also supported Amendments 33 and 223, opposing complete liberalisation of planting rights from 1 January 2014: the interests of wine-growers dictate that we should wait until the end of the grubbing-up scheme, to see how effective it has been, before we contemplate liberalisation.
Finally, I voted for Amendment 107, seeking to maintain compulsory distillation.
In general I am satisfied with the amendments that Parliament has made; I supported this report and I hope it will have a positive influence on the Agricultural Council on 17-19 December, where the interests of our regions will be at stake.
in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am voting for the report by our esteemed colleague Mr Castiglione.
There has long been a need for a reform of the wine sector that restores the profile and competitiveness of Community wines and enables European producers to recapture former markets and capture new ones.
European, especially Italian, producers are experiencing fierce competition from new producers.
This is due not so much to a downturn in internal consumption as to exaggerated production costs, to over-rigid and complex regulations, which often limit the possibility of adjusting production to suit changes in demand, and to over-timid promotion and marketing policies.
We need to make the most of the quality of European and Italian wines.
To enable the European Union to consolidate its leading position in the wine sector, the reform of the CMO in wine should focus on improving quality, and that means promoting, safeguarding and reinforcing regional, designation of origin and geographical indication wines, which represent quality European products on the world market.
in writing. - (DE) In years when conditions are unfavourable for vine-growing and when there is too little sunshine, the fructose content of grapes is insufficient to produce the volume of alcohol required for fermentation.
For this reason we add sugar, which does not alter the taste of the wine.
The crucial point is that the sugar is added before fermentation and not afterwards, which means that it is not a matter of sweetening sour wine, and the addition of sugar is only permissible for table wines and vins de pays.
This should remain the case in future.
The Commission's plans to replace beet sugar, which has hitherto been the standard additive, with grape must from the southern regions with production surpluses, do not stand up to scrutiny.
in writing. - I voted for this report but there are still many areas of concern that Parliament has chosen not to address, notably to make the sector more competitive against third country imports, and to improve the quality of wine produced at EU level.
Sadly national and regional priorities have got in the way of a lasting reform programme.
In Europe we must protect our quality wine, and we must also address the issue of producing quality wines at an affordable price.
There is no doubt the Commission's proposals have been watered down.
Thankfully, however, my amendment to lift the de minimis criteria, and those amendments to allow chaptalisation have been accepted by Parliament.
These amendments are crucial for northern countries and my own wine producers in the United Kingdom.
The European wine industry still faces many threats, and in the EU we are seeing our own market share disappearing to New World countries.
But why?
It is because they can produce excellent-quality wine at an affordable price and with a marketing strategy that is based on what the consumer wants in the 21st century; not what the Romans planted in the third.
We need quality, not quantity, and we need to produce wine that offers value for money.
in writing. - The wine market in the EU depends upon the widest variety of choice and upon local production which is sustainable.
For many, the issue of wine is as close to a cultural issue as language itself.
This is why this vote today was such a contentious one.
The impact of sugar labelling or of denying wineries from using sugar additives would have had a prohibitive effect on wine production in northern Europe.
Many excellent wines now originate from the UK and particularly in the south-east of England.
This has been the case since the Romans first brought wine to the UK.
I voted to maintain this tradition and for an open market.
in writing. - Conservatives voted against this resolution for the reasons that, firstly, the motion calls for more EU involvement through the proposed Reform Treaty and would thus extend the competence of the EU into the highly sensitive area of national security.
Conservatives believe in a strong partnership at a global level with all those nations fighting the war on terror, and especially with our American allies.
This motion fails to recognise the need for cooperation rather than harmonisation on this issue.
in writing. - The British Socialist Delegation (EPLP) welcomed and voted in favour of the resolution on terrorism.
Whilst the final version of the resolution adopted by the European Parliament is not perfect, we recognise the importance of sending a clear, unequivocal signal to those who threaten our way of life that we shall not succumb.
The EPLP is convinced that the EU can and will do all it can to defeat terrorism and that with neighbouring Member States and international allies working together we are more likely to achieve this ultimate goal than by isolationist policies.
We take full responsibility for our role as parliamentarians to extensively scrutinise Commission proposals in this field to ensure that any legislation which is adopted is appropriate, proportionate and respects the fundamental rights of our citizens.
We will continue to be critical of allies' policy where there are policy differences, however we recognise and welcome the on-going co-operation between the EU and democratic states, especially the important relationship between the EU and the US, in the field of Justice and Home Affairs.
We remain convinced that it is through co-operation with our allies not antagonism or retaliation that we will defeat those who seek to destroy our values and principles through violence and hatred.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, the EU Member States have a duty to combat terrorism in all its forms, while remaining within the bounds of law and respect for human and civil rights and freedoms.
The fight against terrorism transcends national frontiers, and the need for international cooperation is obvious.
It is absolutely necessary that all institutions and authorities given special powers in the fight against terrorism be subject to full democratic control by an independent judiciary.
The fight against terrorism must not - as the resolution adopted today attempts to do - serve to increase the police and judicial powers of Brussels at the expense of the nation states.
That is why I did not support today's resolution on terrorism in the EU.
in writing. - (FR) Terrorism has become a greater threat than ever before to the security of all European Union citizens.
The EPP-ED Group has therefore made combating terrorism a priority and it had hoped to see the adoption of a resolution to that end.
The resolution tabled highlights how hard and how necessary it is to strike the right balance between security and respect for individual freedoms.
In our European democracies we certainly do need to ensure that anti-terrorism measures are proportionate to their purpose, so that they do not compromise the personal freedoms of any of our citizens.
At the same time, we have to remember that the Union's primary aim is to defend the right of every European citizen to life and to security, and it pursues that aim by preventing and opposing terrorism.
It is unfortunate that a large number of distinctly disproportionate and, in some cases, unjustified provisions have upset the balance in this text.
Despite the amendments that our group introduced, the resolution ultimately adopted in plenary reflects neither the spirit nor the letter of our position on this matter, and that is why I voted against it.
in writing. - (PT) Although it contains aspects that criticise, albeit mildly, the violations of human rights committed in the name of the so-called 'fight against terrorism' - violations which we clearly and firmly condemned from the outset - this resolution does not dissociate itself from the fight or seek to challenge it when international law is flouted and State terrorism is practised in its name.
Yes, it certainly calls for criticism of the violation of the right to a fair trial and data protection, the lack of transparency and democratic control, the refusal of the Council to answer 'allegations of abuse of powers under the pretext of counter-terrorism, in particular in the case of CIA extraordinary renditions and black sites'.
Nevertheless, we cannot accept that, under cover of the so-called 'fight against terrorism', Parliament should 'warmly welcome the adoption of the new Reform Treaty' and call on 'the Member States to ratify it'; that it should highlight, once again, that 'the US is an essential partner in this field', adopting US foreign policy lock, stock and barrel; or that it should call for 'the powers of Europol to be reinforced' and for it to be accorded 'independent power to conduct investigations'.
in writing. - I could not support today's motion for a resolution on the fight against terrorism for a number of reasons.
Firstly, its enthusiastic welcome for the Reform Treaty (Lisbon Treaty) is not one I can share in.
I believe the Reform Treaty will not make Europe a safer place for citizens of Member States.
I also have concerns regarding the civil liberties aspects of this motion for a resolution.
This motion for a resolution, although it has some excellent points, is unbalanced with too great an emphasis on legislation and security cooperation.
in writing. - (DE) Europe has become more of a target for terrorists because it has allowed itself to be reduced to the role of an accomplice in the breaches of international law and human rights committed in the name of US foreign policy and also because it has not managed to act as an honest broker on the Palestinian question.
It is high time the EU recognised that mass immigration from the Islamic world is a potential security risk, particularly since emigration to Europe has become a means of acquiring martyr status and the infiltration of the Christian West by Muslim immigrants has been declared a religious objective.
Instead of acting accordingly and pressing for an immediate halt to immigration from Islamic countries as well as getting to grips with the repatriation of illegal immigrants, the EU is adopting a softly-softly approach to avoid vexing the Muslims who are here already.
It is chiefly because this report seems to regard the EU Reform Treaty, with its disdain for democracy, as the cure for terrorism that I have voted against it today.
in writing. - (IT) We asked the European Parliament to deal seriously with the problem of terrorism at the July part-session.
Some clever person decided, however, to talk about it in September and vote in December: another five months wasted and yet more words aiming more to defend the rights of freedom of expression of terrorists, who are making increasing use of information networks, than to protect the safety of European citizens and the other countries attacked by terrorism.
We award the Sakharov Prize to Mr Osman and we leave him alone to fight to defend the lives of millions of people in Darfur, we continue to ignore the violence of the Islamic fundamentalists in Somalia and we weep crocodile tears for the 50 victims in Algeria.
Shame!
For that reason I cannot support your resolution and I shall vote against it.
in writing. - (EL) The European Parliament resolution matches and in many respects outstrips the reactionary policy and anti-democratic measures of the EU, which, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, restricts the fundamental personal rights and democratic freedoms of workers.
It calls for still greater strengthening of police and judicial cooperation between the enforcement mechanisms and secret security services of the Member States, Europol and Eurojust, and for greater effectiveness in the operation of the SIS II and VIS databases, in order to extend and increase the effectiveness of the monitoring and filing of information on workers throughout the EU.
Not only does this resolution align itself fully with the new dimension which the EU is giving to its 'counter-terrorism strategy', i.e. combating and preventing so-called 'violent radicalisation', but it demands that the strategy should be fought for and that it should be aimed, amongst other things, against 'incitement to commit violent actions'.
This strategy against 'radicalisation' reveals the real target of this so-called 'counter-terrorism' policy of the EU and its enforcement mechanisms: all those who resist and challenge its reactionary policy.
However, no matter how many resolutions are passed by the political mouthpieces of the monopolies, they will not stop the opposition movements and the steadily growing groundswell of opinion challenging the EU itself as an imperialist inter-state union of European capital.
in writing. - The Fine Gael delegation in the European Parliament voted against paragraph 16 of the resolution on the Commission's Legislative and Work Programme 2008 as we are vehemently opposed to any EU initiative to establish a European Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB).
We welcome the fact that the Commission does not intend to propose legislation on this matter in its programme for next year.
Tax competition is vital for promoting growth, attracting investment and enabling Member States, especially those in the Eurozone, to manage their economy.
The ECB sets interest rates and the Stability and Growth Pact sets borrowing and inflation requirements for the Eurozone, tax policy is therefore one of the most important instruments left to Eurozone Member States under the Treaty and must be safeguarded.
The Fine Gael MEPs believe an EU CCCTB would lead eventually to the establishment of a single tax rate in Europe and are strongly against it.
in writing. - (PT) We are voting against this resolution because the proposals expressing our serious concern over the acceleration of the process of liberalisation and deregulation, which is occurring in many sectors and which poses a threat to employment, the quality of services provided and the future of public services in the EU, were not accepted.
What remains is biased against the State as a supplier of services of general interest, since the whole emphasis is on liberalisation.
Monetary and fiscal policy in the EU has also been restrictive, the prime objective being to stabilise prices and consolidate the budget in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact even though we know that the process of nominal convergence has an adverse effect on economic growth and employment, economic and social cohesion, real convergence between the EU Member States, and public investment.
It also lays emphasis on the neoliberal Lisbon Strategy, which has been the principal instrument used in the EU to promote the liberalisation and privatisation of services and public facilities, flexibility and adaptability in labour markets, wage reductions and the opening up to private interests of most social security provisions, including pensions and health.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, the work programme for 2008 adopts a complex approach aimed at implementing a vision of Europe that meets its citizens' future expectations.
The European Commission's main priorities for the coming year are activities to promote economic growth and employment, sustainable development, and the management of migratory flows.
They also concern climate change, energy, future enlargement of the EU and action on the international scene.
It should be stressed that the work plan was elaborated in the light of detailed discussions with other institutions, including the issues discussed recently in the debate on globalisation at the Council's informal meeting in Lisbon.
