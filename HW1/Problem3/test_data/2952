Lifelong learning helps people to keep pace with the development of science and technology and makes it easier for them to understand the world in general.
Alongside the development of educational programmes, it is necessary to focus on ensuring that lifelong learning is not just a luxury for the chosen few but is accessible to all sections of society, regardless of social status and gender.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the purpose of this decision is for Parliament and the Council to set up an integrated programme in the field of lifelong learning, to be implemented in the years 2007-2013.
Amongst other things, the programme aims to develop international cooperation between institutions of higher education and schools, and also to promote the mobility of students, staff, pupils and teachers.
The programme is composed of four sectoral programmes, namely Comenius for schools, Erasmus for higher education, Leonardo da Vinci for vocational education and training and Grundtvig for adult education.
The original version of the programme's budget has been cut.
This has entailed cuts in terms of the quantitative targets for individual components of the programme and also the percentage share of resources.
As less funding is now available, many of the actions previously planned will now not be undertaken.
These include fostering long and short-term mobility of teachers within the framework of Erasmus, along with study visits and innovative and experimental projects within the framework of the inter-sectoral programme.
Pursuant to the provisions of the new 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, the budget allocation for the implementation of the lifelong learning programme has been almost halved.
It has been cut from the EUR 13.62 billion originally planned to EUR 7.171 billion.
This reduction in the programme's budget implies that there will be fewer grants available for projects and that there will also be fewer opportunities for poorer students to study at foreign institutions.
In conclusion, I should like to thank Mrs Pack very much for all her work.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the lifelong learning programme is an excellent venture, and the aims enshrined in its provisions are all relevant.
This programme is intended to implement one of the pillars of the Union, namely the common social policy.
However, as has been the case with similar excellent ventures, the programme has fallen prey to funding cuts.
One of the provisions of this programme involves supporting the contribution of learning to social cohesion, which should lead to improved relationships between societies in our Community.
I put it to you, ladies and gentlemen, how can this be brought about when the new Member States are still bound by the transitional periods set for access to the labour market, and therefore denied equal access to knowledge and technology?
Another key aim is also undermined, namely that of increasing competitiveness, mobility and innovation in the aforementioned market.
How can there be talk of such values when there is no mutual recognition of the equivalence of final diplomas, thus putting individuals at a disadvantage at the very start of their career?
In conclusion, I would point out that, once again, a splendid and noble programme is deemed worthwhile and its provisions and aims are implemented mainly in the countries of the old Union.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Pack has acted as the driving force behind the development of the programmes that we are discussing today, with the integrated action programme.
Without her passion, we would never have made the progress that we have made.
Erasmus is certainly the most popular programme.
Despite the financial increase, the new version will still depend on general mobility conditions such as the transferability of grants, social security and the recognition of qualifications, too.
While mobility does not guarantee that a person's studies will be integrated into his or her curriculum vitae, taking the Erasmus route means that he or she is likely to have to study for an extra year.
Commissioner, I should like to ask you where in the Bologna process is the inclusion of an Erasmus year?
As regards the Leonardo programme, the mobility of employees undertaking vocational training is of prime concern to the craft-based industries and small and medium-sized enterprises, which also need to be made aware of mobility-related issues.
Making our workforce mobile: that is what the Leonardo programme could do.
To that end, the Commission should embark on campaigns to raise the awareness of businesses and should also ensure that the available budget is actually spent.
I should like to point out that our ancestors used readily to move around.
Artists and craftsmen were the ones who travelled the most; it was they who moved society forward.
Cross-border trade is the best way to make our fellow citizens forget about borders and to prove that we can do better.
Finally, I shall not stop repeating, Commissioner, that, given the importance that Mr Barroso attaches to culture, we should have the courage to make it a European policy.
Indeed, those who want a larger budget must be able to submit political projects that are important and that are recognised as being important.
A revival of the debate on the best means of taking the Commission forward would provide a good opportunity for us to speak loudly in favour of such a policy.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, on her good work, and all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education, whose contributions have enriched this text.
I would also, however, like to communicate my concern with regard to the implementation of the lifelong learning programme.
I remember how, at the outset, we were all falling over ourselves to improve the system of student mobility in Europe.
We all voted in favour of increasing the funds for the Erasmus, Leonardo, Comenius programmes etc., in the conviction that it was a very productive long-term investment.
Providing the participants with economic facilities and, at the same time, simplifying the process for being awarded grants, brought us closer to the objectives set in the Lisbon Strategy.
As time passes, however, I am finding it harder to remain optimistic.
I note from surveys that fifteen-year-old European schoolchildren have poor reading skills and show a high level of truancy and that many young people do not complete their studies within the time set.
In view of this information, I wonder how we are going to deal with the challenges of globalisation.
If we are to create a knowledge-based society, sustainable economic development and greater social cohesion, we will have to establish a strong foundation from the outset, and that can only be achieved through effective education.
In short, in order to deal with future challenges, it is crucial that we invest more in education.
It is possible to improve the way existing programmes operate and to create new programmes.
If we make the effort, the numbers will gradually prove us to be right, but all of us must try to convince the Member States that we need to dedicate more money to education and training.
- (LT) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to re-emphasise that the programme being discussed provides citizens with more favourable opportunities for on-going training and becoming active participants of the knowledge-based society.
I think that the initial version we have returned to of the document proposed by the European Commission will enable us to more smoothly implement a programme integrating all the initiatives that are now operational in the area of education.
A unified system will ensure clarity and, most importantly, the possibility of avoiding redundancy in certain areas.
Those states that are able to participate in lifelong learning programmes have experienced obvious benefits from this European Union initiative.
For example, the Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci or Jean Monnet programmes are well known to the Lithuanian people, indicating that European Union initiatives in the area of education are being implemented quite effectively.
I hope you will support my contention that the lifelong learning programme is of vital importance, both for promoting competition and entrepreneurship and in building a shared sense of European citizenship based on the values of the European Union, such as mutual understanding and respect for human rights and democracy.
(PL) Mr President, I fully support the programme for lifelong learning in the Union.
We are always saying that Europe has to become more competitive.
Competitiveness must be built on the foundations of the knowledge triangle - education, research and innovation.
Education is crucial to this structure.
The Union's educational systems are the competence of the Member States, but a better-integrated European programme on education is very welcome.
We now have the Seventh Research Framework Programme and a new Community programme on competitiveness and innovation was launched very recently.
The angles of the Union's knowledge triangle are therefore well established.
Questions arise as to the sides of the triangle: are these programmes adequately connected and do they support each other?
We must not think in terms of three separate programmes, three distinct key aims for the European Union, but in terms of a single joint aim, namely a knowledge society.
I value the proposed changes to lifelong learning, such as the amendment of the Leonardo da Vinci programme to facilitate the transfer of innovation, and the amendment of the Grundtvig programme to facilitate the innovational mobility of older learners.
All too often, however, the programme introduces innovative learning methods instead of opening up the field for the innovations themselves and for future researchers.
There is no system for recruiting highly talented individuals, particularly participants in the Comenius and Erasmus programmes for young people, and allowing them to continue their development within the framework of the Marie Curie programme.
The lifelong learning programme should also be in line with the research priorities of the Seventh Framework Programme.
All our actions should be aimed at ensuring the continuity of the knowledge triangle from school right up to the European Institute of Technology.
I congratulate the Commissioner on this programme, and urge him to ensure that these comments are taken into account during its implementation.
Member of the Commission.
(SK) I am sure there is no need for me to add much; we should rather do more to implement what we have already agreed upon several times.
Education is more than a period in one's life.
We can deal with the issues of employment and growth through a much more coherent approach, which is what the Lisbon Strategy is all about.
Education cannot be isolated from research and innovation (which involves creativity and the promotion of knowledge).
It is also necessary to deploy knowledge practically, and in innovative ways.
I think that the Commission is heading in that direction.
The proposal to set up the European Institute of Technology provided evidence of this at last week's summit in Lahti.
There is further evidence of it in the whole programme and the policy of putting education at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy, and aiming to shape Europe and generate knowledge for growth and employment.
The four pillars of the lifelong programme have very inspiring names - Comenius (Jan Amos Comenius), Leonardo da Vinci, Erasmus of Rotterdam and Grundtvig.
In my opinion this is an important signal.
We will not be able to solve all financial problems through this programme, but we can provide a lot of inspiration, in particular for measures at national level so that education, which is within the competence of the Member States, becomes the focus of national approaches or of the Lisbon Strategy.
There will then be much more money available, and we would certainly appreciate having more allocations for mobility and cooperation in the area of education.
I think that the upcoming 20th anniversary of Erasmus, the most popular programme in the European Union, is a great opportunity to evaluate the situation, but also a challenge for us to do more together for education, young people and the future.
With regard to visas and cooperation with other countries, as of 1 January 2007 Member States should implement or transpose the visa facilitation decision for students, lecturers and researchers throughout the European Union, with the exception of the UK, Ireland and Denmark.
In response to whether we need harmonisation or some other kind of policy, I would say that what we need is complementarity and compatibility rather than the harmonisation of our education systems, and this is gradually being achieved through measures such as the Bologna Process.
We are constantly calling not only for more investment but also for better investment.
The first priority is for 'better investment' whereas 'more investment' comes second.
'Better' also means raising public-private funds.
This often takes the form of mobility or education sponsorship on the part of businesses and industry.
So much for my reflections in response to some of the points that have been raised.
May I once again thank the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, the entire committee and all those who contributed for their high level of consensus and commitment.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Written statement (Rule 142)
Mr President, I congratulate our rapporteur for her work in steering this important report through Parliament.
Next year Erasmus celebrates its 20th anniversary, having been brought into being by one of my predecessors, Winnie Ewing, when she was chair of the Culture and Education Committee, and there is much to thank her for.
Since 1987, over 1.2 million students have completed exchange courses at universities outside their own countries.
In the 2004/2005 academic year, over 144 000 students took advantage of the opportunity provided by the Erasmus programme to continue their studies in a country other than their own.
The benefit and invaluable cultural and linguistic experience this provides for students is second to none.
As a former Erasmus exchange student myself, I can vouch for that.
Erasmus has been one of the successes of the EU in demonstrating its relevance.
But while the uptake for students coming to Scotland has been encouraging, with 2163 during 2004/2005, the number of Scottish students going abroad to study has been far less, standing at 1018.
I want to see more Scots taking part in this programme and benefiting from the opportunity to study abroad.
Erasmus is one way in which we can encourage our young people to have an international outlook.
Annex - Commission statement
The Commission should like to draw the legislative authority's attention to the need for the financial package mentioned in the basic act to be expressed at current prices, and for this to be done no later than its final publication in the OJ.
This corresponds to the standard budgetary practice and will help to ensure, with all due transparency, that the legislative authority's decision is complied with.
For the 'Action programme in the field of lifelong learning', the sum at current prices amounts to EUR 6 970 million.
"Europe for Citizens" programme (2007-2013) (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the Council common position (C6-0316/2006 for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 the programme 'Europe for Citizens', to promote active European citizenship (09575/1/2006) (Rapporteur: Mr Takkula).
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank everyone who has been involved in the deliberations on this report, especially the shadow rapporteurs and members of other committees who have made their comments.
I wish in particular to thank my esteemed colleagues and coordinators, Mrs Pack and Mrs Prets, because, being a member of the smallest group, I would not have been able to produce this report without your support.
I am also grateful for the excellent team spirit and cooperation which you have shown in our committee.
The programme consists of four areas of action.
The first is a Europe of active citizens, which includes town-twinning and citizens' projects.
Town-twinning has already proven to be a success story, and I hope that this success story will continue and go from strength to strength with this programme.
Furthermore, the citizens' projects are very important.
One central idea in establishing this programme was that the European Union could indeed have a grassroots programme which would not be elitist and which the people, the citizens of the European Union, could think of as theirs.
The second area of action is active civil society in Europe.
This could help provide structural support for EU public policy research organisations (think-tanks) and for NGOs at European level, as well as support for projects coordinated by these NGOs.
I think it is vitally important that open adult education centres and vocational colleges, non-degree-based organisations, have a bigger role, because these are just the sort of organisations that are best at reaching out to ordinary people at grassroots level.
This way, this programme will hopefully also open its doors to people all over the European Union, and they will feel it is something relevant to them.
The third area of action is 'Together for Europe', supporting high visibility events, studies and information and dissemination tools.
As we know, it is important to promote the European Union in the appropriate way and to bring it closer to people, because there are shortcomings too in the area of information and communications.
People feel that they are a long way from the decision-making process, and therefore they feel that European Union programmes are remote.
We have much work to do to bring the Union closer to the people by providing information and through various events.
A fourth area of action was added to the programme, and this is the preservation of Active European Remembrance.
There was intense discussion on this in our committee.
We finally hit on the idea that, when this action was transferred from the Culture 2000 Programme, it was just this memory of Nazism and Stalinism that we needed to preserve, so that no horrors like this can ever occur again in Europe.
We think that it is very important that future generations are also able to understand what the European identity is, what peace is, and what stability is, and it is therefore also important to guarantee active remembrance.
It would also obviously have been desirable for the budget to be up-to-date when this programme was being put together.
We know, however, that for some reason there is not as yet enough sympathy in the European Parliament, or at least not in the European Commission or the Council, for cultural projects, or enough appreciation of their importance.
I myself believe that culture and our civil society create a basis on which a dynamic and thriving economy can also be built.
We on the Committee on Culture and Education, being cultured people, should ensure that the budget will be more effective in the future.
This time we were obliged to some extent to cut it from the Commission's original proposal under pressure from the Council, but I hope that the programme can be got underway here, and that it will become a success story.
Finally, I would like to express my gratitude for the cooperation and general understanding that has been reached between the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
I am especially glad that NGOs, open universities and amateur sports clubs have been included in the programme.
I hope that when this programme starts in early 2007 it might become another success story.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission. Mr President, not more than half a year ago, I was here speaking on the same programme, asking for a quick agreement.
At that time the proposal had a different title: 'Citizens for Europe'.
Now, after half a year we are here, very close to the final decisions with the new title, 'Europe for Citizens', coming from your input; but I think this was a remarkable shift, both in consensus but also in the readiness top progress towards finalisation.
This programme is very important for citizens and civic society organisations.
I am very satisfied with the quality and intensity of negotiations between institutions that have taken place on the programme.
I would like especially and sincerely to thank the Committee on Culture for its efforts to accelerate the procedure, and the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, for his excellent work and cooperation.
Those steps in the interinstitutional procedures were accompanied by informal trilateral meetings.
They resulted in a compromise acceptable to all three institutions in the form of four amendments on which you will vote on tomorrow.
Concerning the budget, we agreed to allocate an amount of EUR 190 million at 2004 prices, which means EUR 215 million at current prices.
This is less than the Commission's original proposal but it still enables us to retain the structure of the programme, only reducing the number of outputs.
I would like once more to express my regrets about the introduction by the Council of a supplementary step to the comitology procedure.
This will slow down the selection procedure for certain categories of projects.
However, with a view to reaching a quick agreement, the Commission accepted the position taken by the Council and supported by you.
Today you are envisaging adopting four amendments: two of them concern the budget breakdown between different actions; one is technical and will accelerate the entry into force of the programme; and the last one adds the promotion of tolerance to the objectives of the programme.
That is fully in line with the programme's philosophy.
Let me repeat that the Commission fully supports the agreed compromise and therefore encourages Parliament to adopt those four amendments.
If you adopt them, the Council has committed itself rapidly to adopt the whole agreed text and the programme should then be able to enter into force by 1 January 2007.
I can assure you that once the programme is adopted the Commission will take all necessary steps to implement it as efficiently and as effectively as possible.
Indeed, my services are already actively preparing its entry into force.
We will work in close cooperation with the Programme Committee and in close dialogue with the organisations involved in this programme.
I would like to finish by repeating what Mr Takkula said, i.e. that culture forms the basis for our societies, which is why we defined the legal base for this programme in combination with the culture-related Article 151 of the Treaty.
It was the subject of many discussions, but I believe it is the right proposal and the right line to take, for future culture and citizenship to go hand in hand towards responsibility on all levels of our public and private engagement in our lives, as well as in the spheres of enlargement and the future of our Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with a word of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, for this very fine report on 'Europe for Citizens'.
Now that the overall amount has been reduced to EUR 190 million from the EUR 235 million that this House and the Commission originally agreed on, that is the amount with which, for lack of any understanding on the Council's part, we are obliged to manage.
We support the rapporteur's two amendments, one of which aims for a 2% decrease, and the other at an increase by the same amount.
We are particularly glad to see that the new Action 4, which has to do with memorials, keeps alive the memory not only of the crimes committed by the Nazi regime but also of those committed under Stalin.
I would, however, Commissioner, like to address one other problem, one that has been raised by those who benefit from the programmes and by those who run them.
This House wishes to point out that its resolution of 5 April 2006 referred to both conferences and seminars, and the bilateral seminars - working parties and meetings of experts - are essential components of the partnership effort in terms of qualifying the programmes and those who work on them, and grants should be available for them in the same way that they are for multilateral conferences.
Furthermore, this House takes it as read that the Commission will, in the course of the applications procedure, accord equal treatment to local authorities and civil society organisations, and the object of that is that the Commission should be prevented from doing as had originally been planned and imposing additional requirements - such as guarantees and special bank sureties - on too many other social organisations, which they would find it difficult, indeed impossible, to meet.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, for his excellent report and for his good cooperation.
I welcome this programme with open arms, for it will benefit the public, us in this House and the European Union as a whole.
After all, the Europe for Citizens programme finally indicates that the citizens should not be there for Europe but the other way round. Europe is there for its citizens.
Only when the European Union obtains concrete results for its citizens can we count on support for this European Union.
Needless to say, we can try to enhance the bonding process between our citizens and the EU by organising exchange programmes and events, but it is always more successful if the citizens come up with their own initiatives, which is where this programme comes in.
I am grateful to Mr Takkula, to my fellow Members in all the groups, as well as to the Commission and Council, for the good working relationship we have enjoyed in dealing with this dossier.
There is, however, something that I need to get off my chest.
The European Union has recognised that there is a chasm between its citizens and the institutions.
This programme is in recognition of this and tries to make amends in this respect.
Why then, have we skimped on this programme and other vitally important programmes?
Talking about citizen involvement without injecting money into it is, of course, a waste of time.
I will in any event do all I can to promote this programme to people in the Netherlands.
I hope that other Members will bring this programme to people's attention in their own countries too.
If we all made a huge success of it, next time, the Council and the Commission may have no choice but to increase the budget of the Europe for Citizens programme to an acceptable level.
There is no doubt that the Europe for Citizens programme can become a success.
In Europe, there are many people who are prepared to actively work on Europe's integration.
This programme allows them to take part in the process and get organising.
It is, therefore, enormously important for the European citizens to have the sense of being involved in the EU's development.
That is what this programme makes possible.
My appeal to the citizens of Europe is therefore that they seize that opportunity.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work in producing this report on the promotion of active European citizenship.
Many of us who genuinely care about the future of Europe believe that active citizenship will play an important role in the continuation of the European project. The EU is a work in progress; progress from centuries of division to a time of mutual cooperation.
That mutual cooperation is for the benefit of all our citizens. Otherwise the EU has no raison d'Ãªtre.
It is also important to understand that this mutual cooperation is not just between Member States.
That is certainly important, but it is not enough.
There must also be mutual cooperation between our citizens so that they too are an integral part of the process - not as an audience, but as actors on the stage; not as observers but as participants.
We are looking here at participative democracy alongside representative democracy - sometimes an uneasy alliance on both sides, but one we must promote because otherwise we just pay lip service to our citizens, and they deserve much better than that.
I am pleased to see the inclusion of non-formal education programmes in this report.
Perhaps we might extend that to the recognition of volunteering activities through the provision of a European volunteering passport.
Volunteering plays an important role in active citizenship because many of the activities earmarked in the report, such as town twinning, civil society organisations and amateur sports organisations, involve volunteer participation.
Intercultural dialogue must also be supported.
All of us have our prejudices, our misconceptions about others, and it is only by engaging with each other that we begin to recognise each other's humanity; and that is the foundation of mutual cooperation and mutual respect.
My only regret is that the funding provided will not be sufficient to accomplish the huge and important task we have set ourselves.
However, I agree with the previous speaker: let us roll up our sleeves and get on with it.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Takkula.
I am delighted that there has been a rethink in the naming of the programme, originally called 'Citizens for Europe', and that it is now called 'Europe for Citizens'.
This means that the onus is on Europe, too, and that it must reach out to the public.
The aim is to reach and involve citizens, to meet them locally, to take them seriously, to listen to their concerns and to win them over to Europe and the debate on its future.
Town-twinning activities are a good means of contributing to this.
A general discussion on European globalisation blues will also form part of the debates within this programme, however, as will the question as to how we can strike a balance between excessive neoliberalism on the one hand, and statism or excessive protectionism on the other.
I should like to mention a further point, namely the inclusion of extermination camps - be they Stalinist or Nazi - in this programme.
I believe that a further reappraisal of the history of this particular European totalitarianism, which destroyed Europe and brought great unhappiness to the whole world, is politically appropriate.
Learning the appropriate lessons from this and building a genuinely open and democratic Europe remains one of our challenges for the future.
The programme is also intended to make a contribution to this.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) We share the concerns and the objectives of the 'Europe for Citizens' programme and accordingly voted in favour.
The truth of the matter is that this European Union is short of neither 'Europe for businesses' nor 'Europe for the market'.
Far from it, in fact.
We have had far too little 'Europe for citizens', too little support for a European citizenship with an active voice in the major themes on which we are building our shared territory.
In this area, decisions lack courage, laws are thin on the ground and support is virtually non-existent.
This programme alone will not in itself reverse this situation.
We support the programme, but we are also critical of its budgetary weakness.
A 60% cut on the original proposal is clearly excessive, but very much in keeping with the restrictive and outdated rule whereby all programmes in the field of education, culture and youth are underfunded.
Chronic underfunding is not the result of any scarcity of resources, but of a deliberate policy strategy on the type of Union that the Member States want to construct, which resurfaced when the financial perspective for 2007-2013 was adopted, to the detriment of areas such as culture.
There is no such thing as effective policy without adequate funding.
Words and good intentions are all well and good, but the policy must be much more than this.
Mr President, Mr Takkula, we agree with you as regards your preference for transparency in granting funding for projects.
This should be based on clear criteria with open application procedures and impartial adjudicators.
Unfortunately, this has not been the case.
We are pleased to note that we will gradually see an end to the scandal of funding being granted outside the application system to organisations that place themselves above fair competition and are still receiving substantial long-term funding.
This damages the Union's image.
The fact that these organisations are often associated with important personalities who made their careers in the European institutions only makes matters worse.
I come from a southern European country and I must say I warmly welcome the fresh air blowing in from the north in relation to this issue.
Lastly, as regards the new line of funding on memorials to dictatorships, I should like once again to express our complete opposition to the criteria that have been followed.
The exclusion of memorials to dictatorships that for decades oppressed various peoples in the south of Europe shows a lack of respect for the thousands of victims of these dictatorships.
Without the victory over the fascist regimes of southern Europe, the borders of the EU would be quite different today, and its territory smaller.
The exclusion of these dictatorships, and of the memory of them, sends out the wrong message to the citizens, suggesting, as it does, that there are some dictatorships whose memory should not be forgotten and others that are not so bad or even acceptable.
It also sends out the wrong message to the world.
A pragmatic attitude to dictatorships is indicative of double standards, and poisons and discredits the EU's external policy.
A criterion based on unambiguously democratic principles would have been better than a mediocre, mean-spirited criterion that was unable to look beyond the scarcity of funding.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, we are all playing our part in the creation of the European Union, but we bring with us our own particular outlook, experience and observations.
These make it clear that, although we have much in common, there is also much that divides us.
Many European citizens are sceptical about the Union and dubious about European integration.
As a result, whilst some are seeking ways of rapidly bringing about European integration, others feel that if this process has to take place at all, it must do so slowly and be carefully thought through.
They feel it should be a long-term process that respects national traditions and takes account of contemporary experience.
I welcome the fact that the Europe for Citizens Programme contains many of the suggestions made by Members of this House, in particular in the part concerning memorials to the victims of dictatorship.
Financial support is available for places linked to the Nazi regime and also for memorials to the victims of Stalinist crimes.
Much was said during the debate on the programme about how little the citizens identify with the process of European integration.
A distinction was rightly drawn between citizens of the old, new and future Member States.
Insufficient consideration was given, however, to the important fact that, while one group aims to create a single 'one size fits all' European model of national identity as quickly as possible, another inclines towards a Europe of nations, where the sense of national identity would be respected.
The latter group would determine common cultural values on the basis of cultural diversity and dialogue.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the draft document on 'Europe for Citizens' is an example of detailed wishful thinking.
Someone dreamt up the idea that if more money were invested in awareness raising, informing and including Europeans in Union events, the citizens would be brought closer to the Union and involved in European integration.
A similar argument was adduced in the Soviet sphere of influence, where our lives were dominated by the single orthodox Socialist ideology.
It was believed that pouring money into events would guarantee the development of so-called Socialist awareness.
The Soviet system tried hard to create a single orthodox Soviet identity in the minds of Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians and others.
Nations were deprived of their right to their own distinctive identity.
Someone has now decided that it will be easier to integrate Europeans if the relevant document is entitled 'Europe for Citizens' instead of 'Citizens for Europe'.
We have seen all this before.
Soviet citizens were not supposed to be for the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union was supposed to be for them.
What was actually the case was that, for Lenin, Stalin and others, people thinking and acting as Russians, Poles or Hungarians were a hindrance.
People brought up in Soviet multiculturalism were more malleable and more amenable to becoming slaves in the service of the empire.
We would do well to remember that the genuine freedom of individuals and nations arises out of national cultures where it has its source.
That is why this document should be consigned to the dustbin along with the legacy of the former Soviet Union.
Mr President, our sense of citizenship, like our sense of identity, arises from our history, our culture, our language and our experience of life.
It comes from the bottom up.
This citizenship programme is top-down. It seeks to create a sense of citizenship where none exists.
As such, it is doomed to fail and it is wholly improper.
I was born a British citizen.
I never asked to be a European citizen.
I do not want European citizenship and I totally reject and repudiate it.
The European Constitution, which incorporates the concept of EU citizenship, has been roundly rejected in France and Holland, and it would be rejected if it were voted on in the United Kingdom.
The promotion of this failed concept is therefore highly contentious.
We are using taxpayers' money to promote one side of a hotly disputed debate, and that is wrong, undemocratic and disgraceful.
I call on colleagues to reject this report out of hand.
Mr President, it is a very important achievement to have a common position adopted by the Council on this 'Europe for Citizens' programme and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, on his work and dedication and, in particular, for improving the scope of the programme.
I want to dwell on two aspects of the programme: town twinning and the memorials to the victims of the twin dictatorships of Hitler and Stalin.
I would urge Commissioner FigeÄŸ to coordinate his work with that of his colleague, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, who is responsible for information and public relations, in order to maximise the impact of this extremely important report and programme.
Firstly, on the town-twinning movement, I could not disagree more with the previous speaker.
In my own country there are town-twinning associations which have existed for 50 years and others which have been newly founded.
I wish that the Commissioners - because they are the only people who can do it - would give fair, free and open publicity to the dedication and voluntary work of these organisations.
To hear in my own county town of Hertford, the German, French, British and European anthems sung by local citizens and by school children was infinitely more eloquent than the absurd anti-European propaganda that we are given to digest in much of our popular press.
We are in a battle for the hearts and minds of public opinion and we cannot allow the sceptics simply to have the best tunes.
We have got the best tune, but we have to proclaim it.
Secondly, on the memorials, I am delighted that Mr Takkula has included the victims of Stalinist crimes, because half our European Union was subject to that dictatorship, and just imagine the disbelief of new citizens of the European Union that their suffering should be neglected, whereas those who suffered from Hitler's Third Reich should be commemorated.
Therefore, I commend this report and this programme to Parliament and the entire European Union and let us hope that this time we win the argument.
Mr President, Hungary has commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution.
Old women and men remember the revolutionary events they witnessed, and young people try to image what happened 50 years ago when the anti-Stalinist revolution united the Hungarians, the reformed communists and the democrats.
But some thousand extreme right-wing rioters changed everything last night.
They attacked the police, burned down shops, some of them threw stones and bottles at a synagogue, shouting anti-Semitic slogans under the banner of the Hungarian Nazi movement.
These tragic events show us how important it is to remember, and to allow us to remember, the tragedies and crimes of the 20th century.
Mr Takkula's report rightly calls upon us to commemorate the victims of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes.
But it is not enough to commemorate: we have to combat present-day extremist ideologies as well.
Stalinism is over, thank God; but the danger of the neo-Nazi extremists is still alive.
Every democratic party has to condemn extreme right-wing ideologies and violence.
We have to learn from the lesson of the Weimar Republic.
The smallest concession to the extreme right could lead to huge tragedies.
(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eurobarometer data are extremely worrying.
Most EU citizens are unfamiliar with the Union's institutional system.
The Commission's role is seen as either vague or very vague.
The Council is virtually unknown as an institution.
The citizens' perceptions are extremely muddled.
Many citizens are incapable of expressing a considered opinion on Europe.
There is one salient fact running through these data: the citizens want more information and have chosen television as the best means to receive that information.
We have seen that theoretical or bland citizenship, some vague feeling of belonging, makes Europe weaker.
Europe is viewed more as an abstraction than an important presence in our lives.
What we need is not theoretical or bland citizenship, but strong, practical citizenship, a feeling of loyalty, a feeling that Europeans can identify with a Community whose destiny is encapsulated in its universal values.
Without this feeling of loyalty and identification, no political project can succeed.
Citizenship is the biggest challenge facing a post-national society such as Europe.
European citizenship is a product of reason, not of tradition.
It needs to be constructed; it is not born spontaneously.
This is a new political era, one characterised by sharing and by new forms of governance.
It is indeed a time in which the sovereignty of States has shifted to a sovereignty of people.
Be that as it may, how ironic is it that the policy does not encourage people to identify with a project that places them at the centre?
The Citizens for Europe Programme does not provide an adequate budget or an incisive enough information strategy.
Publicity about the institutions - especially on television - showing the institutions and the European project must not be delayed any further.
Explaining Europe is vital in forming a feeling for Europe.
- (SL) The greatest achievement of the European Union to date has been guaranteeing peace and coexistence amongst the nations of Europe.
However, critics of the European Union frequently complain that the work carried out by European institutions is too expensive and too remote from its citizens.
The 'Europe for Citizens' programme offers new initiatives that will help to bring European citizens closer together, including those who are not enrolled in any type of formal education but who wish to gain new knowledge and experience and forge contacts with other citizens of the European Union.
Participation in this programme is open to twin towns, so the programme will also be accessible to the kind of people who do not take part in major European Union projects every day.
However, indirect contact and personal experience can contribute appreciably to an understanding of the Union, as I have noticed when I have met groups from Slovenia who are visiting the European Parliament.
Sport, too, has a great power to unify and can communicate across linguistic boundaries.
Participation in top-level sport is fast becoming the preserve of an increasingly narrow circle of people.
This programme supports international participation by the wider masses.
Major projects bring major benefits, but smaller projects bring great pleasure to many individuals.
The programmes will be all the more successful if citizens can access them easily and if they do not have to fill in mountains of forms every time they make an application.
Our citizens often become disenchanted with the European Union precisely because they encounter too many administrative obstacles when attempting to secure funding.
This is why we must endeavour, when offering worthwhile programmes, to streamline procedures and to ensure greater awareness of such funds and easier access to them, at both European and national level.
Member of the Commission. (SK) I would like to thank you for all your contributions and particularly for the commitment you have shown concerning the importance of working together as fellow citizens of the EU when dealing with certain issues or ideas.
The programme itself constitutes the legal basis for implementation and will define the conditions that the Commission too will be required to meet.
It is important that these conditions be known and implemented as soon as possible.
Parliament will be involved through the Steering Committee and programme evaluation.
As regards voluntary work and improvements in the recognition of informal education, we are interested in, and are striving for, progress in these areas, particularly from the perspective of young people.
This will be done through the Youth Pass, which should add greater transparency and value to voluntary work.
I agree that it is necessary to raise awareness of the results achieved so far, and of the successes and the nature of this cooperation, particularly, for example, in the area of cooperation between towns and cities.
More than 10 000 municipalities in the EU are cooperating under the civic programme.
Three weeks ago we awarded 11 golden stars for the best projects - those which are inspiring and which help real people solve real problems in towns and cities across the EU.
Such projects might be more widely copied if people were made more aware of them.
In this respect, I agree with Mr Beazley.
The programme will also provide opportunities for special events.
I would like to refer, for example, to last year's celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the Polish Solidarity Movement that were funded from a special budget line and heading.
It will be possible to implement this approach over the next seven years using the Citizenship Programme.
In conclusion, as well as a 'business-friendly' or 'market-friendly' Europe, we also have a real need for a 'citizen-friendly' Europe that is both well-disposed and helpful to its citizens, having as its foundations civil society and a certain degree of maturity.
I would also like to emphasise that the name of the programme is but one side of the coin, as the relationship between 'citizens for Europe' and 'Europe for Citizens ' is a very important one.
This is our space and at the same time it serves us.
We need to shape and develop this space and to take responsibility for it.
Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the entire Parliament for a very constructive approach to the programme.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Please allow me to offer my congratulations on the creation of the 'Europe for Citizens' Programme (2007-2013) and to congratulate Mr Takkula on the most recent version of the report.
Europe's institutional, social and political relationships today form a dense network, the threads of which have become even more closely interwoven since enlargement.
Forming active European citizens plays a key role in this process, and the presence of such citizens is indispensable in order to ensure the continued democratic and balanced development of the European Union.
If we are to have European citizens who take responsibility for themselves and their society, we need to emphasise what today are considered to be 'lost' values, such as freedom, fairness, tolerance and solidarity, which constitute the fundamental values and cohesive bond of European society.
I also consider the balanced integration of citizens to be important, but above all, I believe that we need to foster dialogue between different cultures and worldviews.
Only in this way can we work together toward a common goal, shaping our own visions while accepting the differences of others and respecting our diversity.
Only mutual understanding, solidarity and a sense of belonging can give the citizens of Europe a sense of identity.
I support the efforts to shape a European citizenry based on common values, history and culture.
It is important to promote and celebrate the values and achievements of today's citizens, while not allowing our memories of the past to sink into oblivion.
If we keep our common cultural heritage at the forefront, we will strengthen the foundations of our shared future.
In my view, European citizenship means nothing other than taking responsibility for ourselves, our country and the European Union, and freely exercising our rights while respecting the same rights of others.
The right balance must also be struck between democratic rights and obligations.
This is a common European citizenship of which I would be pleased to be part.
Annex - Commission statement
The Commission should like to draw the legislative authority's attention to the need for the financial package mentioned in the basic act to be expressed at current prices, and for this to be done no later than its final publication in the OJ.
This corresponds to the standard budgetary practice and will help to ensure, with all due transparency, that the legislative authority's decision is complied with.
For the programme in question, the sum at current prices amounts to EUR 215 million.
Restrictions on the marketing and use of perfluorooctane sulfonates (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Schlyter, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council C6-0418/2005 relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of perfluorooctane sulfonates (amendment to Council Directive 76/769/EEC).
Vice-President of the Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his hard work on this proposal, which has made it possible to reach agreement with the Council at first reading.
This is an important directive. It is concerned with restricting the marketing and use of perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS) and related substances.
These substances are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. They have the potential to cause unacceptable risks to human health and the state of the environment.
The proposed Directive is based on specific risk assessments and impact assessments of possible measures.
It takes into account detailed discussions with all interested parties.
The Directive prohibits in principle, with very limited derogation, the marketing and use of PFOS and related substances.
Derogations are envisaged for essential applications in small quantities, which do not pose any unacceptable risks according to the opinion of the Commission's Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks.
Large-scale uses - for example in the field of textiles and carpets - have already been discontinued by industry, and this Directive will reliably prevent the reintroduction of such uses.
The proposed Directive will not only ensure the protection of human health and of the environment, but also serve to strengthen the internal market, as it introduces Community-wide harmonised rules for the marketing and use of PFOS and related substances.
With regard to the derogations contained in the proposal, I agree that the use of PFOS and related substances should continue to be permitted in photoresists and photographic materials, when plating with hexavalent chromium and other metals, and in hydraulic fluids, as the risks connected with these uses are acceptable since there are no equivalent alternatives and it is not certain that the toxicological profiles of the alternatives are any better.
With regard to fire-fighting foams, I can agree that the marketing and use of new foams should be prohibited and that a period of 54 months should be granted for the continued use of existing stocks.
On the other hand, I am not prepared, at present, to support the extension of the envisaged restrictions to other perfluorinated alkyl compounds such as PFOA, as this would be premature given the absence of a completed risk assessment and of sufficient knowledge of current uses and alternatives, but we can return to this subject.
By way of conclusion, I should like to say that the transformation process has benefited greatly from the close cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Commission can therefore endorse all the compromise amendments proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter.
rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs for their very sound and constructive cooperation.
It made it possible to find a solution at first reading together with the Council, which also did some good work on this issue.
This solution improves on the Commission's original proposal, and I am pleased to see that the Commission too is now backing the compromise.
PFOS and PFOS-related substances are highly fluorinated and extremely difficult to break down.
They are additionally very bioaccumulative.
We have become aware that chloro-organic compounds are poisonous and cause problems in the environment and we have observed that bromo-organic compounds are hazardous.
Fire retardants pose a bigger threat than the fires they were designed to prevent.
It is now the turn of fluoro-organic compounds.
They are extremely stable, and the bond between the fluorine and carbon is the strongest in organic chemistry.
The properties of stability and surface activity are what have made PFOS a much sought-after chemical.
It has, as the Commissioner says, been used for many years in surface treatment for chemicals and textiles.
The largest manufacturer realised the risks posed to its workers and to the consumers of its products.
Its workers had high levels of the chemical in their bodies, and it decided to withdraw the PFOS product Scotchguard from the market.
The Commission's aim with this proposal was to prevent the re-introduction of PFOS, but the compromise goes further.
We now have tougher concentration regulations and we are setting the limit for preparations at 0.005%.
This is reasonable, given that its very properties as a surfactant mean that PFOS is used in low concentrations.
If the limit were set at 0.1%, there would be a risk of more applications slipping through the legislative net.
The definition of surfaces at 1 microgram per square metre shares the same purpose.
Under the compromise with the Council, PFOS is also prohibited in fire-fighting foams.
This is entirely logical.
There are already alternatives on the market that do not contain fluoro-organic compounds.
It is also appropriate to phase out stocks, and, in the compromise, Parliament has extended this phasing-out period to 54 months.
Everyone has a vested interest in hastening the phase-out.
The large oil fire in the UK that resulted in millions of litres of water being contaminated with PFOS showed the costs of using PFOS.
The only way to destroy PFOS is by high-temperature combustion.
Everyone can see for themselves how much work is involved in burning millions of litres of water at high temperature.
Chromium plating is the other big area.
In this field, the proposal restricts the use of non-decorative hard chromium-plating using hexavalent chromium as the process implement.
This exception, moreover, is to be reviewed after an inventory of existing essential uses, which is to be carried out by the Member States within two years.
In this area too there are alternatives, such as bigger, enclosed systems, better ventilation and in the future, I hope, also other processes.
As far as other exceptions such as photolithography processes and anti-reflective coating and industrial treatments for photographic film are concerned, the quantities in question are very small.
Even so, these exceptions too will cease to apply once alternatives are technically and financially feasible.
I would also like to speak about PFOA, which refers to the acids and salts of the same group of substances.
In Germany, many people in the Ruhr area know what it is like to have contaminated water.
People now have to take their drinking water from tanker vehicles, which is a costly and unsustainable solution.
We can attempt to stop these contaminants by means of the codicil that has been added to the compromise on PFOA, according to which the Commission is to analyse and continuously take stock of progress on alternatives.
Once there are reliable alternatives, these will replace PFOA.
I believe that we are ahead of our time here.
We must get to grips with this matter because the next great environmental issue may be fluoro-organic chemistry and the various forms thereof.
This is a first step towards protecting people and the environment from a number of these substances.
I would also point out that this is a first reading agreement and that if Parliament were now to support this compromise, that would also mean that the Council would support it and that we should be ready before REACH enters into force.
This agreement would then form an annex to REACH.
If we were unable to succeed with this agreement tomorrow, the proposal would simply fall, as REACH would then take over.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I hope that we are on the way to a first reading agreement.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his excellent cooperative work on this report.
I was delighted to hear that the Commission agrees with all our rapporteur's compromise amendments.
It augurs well, indeed, for a first reading agreement.
Perfluorooctane sulfonates - PFOS - are chlorinated compounds with numerous applications in consumer products such as textiles and paper, are known for their repellent properties, amongst others, and are used daily in many consumer products.
They also have some specific industrial applications in products as wide-ranging as microchips, fire-fighting foams, chromium plating and hydraulic fluids used in aviation.
These chemical substances are known to be very toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative.
We have achieved several important changes to the draft proposal, which will bring greater protection for human health and the environment, especially in the area where the maximum threshold for the amount of PFOS that can be placed on the market as a substance or preparation has been substantially reduced from the Commission's original proposal.
I welcome the inclusion of PFOA - perfluorooctanic acid - in the scope of this directive.
According to a recent OECD survey, the substance has a similar structure and toxicity to PFOS and thus should be phased out accordingly.
Industry has voluntarily proposed to limit the use of PFOA by 2014, which in itself is a clear sign that our instincts were right to insist on its inclusion in the legislation.
The changes introduced by this House have improved the proposal, and Mr Schlyter's report is both balanced and objective.
The report recognises that limited specific use derogations are needed for critical applications of substances for which no alternative currently exists, for example PFOS is essential in very small quantities in the semi-conductor sector and in hydraulic fluids used in aviation.
The fact that the phasing-out of these will be based on a case-by-case review, taking into account new information on details of uses and on safer alternatives, is a constructive and realistic way to encourage the affected industries to actively seek alternatives.
In conclusion, it appears that this piece of legislation will go through under the Finnish Presidency and we can avoid tying these toxic chemicals up in the REACH queue.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) I welcome the compromise package drawn up by the Council and the European Parliament, which in many respects tightens the Commission's proposal.
It is good to see that Parliament is so united on the question of banning or limiting a dangerous substance.
Health, the protection of the environment and the desire for a healthy life are more important than the narrow interests of industry.
There is no longer any doubt as to the problem posed by chemical substances.
Stricter regulation is necessary in the area of chemicals, and this is indeed the focus of REACH, which seeks to regulate not merely one particular substance but some 30 000 compounds.
As regards today's proposal, it has been scientifically proven that perfluorooctane sulfonate is a hazardous substance.
It endangers human health and is a persistent substance, one that does not biodegrade and is bio-accumulative, that is, it builds up in the body's cells.
Its use must therefore be restricted.
I consider it an achievement that the substance is being banned in more areas than in the original proposal, and in other areas it can remain in use only during a period of transition.
In the case of dangerous fires, fire-fighting foam may continue to be used for some time.
If it is a question of saving human lives, then naturally we must use whatever is at hand.
Over the longer term, however, it is vital that the chemical be replaced by substances that are not harmful to the human body.
I consider it particularly forward-looking that the substitution principle has been built into this directive, which means - as everyone is no doubt aware - that the toxic chemical must be replaced by a different, harmless substance, and that research on and the introduction of such a substance is the responsibility of the manufacturer.
Over the longer term, therefore, the use of PFOS will only be permitted where its replacement is impossible, and where it does not come into direct contact with the human body.
I hope that those who will now vote for the substitution principle in this directive will also vote for the substitution principle for other compounds as contained in the REACH directive.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his constructive cooperation.
It is well known that the two of us do not always see eye to eye, but I welcome the fact that a vote is to be held tomorrow on a compromise that will enable agreement at first reading.
I also welcome the fact that the compromise disregards a number of the demands made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety such as the precipitate inclusion of PFOA without a prior risk assessment.
The toxicity of PFOS is undisputed, including by industry.
After all, industry took it upon itself to dispense with the use of PFOS in particularly critical applications such as consumer goods.
Some sectors at the top end of the value-added chain, such as the aviation, aerospace and semiconductor industries, cannot dispense with the use of PFOS at present, however.
A ban on PFOS or a derogation involving strict time limits would deprive some high-technology sectors of planning security.
The Commission proposal already lays down appropriate derogations for this, and it is essential that these be retained until there is a suitable substitute.
The problem with PFOS is not the use of the substance in these sectors, however, but the fact that it is still found in old textiles such as carpets and clothing and reaches the environment via these.
I should like to make some concluding remarks on EU chemicals policy with regard to the forthcoming REACH debate.
EU chemicals legislation must strike a balance between the socio-economically appropriate use of certain substances and high environmental standards.
As with PFOS, derogations must always be possible where there are no suitable alternatives.
After all, the objective of chemicals policy must be the safe, risk-based handling of chemicals rather than the ideological policy of complete chemical bans.
I hope that the Commissioner will remain committed to a sound chemicals policy in future, too.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to decide on the restriction of the hazardous and harmful substances perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and the closely-related perfluorooctanic acid (PFOA).
I am especially pleased that there is such broad support for the sterling work done by my compatriot Mr Schlyter.
Good work, Carl!
I think that we need to remember this shared vision when, later this autumn, we take another extremely important decision - both for the environment and for our health - namely that relating to the chemicals legislation known as REACH.
I hope that on that occasion we will again see great support across the political spectrum from left to right and from the Commission to the Council of Ministers.
As already mentioned, PFOS is a hazardous substance.
It is bioaccumulative, which means that it stays in the environment and our bodies for a long time.
A study of people from 17 countries by the World Wide Fund for Nature found that PFOS and six other perfluorinated compounds were present in people's bodies.
It is thus high time that there was a restriction.
I am therefore pleased to see that Mr Schlyter and an in principle unanimous Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety have tightened up the threshold value for how much PFOS may be in use in the market.
I would also have liked to see the committee adding in clearer specifications of dates for when PFOS is to be phased out from the market.
Apart from this reservation, this is, in my opinion, an excellent report that I and my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, look forward to voting in favour of.
I would like to finish where I began.
For Parliament to place restrictions on substances that are hazardous to health and to the environment is a good thing. It is also absolutely wonderful that there is such broad support for these measures.
I hope, therefore, that we can keep this in mind when we decide on REACH later this autumn.
Let us also, on that occasion, see broad support for powerful legislation on chemicals.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to echo the previous speakers' thanks to the rapporteur.
Ladies and gentlemen, imagine you are the mother or father of a young child, and your district health authority tells you the drinking water that you yourself have been drinking for months, even years, is no longer to be used for preparing baby foods or for your children on account of very high concentrations of PFOS.
Imagine you are the mayor of a medium-sized town and have to spend several million euro in public funds - taxpayers' and fee payers' money - on removing the PFOS from drinking-water supplies.
Then you would certainly have a major problem.
This is what happened a few weeks ago in my electoral region, South Westphalia.
We have major problems with PFOS, and the cause does not lie at local level.
Instead, we have found that the trail of this massive contamination leads to other Member States - probably Belgium and the Netherlands.
There is a high likelihood, therefore, of problems of the kind currently faced by parents and local-government officials in my region occurring in many other regions of Europe, too, when one looks more closely.
For this reason, we must now ascertain the exact cause in this specific case and, in the event that declarations have been altered illegally, we must investigate this.
We must also tackle the root of the problem, however, as the concentration is particularly high in this case.
This substance has even been found in Antarctica and at the source of the Rhine, where there is no industry whatsoever.
We have to look at this very carefully.
That is why I am pleased that we have managed to elaborate and improve the Commission proposal, and that we have deleted a number of unjustified derogations - such as the one for fire-fighting foams, for which there are alternatives.
We have now reached a good compromise, and should support it.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schlyter rightly deserves our congratulations for his excellent report, which I fully support.
Arguably the most important aspect of this legislative proposal is that the story of PFOS is unfortunately one of shame for EU and international consumer protection, and one that should never be allowed to be repeated.
Although PFOS were well known to be persistent bioaccumulative toxic compounds, they were extensively used in numerous consumer products and in various industrial applications for decades.
This has resulted in the irreversible contamination of the environment and of both animals and humans.
Let us all hope that the directive under consideration here will be fully implemented as soon as possible, but let us at the same time remember that appropriate legislation will also be needed to deal with the hundreds of other perfluorinated compounds which are also very toxic and which today are more or less freely allowed to poison us and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to Mr Schlyter for his report, which shows great commitment.
PFOS, a halogenated hydrocarbon, is toxic to humans, and also both carcinogenic and mutagenic.
There are no scientific limit values for this category of substances, only empirical threshold values.
These substances are not biodegradable, they are fat soluble and, once produced, they persist almost indefinitely.
In addition, once they have been absorbed by the human body, it is virtually impossible for it to eliminate them.
It is highly likely that PFOA has a very similar or identical effect in medical and toxicological terms, even though the body of scientific data on this does not yet have any conclusive evidential value.
REACH will probably apply to this, and the substitution principle will play a decisive role, although, personally, I always have reservations about this.
For all my enthusiasm for the economy and for value added, as a Christian I do not want to balance value added against human life.
I am alarmed by the values of these chemicals measured in both marine and freshwater fish.
Now - rightly and with a clear conscience - we are going further than the original proposal of the Commission and the Council.
The threshold value has been lowered massively by almost two powers of ten.
The number of derogations for chromium plating has been reduced significantly.
Logically, the derogation for fire-fighting foams has been deleted, as unlimited quantities of these can be released into the environment.
The derogation for closed systems has been deleted, as it is scarcely possible to prove that these are sealed.
On the whole, I should like to express my thanks for the constructive cooperation I have enjoyed, and above all for the speed at which this issue has been dealt with, since we were able to reach a workable compromise in less than three months.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to discuss the issue of PFOA briefly, and then go on to make a very fundamental point.
The final decision has not yet been taken in the matter of PFOA.
It was not possible to include a ban on these substances in the Directive, as we are not in possession of a satisfactory risk assessment or an impact assessment.
An international risk assessment is being carried out at present at OECD level, however.
Naturally, we shall look at the results carefully and make any necessary proposals.
I live in the same German Land as the honourable Member Mr Liese and have been following the case he described myself with great interest.
All I can say today is that, although the investigations by the German authorities have not been concluded, I have the very strong impression that this is a case of environmental crime, plain and simple.
Contrary to the law in force, toxic substances have been introduced into the environment.
Whether these Directives could have prevented this is a different story.
Nevertheless, I think it important that Mr Liese referred to this case, as it confirms explicitly once more the kind of risks he described.
In a modern industrial society, it is inevitable that we have to live with certain risks.
The question as to which risks we consider acceptable and which we do not is one on which we have to keep deciding anew.
There is a series of assessment benchmarks that can help us make this decision.
I should like to mention one risk that I do not accept - and here I am speaking as the Commissioner for Industry.
I do not accept the argument that we must accept the risk of highly toxic substances in our environment because investments have been made.
I do not accept the argument that we must accept such substances because they lead to revenue generation.
I do not even accept the argument - even if this does not make me any friends - that we must use these substances so that jobs are not lost.
I consider wholly inappropriate this comparison between jobs in industry and the use of toxic substances for which alternatives exist.
In situations such as this, the decision can only be to protect human beings and the environment unconditionally from avoidable risks.
This is the line that underlies my policy, at least, on all these issues.
The House will notice this when we come to discuss the most important, extensive and modern chemicals legislation in the world - namely REACH - shortly in plenary.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Third-country anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard action (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the annual report from the Commission to the European Parliament on third country anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard action against the Community (2004).
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 2004 annual report on third-country anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard action, presented by the Commission services, has uncovered a piece of information that has raised a number of concerns within our parliamentary committee.
It appears from the report that there has been an abnormal increase in the number of trade protection cases, involving both traditional users of these measures and more recently developed WTO member states.
In many cases, WTO rules and case-law have been partially or completely disregarded, causing damage to Community industry.
For the developed countries, led by the United States, major problems arise as a result of the unilateral and half-hearted application of WTO rules.
For some emerging countries, the application of countervailing duties is not intended to counteract illegal practices, but to give their local industries extra protection against European imports.
In many cases, the investigating standards are low and raise a number of questions as to their full compliance with WTO rules.
The Commission report relates some of those significant cases, namely the 'Zeroing' case with the United States, the Indian anti-dumping cases, the South American and Austrian farming cases and, in general, the extensive and unfair use of safeguards.
In many of the cases brought against the European Community, the Community has succeeded in obtaining a satisfactory settlement for resolving the disputes within the WTO.
Nevertheless, a success such as that often comes too late, and irreparable damage is done to European industry.
Faced with the picture presented to us by the Commission in its report, the Committee on International Trade could have acted on instinct and suggested adopting the same methods and behaviour as those trade partners that violate the anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard rules, but it has not done so.
We are in fact convinced that respect for the trade rules established at international level and within a multilateral framework is the mainstay of economic growth and, more generally, of the peaceful relationship between nations.
Two wrongs never make a right.
Having established that, we should like to reaffirm that the rules must be applied and that, if they are not applied, corresponding sanctions must be swiftly imposed in order to guarantee that the law is upheld.
If they are not swiftly applied, the damage will be irreparable.
In defence of the law and of that sector of European industry that feels unfairly affected by unlawful measures, we call on the Commission to take a firm stand in pursuing the WTO negotiations, which are aimed at making other WTO members apply trade protection measures in a less arbitrary way, and to act as the promoter of actions aimed at having the decisions of the WTO dispute settlement body applied more swiftly and effectively.
These points should be included in the Doha Development Agenda if - as we hope - these negotiations are resumed.
We therefore call on the Commission to accord due importance to this matter as part of the initiatives aimed at increasing the external competitiveness of European industry, such as were recently announced by Mr Mandelson before the Committee on International Trade.
Finally, we recommend that the Commission refrain from giving preferential or special treatment to those trade partners that repeatedly fail to comply with WTO rules and case-law, giving rise to serious economic consequences for European industry.
The Committee on International Trade is of the opinion that, when faced with serious situations, we cannot remain completely passive.
If we want to gain the citizens' support for the new international trade rules, we need to strive for greater transparency, consistency and respect for the law on the part of all the actors, by implementing measures ranging from border controls to the application of common sanctions against those who trade in counterfeit or illegal goods on European soil.
We can associate the conclusions of this report with the recent Commission initiative in favour of a reform of the European Community's anti-dumping and anti-subsidy policy.
The aim of this reform is to restrict the use of these instruments by the Commission as part of the efforts to ensure that the Community interest is looked at more carefully and more extensively.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and the Committee on International Trade for the excellent work that they have done on this important issue.
The European Union is a major exporter worldwide and this leaves us exposed to trade defence actions by third countries.
When such actions are taken in compliance with WTO rules, we cannot and should not complain, and we do not.
However, that is not always the case and these actions can easily become a serious and unjustified impediment to our legitimate market access opportunities.
Therefore, we must closely monitor third-country actions against our exports and intervene to minimise the negative impact of such actions on our companies.
And we should certainly be vigilant.
Whenever possible we favour the diplomatic route, which is the quicker and the most efficient way to solve those issues when we have partners who wish to solve them.
But when diplomacy fails, we do not hesitate to resort to WTO panels, as it is our right to do.
Both the diplomatic and the litigation approaches have met with notable successes.
Take, for example, the Indian cases mentioned in the report.
Diplomacy has resulted in the removal of no fewer than 12 measures.
We also hope for significant success on the agricultural products cases that you have identified.
It is well known that the United States is a recurrent problem for us in this context.
It is pro-free trade, but its use of the trade defence instrument is seen by many as unreasonable on certain issues.
This has been particularly marked in the steel sector, where we have been arguing against certain practices for years on a large number of their dumping and subsidy measures.
We have had a considerable success in Geneva but, frankly, it is a long hard slog even getting them to implement the remedies to the disputes which they have lost.
We cannot solve everything through diplomacy or litigation.
This is why we welcome your support for the proposals we have tabled in the Doha Round to strengthen the rules and the disciplines governing the use of anti-dumping and countervailing measures.
The Round is suspended, something I deeply deplore and regret, but we are fighting hard to get it restarted.
For trade defence this would allow us to seek improved disciplines along the lines of the EU practice in this field, making it more difficult for countries to abuse the system, which I am afraid some are only too prepared to do.
We need tightened disciplines in the anti-dumping system.
We need greater transparency in the operation of trade defence instruments.
We need less arbitrariness on the part of governments. Such behaviour simply discredits the rules.
It brings the system into disrepute and it does not reflect credit on the multilateral trade system and its principal institution, the WTO.
We agree with you that the dispute settlement mechanism is an essential feature of the WTO system, which needs protecting, but we are working hard to improve it so that faster remedies can be achieved.
We will take the opportunity of any bilateral trade agreement with third countries to ensure that our partner countries take on specific obligations on the fair use of trade defence instruments.
This is not an alternative to strengthening and improving the rules at the WTO.
On the contrary, it underpins that.
It is a way of getting insurance in place, so that we can use all available methods to bring reason and discipline to the operation of these instruments.
This would particularly apply for those countries that abuse them the most.
Good practices are as important as good rules.
That is why the Commission's departments devote a great deal of time and resources to providing technical assistance to third countries that become new users of trade defence instruments.
Our aim is that they should apply them in a fair and balanced manner and in accordance with our own high standards.
These efforts seem to bear fruit.
The end of 2005 saw a welcome change from the trend of previous years, with a significant fall in the number of trade defence cases initiated against Community exporters, from 33 in 2004 to 19 in 2005.
Market access, including a fair and proper implementation of WTO trade defence instruments by our trading partners, features high on our priority list and we will continue to take any steps required to ensure that our exports are not unduly penalised.
Of course it is difficult to follow each and every case with our current resources and I would certainly like to do more for our exporters, in particular small and medium-sized companies, which often have little experience in this area.
The EU must remain an example that others can follow.
As the report recalls, we are viewed as a moderate user of trade defence instruments.
That reputation is deserved and that must remain so.
It is in that spirit that I recently launched a reflection process on how Europe's trade defence instruments such as the anti-dumping instrument operate in the modern global economy.
A broad public consultation will take place early in 2007, based on a Green Paper expected in the coming months.
This consultation will allow the Commission to draw on a wide range of views and identify whether there is scope to improve our rules and practices further.
Our trade defence instruments can make an important contribution to ensuring both free and fair trade, thereby stimulating our competitiveness.
This will involve strong and close cooperation with all stakeholders, including Member States and industry, and, I would add, the support and involvement of the European Parliament.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I welcome the general tone of both the Commission's and Mrs Muscardini's reports in wanting to see a world trading system that is as open and fair as possible.
However, when we consider the anti-dumping measures of third countries, we in the Community need to show moral leadership and avoid hypocrisy.
We can agree that trade defence mechanisms are often used as an excuse to protect domestic markets from competition; but we should also admit that the EU is sometimes guilty of using these mechanisms to protect uncompetitive companies from non-EU providers - shoes and textiles being recent examples.
Fortunately, we continue to be sparing users of these mechanisms.
With the potential collapse of the Doha development round, we must work with our trading partners to ensure that their legislation and practices comply as far as possible with WTO rules.
However, to have any moral authority in this area, our own anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations must be transparent and impartial.
I am concerned about the call for a Community approach to defend exporting SMEs faced with protectionism abroad.
During last year's 'bra wars', it was a so-called Community approach that suspended imports from China and caused SMEs in London's fashion industry to lose contracts and to provide compensation to clients left waiting for unfulfilled orders.
If that is a Community approach, then we in London want to see less of it.
When it comes to arbitration, I think we all agree that any ad hoc arbitration group should consist of relevant experts.
But we must ensure that any experts serving on these groups are experts in the sector being investigated who understand the structure of the industry and costs involved, not simply experts in more general trade issues.
Overall, I would like to congratulate both the Commission and the rapporteur on this report.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, the increase in international trade in recent years has led, among other things, to increased competition and has tempted many countries to resort to trade protection mechanisms in order to protect their markets.
It should not, therefore, come as a surprise that there have been increasing numbers of situations in which anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard measures have been adopted.
European exports, as the report before us clearly demonstrates, have been the target on a number of occasions of such measures on the part of third countries.
Such cases have risen alarmingly.
As well as the traditional countries, some of the new players to have arrived on the international trade relations scene are involved.
This phenomenon, which could significantly harm a number of European industries, must therefore be tackled seriously.
Such an approach entails, first and foremost, carefully separating cases in which the use of these instruments arises entirely from the legitimate implementation of the principles of fair trade relations from those in which their use is merely a legal smokescreen to cover up illegal protectionist measures in the very worst sense of the term.
This distinction can only be made completely clearly if we are committed to strengthening transparency in the processes aimed at assessing whether trade defence measures are being used legitimately or otherwise.
The aim is therefore to ensure complete compliance with the rules and the case law of the World Trade Organisation.
To this end, the Commission must channel its efforts into helping improve these procedures, thereby discouraging the illicit use of these instruments.
That being said, it is appropriate to mention the importance of the Commission's assistance to the Member States and to European industry in trade protection cases initiated by third countries.
This support is particularly significant for SMEs, which by nature are less well equipped to deal with situations of this kind.
Lastly, we welcome the fact that the Commission is ready to take an active role within the WTO in jointly reviewing the provisions regulating the adoption of trade protection instruments, with a view to stressing the value of multilateralism.
At no point in this debate, however, must it be forgotten that the EU is the most open trading area in the world and that the Europeans also have legitimate interests to safeguard.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Muscardini on this successful report.
Freedom of access to foreign markets is vital to large numbers of European enterprises.
This freedom of access does not exist in many cases today, with third countries hindering European enterprises' market access in downright breach of agreements or in contravention of the WTO rules.
In so doing, these third countries exploit the whole spectrum of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade skilfully to their advantage and our disadvantage.
The competitiveness of the European economy, and thus of the EU labour market, suffers tremendously as a result of these problems.
These actions on the part of some of our trade partners are unacceptable.
Commissioner, the EU cannot allow other countries to treat us like this.
All participants in world trade must abide by the rules. It also applies that the EU should not treat third countries like this.
We, too, must abide by all the rules in order to take credible action against rule-breakers without any open flanks.
Fair, free world trade is possible only if rules are in place that are binding and are observed by all parties without exception.
What is to be done, therefore?
I would call on the Commission to do everything possible to ensure that we Europeans abide by the rules.
I call on the Commission to take measures to protect our enterprises if it is established that individual trade partners have failed to abide by the rules.
I call on the Commission to make consistent use of the existing - or even an improved - dispute-settlement procedure here if, in specific cases, no amicable settlement has been reached in the short term.
We must focus our future efforts on ensuring that all trade partners abide by the rules.
Only if all parties, without exception, abide by the rules, can people draw long-term benefit from world trade.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for a very comprehensive report on the safeguard action taken by third countries against the European Union.
Unfortunately, a study of Mrs Muscardini's report and of the Commission's own report confirms that European trade policy gives undue consideration to protecting producers at the expense of consumers.
This is particularly true of the agricultural sector.
Import quotas, anti-dumping duties and administrative obstacles for agricultural products cost every European household approximately USD 1 500 a year.
Clearly, there are occasions when it may be permissible to impose protective measures, but only in very limited and clearly defined cases.
The circumstances in which they can be applied must be laid down in advance, and any decisions must be planned in good time and widely publicised, in order to enable entrepreneurs to make appropriate arrangements for their orders or supplies.
Unfortunately, market players are currently still paying too high a price for poorly planned trading policies and for sudden decisions to apply protective rates, which cause legal and commercial uncertainty and make it more difficult for those involved in trading to adjust quickly to any changes.
It is therefore very important for trade policy to be stable and predictable.
Preferential rates need to be understandable and easy to apply.
Their implementation should be widely discussed in advance with all trading partners, so that each entrepreneur is properly informed, and can feel certain of the future and of his or her orders.
I would like to conclude by saying a few words about trade with developing countries, the World Trade Organisation and the European Union.
Developing countries should be able to take advantage of all the opportunities arising from membership of the WTO.
These countries should be treated as equal partners.
It is therefore not acceptable for industrialised countries to protect the interests of large firms located mainly in the EU and in the USA.
(EL) Mr President, having congratulated the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and thanked the Commissioner for his detailed statement, I should like to say by way of introduction that maintaining and strengthening the competitiveness of the European Union in the new globalised environment requires, firstly, increased European intervention in third country markets and, secondly, effective protection from unfair trading practices by our partners.
The Community - and this has already been said - is still firmly a moderate user of trade defence instruments.
On the other hand, the constant increase in trade defence instruments against the Community is taking on worrying proportions.
The Union is - and must remain - an open market to international competition.
We are against protectionism.
At the same time, however, we are against distorting competition and against our partners' achieving competitive advantages by relying on underhand practices in infringement of international trade rules.
There is no sense in unilateral disarmament by the Union.
Trade 'pacifism' operates only when applied by all parties.
No one disputes that we are seeing increased use of trade defence instruments against the Community.
This being so, the Commission should keep a close watch and ensure that abusive and non-compliant measures are withdrawn, either through consultations and/or by taking recourse to the judicial bodies of the WTO as and where needed.
We are also seeing a comparatively large number of trade defence instruments against European agricultural products.
It is therefore the Commission's responsibility to ensure that the radical reforms of the CAP are taken into adequate account by our trade partners when activating anti-subsidy measures.
Mr President, I have never been a unilateral disarmer at any stage in my political career, in any context.
I have always been a multilateralist, whether it be in respect of disarmament or the putting in place of international rules to create institutions of global governance or in the design of processes to create agreements or to solve disputes in the world.
I bring those principles and that approach to this subject as I have done to others throughout my political career.
We have heard a call this evening for moral leadership.
The morality that I bring to this subject of trade is my belief in free trade.
I say it is moral because I believe that free trade is the best way to drive economic growth, to lever up living standards, to create opportunities for people and to attack poverty in our world.
That is what I call 'moral'.
However, one of the ways in which we 'morally' pursue free trade is by standing up for fair trade.
When I look around me and see the public disquiet, uncertainty and unhappiness about what is going on in the global economy and the sense that people feel increasingly insecure and threatened by the dramatic changes that are taking place in the architecture and landscape of the global economy, I see people beginning to question whether free trade is a good idea.
I see them beginning to wonder whether sheltering from the global economy would be better; whether erecting barriers between us and our trading partners might not be a better way of securing our jobs and our livelihoods.
I make a very strong argument against that reaction and instinct, but I will never help that argument against protectionism if I am seen to be or thought to be weak when it comes to standing up for the upholding and implementation of internationally agreed trade rules which stand out against anti-competitive behaviour, state interventions or trade distortions, which are designed to give one trading partner an unfair, unreasonable and unacceptable advantage in trade against another.
That is why it is appropriate and proper to operate trade defence instruments within the rules created by our multilateral institutions.
However, I would never want to see those rules used as a weapon against others' low-cost competition or against others' legitimate use of their comparative advantage.
That is not right and it is not acceptable, but nor, if I may say to Mr Kamall, was that the case either in respect of textiles or shoes.
Shoes, yes, was an anti-dumping measure, arrived at after considerable investigation, analysis, recommendation, discussion, debate and finally decision amongst our Member States, as it properly should be.
I would stand by the objectivity and the transparency with which that decision was arrived at, and it certainly was not adopted for protectionist purposes.
However, in the case of textiles, I never said it was unfair trading.
I never said that the fierce competition that we were facing in the case of textiles was as a result of price or market distortions by the Chinese.
I merely pointed to the fact that with the final lifting of quotas we in Europe were suddenly and unexpectedly faced with what amounted to an avalanche which, if it had not been resisted, would have had the likely effect of burying our market and severely distorting what people produce, how people sell, their profits, their livelihoods and, therefore, their jobs in such a sudden way that I believed it was appropriate - and, in the end, our Chinese trading partners also agreed that it was right and appropriate - to take voluntary cooperative measures to slow down the rapid increase in Chinese textile exports.
You are right that at all times, on all occasions and in all cases we should operate impartiality, transparency and truthfulness in the analysis we put forward, the conclusions we reach and how we seek to justify the measures we are advocating.
It is true, as Mrs Handzlik said, that any intervention of any sort in the market - legitimate, anti-dumping or other uses of trade defence instruments - is bound to create some uncertainty and weaken the ability of businesses to plan ahead.
Mr Kamall made a similar point.
I take this very seriously indeed, because I do not want my actions, as agreed by the Member States, to have the effect of making a bad situation worse by further disrupting or undermining the ability of companies to plan ahead and to organise their production, which, of course, is hampered if supply and production chains are undermined or disrupted by interventions such as these.
Therefore we must minimise the disruption.
One of the things I want to take very seriously in the context of our Green Paper and our examination of this matter, is how we can minimise disruption and offer the greatest possible predictability to companies that might be affected.
I just want to make this last point: Mr Caspary said - if I may elaborate on and embroider his words slightly - that we should keep to the rules and at all times seek to strengthen and improve them.
I agree with that.
That is precisely what we are doing in the DDA and why we have a multilateral system and process governing these rules and an institution that enables us to negotiate precisely the strengthening and the improvement that you advocate.
That is why the WTO system is so important.
I would just like to say in conclusion that, whatever disruptions, interventions, distractions or diversions we have in a trade agenda which is very wide and very complex, I will always keep my eyes very carefully focused on the DDA, the importance of the agenda we are pursuing in the DDA and the vital importance of bringing those negotiations to a successful completion.
I want to do that in respect not only of market access but also of trade rules and their strengthening, and that is what the Commission remains dedicated to achieving.

Peace process in Spain (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the peace process in Spain.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, the European Community was born out of a quest for peace and stability.
Peace and stability are still a resource for the development of the Union and it is very important that these matters are also discussed.
It is especially natural for the European Parliament to discuss the principles of peace and stability.
On 23 and 24 March this year, the Spanish Prime Minister gave the European Council an account of the announcement of a permanent ceasefire by the terrorist organisation, ETA.
At the time the Council said that it was satisfied with the account given by the Spanish Prime Minister.
Since then, the Council has not discussed the issue and abides by its statement of the time.
The issue of security is a particularly topical one, and one that affects all Europeans.
The Finnish Presidency is satisfied with all the actions that have been put in place to ensure that ETA ceases its terrorist activity and to bring about a peaceful solution within the framework of Spain's democratic organs of government.
As we in this Chamber all know, the Union is active in weeding out terrorism and its causes.
The Council once again expresses its support for the action which the Member States have implemented and are implementing to combat terrorism in accordance with the principles of the rule of law.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, terrorism represents one of the worst imaginable threats to democratic societies.
Terrorist attacks not only endanger security but constitute an assault on the fundamental values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
The Commission is strongly committed to the fight against terrorism and intends to continue working for the prevention of terrorism and the protection of our citizens and infrastructures by bringing terrorists to justice and by responding adequately to terrorist attacks in order to save as many innocent lives as possible.
The specific measures that will be taken at European level are clearly outlined in the European counter-terrorist strategy and in the action plan on combating terrorism.
The Commission is obviously deeply concerned at the dramatic scale of ETA's terrorism in Spain; four decades of terrorist activity have seen more than 800 assassinations and other attacks, with economic extortion and blackmail becoming common practice.
Law-abiding citizens have learned to live in fear; many have been permanently threatened in their daily lives.
The serious crime committed yesterday in the south of France - probably by ETA, according to the French prosecutor - is a source of concern.
The attitude of Spanish society during all these years has been exemplary; indeed, its tenacity and conviction in combating terrorism through respect for democracy and the rule of law has paid off, leading to the increasing weakness of ETA.
The Commission, once again, pays tribute to all the victims of ETA's terrorist attacks and recalls the importance of helping them and helping to make good damages suffered.
In these circumstances, the Commission recalls the statement made in its presence by the European Council in March 2006, welcoming the report of the Spanish Prime Minister on the announcement of a permanent ceasefire by terrorist group ETA.
The Commission also recalls the statement made by the President of the European Commission on the announcement by the Spanish Prime Minister on the launch of a dialogue with ETA, sharing the hopes of all those who look to a future in which Spain is free from the scourge of terrorism.
The Commission is most hopeful that those announcements will result in the total disarmament and dissolution of the terrorist group.
At the same time, the Commission is aware of the complexity of the initiative, as well as the extreme sensitivity of the matter, but is convinced that Spain, through all its democratic institutions, will find the right path that will bring an end to ETA's terrorism and restore peace, with full respect for the principles of democracy and the rule of law.
We shall not be divided today, since we shall not forget that the target of this debate is a common enemy of Spain and of Europe: terrorism.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is one of the most noble tasks of a politician to work for peace.
We all want peace on Earth, in Europe and in Spain.
There are, however, often differences of opinion about how to achieve this objective.
This is the case again today.
This debate is not about party-political tactics and gains, but principles and fundamental convictions.
For this reason I ask that everyone here show great respect in this debate today and that we do not deny each other the mutual good will that sustains our conviction.
We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would like to know how it is that we can trust that ETA and Batasuna want peace when they have not expressed a single word of regret or apology or made any kind of appeal for forgiveness to the families of the over 800 people that they have murdered.
Until this occurs, we must expect that they will begin to kill again if they do not achieve their goals through negotiation.
Today, our sympathy, our respect and our solidarity are with the victims of the acts of terrorism and violence carried out by ETA and Batasuna.
I can see from here our highly esteemed fellow MEP Mrs DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop, whose husband, the then Chairman of the Socialist Party in the Basque Country, was murdered in 1984.
Several attempts have been made on the life of Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, and seven of his political associates from the Partido Popular in the Basque Country have been murdered.
We owe it to the victims to ensure that the murderers are punished.
This is in accordance with the guiding and basic principles of our system of states under the rule of law.
If it is to be credible, the process of reconciliation must begin with reconciliation between perpetrators and victims, including the victims' descendants.
We call upon ETA and Batasuna to give your victims - who are surely on your consciences - a sign of conciliation and of apology.
We would remind people that ETA and Batasuna are on the EU's list of terrorist organisations.
They have not surrendered their weapons. These weapons remain a threat to the constitutional order of Spain, as well as of France and thereby of the whole of Europe.
The Commissioner has reminded us of the events of the day before yesterday in Nimes.
A woman and two children were taken hostage and the French authorities have stated officially that this took place as part of an ETA weapons robbery.
In other words, weapons remain an instrument of political argument.
We have to ask ourselves what goal ETA and Batasuna are trying to achieve.
A statement was issued on Euronews on 24 October from a high-ranking representative of ETA and Batasuna. The statement said that weapons would not be surrendered until the Basque Country was - in their words - independent.
MEPs have received a letter from Batasuna, which states in English, 'Regarding the negotiation between ETA and the Spanish and French states it will be them who decide all about the demilitarisation of the conflict.'
This form of words is a bad sign, since, if the negotiations fail, the blame is already being laid at the doors of the Spanish and French states.
What we in the PPE-DE Group, have to say to this is that we want dialogue.
Spain and France are free and democratic states.
They are not dictatorships, they are not tyrannies, against which one may express resistance through violent means.
No, they are free states, and in free and democratic states it is democratic dialogue and not violence that must be used.
As we share this conviction at the deepest level, our group, the PPE-DE Group, has tabled a resolution.
It is not merely a resolution on the part of our Spanish allies in the Partido Popular, it is a common resolution on the part of the whole of our group, and we will defend it with solidarity and now, today, and in this debate, commemorate the victims.
(Applause from the right)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of terrorism in Spain is not a Spanish internal problem; it is a European problem.
Terrorism is an attack on our values.
Terrorism is always an attack on everything that we in this Parliament defend on the basis of our common European convictions.
No terrorism, absolutely none, is justified.
It is for all of us to find ways out of this terrorism because we are all - when it is our values that we are defending - victims of this terrorism too, every time a terrorist attack takes place.
Mr Poettering, commendably, made reference to my colleague Mrs DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop, who is herself a victim.
We have many people with us in the public gallery today from the Basque Country who themselves were and are victims in that they have lost loved ones or in that they have personally suffered injury to life and limb.
They are here listening to us today because they want to say 'yes' to the route of dialogue because it is only through dialogue that the spiral of violence can be ended.
I admire men and women who must have experienced the deep sorrow that these victims have been through and who nevertheless come out and demand an end to the death, to the violence and to the downward spiral.
This moral force must be the impetus to reach a solution to the problems of violence, not only in the Basque Country, but everywhere else too.
It is thus a European problem that we are discussing today.
I admire the courage of the Spanish Government in choosing this path, a path that is controversial and fraught with risks.
It is, however, a path that is best described by a quotation that I would like to read to you.
(ES) For the sake of peace and your rights, we shall not close ourselves off but, rather, we shall open ourselves up to peace, hope, forgiveness and generosity and we shall do the best we can to ensure that peace is lasting with the help and hope of everybody.
(Applause)
(DE) What I have just read out to you is a wonderful sentence that describes what this is all about.
It is a sentence uttered by the Spanish Prime Minister who sent his Secretary of State off to negotiate with ETA.
It is a sentence spoken by the Spanish Prime Minister JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar in 1998.
That is the spirit that can form the basis for us all to reach a common solution to this problem of violence, since what the Spanish Government is doing today is in the tradition of all the governments before it.
(Applause)
It would therefore be a good thing if we were able to attain a joint resolution.
I do not always agree with Mr Aznar, which will not surprise you to hear, but on this issue he was right, dear members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and dear members of the Partido Popular, he was your party leader, after all.
In this spirit we can agree, as one, that we are prepared, for the sake of such a fundamental right and through dialogue, to find a solution.
Mr President, when Members of this House had to deal with terrorism in the past, they were always aware of the risks.
When John Hume und David Trimble, Members of this House, set off together on the road to peace they were also aware that it is a road fraught with risk and that there is no guarantee of success.
The gun heist in France yesterday - which we condemn in the strongest possible terms - shows that if you want to get out of the cycle of violence there is always the risk that someone will attempt to use violent means to block your road out of the deadlock.
You cannot afford to be forced off this road, because what is the alternative?
Remaining deadlocked means perpetuating the violence.
The dialogue that has been entered into is thus a great opportunity, and I implore all of you, let us adopt this dialogue together on a common platform supported by all the groups.
(Applause from the left)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the European Union has been referred to as the greatest example of conflict resolution in history.
We must be concerned with the remaining conflicts at home, just as we are concerned with conflicts beyond our Union.
It is not for us in the European Parliament to intervene directly between the Spanish Government, political parties and the long-running conflict in the Basque country, but nor can we turn a blind eye.
We should encourage what may be the best prospect for peace in a generation.
I extend my solidarity and sympathy to all those families who have been bereaved of loved ones over the years as a result of the violence.
But surely the most appropriate response that we, as democratic politicians, can bring to those countless victims is to ensure that there will be no more victims.
It is for that reason that Liberals and Democrats lend their backing to the resolution before the House today.
It is neither a time nor a subject for political point-scoring.
It is my firm belief that all democratic forces who wish to see a peaceful end to violence and terror in the Basque country and elsewhere in Spain where atrocities have been committed should back the endeavours of whichever Spanish government is prepared to work to that end.
Earlier this year, this House welcomed the announcement of an ETA ceasefire.
It is right that we now build on that and engage a process that entrenches it, without prejudging or commenting on the outcome of any political dialogue or settlement.
As with the Northern Ireland peace process, which is not identical but offers some important lessons for conflict resolution, it is occasionally necessary for politicians to take a risk for peace.
I recall that our former colleague John Hume and his Unionist counterpart David Trimble were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998, following the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland.
They took a risk for peace.
This is not to hand a victory to the terrorists, as some would suggest, but rather to hand them a defeat.
For there can be no dialogue among democrats if one of the parties still maintains the intent to kill.
We should not imagine that building the house of peace will be easy.
There will be setbacks, such as the discovery of a cache of weapons in south-west France.
But it is our duty to build the house of peace with the bricks of effort and the mortar of persistence.
That is why my group appeals to all sides of this House today to set aside party politics and unite for the prospects of peace, as much as we stand together in revulsion at acts of terrorism.
(Applause from the left)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the process opened up in Spain to finally put an end to the terrorism of ETA and find a solution to the Basque conflict.
At the same time we reiterate our profound solidarity and respect for all of the victims of terrorism.
We support this process because it rejects violence, it leaves all options for a final solution open, it is not exclusive and it also gives the Basque political parties and Basque society in general responsibility in terms of putting an end to the so-called Basque conflict.
Debating this issue in the European Parliament does not mean interfering in the policy of a Member State.
It simply means promoting a process already underway and restating that terrorism and violence affects all Europeans.
However difficult this process may be and however unsure its result, we support and we will continue to support those people who have decided to run the risk of taking a different direction to that of the Aznar Government, which quite clearly did not achieve any real results.
As Gandhi stated, 'There is no path to peace.
Peace is the path'.
We believe that it is appropriate to debate this process here and we have always been in favour of doing so, even when the People's Party was determined to bring this conflict to the European Parliament in order to gain support for its policy, a policy that we always believed to be mistaken, because it was based on the idea that, in order to defeat terrorism, it was necessary to divide Basque society rather than unite it.
The Basques and the majority of Spaniards are tired of this policy of confrontation.
In our view, the key factors for the success of this process are dialogue, non-violence and respect for the citizens of the Basque country's right to decide.
With these objectives in mind, we are going to support this process, as firm friends and allies in the fight against terrorism, against all forms of terrorism.
(Applause from the left)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, my group has always condemned terrorist acts, whoever the perpetrators and whatever the scale of the acts and the reasons given to justify them.
We are in favour of political struggle, with the exclusion of all forms of violence.
We see violence as reprehensible in all circumstances except where, as provided for by the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a population, in the absence of the rule of law is 'compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression'.
Even in this case, attacks on civilians are, in our opinion, to be prohibited.
All the more reason for our having unreservedly and systematically condemned the attacks by ETA, which have killed hundreds of innocent people.
We continue to remember these victims and express once again our solidarity with their loved ones.
For a long time, we have been hoping that this chapter could be closed, once and for all.
We were therefore extremely pleased to welcome the announcement of the permanent ceasefire by ETA.
We therefore also greatly appreciate the open and responsible attitude with which the Spanish Prime Minister, JosÃ© Luis Zapatero, has taken this opportunity to endeavour to achieve peace, in particular in his speech on 28 June 2005, by choosing the path of dialogue while taking care to respect the laws and legal procedures in force in his country.
The European Parliament would be honoured to lend its support to this move.
It is in this spirit that the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has united with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe through a joint resolution.
I would add that we believe it would be a good thing for MEPs from other groups to also lend their support to a move that is nothing short of a reflection of the wishes of the majority of Spanish people, namely that a peace process be opened, based on legal grounds.
(Applause from the left)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to join with my colleagues in saying that today is a very sensitive occasion for us in Parliament.
In all our deliberations we have to remember the victims of terrorist violence and, today in particular, the victims of ETA violence in Spain over the last few years.
But we must also look to the future and ensure that there are no more victims, because political solutions will be found to the differences in Spain, France, and the European Union as a whole.
I believe it is wrong to draw parallels or to say all processes are exactly the same.
However, previous peace processes can act as a guide to what might happen, the kind of difficulties to be overcome and the challenges to be faced.
If dialogue is to succeed, both sides must be open.
You cannot talk about a future process with one hand tied behind your back.
You have to ensure that those with whom you have a dialogue are committed to reaching a compromise and finding a solution.
And the most important thing to remember is that when you go into a peace process you have to make peace with your enemies, not with your friends, and that can create a lot of internal difficulties.
(Applause)
The opportunities now presented to us by this process should be grasped, but it should not be predetermined that everybody gets what they want.
It is most important that we do not point the finger of blame at someone else from the Popular Party or from the Socialist Party, but encourage the main forces of democracy in Spain to unite in finding a solution for all of the people of Spain and not to be driven down the road of division and dissension.
That is not in any way to undermine or to ignore the suffering people have gone through.
Can any of us imagine what it would be like to lose a loved one because of a so-called political cause?
We in Ireland know what that is like - there have been 3 000 victims of terrorist violence in Ireland over the last 30 years - and yet we could find a way forward and bring extreme opinions together.
An opportunity does present itself if people genuinely want to act.
Opportunity comes to pass but not to pause.
Let us seize the opportunity and give our support.
(Applause from the left and the centre)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, my group does not wish to involve itself in Spanish domestic politics, but there are principles of international law to which all countries are obliged to adhere.
Sometimes, they do not provide a clear answer.
The right of peoples to self-determination is an inviolable principle.
Every people has the right to chose its own fate.
Every nation has the right to its own country.
There are, however, only around 10 to 12 countries in the world where people, nation and geographical unit combine to form a higher unit.
Everywhere else it is a question of negotiating solutions that are respected by the different peoples and nations that share the same territorial unit.
The EU does not interfere in the forms of government of the Member States.
This is an area in which they themselves have competence, whether they wish to have a unitary state, a federal community or devolved arrangements or to be divided into multiple states.
The states must protect minorities and respect human rights.
National discrimination is not permitted.
So what can the EU do in the Basque Country to end terrorism and ensure a durable solution with peace and tolerance?
We can encourage our fellow MEPs from Spain to find a negotiated solution and we can provide an economic carrot - financial support for economic development, jobs, training and education instead of terrorism.
I come from the border region between Denmark and Germany, where we have had wars and hatred for centuries.
My grandfather was a German soldier with Danish sympathies.
My father was conceived in Germany, but born in Denmark after Northern Schleswig rejoined Denmark following a referendum.
Our national leader, Hans Peter Hansen, was a moderate who did not want areas that had German sympathies to rejoin Denmark, as Germany was on its knees after the First World War.
What a stroke of luck!
The reconciliation between Danes and Germans began, and now everyone recognises the border.
Denmark grants the German minority more rights than it grants to Danes, and the same applies to the Danish minority in Germany, an example being exemption from the 5% electoral hurdle to qualification for parliamentary representation.
Recognition, respected rights, special rights - these are the keys to understanding and lasting peace.
As a boy, a German-owned shop was not somewhere that I could buy things.
Today, that seems incredible, and I now work with both the German minority in Denmark and the Danish minority in Germany.
We drew up together the proposal for the protection of minorities in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I hope that the Basques and the other peoples of Spain will be able to reconcile their differences.
The means of achieving reconciliation between Denmark and Germany proved to be a referendum on special rights.
Referendums do not hurt as much as bullets and gunpowder.
It is indeed possible to put the past behind you.
(Applause)
Mr President, coming from Northern Ireland, which has experienced what at times was euphemistically called a peace process, I see uncanny parallels and lessons to be learned.
ETA-Batasuna and IRA-Sinn FÃ©in are both revolutionary Marxist-based organisations intent on foisting their will and ideology on a civilian population through vicious violence as and when required.
It is not surprising that deep terrorist links have existed between them.
Both, moreover, are expert in hijacking the language of peace, while glorying in past and even continuing exploits of terror as they adeptly dodge from one phase of struggle to another.
Learn from our mistakes.
In 1994 the IRA announced a ceasefire, which proved merely tactical as 18 months later they launched the infamous Canary Wharf bombing attack and dipped in and out of terror as it suited.
In 1998 they promised to decommission within two years, and yet it was not until 2005 that they made any notable delivery.
They were foolishly and prematurely admitted to government in Northern Ireland, only to launch their 'Stormontgate' spy ring within that government.
In late 2004 they purported to engage in genuine political negotiations while, at the same time, planning the biggest heist in UK history - the Northern Bank robbery - and weeks later IRA men murdered Robert McCartney.
Now they want back into government, but think they should keep their Army Council.
Therefore, do not be taken in by mere proclamations of commitments to peace by those whose stock in trade is duplicity and mayhem!
Test them long and test them hard, or you too will have your goodwill exploited.
To conclude this debate, two motions for resolutions have been presented pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m. after the formal sitting with the President of the Republic of Hungary.
Results of the informal summit of heads of state and government (Lahti, 20 October 2006) (debate)
The next item is the European Council report and Commission statement on the results of the informal summit of Heads of State or Government in Lahti on 20 October 2006.
President of the Commission. Mr President, Prime Minister Vanhanen has given you a comprehensive overview of the results of the informal European Council in Lahti last Friday.
I should like to concentrate on a few points.
The Lahti summit should be seen as part of a process.
As you know, we have been saying that we should drive forward integration through practical, concrete actions and we have been doing so, hand in hand with Parliament and the Council.
We have set out an ambitious agenda, for example on security, on energy, on research, and now we must put that agenda into action.
That is precisely what we did at Lahti.
Firstly, on innovation, everyone agrees that innovation is important and that Europe is lagging behind.
There is a consensus on the need for more support and incentives for innovation and fewer barriers for innovators. That has been endorsed in the European Council and in resolutions from this Parliament.
What we needed were some clear, practical steps to show that Europe was prepared to take a lead and that is what we got at Lahti.
On joint technology initiatives, for example, key projects such as the Artemis Programme on embedded computers were being held back by a lack of national funds.
Now we have some clear commitments for direct support.
On procedures to set European standards for products, we have an agreement that these should be speeded up.
I also believe that momentum is building up on intellectual property, including patents, and the Commission will push that further before the end of the year.
Importantly, the Commission received the green light on the European Institute for Technology (EIT).
I am grateful for the support I received from all the Members who spoke in favour of the EIT in the part-session two weeks ago.
There is a growing consensus that the EIT will offer European leadership on innovation.
We are receiving enthusiastic support from all over the business and scientific community in Europe.
The attention given by Parliament to that important initiative has been of real help in developing the details of the proposal.
Of course there will now be negotiations on details, including the budget.
I look forward to working with you and the Council in order to move swiftly towards adoption of the regulation.
I believe that the EIT can be a flagship of excellence in innovation for Europe.
We should ask the EIT to make its first priority the great challenges of climate change and everything related to environmentally-friendly sources of energy.
That is an important task for us as a society.
We should ask the scientific community of Europe to help us solve these problems, so that we can maintain the lead in what is perhaps the most important challenge of the 21st century.
The second main issue in the debate was energy.
The Commission, working closely with the Presidency, had identified three practical steps forward, and we received support for them all.
First, the European Council agreed that we should step up our energy relations with our neighbours, especially producers like Russia, Norway or Algeria, and key transit countries like Turkey and Ukraine.
Secondly, the European Council agreed to create a network of energy correspondents, which will also make us better prepared for unexpected shocks to our energy supply.
Thirdly, the European Council agreed on a specific common approach to Russia.
We made clear to President Putin our wish to have a close energy relationship with such a key partner, but that relationship must be based on the principles that Russia has already signed up to at the G8 hosted by Russia this year, as well as the energy charter: transparency, the rule of law, reciprocity and non-discrimination, along with market opening and market access.
Those principles apply to energy, but not just energy.
They are necessary elements in increasing the mutual confidence and investment essential to a long-term relationship.
That message was all the more powerful in that we were united.
In Lahti there was a clear sense of solidarity, an understanding that the European Union will act as one and that Europeans should receive the same standards of reliability from our Russian partners, whichever Member State is concerned.
Prime Minister Vanhanen spoke on behalf of the whole European Council, presenting the general issues regarding our broad relations with Russia, and I was proud to have been asked to speak on energy matters.
It was important for that meeting and for the success of the Lahti summit that the statements by the Presidency and by the European Commission were clearly supported by all members of the European Council.
The idea of solidarity is more important than ever.
Solidarity and coherence are more than ever the key words of our European Union.
Going forward on energy, within the framework of our new global agreement with Russia, will help ensure that this common approach is maintained.
In short, the message is getting through: energy is a European issue and needs European solutions.
There is growing recognition in the Council of what you in Parliament have long known, i.e. that the European Union has a central role to play in creating energy security and, through energy policy, in tackling climate change.
That bodes well for the energy package that the Commission will present in January.
The European Union must not reduce its relationship with Russia to energy.
At the dinner with President Putin, the European Union raised other issues: human rights, trade, visas, culture and common international concerns.
We covered sensitive issues like Georgia.
Prime Minister Vanhanen repeated the European Union's concern at the murder of Anna Politkovskaya, expressed so eloquently in our previous debate in the European Parliament.
As we negotiate a new global agreement with Russia, this broad spread of issues must be maintained. That is the essence of a comprehensive agreement.
Thirdly, at Lahti there was a short but important discussion on immigration.
Again, there was a clear understanding that this was a collective problem, demanding a collective response.
I was able to explain that in the coming weeks the Commission will be making proposals on how to improve maritime control of the Union's southern borders.
We will also be updating the global approach on migration in the run-up to the December European Council and working to tackle the problem at source in the Euro-African Conference on Migration and Development next month.
However, there is still much more that we could do in this area if the political will and determination is there to give us the tools and resources needed.
In particular, we believe that our decision-making system should be adapted. We can already do that under the existing Treaties.
We cannot go on waiting so long for decisions that are so often blocked because of the rule of unanimity.
Let us be frank: it is completely absurd that in a common space of freedom of movement we still sometimes think in terms of 25 migration policies.
We need a European policy on migration.
(Applause)
Finally, Darfur was also discussed.
I remain determined that we will do all we can to prevent another humanitarian tragedy.
Therefore, Lahti was another signpost on our collective road towards equipping Europeans for globalisation.
We will not be diverted from this path.
The expectations of our citizens for a Europe of practical results are increasing. We must continue to respond.
I am grateful to Mr Vanhanen for his excellent chairmanship and to the Finnish Presidency for our close cooperation.
May it continue to the end of the Presidency and beyond.
That is the way to achieve practical results for our Europe.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Mr President, Prime Minister Vanhanen, President Barroso, in assessing the success of the Lahti meeting we may certainly work on the basis that its results are commendable.
Things did not bode well for the summit.
Many newspapers, the highly regarded Financial Times in particular, painted a very gloomy picture of the meeting in advance, saying that it was a big risk inviting Russian President Putin along, as the EU is divided and disunited on energy and Russian policy.
It said that this would just be a victory for President Putin.
Things turned out differently, however.
It was good to see EU leaders acting in unison and speaking with solidarity over dinner.
In speeches I have given here, I myself have said that the EU should have a united, unanimous, long-term policy on Russia.
Now the first steps have succeeded in being taken. This will also show the public that the EU can act in difficult situations too.
Obviously, we have to acknowledge that we still have a long way to go before things become concrete and Russia ratifies the Energy Charter, which will open up the market and enforce compliance with common rules.
Although this was a small step forward, it was nevertheless an important step towards a uniform, long-term policy on Russia.
It was also important that we ventured to speak openly about human rights and the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and not dodge the issues.
We cannot sacrifice human rights on the altar of energy policy.
The discussion was frank as far as President Putin was concerned too, even though he did not change his views.
Hardly anyone expected him to either.
Cooperation can only be built on mutual trust and a common will.
