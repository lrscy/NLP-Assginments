I also want to thank all those who have participated in the debate here in the House, together with the President and Commissioner Frattini.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I thought I would give a different speech to the one I have written down, as much of what I wanted to say has been said.
This is a good debate in which it is important for us to underline the fact that the issue in question is one that must be dealt with, both through the ratification of conventions and through work on the great social inequalities.
Let me state, then, that getting conventions ratified is not enough. They also need to be complied with.
I am in a position to say that, in a country like Denmark alone, all too few resources are set aside for combating the sex trade.
There is not enough investigation, and those women who are the victims of the trade have no more than 30 days before they are kicked out of the country. There is sufficient time neither for them to get the help they need nor for anything to be done about the problem.
We then ask ourselves whether this is because we do, in reality, accept that there can be trafficking in women and children.
On this point I personally do, in fact, agree with the Swedes that it has proved that, when there is a market, then it is all too very easy both to create an acceptance of the fact that this activity can take place and also, of course, to make things easier for the criminals.
It is very easy for them to gain access to an already established market with their victims and, until something is done about that, I really do not think that we will truly be able to stamp out this trade.
This is a debate we must have because it is incredibly important that we get something done about this issue.
As I say, I wish, personally, to support the Swedish proposal but I am also incredibly open to other things, as long as we establish that it is not just ratifications that are needed but changes of attitude and that funding also needs to be set aside to provide real help because, until all this happens, all that we shall have, as my Swedish fellow Member said before I got up to speak, is little more than words.
I can tell you that even the finest of targets do not help the people who are being trafficked if they are not backed up by proper powers, political will and proper effort.
I hope, then, that this is something we can agree on.
(SK) I welcome this important report and I would also like to express my thanks to Mrs Edit Bauer for her work.
I am glad that some of my amendments have been adopted in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, and I trust that they too have contributed to the quality of this report.
Trafficking in human beings is one of the most sophisticated, best organised and most profitable forms of criminal activity.
This is a problem not only for the developing world, but also for the European Union.
In my amendments I focused on the fact that most of the victims of sexual abuse and trafficking in human beings are minors, who constitute the most vulnerable section of the population.
For instance, the consent of a child to prostitution may not be viewed in the same way as the consent of an adult who is aware of the consequences of his or her conduct.
Many international agreements and treaties have been signed on this issue.
However, many states have not even ratified these instruments and those that have ratified them fail to enforce them, which results in these documents becoming irrelevant.
Although at international conferences attended by various states we all agree that we really must implement these documents to which we all subscribe, such efforts frequently cease on the last day of the conference and the status quo remains unchanged.
In addition to focusing on the customer-victim relationship, it is necessary to pay attention to employers, especially in countries where visa requirements are not applied.
Cooperation must exist between the three elements, that is, the country of origin, the transit countries and the destination countries.
It is necessary to monitor the operation and trustworthiness of employment agencies, including those that are thought to recruit only seasonal workers.
Companies that employ cheap labour obtained through human trafficking must be punished extremely heavily.
Inspections at facilities providing sexual services will not suffice.
It would be desirable also to have administrative inspections in addition to the penalties set out under criminal law.
The funding available to the non-governmental organisations that deal with political rights is many times greater than that available to NGOs addressing human trafficking or women's rights.
Sadly, this appears to reflect how countries have set their priorities.
(HU) Mr President, I can only congratulate Mrs Edit Bauer for having addressed this sad and very serious question with such professional expertise and commitment.
We can only support her in this at the vote tomorrow.
Thanks are due as well to Mr Frattini, for the same degree of commitment.
For this is what is necessary, given that trafficking in human beings, and especially in women and children, has since the 1990s grown into one of the world's most alarming phenomena.
No doubt everyone has heard astonishing figures - we have listened to and discussed these here today.
I am particularly saddened by the fact that 40-50% of all victims are children.
According to UNICEF's estimate, one million children each year are caught up in the international trafficking in children.
One of the roots of the problem is the hopeless situation in the countries of origin.
But we must also recognise that the principal motor driving the trade is demand.
Human traffickers would not succeed if the host states did not have such a large demand for women and children to exploit, that is, for cheap labour.
It makes no difference that practically the whole world condemns this sexual exploitation or slavery of children, and the police forces of individual countries strive in vain to uncover paedophile rings, if trafficking in human beings remains largely international in scope.
Therefore, we must strengthen cross-border cooperation to protect the victims, bring the offenders effectively to justice and work out comprehensive methods of prevention.
Currently, human trafficking is the most rapidly growing criminal activity within the European Union.
The struggle against trafficking of women and children is a moral question as well, and I have no doubt that it is our duty to intervene against it.
It is sad to see that the European Parliament has to debate this issue, here among these empty benches, for in my view, this question somehow affects all of us, since it is our children who are at stake.
(PT) Trafficking in human beings is a heinous crime that, in a particularly insidious fashion, debases the very nature of what it is to be a human being.
Unfortunately, it has become one of the most lucrative forms of international organised crime.
It affects hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world, and in particular the weakest and the poorest, women and children.
The fight against this scourge ought to be an immediate priority.
For this fight to be successful, international cooperation must be stepped up in the areas of investigation, exchange of information, identification of victims, law enforcement and reintegration.
Accordingly, those Member States that have yet to do so must speed up the process of ratifying and implementing the many existing international conventions that could make a decisive contribution towards gradually eradicating this utterly abhorrent crime.
The EU, too, must strengthen its commitment to promoting initiatives aimed at combating the causes of this most disgraceful trade, and must support the weakest countries in which most of this trafficking originates.
As we debate this matter here in the Chamber, we must all be aware of the enormous difficulty of the war that we must wage together.
We must be clear in our minds that we are fighting to defend human dignity.
There is therefore, ladies and gentlemen, no more urgent fight than this.
(PL) Mr President, the fight against human trafficking is a great challenge for the twenty-first century.
In the struggle for human dignity, and in order to limit this phenomenon, international and national organisations have signed a series of declarations, conventions and directives, and are implementing a series of action plans.
As the rapporteur has pointed out, these action plans may restrict human trafficking in its broadest sense, but they do not eliminate its causes.
The causes include: unemployment, hunger, poverty affecting large parts of society, high indirect labour costs, competition and the desire to achieve maximum profit.
They often encourage illegal work and permit local communities to turn a blind eye to slave labour (an example would be the case of the area surrounding the Italian town of Foggia), sexual abuse, ethnic conflicts and wars.
This report could provide the basis for drawing up a programme for further economic, legal, political, educational, informative and institutional actions. Implementing this programme would restrict human trafficking, which goes against the principles of democracy and human dignity.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Bauer's report not only affords us an in-depth analysis of this ghastly state of affairs, but also very wide-ranging proposals as to how strategies to combat people-trafficking - one of the cruellest branches of organised crime - may be successfully implemented.
These proposals range from the improvement of the legal framework to improved coordination of the most diverse measures at national and European level, taking in also the action needed in order to reduce demand and to protect the victims.
While I support them, I would also suggest that corrections be made at a few points, with it being prescribed in detail to the Member States what measures they are to take in order to protect victims, with regard to such things as access to the labour market, to accommodation, to education and so on, irrespective of whether or not the said victim is willing to cooperate with the authorities.
It is in these respects that the Member States should take appropriate action to protect the victims, albeit not of such a nature as to drive more of them into the clutches of the people-traffickers.
I am particularly grateful to Commission Frattini for taking very definite action that will have a lasting effect, and am very supportive of his action in now threatening that those Member States that have not hitherto been willing to implement and transpose the relevant directives, regulations and international conventions will have to face the consequences.
Their attitude is simply unacceptable, and the Member States must now do something in response to the requirements imposed by the UN and the European Union.
(PL) Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has addressed a very important issue which is of great socio-political significance.
Human trafficking is a problem on a global scale and is a modern version of slavery which infringes fundamental human rights.
The trafficking of women and children is a particularly tragic side of this phenomenon.
In my speech, I would like to focus on the economic aspects of this phenomenon.
It should be stressed that human trafficking is driven by the forces of both supply and demand.
In some developing countries, in contrast to the levels of social and economic development in Europe, there are few prospects for the future in terms of the economic and social situation, unemployment is high and there is growing poverty.
These factors contribute towards a situation where it is easy for criminal organisations to profit through human trafficking.
However, we should also take into account the fact that the demand for cheap, unregistered and obedient workers in the European Union contributes to the illegal trade in human beings, as using such a workforce can cut costs.
However, this is done at the expense of human dignity and undermines employment standards, health and safety, fair pay and local and national budgets through unpaid taxes and social security contributions.
Human trafficking is the fastest growing criminal activity amongst the forms of organised crime in the European Union.
The measures taken to restrict human trafficking to date have yet to produce tangible results.
There are obvious difficulties involved in combating this phenomenon, but the European Union must take decisive action.
That is why we should gladly adopt the report before us, which proposes an integrated approach, and the proposed action plan.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, it is women and children who are most vulnerable to human trafficking, and it is unfortunate that the world of sport deserves some of the blame in this respect.
More and more, professional sports clubs resort to attracting ever younger players, particularly from Africa, for the obvious reason that they pay very little, if anything, for them.
These players are often simply dumped along the way, and subsequently go underground.
Too little attention is given to this.
In our draft report on the future of professional football in Europe, we demand that the Commission should deal with this in the context of the Council's framework decision on the fight against human trafficking.
Since, Commissioner, this decision makes no bones about the fact that the exploitation of children is punishable, we want the Member States to introduce hefty penalties for it.
May I remind you in this connection of the agreements that were concluded at the European Summit in The Hague two years ago?
The European Council then recommended that a European plan be drawn up in order to develop common standards, best practices and suchlike to prevent and fight human trafficking.
I have to tell Commissioner Frattini that this issue is becoming all the more urgent and acute because some professional football clubs intend to circumvent and undermine the so-called 'home-grown' rule by attracting ever younger players to Western Europe, or Europe in general.
This often involves entire families moving, only for many of them later to be left to their own devices.
I would like to add that we give our 100% backing to this home-grown rule that has already been implemented by UEFA, because it benefits the training of young footballers.
Moreover, on the basis of initial discussions here in the parliamentary committees, it seems that this home-grown rule meets with broad support here in Parliament.
We must, whatever we do, rule out the risk of this measure being undermined, and that is why I urge you to support the amendment which I, along with the rapporteur, have submitted to that effect.
My question is, of course, addressed to the Members in this Chamber, but also to the Commission and ministers.
- (LT) I would like to thank the rapporteur for doing such an enormously important work.
Europe has long been proud that slavery was eradicated here sooner than on any other continent.
Sadly, it is returning in other forms that are equally repulsive, along with scorn, distress and, ironically, unimaginable profits.
What should we do first?
We should coordinate the actions of the EU and all neighbouring countries better, eliminate legal gaps enabling offenders to evade law enforcement without being punished, even hand out to all Members of the European Parliament a kind of 'shame list' of states, which have failed to ratify United Nations conventions on trafficking in human beings, and draft a code of conduct for officers of EU institutions and bodies, which would even be useful for some Members of Parliament.
We must make our citizens, especially those in the new EU Member States, clearly aware of the possible threats of becoming a target of traffickers in people.
The victims of offenders must not only have the courage but also the right to be able to address governmental institutions without being afraid of deportation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Written Statement (Rule 142)
(IT) I worked as draftsman for the Committee on Development on the Financial Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, together with the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Our committee has voted for an amendment including the fight against trafficking in women and children, who represent almost all the people trafficked, among the projects that can be funded using this instrument, primarily to help the countries at the origin of the trafficking to combat this dishonourable practice.
However, few projects, even if well targeted, are not enough to combat a problem concerning over a million victims a year, above all women, teenage girls and children.
A legal framework regulating prostitution, close collaboration between the Member States and, above all, with the countries of origin of the majority of victims, as well as extremely harsh punishments for those promoting this trafficking, are necessary tools to try to bring an end to this scourge.
However, we also need to implement a strong dissuasion and awareness campaign for all Europeans that feed people trafficking, primarily through sex tourism.
Finally, I would like to extend my support to the committee's proposals for actions supporting victims, helping them to come out into the open, denounce their traffickers and become rehabilitated in European society.

Opening of the sitting
(The sitting opened at 10.00)
Mr President, I rise simply to report to the House the good news that last night the President of Pakistan, who was our guest a few weeks ago, has commuted the death sentence on my constituent Mirza-Tahir Hussain, who had been on death row for 18 years but is widely regarded to be innocent of the charges against him.
A number of Members of the European Parliament, led by Mr Karim, were going to Pakistan next month to make a final plea.
Now, of course, we shall turn our efforts towards ensuring Mr Hussain can return to Leeds by Christmas.
I am delighted at this news and hope that the President of Parliament will make a statement later today.
I know he has worked very hard on this case, as have other Members of Parliament.
(Applause)
Ombudsman's 2005 annual report (debate)
The next item is the report by Andreas Schwab, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2005.
Ombudsman. Mr President, I wish to thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament and to present the annual report for 2005, a year in which the Office of the European Ombudsman celebrated an important milestone: its tenth year of operation.
The annual report records our progress in handling complaints, promoting good administration and making the Ombudsman's work better known to citizens.
In total, 3920 complaints were received, a 5% increase compared to the previous year.
I note that a rise in complaints does not necessarily result from worsening administrative behaviour by the European Union's institutions; rather, it may also reflect citizens' increased general awareness of matters European and growing knowledge about their rights and about how to exercise those rights.
This general awareness was also observed during 2005 in the participation of citizens in the debate about the future of the European Union and the Constitution.
To contribute to the furthering of this general awareness, I made intensive efforts to inform citizens about their rights and to spread the word about the positive results that have been achieved in defence of those rights.
All in all, I and my staff gave over 170 public lectures, presentations and press interviews, in addition to meeting with ombudsmen, public officials and other interlocutors in the Member States.
A particular feature of these communication activities in 2005 was a series of events to mark the tenth anniversary of the Ombudsman, directed at specific target groups, namely, civil society, academia, the press and the institutions themselves, including a reception in honour of the European Parliament on 27 September, which was addressed by President Borrell Fontelles himself.
During 2005, I was able to assist over 75% of the people who complained to me. This assistance took the form of opening an inquiry, transferring the case to a competent body, or advising on where to turn for a prompt and effective solution to the problem.
I closed 312 inquiries during the year.
In 36% of the cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration.
Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of a full explanation from the institutional body involved.
Furthermore, even when there is no maladministration I may identify an opportunity for the institutional body to improve the quality of its administration in the future.
If so, I make a further remark in closing my decision.
Wherever I find maladministration, I try if possible to achieve a positive-sum outcome that satisfies both the complainant and the institution.
In 30% of cases my inquiry has resulted either in the institution concerned settling the case to the satisfaction of the complainant, or in a friendly solution.
When a friendly solution is not possible, I close the case with a critical remark or make a draft recommendation.
One of the draft recommendations accepted in 2005 was a case in which the Commission granted ex gratia compensation to a complainant whose project it had cancelled at extremely short notice.
The Commission agreed to pay EUR 56 000, the largest such settlement ever secured by the Ombudsman.
If a Community institutional body fails to respond satisfactorily to a draft recommendation, the Ombudsman's ultimate weapon is a special report to Parliament.
Three special reports were made in 2005: on the Council's continuing practice of legislating in camera; on the Commission's responsibility for children of its officials with special educational needs; and on the nature of information provided by OLAF to the Ombudsman during a previous enquiry.
I am grateful to Parliament for its support as expressed in its resolutions of 4 and 6 April 2006, based on the Hammerstein Mintz and De Rossa reports respectively and concerning the first two of these special reports.
I would now like to say a few words about my priorities for the future.
As indicated before, the first priority is to promote a citizen-centred approach by the EU institutions and bodies in all their activities.
To that end I seek every opportunity to reach out to EU institutions, to encourage best practice and promote friendly solutions.
The active cooperation of the institutions and bodies is essential to the success of the Ombudsman's work for citizens.
The annual report contains many examples of the institutions taking prompt action to settle cases brought to their attention and responding positively to my proposals and recommendations.
During visits to the institutions and bodies, I underlined the value of reacting promptly and constructively to complaints.
The ultimate goal for all of us must be to ensure the best possible service to the citizen.
The Commission has already taken constructive steps to improve its service to citizens by overhauling its system of handling the Ombudsman's inquiries resulting from complaints.
In its communication of November 2005 the Commission outlined the new procedure to apply henceforth.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m's idea in designing the new procedure was to give individual Commissioners greater ownership of cases, while fully maintaining the valuable role of the Secretariat-General.
I am particularly grateful for her efforts in bringing that concept to fruition and for her continuing commitment to its proper implementation.
The new procedure allows individual Commissioners to get involved in cases at an early stage, when options still remain open.
The speed of the new procedure already bore fruit in a case in which I found that the Commission's response to a citizen's infringement complaint had been unsatisfactory.
I held a meeting with Commissioner McCreevy and learned from him that the Commission had taken steps to resolve that particular issue.
I believe that the successful resolution of that case illustrates the value both of the Ombudsman's role in promoting good administration in the infringement procedure and of the concept of greater ownership of cases by individual Commissioners.
I wish to thank the Commission for that in the presence of Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m.
I have also revisited the question of the Ombudsman's Statute by submitting to President Borrell Fontelles in July considered proposals for revision, in response to earlier resolutions on the Ombudsman's annual report by this House.
Overall the Statute continues to provide a good framework for the Ombudsman's investigations and for effective cooperation with the institutions to promote good administration and fight maladministration.
The changes I propose are therefore limited both in number and scope.
My principal objective is to ensure that citizens can have full confidence in the Ombudsman's power to find the truth when hearing witnesses or inspecting documents.
I should also like to cooperate with Parliament to ensure that citizens' complaints about violations of the fundamental rights mentioned in the Charter can be brought before the Court of Justice if an important issue of principle cannot be resolved in any other way.
Parliament already has full rights as an institution to initiate cases before the Court.
In this context, it would be useful for the Ombudsman to have the power to intervene in such cases, a power that has already been given to the European Data Protection Supervisor, with whom I have developed a close working relationship.
I look forward to working with Mr Guardans CambÃ³ and Mrs Matsouka as they embark upon the process of drawing up a report and opinion concerning this proposed vision in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Petitions respectively.
My third priority is to deepen my close cooperation with ombudsmen in the Member States through the European Network of Ombudsmen.
The aim is to promote good administration throughout the Union in order that citizens can enjoy their rights under European law.
I am delighted that the Committee on Petitions participates in the Network as a full member and was represented at the meeting of national ombudsmen that took place in The Hague in September 2005.
Next week, a similar meeting for regional ombudsmen in the European Union, with whom I have made a commitment to meet every two years, will be held in London.
I should like to thank the members of the Committee on Petitions, and in particular this year's rapporteur Mr Schwab, for their support and constructive proposals as set out in Parliament's report.
I have already mentioned today many of the matters on which the report contains wise advice to the Ombudsman.
I am committed to improving the information given to Parliament and citizens about the services provided by me and by the European Network of Ombudsmen.
I have already asked to appear before the Committee on Petitions whenever I submit a special report to this House.
Next year, I intend to put an interactive guide on our website to help complainants find the appropriate ombudsman to deal with, be it at European, national or regional level.
I believe this will be of great benefit to citizens and help address the concerns rightly expressed in Mr Schwab's report about the large percentage of inadmissible complaints.
Last year we successfully consolidated the Office of the European Ombudsman and moved firmly in the direction of enhancing the institution's ability to deal effectively with complaints and inquiries from citizens of the enlarged European Union.
To that end, we could always count upon the support of two of Parliament's most senior officials who are about to retire or have just retired - Mr Priestley and Mr GarzÃ³n Clariana.
Their wise counsel and assistance to the Ombudsman have been invaluable and will long be remembered.
I believe that the relationship of goodwill, trust and understanding built up over the last decade between the European Ombudsman and EU institutions constitutes a precious resource for improving the quality of public administration in Europe to the benefit of citizens.
It is enormously reassuring to me, both personally and institutionally, to know that in this regard the European Parliament and its Committee on Petitions are vital partners for the European Ombudsman.
I intend to make the most of that partnership in seeking to contribute to the deepening of a service culture to the benefit of EU citizens.
Thank you for your attention.
(Applause)
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Diamandouros, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that you have all managed to get up so early and be present here for the debate on the report on the 2005 report from the European Ombudsman.
I would like to start by thanking you, Mr Diamandouros, most warmly for the constructive contribution you have made in the shape of your annual report, on which I have had the privilege of reporting to this House on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, and I would like, in so doing, also to thank all the Members of this House who, by their amendments and personal comments, have played a constructive part in the report's gestation, especially our coordinator Mr Atkins and my predecessor from last year, Mr Mavrommatis.
I am glad that you started by highlighting the need for the Ombudsman's status to be specified in rather clearer terms in view of the increasing workload with which the public present you, and I am most obliged to you for having actually done that again today.
Since we should try to draw the demarcation lines between the functions of the different European institutions as sharply and distinctly as possible, the deliberations on your letter to our President, Mr Borrell, may well bring us to a satisfactory outcome.
The European Ombudsman is an important European institution, being particularly relevant to Europe's development and with a special importance in the eyes of the European public.
He exists to bring the European Union closer to its citizens and to make it transparent.
It is to him that Europe's citizens can turn in order to complain when the institutions do not do their jobs properly; that gives him a very personal relationship with Europe, one that cannot be the same everywhere, and that is what makes his position so special.
It is this idea - the idea that European policy should be shaped more by practical considerations and by reference to the interests of the public - that we should, in future, take more to heart.
We must focus our policies more closely on the public and thereby show them that they and their concerns - be these major or minor, important or trivial - are taken seriously, and we will accomplish that firstly by making a better job of communicating what European policy is all about, and secondly, by way of greater transparency - two important points from among those I have made about your annual report.
The Committee on Petitions has received the European Ombudsman's annual report, which discusses his activities over the past year, and that leads me to thank you for doing a splendid job of work.
You have been in office since 1 April 2003, and your labours are being crowned with success.
I believe that the report that this House has produced is a very balanced one; I have endeavoured to examine the Members' amendments and, where I thought it possible, to incorporate them.
I believe that the report is comprehensible to the public, and that is the most important thing, but, following the vote in committee, I assumed that not all the amendments could be re-submitted, and I will, for that reason, be recommending to my group that it should reject them.
For that I ask your understanding.
We have spent a long time trying to compromise on this point.
You have already set out the most important points from your report.
The year 2005 saw a large number of complaints - the largest, indeed, ever made to the Ombudsman - and the first thing that indicates is that more and more people are taking an active interest in the EU and in the way it works.
What is shocking, though - and this is something to which you referred - is the continuing large number of complaints - amounting to some 70% of those made - that are not actually within your remit, very often because the people making them do not know with any certainty to whom they actually need to address themselves, and it is for that reason that I very much welcome your statement to the effect that you want an online form set up on your homepage as a guide to the right institution; that would certainly be useful to all those who want to contact you online.

It follows, then, that the powers and responsibilities of the institutions need to be demarcated even more clearly in order that the public may understand who, in the European Union, is responsible for dealing with what, and you can help to make the tangled undergrowth of institutions and their powers more transparent, something that is, of course, in the first instance a task for Parliament and for its Members in the electoral districts in the relevant regions, but you can play your part too.
We extend a very warm welcome to the European Network of Ombudsmen and similar bodies, which take quite different forms from one Member State to another, and we have, for that reason, particularly highlighted their public information events.
Turning to the substance of the various complaints, they focus primarily on a lack of transparency, and so, in that the report repeats the Ombudsman's demands - made in his special report on the subject - for all meetings of the Council in its legislative capacity to be open to the public, you have served the cause of democracy and transparency in Europe well.
We also, though, need more transparency if the democratic functioning of the European Union is to be guaranteed, and hence, in our report - and in saying this, I am perhaps addressing you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, more than anyone else - we call for the 'europa.eu' Internet portal to be redesigned as a means of access to all the institutions and for a clear guide to the various European institutions - rather than a catalogue of all the European Union's activities - to be positioned on the homepage.
Finally, I should like to give voice to another thought, namely that it was in January that you presented your annual report for the past year, yet it is only now - in November of the following year - that we are debating it.
We in the Committee on Petitions should endeavour to discuss these reports as soon as possible after they are published.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, first I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, for his work on the European Ombudsman's report on his activities in 2005.
This is an important report from Parliament on the general principles, the state of play and future development of cooperation between the Ombudsman and other EU institutions.
I would also like to congratulate the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, on his annual report.
I am happy, as always, to hear Mr Diamandouros confirm his commitment to ensuring the highest standards of administration in the European institutions, and that is a commitment the Commission shares.
I entirely support Mr Schwab in his endorsement of the role of the Ombudsman as an external monitoring mechanism for sound administration.
Through his work, the Ombudsman contributes to the promotion of good administration.
I am convinced that, through their cooperation with the Ombudsman, EU institutions are helped in fostering a citizen-oriented approach to their daily work.
That means ensuring greater transparency of the EU decision-making process and working to develop best practices to meet citizens' expectations and safeguard their rights.
This is about bridging the gap between institutions and EU citizens.
I would like to comment on three specific points in the report.
Firstly, I think that the cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Commission has developed well in recent years.
As pointed out in the report, the Commission uses a new internal procedure empowering each Commissioner to adopt and transmit communications to the Ombudsman.
I am happy that both the Ombudsman and Mr Schwab welcome this innovation in their reports.
In addition, the Commission has adapted its internal rules to speed up the handling of its replies to the Ombudsman.
The Commission will continue to develop its cooperation with the Ombudsman.
The rapporteur suggests that a similar empowering procedure be introduced for the handling of petitions.
While the Commission will continue to work closely with the Committee on Petitions, that is not a possibility that the Commission envisages.
The Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman have distinct roles, each with its own value to citizens.
Secondly, the report mentions the Europa website.
It is one of the most visited websites in the world and it has become quite complex to navigate.
It is in that light that the Commission is well on its way towards refurbishing its own part of the Europa portal.
The ultimate objective is to transform the Europa website into a more user-friendly, well-structured and coherent web portal.
It will be multilingual at appropriate levels and the presentation will be more oriented to citizens and communication.
Thirdly, and finally, the decision to revise the Ombudsman's statute rests with the European Parliament, with the approval of the Council.
The Commission is, however, consulted and closely follows developments relating to the proposal, including those in the committees concerned.
The Commission is currently examining the proposal in detail, and has been in contact with the Ombudsman's office to seek clarification on some aspects of the proposal.
In conclusion, I understand that next year the Ombudsman intends to include a few star cases in his annual report.
These are, as I understand it, cases where the handling of complaints by the EU institutions has been exemplary, regardless of whether maladministration occurred.
I think that is an excellent initiative and I also look forward to seeing next year's report.
Mr President, Madam WallstrÃ¶m, Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, my honourable friend Andreas Schwab, on the extraordinary effort he has made in his report to illustrate that, year on year, the institution of the European Ombudsman is becoming extremely important to European citizens, thanks to the work being carried out by the European Ombudsman.
I also wish to express my thanks to Mr Diamandouros, because the new facts that he brings to light in the position he holds are reference points for the trust that the citizens place in the institutions.
I acted as rapporteur for the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2004 and I wish to point out that, compared with that year, during which complaints rose by 53% over the previous year, in 2005 the Ombudsman received a total of 3 920 complaints, in other words an increase in the order of 5%.
This does not mean that there are more cases of maladministration on the part of the institutions of the European Union, but that the citizens are more informed as to their rights.
An important factor for the efficacy of the institution of the Ombudsman is its cooperation with the institutions of the European Union.
I would refer by way of example to the regular updates and meetings between Mr Diamandouros and the Committee on Petitions and its bureau.
The Ombudsman's annual report illustrates, among other things, the efforts being made by the Ombudsman and the Commission, of course, to broaden and further strengthen the network of national and regional ombudsmen, by developing exchanges of information for best practices.
The participation of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament in this network is important and would facilitate practical cooperation between the European institutions and the national and regional ombudsmen and would allow regular contacts with the committees on petitions of the national parliaments and with the ombudsmen of the Member States to be increased.
If we compare the Ombudsman's reports for 2004 and 2005, we see that the result was positive, so that we can concentrate on the points in which the Committee on Petitions is particularly interested.
Furthermore, we can see in this way the essential role he plays and the progress made within one year.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - I too want to thank Mr Schwab, and my colleagues in other political groups as well, for the considerable amount of work they have put into this report.
The Ombudsman's report, particularly the executive summary, is, I believe, an excellent example of how to present our work to the citizens.
It is clear, concise and to the point.
Transparency is, I believe, the key to European democracy and its main building block.
I welcome the increased awareness of the European Ombudsman's role, reflected in the increased numbers taking their complaints to him.
I am not at all concerned about the fact that many of these are not directly his responsibility.
That is a reflection of his success in bringing his office to the notice of the public and perhaps also an indication of the inadequacies of other institutions in making clear who they are and how to access them.
I believe we should not expect citizens to find their way through the maze of EU institutions.
They have more important things to be doing with their lives.
When they have a complaint to make, they will reach for the nearest known vehicle available to them.
I think that the citizen's right to make a complaint is a good thing.
The action of the Ombudsman in referring those cases for which he does not have direct responsibility to the appropriate institution is an excellent way of dealing with such complaints.
I believe it should be followed by other institutions.
One final point: ten years after the initiation of the Ombudsman's statute, there is clearly a need for a review.
I welcome the Ombudsman's initiative in that regard and I look forward to debating it in Parliament in the near future.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I too should like to thank the Ombudsman both for his report and for his interesting presentation today.
I would also like to thank Mr Schwab for his very competent report and analysis of the Ombudsman's report.
There is little to say except that everything seems to be going well in the sense that our citizens are more aware of the Ombudsman's activities.
If the numbers of complaints are rising owing to an increasing awareness of what is possible and an awareness of Europe, then that is helping to bring our citizens closer to us.
That is what we should be all about.
Reports of this type help give us a snapshot of what is going on and of how we can do things better in the future, and this report sets out many of those lessons.
I want to centre my remarks on an issue already mentioned by other speakers, which is that if we want to be citizen-centred then we have to ensure that our citizens can make a complaint easily, perhaps via a one-stop shop.
Simply having a good website may not be the answer.
At present there are a lot of people dealing with complaints, problems and issues.
We have the Ombudsman's very good service, Parliament's Committee on Petitions, the Commission itself, which accepts complaints, and ourselves as MEPs, who receive constituents' case-work, as well as SOLVIT and EUROJUST.
I fear that some EU citizens who apply to one of these bodies only to be referred to another will fall by the wayside and give up.
We need to think about ways in which we can bring these various strands together so that our citizens feel that their issues are being answered promptly and that they are being directed to the right recipient.
That is something we should think about for the future.
Thank you again for your report.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the Ombudsman and also Mr Schwab, for his thorough, complete and positive report.
I would like to begin by expressing my agreement with Mrs Wallis's proposal and with the proposal for a European one-stop shop for the citizens' complaints.
This one-stop shop could bring together SOLVIT, the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions and would be responsible for channelling the citizens' complaints to the appropriate institution.
We cannot expect the public to be able to navigate such a complicated labyrinth as the European Union.
My only regret about the report, which in general is very positive, is its consideration of the third special report by the Ombudsman, which was going to be a report on OLAF and which has been blocked by the Conference of Presidents.
Some of the wording of the Schwab report appears to legitimise this House's Conference of Presidents' attempts to hinder the Ombudsman's work of monitoring European bodies, including OLAF.
In particular we should thank the Ombudsman for some of his efforts, such as those relating to the environment, where there is great popular concern.
I would especially like to mention the case of the industrial port of Granadilla, in the Canary Islands, where the Ombudsman has tried to ensure more rigorous application of the Habitat Directive, with a degree of success.
It is also important to highlight the special report on the transparency of the Council when acting as legislator, a report that I personally was involved in preparing.
We can see that there is slow, gradual, but real progress in this area.
I would like to end by making it clear that the role of Parliament's Committee on Petitions in no way clashes with the role of the Ombudsman, but rather their roles are complementary.
The Ombudsman monitors the European institutions in their day-to-day work, while the Committee on Petitions plays the role of direct intermediary between the citizens and the body of Community law.
There should be more fluid day-to-day cooperation between them, with more information and more contact.
Thank you for your report, Mr Schwab, and thank you, Mr Diamandouros, for your very intensive, wide-ranging and important work.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (ES) Mr President, I too would like to thank the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, and our rapporteur, Mr Schwab, because they are both working to try to improve the way we respond to the European citizens' complaints, administrative or of any other kind.
In fact, I believe that the time has come to take concrete initiatives to make such improvements.
Some interesting ones have already been mentioned, such as the online form and the better demarcation of the competences of the different bodies, but I believe that we should be rather more ambitious.
We should move toward a code of good administrative conduct for all of the European institutions, and the one-stop shop, which Mr Hammerstein mentioned, can also be important.
The reports note that 24% of complaints relate to a lack of transparency.
I believe that we must make an effort to promote a public debate in Europe on how close a relationship citizens have with the institutions and to ensure that those institutions act in an entirely transparent fashion.
In this regard, I would like to mention another problem that the members of the Committee on Petitions should resolve.
Many of the citizens' complaints received relate to large works, large infrastructures, that are carried out in the European Union without the mandatory environmental impact study.
Sometimes the European Commission is late in issuing a report, since the damage caused by certain absolutely monumental works is already irreversible.
I believe that the European Commission must act much more quickly, in order to prevent that damage from having an horrendous environmental impact.
To this end, I believe that we should all do our bit to create speedy assessment mechanisms for these kinds of works, in order to prevent that damage.
I believe that the European Network of Ombudsmen is important, because it may be the key to providing many solutions that can prevent complaints from the citizens of Europe and, where necessary, improve the way we respond to them.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I am, in a sense, wearing two hats today.
As you said, I am speaking on behalf of the Union for the Europe of the Nations Group as well as in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, which makes me particularly qualified to speak on this matter.
I would, of course, like to thank Mr Schwab for his report, which was very well prepared and subsequently adopted in our committee, and I therefore fully agree with everything Mr Schwab has said.
I would particularly like to thank Mr Diamandouros.
He does his job extremely well and this is fully appreciated as, if I may remind you, he has been re-elected to his post by a majority of over ninety percent of the votes cast.
I very much appreciate the contact that Mr Diamandouros has with the European public, outside of his main work as Ombudsman.
He has attended over 170 meetings.
I myself was present at one of these meetings in Poland, which was attended by over 150 people who had come to see who he was, what he had to say and what message the European Ombudsman himself had for them.
This is one of the achievements of Mr Diamandouros' hands-on approach.
As everyone has already mentioned, I would like to say that the active involvement of the European Ombudsman is closely linked to, shapes and reflects a greater awareness of the rights of the European Union citizens, and that they are more aware of these rights precisely thanks to the activities of the European Ombudsman.
The Committee on Petitions, of which I am the chairman, works closely with the European Ombudsman.
We have similar competences, but they are not identical.
It is therefore important to be aware of the differences between the competences of the Ombudsman and those of the Committee on Petitions.
If the President will allow me to extend my speech by a few more seconds, I would like to draw your attention to one more matter.
The Committee on Petitions is a European Parliament body.
It is therefore very regrettable that the European Parliament and its bodies sometimes bypass our committee in their dealings with the Ombudsman.
There was an instance of this on 15 March 2006, when the European Parliament signed a new agreement with the Ombudsman over the heads of the committee which I chair, and which was not involved in this process.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Ombudsman's 2005 report indicates that a growing number of citizens are dissatisfied with the European Union's bodies.
There is a striking lack of transparency concerning their activities and a lack of effective control over the way we spend our money.
The infringement of citizens' right to information is particularly damaging.
A glaring example of this was the campaign to promote the so-called Constitution for Europe.
In March of last year I addressed a complaint to the European Ombudsman regarding the use of EUR 8 million to promote the European Constitution.
This funding was only available to supporters of the Constitution.
This fact was confirmed by a European Commission spokesman on 16 February 2005.
In response to questions from the media on whether European Union money could be used to fund a campaign organised by opponents of the European Constitution, he said, and I quote: 'The Commission is treating the European Constitution like its baby and cares about its ratification' and the 'European Union's Office for Official Publications is not going to print pamphlets written by opponents of the Constitution.'
These frank statements by Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m's spokesman explicitly show that opponents of the Constitution did not, and still do not, have any opportunity to present their views.
For example, before the referendum in Spain, the European Commission spent EUR 1 million on printing 5 million pro-constitutional pamphlets and stickers, which were handed out in public places.
There was a deliberate move to avoid providing information on the negative aspects of the European Constitution.
This was therefore a blatant infringement of the European citizens' fundamental right to equal access to information.
After investigating my complaint for a year, the European Ombudsman decided that the European Commission did not infringe the citizens' right to equal access to information.
In that case, who did?
When they see their credibility collapsing and disintegrating, the European Union institutions resort ever more frequently to mendacious propaganda and to funding and imposing a single, 'true' vision of European unity.
I appreciate the Ombudsman's efforts in the fight to achieve transparency concerning the work of the European institutions, but there is still a long way to go.
Dinners with representatives of the bodies the Ombudsman are investigating are not enough to increase the credibility and authority of his office.
This office should be a real Ombudsman defending our rights, an Ombudsman who speaks out for the truth and defends the citizens from the ills of the European Union machine.
However, such work requires courage and autonomy.
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Schwab.
He has produced a jolly good report and I am delighted to be part of it.
The Ombudsman has been signally successful in his activities, but ironically his success has provoked more interest.
That, however, is actually good news for the task of the Committee on Petitions, to which the Ombudsman reports and whose joint work with him is so important.
I agree entirely with Diana Wallis that is essential that EU citizens are made more aware of the facilities for the redress of grievances, particularly those that exist through the auspices of the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions.
I, with everyone else, congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his achievements, especially, if I may say so, on his determination, past, present and future, in explaining the use of his powers to the new Member States and encouraging them to use his services.
We have plans to do the same on behalf of the Committee on Petitions and I should say that the combination of a Commissioner from Sweden, where the Ombudsman originated, and an Ombudsman from Greece, where democracy originated, is a powerful and influential one.
I am particularly interested in the Ombudsman's special reports.
He will know that I am the rapporteur manquÃ© for one such report, relating to OLAF.
He must know, as must this House, that I will not allow this issue to go away.
Transparency and open dealing must be paramount and this report must and will be dealt with when the judicial process is completed.
As the chairman said, the Committee on Petitions is of increasing importance and must soon cease to be the Cinderella committee at the end of the list of limited significance.
The activities of the Ombudsman and the Petitions Committee are many, various and growing exponentially.
They must be recognised by Parliament and the Conference of Presidents and given the authority they deserve.
(Applause)
(ES) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Diamandouros on his detailed report, which proposes a way forward and improvements in the relationship between the citizens and the European Administration.
I would also like to congratulate Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m and thank her for her tireless efforts to facilitate communications between the citizen and the European institutions and implement quick, simpler and interactive solutions.
I would also, of course, like to congratulate Mr Schwab in particular on the in-depth way in which he has dealt with these issues, which may seem routine but which certainly represent progress on the road towards 'more Europe'.
I am particularly pleased with the progress in the work of mediation and response to the citizens' demands and I am particularly pleased and interested to note the friendly solutions proposed.
I would also urge Mr Diamandouros to develop a format for the peaceful settlement of disputes that serves as a model for Europe in general.
I am sure that the democracy enjoyed by both the Administration and the citizens will be increased by means of a better and more transparent administration.
I am also delighted with the explicit proposal to offer the Internet sites for all of the institutions in all of the Union's official languages.
Given his constructive approach, I share Mr Schwab's concern about the need to improve cooperation, with no obstacles or misunderstandings, between Parliament and the European Ombudsman, while preventing any overlapping between them: the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman are still seeking their own directions, and it is therefore positive that the Committee on Petitions should participate in the European Network of Ombudsmen.
Finally, perhaps because I am not aware of the scale of the issue, I am rather concerned that the future of the Ombudsman appears to lie in the courts, and I hope that that does not mean that improving information and, particularly, the efforts to achieve the peaceful settlement of disputes will be abandoned early.
The proposed judicialisation is not the best way to improve relations between the citizens and the European public Administration, and I would refer to the existing examples that have already been mentioned.
I truly believe that the European citizens' confidence in their Ombudsman will depend on a greater capacity to settle disputes peacefully.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Diamandouros for his report, and Mr Schwab for the report we are debating today.
I share his concerns that it is a little late in the day to be debating this issue, but I suppose it is better late than never!
The Ombudsman is the watchdog of the system.
I would prefer to think of him as a Rottweiler, which is what we need, rather than a tamer breed!
My Irish colleagues will giggle at the 'Rottweiler' description because politically speaking we have one of those in our national parliament.
The Ombudsman has an important role to play and I do not share the concerns of those who maintain that 70% of complaints fall outside his remit.
As others have said, this reflects the fact that there is a huge amount of frustration and people need somewhere to turn.
It is important to underline that.
I am pleased that the Ombudsman, in his wisdom, does not turn them away, but actually assists them.
He should continue to do that.
Others might not agree, but that is part of his job, and we need that flexibility.
I compliment the Ombudsman for trying to promote his work.
There is an onus on all of us in this House to help him in that regard, even if I regard my own office - and I think other colleagues feel similarly - as a one-stop shop.
At the end of the day, I hope MEPs are the first port of call for citizens who have problems.
Mrs Wallis' proposal to set up a one-stop shop is a good one, but let us not forget that we as elected representatives are also here to obtain information for citizens.
The Ombudsman should bear in mind that we in this House often experience as much frustration as the public when it comes to getting information from the Commission.
There is a duty on administrators to see themselves as servants of the public and not as protectors of the system.
If necessary, we will have to train people and change their culture.
I would be interested to know whether the Ombudsman has looked into the attitudes of those who are at the root of problems.
In other words, in the complaints he has upheld, is a bad attitude evident among administrators?
If so, we should do something about that.
I wish to thank all those involved again, and I hope the Ombudsman's workload increases exponentially, as it should.
(NL) Mr President, the European Ombudsman's annual report reveals that a quarter of complaints come from citizens who experience a lack of transparency on the part of the European institutions.
Whilst these complaints are not always justified, of course - as is also mentioned in this extensive report - this is still a large proportion, and so there is much room for improvement.
The rapporteur is right to point out that, according to the Treaty of Nice, every European institution must seek to be as open and accessible as possible.
The bulk of the complaints are directed at the Commission, of course, because they are most closely involved with the citizens, although it is in actual fact mainly the Council of Ministers that is causing the delays.
In the old-fashioned culture of paternalistic power and the top-down approach, openness can wait.
Nevertheless, confidence is a key condition if policy is to be effective, and the world needs a strong EU that is carried by its citizens, because there is more at stake than a little governing.
Would Europe want to stand up for globalisation of a different kind, social, sustainable and fair development?
Only if Europe commits to this can the EU truly gain confidence.
Only a Europe, though, that offers openness in every decision will be given it.
If we want to boost Europeans' confidence in their own European Union permanently, openness and accessibility are absolute political priorities.
I would urge Europe to throw the doors open wide.
(DE) Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to comment on what my esteemed colleague Mrs McGuinness said.
The Rottweiler dogs to which she referred come from the town in which I was born, and so I regard myself as a Rottweiler.
If I can assist you, Mr Diamandouros, in Rottweiler-like fashion, I shall be very happy to do so.
(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Diamandouros, Mr Schwab, I would particularly like to thank the latter two of you for the splendid work that has been done, and to express the hope that Mr Schwab can continue to have as firm a bite - not least where politics are concerned - as the well-known breed of dogs from his home town of Rottweil.
In any case, I wish him every success in that.
You, too, Mr Diamandouros, have an important part to play, particularly since you are, in my view, the relay that connects the public to the European institutions; it is to you that citizens turn with any concerns they may have with them, and your role is to settle grievances and you do try to find solutions.
Last year saw 3 920 submissions made, and in 75% of cases, it proved possible to offer the complainants a solution by setting investigations in motion or referring them onward to the relevant departments; that really is a very high percentage.

The Commission, too, has a very important part to play in this, in that it keeps on trying, by means of various transparency initiatives, to demonstrate how open it is, and I can do no other than encourage it in that, and you, Madam Vice-President, in carrying on down this road.
The fact is that, as we know, great institutions - not only the Commission, but also those in the business world - have a tendency to become self-sufficient and to acquire a life of their own into which it is difficult for outsiders to get an insight, so press on with your transparency initiative, I beg you.
What I would like to say to our Polish friend is that I think it extremely hypocritical to accuse the Commission of providing only such information on the constitutional treaty as shows it in a favourable light.
The publications I have seen were all kept relatively objective and were a necessary means of informing the public as to what this is all about.
(Applause)
It really is hypocritical to demand, on the one hand, more information, and, on the other, to ask that some of it be curtailed.
That is why we must press on together down this road in order to be able to build a Europe in which we can all share.
(Applause)
(PL) Mr President, the 2005 report allows us to conclude that the European Ombudsman is successfully achieving the aims of increasing the effectiveness of his institution in the field of good administrative practice and adherence to the principles of the rule of law and human rights.
At this point, we should say a word of thanks to Professor Diamandouros, who is in charge of this institution.
The public nature of the Ombudsman's activities deserves praise.
Nevertheless, it is worrying that 70% of all complaints lodged still remain outside of the scope of competence of the Ombudsman.
This is nearly always a result of the fact that the essence of the complaints are not directed against the bodies or institutions of the European Union.
It shows that the division of competences between the institutions and the decision-making processes are still unclear to many European Union citizens.
It is therefore vital to define and clearly delineate the role of the Ombudsman and the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions in a way that is clear to the citizens of the European Union.
Last year, the number of complaints rose by 5% over the previous year.
This may reflect the fact that the Ombudsman's activities are more widely acknowledged, or it may be linked to the fact that not all European Member States have this type of institution, which means that many people go to the European Ombudsman with problems involving national, regional and local administrative bodies.
The Ombudsman must increase its efforts to provide the public with reliable information.
Citizens must have easy access to information in their own mother tongues.
This will allow them to feel that they are card-carrying citizens of the European Union, whose welfare is important and whose voices count.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, on an excellent report.
I think that he will continue in his role as a watchdog, or indeed a rottweiler, of the law.
(EL) Mr President, eleven months after the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the institution of the European Ombudsman, the annual report for the 10th year is being approved today.
I congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his worthy representation and effective conduct of the role of defender of transparency and honest administration in the European Union.
Perhaps next year we shall examine his annual report in Parliament earlier and more quickly and the Committee on Petitions, as the competent committee, will be in direct contact with the Ombudsman, so that it can be informed about the procedure for the signing of interinstitutional agreements between him and the European Parliament.
Paragraph 6 of the Schwab report justifiably expresses our regret about the signing of a new agreement with effect from 1 April 2006, in other words before the report for 2005 had been approved.
The Ombudsman also submitted on 11 July a proposal for the adaptation of his statute.
Paragraph 13 of the Schwab report welcomes the fact.
However, I should like to comment that the issues which he touches on in his request are particularly sensitive and his arguments are particularly weak.
The ban on intervention in cases pending before the courts is something which cannot be contested on the basis of the Treaties.
Community servants must be bound by professional secrecy.
We have competent institutions for examining human rights; but we too, as a parliament controlled by the citizens, have the jurisdiction to investigate and file complaints.
There is a plethora of extrajudicial procedures.
The Ombudsman has numerous duties and one can only hope that he has time with the staff in his department, which fortunately is constantly increasing - from 38 to 51 and 57 in 2006 - to respond to the increased number of complaints.
If, however, the Ombudsman condemns the lack of transparency in the work of the Council, we call on him in Amendment 1 - which I call on you to support - to check, not after specific complaints from citizens, but on his own initiative, the transparency with which EPSO recruitment competitions are carried out and the recruitment methods of the European agencies, including his own department.
This is an issue which touches on the sensitivity mainly of the new Europeans, who take part in competitions and interviews in their thousands and do not have the right to find out why they failed.
My thanks also to the Commissioner for highlighting the intention of the Ombudsman to use his time praising the Commission.
Ombudsman. Mr President, I should like to thank very warmly all the Members of this august House for their very encouraging words.
I take heart from the support I have from this particular body, whose cooperation I value enormously.
I also commit myself and my staff to trying to move forward, to doing more of the same and to doing more of what I am asked to do.
It is not possible for me to cover all the remarks that have been made, but let me address some of the issues.
Firstly, I am very grateful for the support I have received concerning the Statute.
With the permission of Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I would like to clarify two points concerning this, which I will do in Greek, since she addressed me in Greek.
(EL) Mr President, Mrs Panayotopoulos, I wish to assure you that the European Personnel Selection Office is already within the European Ombudsman's mandate and that this is a matter of particular concern to us, which we are monitoring very, very closely.
As far as my recommendations are concerned, I also wish to assure you that the request I make ...
(The speaker was cut off by the President, who drew his attention to a problem with the interpretation)
I apologise, Mr President. I did not realise there was a problem with the interpretation.
I thought it was an attempt to test my ability to speak in my native tongue!
With the President's permission I would like very briefly to assure Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou and the House that the European Personnel Selection Office is already within the Ombudsman's mandate and we devote a great deal of time to questions concerning recruitment.
On the Statute, I want to make it absolutely plain that the Ombudsman is not, under any circumstances, asking for the right to initiate cases before the Court.
That is clearly not for us to do.
The Court and the Ombudsman are separate.
What we are asking for is the right to intervene before the Court, as that right has been given to the European Data Protection Supervisor in cases of major violations of fundamental rights.
That is a fundamental difference.
I repeat, we are under no circumstances seeking to have access to the Court in a way that would in fact go beyond my mandate.
I appreciate the encouragement concerning a Single Code and I am working with Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m to see whether that would be possible; she referred to that in her own remarks.
I wish to thank Sir Robert Atkins in particular for his determination to see that all the special reports submitted to this House by the Ombudsman will be dealt with eventually.
I hope that will be done.
The one-stop shop idea is a very important one.
I would very much look forward to working with Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and with other institutions and perhaps launching a brainstorming and reflection procedure about that idea, so that we can serve citizens better.
I want to stress that the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are complementary organisations; I am very grateful to that committee and we will work with it constantly with a view to moving forward.
Lastly, I have a few comments to make if I may.
The inadmissibles are indeed very important and we shall try to reduce them.
But we will continue to help all citizens who come to us for the wrong reason by using the Network of Ombudsmen of the European Union as a mechanism of transferring complaints to them, thereby helping those citizens and in a sense trying to apply subsidiarity in non-judicial mechanisms.
We work with our colleagues at national and regional level to serve citizens better, which includes the transfer of inadmissibles.
I thank Mrs McGuinness very much for her very laudatory remarks.
I view myself as an external mechanism of control over the administration and therefore, if everything else fails, yes, I will also have to act as a Rottweiler.
Leaving aside the Irish overtones of that - I do not want to get into theological implications here, or divinity - I think that is, however, the ultimate step.
The first step, on which I am working very closely with the Commission, with the Secretary-General of the Commission and with Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, is to reach out to the institutions, to reach out to the Commission, and help them understand what their obligations are.
It is indeed to help them realise that a change of culture is extraordinarily important if the European institutions, including the Commission, are in fact to understand that the institutions exist to serve the citizen and not the other way round.
Thank you very much for giving me the time to make these clarifications.
Once again, I want to thank this House for its very encouraging and very warm reactions to my report.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Voting will take place today at 12.00.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(HU) I wish to draw attention to a matter concerning Mr Diamandouros's report on his activities in 2005, on which the European Parliament has already adopted a resolution this year.
In 2005, the European Ombudsman submitted a special report to Parliament, because he had found an unjustified discrimination with regard to funds for members of EU staff with children with special educational needs.
In his draft recommendation, he asked the European Commission to take the necessary steps to ensure that parents, whose children are excluded from the European Schools because of their degree of disability, should not be required to contribute to the educational costs of their children.
Parliament's resolution on the matter requested that the Commission respect the principle of equal treatment.
The necessary steps were not taken, however, since unfortunately in the course of school enrolment this autumn, it once again happened that a pupil with special educational needs was refused admission.
This practice, which violates respect for human rights, has led to several families living apart and having to leave Brussels, and often the European institutions as well.
As laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the EU Treaty, the right to education, equal treatment and the prohibition against any form of discrimination constitute the founding principles of Community law.
I therefore request that, having regard to the Ombudsman's recommendation and Parliament's resolution on this matter, the European Commission create the conditions for equal educational opportunities for children with special educational needs, in line with European principles.
European communication policy (debate)
The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Herrero-Tejedor, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the White Paper on a European communication policy.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, when Mrs WallstrÃ¶m presented the European Parliament with the White Paper on a European communication policy and I discovered that I was to have the honour of being rapporteur for the report on that White Paper, a journalist friend of mine, who works here in the European Parliament, told me that the best thing I could do was to produce a very short report containing just one paragraph saying 'Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, the only use this White Paper has is as wrapping paper, because, although it expresses good intentions, it is useless'.
I replied to my friend, 'I think you are being unfair.
I believe that Mrs WallstrÃ¶m is making an effort to create a good information and communication policy and furthermore, call me naÃ¯ve, but on several occasions she has shown me that that is her objective.
The problem is that the circumstances are not currently right for organising such an information and communication strategy in the European Union.'
Why is that?
Because there is currently no legal basis for organising that information and communication strategy and therefore for establishing actions and controlling them properly.
Let us therefore take a further step - and this is the approach I took when drawing up this report - and let us try to change the way things have been until now, because every time we meet to talk about the information and communication strategy, we make a load of general recommendations that come to nothing.
Let us try to achieve what we do not yet have.
Let us create that legal basis that will enable us to act much more effectively in the future.
On looking into it, I discovered that there was only one formula for creating that legal basis: the application of Article 308 of the Treaty.
When the circumstances in which that Article could be applied were explained to me, I was tempted to say, 'it is impossible, we are not going to be able to do it'.
There need to be three circumstances in place that are very difficult to bring together: firstly, the Commission must ask for it; secondly, Parliament must agree; and thirdly - and the most difficult circumstance to bring about - the Council must approve it unanimously.
I spoke to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and she told me that the Commission was in agreement.
I spoke to all of the shadow rapporteurs, and they told me that Parliament could be in agreement.
In the interinstitutional group we had the opportunity to hear the opinion of the Minister who, on that occasion, was representing the Council, and she told us that she was in a position, not to guarantee unanimity in the Council, since that is something she could not do, but at least to say that she believed there could be such unanimity.
All the elements are therefore in place at the moment, but that will be very unlikely to happen again at a later date.
In politics, the most important thing is to take advantage of the circumstances in place at a particular time.
We currently have an opportunity that we will probably not have again in the future: a very good opportunity to improve things, to create a legal basis.
That does not mean that it will cure all our ills, but it will clearly be a step forward.
We have just two possibilities: either to accept it or to reject it.
I propose that we accept it.
Mrs Prets, Christa, I would ask you please to help me, because I know from Mr Corbett's speech that your party is going to vote against the application of Article 308.
Mr Corbett believes that there is another way to achieve that legal basis.
There is not.
Or if there is, tell me what it is.
Let us negotiate.
Let us talk about it.
There has been no amendment from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs offering us an alternative.
GÃ©rard Onesta, shadow rapporteur for this report, whom I thank for speaking on behalf of the Group of the Greens/Euroopean Free Alliance, has understood that we have this opportunity and has agreed that we should take advantage of it.
You know, Christa, that there was only one vote in the Committee on Culture and Education against this report, which calls for the application of Article 308.
Let us try to take advantage of it.
This is not an ideological issue.
I have praised Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, who is not from my party, because I believe that she is doing the right thing.
I would like to thank Mr Bono, because he has been shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in the Committee on Culture and Education.
I know that you would help me if you could.
I also know, however, that group discipline sometimes imposes views that are not the right ones.
I would ask you to reflect between now and the vote, so that we can have this report adopted.
I would earnestly beg you.
This is not an ideological issue.
It is a political issue.
One of timing.
It must be now or it will be extremely difficult in the future.
This is the best way to organise the policy we want.
Otherwise, members of the Committee on Culture and Education present here today, we will meet every year and hear a list of good intentions, which, as well as costing a lot of money, will be communicated by us to the Commissioner at the last moment, and we will have no control.
We shall have little idea of how the money will be spent or of what use it will be.
We will be going round and round in circles.
Mr Bono, Mrs Prets, Mrs Badia I Cutchet, I can see you here, you are members of the Committee on Culture and Education: we discussed the report and approved it in that committee, with just one vote against.
Mr Corbett's amendment did not succeed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
We have not been provided with any alternative.
Let us respond to the political opportunity we are being offered.
I would earnestly beg you.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Herrero-Tejedor, for his hard work, the positive tone of this report and the support it gives to the Commission's ideas.
However, I must say that I hope his friend is a better journalist than he is an expert on the EU institutions.
When the Commission adopted the White Paper back in February we said that we intended to open a new chapter as regards communication between the European Union and its citizens.
As we put it, the new communication policy should move from monologue to dialogue.
It should put ears on the European Union.
It should move from institution-centred communication to a citizen-centred approach based on people's fundamental right to information and to be heard.
It should move from Brussels-based communication to a decentralised approach and from an accessory tool to a real European policy on an equal footing with other EU policies. In other words, it should be a policy in its own right.
This leads me directly to the issue of the legal basis for the communication policy, which is, I agree, an issue here, and a very difficult and controversial one at that.
It is a means of giving legitimacy to what we do and creating commitment, and it would set out the principles by which we worked on communication.
The Commission has proposed a citizens charter, or a code of conduct as we have called it, to which the institutional actors, including Member States, could subscribe on a voluntary basis.
The report suggests a somewhat different approach, inviting the Commission to work on a draft interinstitutional agreement.
It also urges the Commission to explore the possibility of launching a genuine Community programme for information and communication on Europe on the basis of Article 308 of the EC Treaty.
The Commission is willing, as you recommend, to explore all possibilities for finding a sound basis for joint action, ranging from a citizens charter to a formal legal base.
I am more than happy to embrace those ideas, again in order to give legitimacy to what we do.
I am glad to see that your report acknowledges the importance of civic education and citizens' involvement in the decision-making process.
It calls on the Commission to ensure consultation with the public at an early stage of policy-shaping, and this view is also shared by a broad cross-section of civil society.
We shall certainly take action in this regard.
We are all more than aware of the crucial role that the media - press, television, radio and the internet - play in contemporary democracy.
We all know that a large part of the communication gap has to do with the fact that European affairs are quite marginal and often misrepresented in the media.
I would like to be clear on this issue, because you have asked the Commission to define with the greatest precision what role it would like to assign to the media.
However, the problem cannot be addressed from that angle.
The only role the media can have is the one that our democratic tradition has entrusted them with, which is to inform citizens in an independent, pluralistic and critical manner on European issues in the same way as domestic issues.
The problem is how to create the conditions for this to happen, and this will be the theme of a stakeholders' conference that will take place in Helsinki in December, as a follow-up to the White Paper.
Another central theme of the White Paper is understanding public opinion.
Our societies are experiencing unprecedented changes due to higher internal mobility, migration and globalisation.
Public opinion has become more and more complex to define and comprehend.
Over the last 30 years, the Eurobarometer has been a very useful tool for measuring public opinion, perceptions and orientations.
However, we feel that much more can be done.
I take note of your hesitations as regards our proposal for an observatory for European public opinion, but we can adopt a more pragmatic approach or step-by-step approach to this matter.
For example, the idea of setting up networks of experts to exchange best practices and exploit synergies received considerable support during the public consultation.
I shall not touch upon the many other issues that you rightly address in your comprehensive report, such as the role of Member States, the importance of the regional and local level, the involvement of national parliaments or the responsibilities of political parties, which are all crucial, of course.
We fundamentally agree on those issues, and I am very glad that the scope of my mandate allows me to work out concrete proposals to help realise these common aspirations.
Your report is a milestone in the process we have started with the White Paper.
It contains strong encouragement to move forward on the basis of ever-closer cooperation between our two institutions.
The Commission will issue its final report on the White Paper next spring.
That report will set out a series of concrete proposals, to be followed up by operational plans of action.
The way ahead is still long and far from easy, but I am confident that, with your support, we can make a real change in the way Europe communicates with its citizens by giving them a real say and by listening to them.
An EU communication policy can be a tool to strengthen democracy and I look forward to the debate on it.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, but in my one minute I want to focus directly on what we should be doing.
We should be examining the way we communicate with our citizens, and that means we have to be absolutely clear about the language that we use.
It must be plain, simple, clear and precise.
It is no use talking about tools and barometers.
People switch off. We need to be passionate about what we do and how we do it.
This is arguably the most successful European institution, and yet we are criticised and we very rarely defend ourselves.
There are 25 Member States with different political persuasions and cultures, acting together for the common benefit of 450 million citizens - absolutely brilliant!
But do we sell and promote what we do effectively?
We do not.
Do we ensure that national parliaments engage in their scrutiny role?
No, we do not.
We merely stand back and take the criticism.
Finally, let me grab four seconds.
I urge the Commission to go forward with its proposal for the review of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
It is not in this report.
It is accepted in the Commission work programme.
We can only be held accountable and be effective if people understand what we do for them.
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has clearly signalled its consent to an EU communication policy and commends Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m's work.
Indeed, it is high time we had such a policy, judging by the Eurobarometer findings which show the extent of the gap between our institutions and the expectations of our citizens.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs also welcomes the Commission's focus on two-way communication, which is very much a new departure, involving the institutions addressing the public and the public addressing the institutions.
The problem is that, after having proclaimed this excellent principle at the start of the White Paper, the Commission has tried rather desperately to identify practical ways in which the public can express themselves, and this, Commissioner, is perhaps the main shortcoming of your proposal.
You might find it useful to borrow from parliamentary proposals, such as the one aimed at setting up an open citizens' forum, the consultation mechanism that will be piloted in 2007.
Our committee is not opposed in principle to a new interinstitutional instrument, but it does ask for careful study of the guarantees and obligations implicit in such an instrument.
It stresses, moreover, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights already defines citizens' information rights and that our Parliament's prerogatives must be respected come what may, particularly its right to address itself freely to the people of Europe.
It is also essential to take account of the very specific rhythm of the European debate, which is entirely separate from the national agendas.
In this respect, we wish to reiterate our desire to have an annual plenary debate on the subject here in Parliament.
We are in favour of the use of new technologies, provided they do not create a digital divide between those who have access to modern technology and those who do not.
We also believe there is a need for better stratification of partnerships between civil society, European political parties and journalists - without prejudice, of course, to the independence of the media.
We will even go so far as to make the iconoclastic proposal that a local European administration network be established to bring Brussels closer to the people.
What my report leaves unsaid relates to the legal basis.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs did not wish to express its opinion on Article 308.
By a very narrow margin, it voted against explicit reference to that article, but by another very slim margin - and our thanks are due here to Mr Duff - it decided against formally ruling out recourse to Article 308, if you still follow the reasoning.
The debate on the legal basis therefore remains wide open, although from a personal and tactical point of view I unreservedly endorse the proposals made by your rapporteur, Mr Herrero-Tejedor, whose open-mindedness, conviviality and constructive approach I commend.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am actually glad that the debate on information policy follows immediately after that on the European Ombudsman, for the Ombudsman was, this morning, often referred to in terms of his relations with the public.
I find it problematic - and we in the Committee have found this too - that the Commission, where its relations with the public are concerned, often lags behind what the Ombudsman actually wants to achieve.
The Commission's responses to the many requests made of it by members of the public or those running projects in the European Union are often unsympathetic or even brash, and that is quite simply not on.
It is precisely those interested citizens who are responding to demands for the submission of proposals who are often on the receiving end of such unfriendly treatment that they lose interest in working any more on European projects.
What, then, is going to happen in the case of those members of the public who have other interests and are not committed in the first place?
That is no way to get our message across to people, and I have to say that, if what we are trying to do is to get people more involved, then the Commission's new communications strategy is not going to achieve that.
We need people where they are, and that is where we have to communicate with them; it cannot be done from Brussels.
The Commissioner means well; she really does want to communicate, but the problem is that the public have no desire whatever for what the Commissioner is serving up to them, since they take the line that the Commission is going to be all in favour of it anyway and that they do not have any faith in it.
What you need, then, is elected citizens on their home patch; you need the Members of this House, of the German Bundestag, and of the regional parliaments, with whom you can talk about matters of European interest.
We have the great problem, though, that they do see themselves as responsible.
We must try to communicate more on the public's own terms, reinforcing the infopoints in cities and establishing more of them, for it is these infopoints in town halls that get the message across to the citizens.
We must, of course, make use of the programmes that the European Union already has in the educational field; educational programmes like Comenius, Erasmus, and Leonardo make for the best communications strategy, so let us use them, and then we will find the citizens that we need in order to continue the European project.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament on the draft report concerning the White Paper on a European communication policy, I should like to say straight away, as Mr Onesta did before me, that I welcome the overdue recognition of communication as a two-way process between the institutions and the people, and no longer as a mere marketing operation.
There is still, however, a long way to go to the establishment a European communication system in which European affairs are part and parcel of the public domain at the national level.
What I said in committee I shall repeat here: I regret that the White Paper continues to overrate new technology and to underrate national television services.
We know, and Eurobarometer surveys confirm, that the mainstream national channels remain the favourite information source of the EU population.
It seems to me that we must act accordingly.
Furthermore, the White Paper remains strangely silent on the subject of financial resources.
As we all know, democracy, and hence communication, come at a price.
As long as the Union's multiannual budget is lower than the budget of a European advertising agency, little effective progress can be made.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Herrero, of course, and to say to him that the debate on Article 308 is not closed and that Mrs Prets will return to the problem shortly.
Commissioner, it is a sad fact that the Commission only ever talks about communication policy when Europe is in crisis.
It is only when things are going badly that the Commission feels the need to communicate.
The question that must be put to the Commission concerns the actual content of its communications.
People see the Commission as an ultraliberal body with no interest in protecting European citizens from the storm winds of globalisation.
We owe it to our citizens, and to democracy, to provide a better explanation of what happens in Brussels.
Most of Europe's citizens are unaware of the achievements that have been made possible by the policies and financial resources of the European Union.
What is more, they are too often unaware that every decision in Brussels emanates from the will of the Member States.
If electricity, gas, rail transport and now postal services have been liberalised, it is because the Member States wanted them to be liberalised.
Without the will of the Member States, these things would not have been done.
In conclusion, I believe that what we need is not so much a code of conduct for the European institutions on communication with the public as a code of conduct for the Commission to ensure that it pursues policies that are more in tune with people's concerns.
Lastly, we need a general code of conduct to apply to the Member States so that they assume their responsibilities and put a stop, once and for all, to the practice of ascribing European successes to national policies and national failures to the Community.
That would raise Europe's stock.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the communications White Paper, on which we are to vote today, is an example of how you can turn anything into a science and learn some thoroughly interesting things, but, if your house is on fire, what you really have to do if you do not want the place to burn down is - rather than philosophising about fire - to locate the source of the fire, cut it off, and grab a fire extinguisher.
The EU has a massive communications problem and a bad image.
The worst thing that the public accuse us of is that we are over-bureaucratic, with laws that are too divorced from reality and that bring them no benefit.
That is not, of course, true, but it is in that very area that we have to get the message across, and that we often fail to do.
The latest example of this was the EU's safety regulations relating to hand luggage on aircraft.
Listen to members of the public talking about this at an airport, and you will get some idea of just how worked up they get about this, but they see the villain as being Brussels rather than Osama bin Laden or some other terrorist figure.
It is we who are blamed for their no longer being able to take even a bottle of water on board with them, and we who are mocked when we insist on 100 ml containers, even though such containers are available nowhere in the EU's single market.
Now, since it was the Commission that drafted this secret legislation, I will ask them just what they did to improve the way in which this was communicated; did they distribute leaflets to every passenger, asking them for their forbearance?
If they did, I heard nothing of it.
Did they put all their trust in media reports?
That is not enough; what you have to do is address the public directly, for you are interfering directly in their lives, and, since it is their freedoms that you are restricting by means of these security rules, you have to come up with some very good arguments in favour of them.
That is what communication is about.
We have now spent two and a half years working at improving communications, but all that has emerged has been intellectual concepts - the very antithesis of efficient communication - so let us be more practical, more down-to-earth, and, instead of making communication into an abstract science, let us simply see it as what it is, namely a tool, rather like a fire extinguisher when something is burning.
Mr President, to date the information leaflets and electronic media of the European Union have formulated its anti-grassroots policies in the most attractive terms in that, even though they are for the benefit of capital, they present them as being for the benefit of the workers, thereby eliminating opinions to the contrary; nonetheless there have been no results.
The workers, judging on the basis of their life experience, are starting to question the vision of the European Union.
This was expressed with the huge abstentions at the last European elections, with the referenda and 'no' votes on the European Constitution in France and Holland, with the reactions to the euro and inflation and with the huge movements against privatisation (in education, health and welfare) and employment relations (in insurance and other matters), facts which prove that the credibility of the European Union is on the wane in the eyes of the people.
Thus, slowly but surely, a trend is emerging towards more and more acute social and political clashes.
It would appear that grassroots dissatisfaction is turning into a fight against this inhumane policy of poverty, injustice and war.
Thus, the Commission, in its White Paper on a European communication policy, is enlisting all means, starting from its institutions, the Member States, the national parliaments, local authorities and the media and making use of education in new technologies and the Internet, to identify public opinion and grassroots concerns and dissatisfaction and is using the information to improve its propaganda.
Its objective, through and from the peoples' money, such as the PRINCE programme, through what are supposedly information actions, is to improve its propaganda and to lobby for the adoption of the European Constitution, which militarises Europe and condemns the people to fewer rights and constant austerity and for tolerance and acceptance of its policy overall.
It concentrates its efforts on controlling the channelling of information from state broadcasting stations, national and regional newspapers and private channels, the overwhelming majority of which are in the hands of capital, the Internet and so forth, so as to formulate the exact content which will put a gloss on its European imperialist policy, making it attractive and persuasive in the eyes of the peoples.
The White Paper basically develops a dynamic and active communication policy hypocritically on the pretext of freedom of expression and understanding of its policies which are applied.
Thus it wants to conceal its unilateral political choices through reinforced social dialogue which will safeguard the necessary smooth operation of the European Union as a mechanism of capital and social consent to and/or complicity in its political choices.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, we have good reason to be holding today's debate on European communication policy, as it is a non-existent policy.
What we currently call communication is, in fact, nothing more than common propaganda.
The words and arguments put forward have not and will not strike a chord with the people, because what the people want is dialogue and not one-sided propaganda.
As long as pre-packaged dogmatic solutions are thrust upon them, people will not feel that they are participants in the discussion and will shut themselves away and become entrenched in their convictions.
If we truly want modern communication or, even better, a social dialogue, then we must first answer the question of whether we are ready to speak with the people.
If that is the case, then we should begin with a debate on what the European Union should be.
Should it be a federal state or a Europe of countries and nations working in close cooperation?
If we want a dialogue, then we have to acknowledge the results of the constitutional referenda in France and Holland and not stubbornly return to the draft Constitution, which is already dead.
Let us also stop arguing about whether it is Europe for the citizens or the citizens for Europe, and let us instead try to hold a great European debate on the direction in which we are heading.
Let us also bring Europe closer to the citizens, not by means of propaganda, but through good solutions, clear legislation, simplified procedures, less red tape, citizen-friendly institutions and the opportunity of discussion between equal partners.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the EU communication policy that this report evaluates was devised in an attempt to - and I quote - 'halt the rise of euroscepticism'.
It is yet another reaction to the French and Dutch public rejecting unequivocally both the draft Constitutional Treaty and further integration.
Instead of accepting that 'no' means 'no', the political elite have deluded themselves that the French and Dutch people did not base their 'no' votes on sensible and educated grounds.
Indeed, a Commission official is recently quoted as saying: 'given the recent experience in France and the Netherlands concerning referendums, we would not advise anyone to organise one'.
So asking people what they want is a no-no.
May I offer you some advice?
You are in a hole of your own making.
I suggest you stop digging. You should throw away the spade.
Why?
Very simply, because you are missing the point.
It does not matter how much style and gloss you put on a project, because if the substance is rotten then it will fail.
For communication to be successful you have to listen.
Simply shouting louder will not do!
The institutions are being disingenuous to the people they purport to represent.
The French and Dutch have scuppered the project, yet you go on as if this never happened.
Let me assure you that if and when the British people are afforded the same opportunity, the results will be even more conclusive, and that no communication policy will change the growing realisation that, right across the Member States, the EU project is an expensive failure.
(NL) Mr President, whilst the report is right in pointing out that citizens need to be listened to, it fails lamentably when it comes to coming up with any specific solutions.
It is assumed, apparently, that better communication policy is only possible if there is more Europe, hence the plea for the European Constitution and for pan-European political parties.
It appears that not much has been learnt from the referendums in France and the Netherlands.
I do admit that it is difficult to fill the public with enthusiasm by means of communications policy if the rest of policy is at odds with public opinion.
I would refer, for example, to the policy on enlargement.
Although the Commission and Council know only too well that the large majority of Europeans are opposed to the accession of a non-European country such as Turkey, they are not in the least concerned about that.
We can communicate until we are blue in the face, but it will do nothing to change the yawning gulf between public opinion on the one hand and European institutions on the other.
The report suggests that the Commission's information bureaus cannot kindle public interest.
This is putting it mildly.
In Flanders, for example, the country's largest party, the Vlaams Belang, has not had one single invitation to the debates on European issues that have been organised in the provinces.
These were debates among like-minded people, because the only party that is critical of the enlargement policy and the Constitution was not allowed to take part.
What is more, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m has openly admitted to the Belgian Federal Parliament that this discrimination goes on.
Consequently, in my country, so-called European communication is nothing but propaganda - propaganda that nobody takes serious and that carries no credibility whatsoever.
It is, in other words, a waste of money.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, the problem of communication between the Europe of the institutions and the Europe of the citizens has been ignored for too long.
Europe has not yet formed a political centre able to attract and mobilise its citizens and to win their support in these changing times.
The reasons for this are plain: the lack of any adequate institutional reform, the prevalence of the power of indirect representation in the Council over that of direct representation in Parliament, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and work done behind closed doors over genuine efforts to publicise and inform.
As the Eurobarometer reminds us, people see Europe's institutions as a remote or even alien freedom.
They have not even the vaguest idea about some of them.
The street is a long way from the centres of power, and the political system does not respond to the social milieu.
The truth is that European, transnational, cosmopolitan citizenship only exists when imposed for political reasons, precisely because it does not have the spontaneous vigour of our national citizenships.
Therefore, we urgently need to grasp the strategic importance of the general mass media; we urgently need to include Europe as a subject on the curriculum in schools, universities and training centres; we urgently need to publicise our institutions in the media; we urgently need to take more seriously the work done by the Commission's and Parliament's information offices in the Member States; and it is essential not to shelve the constitutional project to recast Europe: without serious institutional reform and without an effective information policy, Europe will be a giant with leaden feet.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we have just heard about the referendums on the draft European Constitution in the Netherlands and in France, but the reasons why people voted in this way also need to be set out, for it was not attributable to any failure on the part of the European Union, and most Europeans have already voted in favour of the Constitution.
Nevertheless, thought does have to be given to how to communicate this, and a number of practical proposals have been put on the table in the form of the White Paper, but, if the knowledge deficit is to be reduced, it will be necessary to develop and push forward high-quality public relations work at every level.
Among other things, that will mean more infopoints, which will be able to give useful answers to members of the public wandering haphazardly through cities in search of some way of making contact.
We need more media at the local, regional and national level, for it is often the case that reports in most of the media take a negative line.
The Council, too, whether in Brussels or Strasbourg, speaks a different language to what the people are used to at home.
It is the EU's fault that this or that decision went the wrong way; there, too, there is a need for action, and that is why - just as the report demands - it is important that dialogue among the Council, the Commission, Parliament, and the public, be encouraged, for with it, perhaps, we might stand a chance.
I am in favour of the significance of the programmes being underlined.
Programmes such as Leonardo and Erasmus, for example, do much to promote communication, but we are reducing their funding rather than topping it up.
Such things as active citizenship and town partnerships are important, and we need them; they are preferable to innumerable brochures, and yet it is here - in quite the wrong place - that cuts are being made.
Article 308 would weaken this House, for it makes no reference whatever to Parliament.
It would put us out in the cold, and that is something we have to defend ourselves against.
(FR) Mr President, a White Paper on a European communication policy - what a good idea!
What an idea, for that matter, to have been so long in coming!
As has already been said, this was surely the only good thing to have come out of the rejection of the Constitution in France and the Netherlands.
It will have confronted European leaders with their huge responsibilities in terms of communication.
Europe is not suffering from a democratic deficit - the charge is unfair - but from a lack of information, explanation and appropriate, interactive and comprehensible communication.
While I welcome this White Paper, I regret that it confines itself to a catalogue of questions and principles.
The time to speak about forums, consultations, surveys and networks and to reflect on possible measures has passed - it is now time to act.
The three key points in this document, in my view, are points 23, 24 and 32.
It is in the education system that the battle for European citizenship can be won.
We experience this daily in our encounters with students.
It is in higher education that real citizens of Europe are nurtured, thanks to Erasmus, through direct contact with our cultures and our differences, and it is with the traditional media, for I have no faith in the alternative media, that we must work to highlight the value of our everyday activities and reveal the benefits of our legislation.
Let me say in conclusion, Mr President, that this is a huge challenge and that this debate is essential, because the real threat in Europe today is not scepticism but indifference, which we must combat, and our weapon is communication.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
I agree with the Commission in upholding the importance of bringing the institutions closer to citizens, not least by means of an efficient communication policy.
However, I share the rapporteur's view that defining a common line for all the institutions would reduce the scope for freedom of expression and also for adapting communications, as is necessary, to the various spheres of action and to future social and technological realities.
In fact, a legal framework in this area would serve only to burden pointlessly a sector that thrives on creativity and spontaneity.
Let us not forget that communication is a tool and not an end in itself: if we want to reconnect citizens with the institutions, we need to do everything in our power to draw close to them and to listen to the requests coming from the ground.
We therefore need to avoid pointless legislation; deal with policies and actions that have a positive practical impact on growth and development, revive the draft Constitution, increase efficiency, and, most of all, do away with this ridiculous and extremely expensive monthly commute.
If we can do all this and are then able to communicate it, we will be closer to citizens.
(HU) Mr President, according to a popular theory, it was the capacity for speech, that is, for communication, which raised human beings above their environment.
Since I am not an ethologist, I do not know whether this is really what happened, or whether other factors also came into play.
It is an unquestionable fact, however, that the human being is the most communicative being on earth.
In other words, advanced communication is a distinctive natural characteristic of humanity.
The problem is that not only we humans, but the institutions, organisations and groups we create also wish to communicate, something that does not pertain to the essence or nature of these institutions.
A study of history leads us to conclude that in the past, the institutions responsible for organising and directing our lives did not always strive for high quality communication, but in fact often explicitly closed themselves off from it.
The effort to achieve ever more perfect communication with society is a distinctive feature of democracy, and has been made possible by the 20th century revolution in telecommunications.
Without radio, television and the Internet we would not even be able to talk about this question today.
In light of the above, I affirm that the European Union is one of the most open and communicative organisations that we have ever experienced in Europe.
Naturally, it is not perfect, far from it, but until now, it is the best.
It could use fewer technical terms or abbreviations, its concepts could be clearer and more comprehensible, and so on.
But all this would be worthless if the EU, as a communicator, lacked credibility.
Without credibility, even a comprehensible message does not come across.
And in this regard something else must be said: the greatest destroyers of the Union's credibility are none other than the politicians and governments of its Member States.
They are the ones in whose statements the EU is presented solely as the cause of difficulties, whereas the positive achievements of the EU are always mentioned as the attainments of the government in question.
This White Paper, too, will be successful only if the Member States commit themselves to developing and supporting a new, common European communication policy.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the debate on this report we will once again consider the gap separating the Community's institutions from the citizens and how to reduce it.
Though I acknowledge the great efforts made by the Commission and this Parliament to close this gap, it is absolutely essential that the media be involved, as well as national parliaments.
The general view is that the media in the Member States believe that what happens here is not newsworthy or is not generally of interest to the citizens.
We should firstly therefore involve the media more directly, so that they can help us to communicate and bring the Community dimension closer to the citizens, without using any technical jargon.
With that kind of cooperation, we would probably also be able to communicate the European Union's current news at times of day when media audiences are largest.
For our part, we must facilitate the work of these professionals, and it is essential that we simplify the procedures and make them more transparent.
There must be cooperation and joint work with the national parliaments, so that they can communicate issues of concern at national, regional and local level and thereby, in the normal course of things, generate feedback on issues including those relating to European policy.
Furthermore, I believe that we should continue to look to the Internet as one of the main providers of Community information.
Nevertheless, the Internet only reaches a section of the public that already has an interest.
We have another public, which only uses traditional media - television and radio - via their respective national, regional or local channels and stations.
The new technologies can open up a new horizon in this field, incorporating different services and products that can facilitate the multimodal transmission of information, thereby increasing the number of people receiving it.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur.
In the short time available to me, I should like to mention the strategy used by a former President of this Parliament, Pat Cox, to communicate Europe.
In a famous speech, he started by talking about the local impact on a small community in the south of Ireland that used European legislation to maintain its telephone service. Then he moved on to the global - or European - level, speaking about European values and issues such as Blue Flag beaches, the European health card and other benefits that accrue to European citizens.
That is a good strategy - communicating the added value of Europe at the local, regional, European and global levels.
Look at this week and take two pieces of legislation we have passed.
We passed an amendment to Aarhus, which already guarantees public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters.
We have added GMOs to that.
That will make a difference at individual local level, where citizens can influence outcomes.
We also passed the Services Directive.
That too will have a positive impact on our citizens.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on a European communication policy aimed to halt the rise of Euro-scepticism, given the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands.
This is the cunning ploy to try to bridge the gap between the Union and its citizens, instead of ceasing to impose abstract ideas and harassment through regulations and directives.
I agree entirely with the rapporteur: drawing up codes of conduct to be observed by all the European Institutions reduces the scope for independent opinions even further.
This is even more true for Parliament, where the already extremely restricted scope for freedom - simply look, for example, at the way in which the President is elected, or the way in which speaking time is reduced for non-attached Members and their right to influence the legislative process is violated - would be further reduced by a code defining communication procedures.
It is time to stop wasting money on ridiculous propaganda.
(DE) Mr President, to say that selling the European Union is difficult is less a statement about its potential usefulness than a factual one about how to inform people about it.
The things with which Europe has to concern itself are highly complex; our procedures are longwinded and laborious, and that makes it difficult to get its citizens to comprehend just what they get out of it.
In part, though, we also have ourselves to blame for this sorry situation, with the Commission so desperate in its pursuit of objectivity that it finds it impossible to say a clear and firm 'yes' to the European Constitution, and the authorities of this Parliament of ours doing everything they can to shut visitors to Brussels and Strasbourg away in back rooms and basements.
That is why what we need is new and better information without arguing about the legal basis.
What we need is well-made and properly edited television reports on the work Europe does that is actually of benefit to people.
What we do not need is glossy brochures that nobody reads and that everybody throws away.
Mr President, for us to plunge into legislation in this sensitive field would be a great mistake.
It is clear that an EU media law would be complex, controversial and unpopular.
My group therefore strongly opposes the deployment of Article 308, which is neither necessary nor suitable.
We greatly prefer the Commission's original and pragmatic proposal for a code of conduct.
(ES) Mr President, on 1 February 2006, the Commission presented the White Paper on a European communication policy, and the report by Mr Herrero, approved by a large majority in the Committee on Culture and Education, takes up the key elements proposed by the Commission, but also introduces an essential new element, which has led to a serious and in-depth debate, both in this Parliament and at interinstitutional level.
Paragraph 10 of Mr Herrero's report urges the Commission to examine the possibility of launching a European information and communication programme, in accordance with Article 308 of the Treaty.
In my capacity as Vice-President responsible for information and communication in this Parliament, I have followed this debate very closely and I must point out that the interinstitutional group has expressed its support for the creation of a legal basis and that all of the institutions have also done so, as Mr Herrero has said.
My conclusion is that it is worth trying.
I am aware of the reservations that this proposal has generated, all concerning a loss of control by this Parliament, which is strange, ladies and gentlemen, since it is difficult to lose something that you do not have.
There are three things that we must bear in mind, though.
Firstly, the report makes it clear that, if the Commission presents a proposal, Parliament must participate fully in the drawing up of its content; secondly, Parliament has the powerful tool of budgetary control; and, thirdly, there is the interinstitutional group on communication, the mandate of which is to establish the basic guidelines for the communication policy.
We must have courage and create a communication strategy that is capable of presenting, explaining and defending Europe through reason, but also with enthusiasm, passion and emotion.
I would therefore like to express my full support for the report by Mr Herrero and his proposal to create a programme on the basis of Article 308 of the Treaty.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, I have to admit that this discussion has left me a bit puzzled.
In the White Paper on a new communication policy, we have tried, first of all, to analyse the problem with previous communication policies and see exactly what we have to do to ensure that we democratically safeguard citizens' rights to information and ensure they have a say in decision-making in Europe.
We established five areas of action.
We need to define common principles, such as freedom of expression, diversity, inclusion, participation.
We need to empower citizens.
We need to involve them in different ways, from civic education, giving them a basic knowledge of what goes on, to engaging with civil society.
We cannot ignore the new media and new technologies.
If we think that it is enough to publish an article in The Financial Times to communicate with citizens, I am sorry, this is 2006.
The debate is also shaped elsewhere.
The real divide, as someone said at one of our stakeholder conferences, is between the decision-makers and those who use the internet.
If you look at the campaign in France, most of the websites on the Constitution were 'no' websites.
Where were those who wanted to argue for a 'yes' vote?
They did not use the internet enough.
We have to understand and embrace what is going on in the new technologies.
The fourth chapter is understanding public opinion.
We have to be more professional in monitoring and linking up to public opinion.
As many of you have said, we have to do the job together.
All the institutions have to take responsibility.
In this debate, some have accused us of issuing propaganda as soon as we do anything and others seem to think that it is enough to increase the number of Europe Direct information points in Europe.
That will not do.
We have to have a serious communication policy as a tool for democracy, a tool for citizens.
They have a right to better understanding.
They have a right to participate in a public sphere where we have a truly European political culture and truly pan-European media, reflecting the debate that is going on and helping us to understand and follow it.
We also need to establish meeting places for citizens where they can participate.
You say we already have democracy in Europe.
Well, we have a participatory deficit.
The majority of citizens still say they know very little or do not know enough about the European Union and its institutions, they are not able to follow what is being done in the European Parliament or the Commission.
Can we simply say that we do not care and continue with business as usual?
We have to change the way we communicate with citizens and it is their right to engage with us.
We will continue to work on all the things that you have mentioned.
We have steadily increased the Europe Direct centres.
We now have 400 and for the first time we have established them in the UK as well.
We will increase this number next year, with 30 new centres, and we will continue our obligation to inform citizens, but that is still not enough.
This is not just about information, it is about communication.
We have to make it a two-way process.
Most of our citizens get most of their information from radio and television, so we have to make sure that we help radio and television at all levels to report to citizens on what goes on.
That is also part of our policy.
We will review Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, because access to information is absolutely crucial.
Transparency, openness and access to information are central to a new communication policy.
Of course we discuss the content of policies: that is at the core of everything we do.
A communication policy cannot replace good content or good policymaking.
That is why we engage in Plan D activities, where we invite citizens to participate in the political debate about the future of Europe.
We take seriously the proposals for practical measures such as Agora, which are extremely important.
We have analysed the problems with the lack of a real communication policy.
We have identified the five areas of action.
We want a serious reaction from the European Parliament.
Are these the right areas?
If you have other proposals, we would be more than happy to work out very practical ideas, so that we can come back to ask for the necessary budgetary resources.
We will combine that with reforming the way we work internally, in order to become more professional, more open, more transparent and more democratic.
I thank you for this debate and I hope that we shall continue to discuss these very important principles in trying to establish a communication policy that is right for the European Union and all its institutions.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner.
I was itching to intervene in this debate.
The Commissioner explained matters extremely fairly, and I thank her for expressing herself so forcefully, but I should be overstepping my role if I were to say any more.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The Communication is pragmatic if it is must be based on regular dialogue with European citizen, discussion and clarification of EU's goals and strategies, aiming at the development of the successful European Project.
Part of the responsibility lies on the EU, but the other part on Member States. Efficiency is the main target.
Therefore the communication must be target-oriented and should have a legal base.
It is a must that the dynamic European society itself play a decisive role.
The communication should reach out to all members of the society through a variety of tools, including traditional methods and new communication technology.
Communicating through clearly defined messages, clear visions on Europe and European policies on the citizens' own languages.
European citizens would like to see Europe as a model of growing economy, competitiveness social cohesion and solidarity and would like to feel that they are part of the decision-making processes.
However, correct communication must be made up not only introducing success stories, best practices, added values but challenges, problems that our societies must prepare for and find solution to them together.
This is what we should work for.
(HU) Scepticism, a failed constitution and growing uncertainty regarding the enlargement process, the new Member States and even the Union itself - these are the consequences of an inadequate European communication policy.
In light of this, we should welcome the Commission's White Paper and its intention to improve communication between the Union and its citizens.
The creation of a European public sphere composed of citizens who are well informed beyond their own national borders must undoubtedly be the objective of an effective European communications policy.
On the one hand, we must make significant improvements in the information we provide about the functioning and objectives of the European institutions, and on the other hand, we must be capable of listening to the citizens of the Member States and of making them active participants in shaping European policy.
It is at the local, regional and national levels that we most effectively reach those citizens, and therefore we can make our provision of information more effective only by strengthening the communication and making the flow of information more effective between these levels and the EU institutions.
It is not enough merely to create adequate, two-way channels of communication, but the message itself must be made clearer and more understandable.
Therefore, we must stop using a technical EU jargon that is often difficult even for an expert audience to understand.
The European project and its success depend, among other things, on the people who are its subjects and purpose - the citizens of the Union - making it their own.

Statement by the President
I wish to make an announcement to my honourable friends.
It was with huge relief that we heard the news that the death penalty on Mr Mirza-Tahir Hussain, a British subject detained in Pakistan, has been commuted.
The President of the European Parliament and the Members of the House made huge efforts to save Mr Mirza-Tahir Hussain's life.
In this particular case, we are all in a position to welcome the fact that the message sent by Parliament was heard.
(Loud applause)

We were in fact voting on paragraph 44(2), while the screen was displaying paragraph 44(1).
There may therefore have been some confusion.
(IT) Mr President, I should just like to confirm that, regarding the previous vote, 44(1) appeared on the screen and not 44(2), in the last vote that was cast.
There has been a great deal of confusion as a result of this.
That concludes the vote.

Explanations of vote
in writing. In supporting this joint Resolution I want to highlight the demand that the EU must now use all the instruments at its disposal, including the EU association agreement with Israel, to end the violence in Gaza which has condemned the Palestinians to a slow death and risks setting the whole Middle East on fire.
Israel, as a democratic state, needs to ask itself questions.
Lawlessness cannot be allowed to be the answer to lawlessness.
The Israeli government must end its blockade of Gaza and there must be an immediate resumption of aid to Palestine, and support for the government of national unity.
I support the call for an international inquiry into the possible use by Israeli forces of weapons of mass destruction, as was suspected in Lebanon.
I also support the idea of an international peace conference bringing together all the actors in the Middle East, including Syria and Iran.
I demand an international force in Gaza.
We have contributed to the chaos in Palestine and we have allowed the Israelis to go too far in the name of their legitimate right to protect their security.
We now have mistakes to make up for.
in writing. - (PT) I wish to state that I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Gaza.

I did so not because I do not consider the military excesses that have struck at civilian populations to deserve condemnation, but because I feel that the overall content of the statement includes some highly negative terms for the State of Israel, which has been the victim of constant terrorist attacks.
That is in no way justifiable.
in writing. - (PT) Israel is escalating its aggression against the Palestinian people with impunity, as shown by the Beit Hanun massacre and the criminal, inhuman blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has been turned into a vast concentration camp.
In view of that, the European Parliament - while dodging the issue of having endorsed EU participation in the financial blockade of the Palestinian Authority - condemns the Israeli army for the massacre it committed and for its action, which it terms 'disproportionate'.
Faced with glaring evidence of Israel's brutal aggression against the Palestinian people, Parliament merely 'notes' the disgraceful US veto of a draft resolution in the UN Security Council repudiating Israeli aggression, when actually it should be denouncing US complicity with and responsibility for the attacks and crimes perpetrated in the Middle East, specifically by Israel.
Rather than proposing the presence of foreign troops in Gaza and the West Bank, which might just help maintain the status quo, what is required is condemnation of Israel over its colonialist policy, the construction of the illegal wall, the systematic repression of the Palestinian people, the destruction of infrastructure, and all the obstacles it places in the way to prevent the legitimate Palestinian Authority from working and to stop the creation of a sovereign, independent Palestinian state, with its capital in Jerusalem.
in writing. (IT) On behalf of the Transnational Radical Party, I voted wholeheartedly against the resolution on the situation in the Gaza Strip (just as I would have done on any of the proposals of the various 'groups'), believing all the resolutions put forward to be inadequate to solve the structural problems of the Middle East.
I do not think that the European common position on the longest-running conflict in the Middle East can continue to be the old policy of 'two peoples, two states'.
As the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations has pointed out, every civilian victim of the attacks by Israeli forces is a tragic error, experienced as such by Israeli democratic society, while every Israeli killed by the rockets and suicide bombers of Hamas or Hezbollah is hailed as a triumph over Israel, which is looked upon as a tumour to be eradicated from the Middle East.
In reality, Mr President, the viable and urgent European alternative for building peace between Israel and the Palestinians (and in the Middle East) is this: two peoples, two democracies.
This is because only by proposing democratic reforms and the anti-nationalist European federalist model to the Mediterranean as a whole will it be possible to eradicate the structural causes of the Middle East conflict, causes which are very similar to those of all the wars which have devastated our continent, until the decision is made to renounce national sovereignty as an absolute value.
in writing. - (PT) The solution to the Middle East conflict depends on our upholding peace and mutual recognition and rejecting violence, terrorism and gratuitous military action, as well as accepting that a democratic state has the right to exist and to defend itself.
This resolution does not do that.
It is disproportionate when it should be reasonable, and blind when it should be clear-sighted.
We cannot regard the terrorist attacks on Israel as the acts of 'combatants' and then accuse Israel of massacres.
This Parliament should not be lecturing a democratic government about its composition, when it merely asks elected but by no means democratic governments to do the bare minimum in recognising Israel.
That requirement, by the way, is not even mentioned here.
Furthermore, I will not be associated with a resolution that seems to conclude that the United States is the reason why the conflict is still going on, and which rather unsubtly threatens to call the association agreement with Israel into question just as an association agreement with Syria is about to be approved.
The sincere solidarity shown towards the victims and the refusal to accept that the attack on Beit Hanun should go unpunished cannot make me forget the need for balance or make me support a resolution that is disproportionate and counter-productive.
in writing. - (FR) I voted against this resolution on Gaza.
This is not in any way to minimise the tragedy of Beit Hanoun, where misdirected Israeli artillery fire claimed 19 Palestinian lives.
The mistake had tragic consequences, and it is right that we should condemn it.
The tragedy, however, does not entitle us to adopt a resolution that is the most unbalanced I have seen in my seven years in this Parliament.
I cannot possibly enumerate all the partisan and contentious points in the text of this draft.
In general terms, it is a one-sided indictment of Israel.
Paragraph 4 just about manages a reference to the country's inalienable right to security.
The Qassam rockets that rain down daily on Israeli towns, on the other hand, do not merit a single mention.
No more than three words are devoted to Gilad Shalit, who has now been in the hands of kidnappers for three months.
This brief reference, moreover, is hidden away at the very end of paragraph 19, with no mention of his comrades who have been kidnapped in Lebanon.
Some comments made during the debate, indeed, were despicable, such as the reference to an Israeli society 'hypnotised by rudeness and racism', or the talk of Palestinian deaths counting less than Israeli deaths.
It seems that anything goes nowadays, and the boundary between anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic rhetoric is overstepped without anyone batting an eyelid.
