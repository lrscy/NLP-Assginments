To close, I wish London the same good luck for 2012 as Athens had with the 2004 Olympic Games, despite any doubts which London had at the time.
Good wishes also because Great Britain has the capacity, in conjunction with Beijing in 2008, to strengthen relations still further.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â Ladies and gentlemen, critics of Europe often claim that it is too self-absorbed, and that it takes a great deal of notice of what is going on in neighbouring countries while ignoring problems in other parts of the world, such as Eastern Asia.
I believe that todayâs debate will demonstrate exactly the opposite, namely that we are very much aware of the challenges emerging from Eastern Asia, of the growing importance of China and the role of Japan, North Korea and South Korea, and of course of the security problems that are rife in Eastern Asia.
As far as China is concerned, I agree entirely with the current UK Presidency that global dialogue needs to be strengthened, that Europe and China are global partners, and that they must tackle global challenges such as security, energy security and climate change together.
I too believe that this dialogue and partnership will be enshrined in the framework agreement, and that it will actually encourage dialogue on human rights rather than ruling it out.
Previous speakers have already referred to Taiwan and South Korea, and these two countries are prime examples of the way in which a democracy can gradually be built out of a totalitarian and authoritarian country.
In my opinion, a similar outcome could be achieved if we were to step up dialogue with China on human rights issues.
Â Â  Mr President, perhaps this policy under consideration is the best one at the given time.
I am going to start by mentioning the political background.
Our policy is based on the âone Chinaâ principle, but this principle has deprived the people of Taiwan of another fundamental principle: that of self-determination.
I might understand the pragmatism of the EU, but it should not be selective, as we have never spoken of a âone Koreaâ principle, for example.
My next comment is about the compatibility of China and Taiwan.
I can hardly imagine two states under one political umbrella if they have such incompatible political systems.
I see two options: we must either revise the one-China principle and adjust our policy in respect of it, or wait for an indefinite amount of time until China per se becomes a democratic state with a multi-party system, a rule of law and respect for human rights.
The proposed policy stems from the second option, but it is by no means the best choice.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me begin by thanking the honourable Members for their wide-ranging and thoughtful contributions to this important and timely debate.
I also thank the Commissioner for her generous welcome in this Parliament today.
I also look forward to our many debates over the weeks and months to come.
Let me respond first to some of the main points raised during the last hour.
Mr Jarzembowski spoke of the importance of the recent EU-Japan meeting.
We clearly welcome and will work towards strong relations with Japan, and, of course, with China.
He spoke wisely of the need for continued understanding and reconciliation within the region.
Mr Ford recognised the interdependence that is surely one of the hallmarks of our globalising world.
He also raised the issue of the arms embargo, as did a number of speakers, including Mr Szent-IvÃ¡nyi, Mr Romeva i Rueda, Mr Belder and Mr Kristovskis.
Let me, therefore, take a moment or two to address the queries that have been raised.
As Members are aware, a review of the European Union arms embargo was, of course, announced by the European Council in December 2003 and is presently ongoing.
In June, the European Council also recalled its conclusions of 16 and 17 December 2004 and invited the Council to continue its work on that basis.
No date was set for a decision.
The Council also welcomed the launch of a strategic dialogue on Asia with the United States and Japan.
We look forward in the course of our Presidency to taking this forward.
No decision has yet been taken on lifting the EU arms embargo in China.
The review launched in December 2003 is, as I have said, ongoing.
In its conclusions in December 2004, the Council recalled the importance of the criteria of the code of conduct, which have been referred to by a number of Members today, including the provisions regarding human rights, stability and security in the region and the national security of friendly and allied countries.
Mr Szent-IvÃ¡nyi also raised the issue of the European Unionâs position on Taiwanâs participation in the World Health Organisation.
There are difficulties over Taiwanese membership of the World Health Organisation.
The WHO is a United Nations specialised agency where statehood is therefore a prerequisite of membership.
The public health benefits to Taiwan from observer status appear limited, since the World Health Organisation and Taiwan already share information on an informal basis.
The European Union made its position public on Taiwanese participation at the 2004 World Health Assembly.
Ireland issued an EU Presidency statement that strongly supported the principle enshrined in the WHO Constitution that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being.
It also expressed hopes that all parties will show flexibility in finding mechanisms to allow Taiwanese medical and public health officials to participate in these activities.
At this yearâs World Health Assembly, the issue did not come up for vote in the General Committee, but we understand that the WHO secretariat and China recently signed a memorandum of understanding on WHO technical exchanges with Taiwan.
Mr Meijer offered his own distinctive views on Chiang Kai-Shek and on his successors in Taiwan.
I would simply reiterate the point I made in my introductory remarks that today Taiwan is, of course, a full democracy.
Mr SzymaÅski and Mrs Dobolyi spoke of the anti-secession law recently passed by China.
So let me say a further word on China-Taiwan relations and cross-strait tension.
The European Union and the Council attach great importance to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, which is important for the whole region and indeed beyond.
The Taiwan question should be settled peacefully, as I said, through peaceful negotiations.
We welcome any efforts by both sides to lower tensions, such as, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, the cross-strait charter flights and visits by Taiwanese opposition parties.
We hope that both sides can find a mutually acceptable basis for a resumption of peaceful dialogue and avoid unilateral measures, which might heighten tensions.
Luxembourg issued two Presidency statements this year on cross-strait relations.
In February, a statement was issued welcoming the agreement to cross-strait direct charter transfer flights over the Lunar New Year.
The second statement issued in March by the Luxembourg Presidency followed Chinaâs adoption of its anti-secession law, which has caused so much commentary in the course of our debate this afternoon.
That statement voiced concerns over the legislationâs reference to the use of non-peaceful means.
It asked all parties to avoid any unilateral action that might rekindle tensions and also encouraged both sides to develop initiatives that contribute to dialogue and to mutual understanding.
In his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Li on 17 March, almost immediately after the passage of the law, the High Representative, Javier Solana, expressed the European Unionâs concerns about some elements of the anti-secession law.
He acknowledged positive elements in the law, strongly supporting the call for cross-strait dialogue and cooperation, but made clear that references to a potential resolution of the issue by non-peaceful means was very much at odds with European Union policy.
He clarified once again the position of the EU: first, full support for a one-China policy and, secondly, resolution of the situation through dialogue and peaceful means.
Mrs Stenzel told us of her mission departing for the Korean peninsula tomorrow and this was also referred to by Mr Mavrommatis.
I wish her and her colleagues well in this important work and I look forward to hearing a full report of her endeavours on her return.
Mr RouÄek mentioned the criticism sometimes directed at the European Union that it is too inward looking.
I would simply say that those who make that criticism would have done well to listen to the calibre and contributions of the debate we have had this afternoon.
I therefore welcome his endorsement of our approach, which recognises that Europe must look outwards and actively engage with the challenges and also the opportunities that our modern globalising world provides.
Mr Kristovskis and Mr Claeys appropriately raised the issue of human rights in China.
I can assure both Members that the European Union raises a lot of human rights concerns with the Chinese Government at the biannual European Union-China human rights dialogue, which is a regular high-level exchange.
The last round was held in Luxembourg in February.
The next round will take place in Beijing this autumn.
The European Union also regularly engages Chinese interlocutors on human rights issues, including at the very highest levels outside these dialogues.
The European Union also funds human rights projects within China.
Let me say a word or two in conclusion.
The Chinese presently have a target to reach per capita income comparable to that of todayâs developed countries by about 2050.
The significant development of economic strength was really the opening framework with which I approached this debate.
That was echoed by the words of the Commissioner immediately following my contribution.
Whether it reaches that ambitious target or not, the development of its economic and trade ties is already all but irreversible.
China is also accepting the responsibility that economic strength brings.
It has more influence on the world stage in such fora as the WTO, the G8 and the United Nations. This is all to the good.
Many of the problems we face today, such as climate change, which will clearly be one of the significant items being discussed in Gleneagles over the days to come, can only be solved through action by all.
The Council has a close interest in supporting Chinaâs successful transition to a stable, prosperous and open country that fully embraces free market principles and the rule of law.
For this reason, the European Union has a policy of strong engagement with China.
This engagement is mutually beneficial and is not confined solely to matters of trade.
The European Galileo programme will provide high precision global satellite navigation services, an area in which China is keen to develop links with the European Union.
A cooperation agreement was concluded in October 2003, under which China has pledged to contribute EUR 200 million to this programme.
Of course, we do not imagine that there will not be disagreements or that there will not be differences of opinion.
We trust that our relationship with China is strong enough for us to be able to meet to address these challenges in the weeks, months and years ahead.
Â Â  . Mr President, a lot has been said in this very interesting debate.
I thank all Members for their interesting contributions.
They have concentrated on a few topics.
With regard to the arms embargo, my colleague has said almost everything.
I should just like to answer MrÂ Jarzembowski, confirming that we are aiming at a legally binding code of conduct.
It will depend on the Member States, but that is our aim.
With regard to human rights, it was said by a few Members that we have not mentioned human rights.
That is simply not true.
On the contrary, human rights feature in all our political dialogues and great significance is attached to them.
I recently met with Foreign Minister Li and I was also involved in a troika in China.
The main topic there, apart from the arms embargo and some trade issues, was the human rights issue.
We clearly said â and this went on record â that the Chinese should go on, for instance, with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and with releasing prisoners incarcerated after the Tiananmen Square protests.
We have a human rights dialogue at least, where these issues can be clearly talked through and then, hopefully, taken up by the Chinese.
I would also like to mention Taiwan.
The European Union has advocated â and this is a unanimous policy â the one-China policy, which means that we do not recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state and we have no diplomatic or formal political relations with Taiwan.
Nevertheless, we have cultural and economic relations with Taiwan.
Therefore, it is not for us politicians but for high officials to go to Taiwan, where they hold exchanges of views.
We also do not support Taiwan's efforts to become a member in international fora because, if such membership implies statehood, that is not possible according to the consequent policy that we have.
Taiwan was able, by contrast, to join the World Trade Organization because the WTO supposes that each member is a separate customs territory, thus making Taiwan's membership possible.
With regard to the China-Taiwan question, the EU has been very explicit with both sides, consistently insisting on a peaceful resolution through dialogue, as I mentioned.
We were indeed very pleased, and said as much, when opposition politicians went there.
We said that we encouraged them to do such things with all other politicians.
The whole question of the United Nations, of multilateral diplomacy, is very important.
We stand before a reform of the United Nations.
China will have a very important say there.
We would like to work in a very constructive way.
I should like to pay tribute to Mrs Stenzel and other colleagues for this interesting mission to the DPRK.
It would be in all our interests if the six-party talks were resumed.
If needed, we are always standing ready.
There is no need for the European Union to come in, but if there is a need â we have always mentioned that to all the parties â then certainly we would be prepared and ready.
I thank you for this highly satisfactory discussion.
We must accept a China that will rise with or without us.
Therefore, we must focus all our interests in shaping that rise to ensure that China emerges as an open society committed to the rule of law at home and abroad and also as a power that acts responsibly regionally and with regard to global security and, hopefully, in the future, democratically.
It is now at a critical place in the global supply chain, meaning that the significant EU business and consumer interests also need to be consolidated and advanced.
We need to influence the reform process in all areas of society and the economy.
We try to do that in our bilateral talks, in our troika talks, within the framework of the different international organisations, or at the United Nations.
Â Â  Â I have received five motions for resolutionsÂ¹(1) to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 7Â JulyÂ 2005.
Â Â  Â Â Â Security in the Far East is of crucial importance, particularly for those people who suffer from the lack of security in the region on a daily basis.
I ask the House to imagine how it must feel to be a citizen of North Korea, condemned to endure the whims of Communist rulers; how it must feel to live in Taiwan, and to go about oneâs daily life in the face of anti-secession efforts by the Peopleâs Republic of China; or how it must feel to be a Tibetan, and to have become part of a minority in oneâs own country.
It is our duty to provide support to those in danger.
The âOne Chinaâ policy is only acceptable so long as it does not involve violating the Taiwanese peopleâs right to self-determination, and Taiwanese citizens must not suffer from its enforcement.
The Peopleâs Republic of China may be an economic tiger, but in democratic terms it is unfortunately anything but.
The principle of territorial integrity would be easier to apply if the country were a democratic state under the rule of law.
Until the Peopleâs Republic of China improves its human rights record, however, any pressure brought to bear by it on Taiwan will be unacceptable.
Europe has succeeded in overcoming the political effects of the Cold War, whereas Asia has not managed to overcome the political, economic and social effects of a real war, namely the Korean War.
It is debatable whether or not North Korea lost this war, but there can be no doubt that ordinary people did.
These people are entitled to lead a normal life, instead of living in an open-air museum of Communist totalitarianism.
Â Â  Â The next item is the Council and Commission statements on a world without landmines.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am honoured today to have the opportunity to open this debate on âa world without landminesâ.
Support for international mine action is one of the most important political priorities of the European Union and I am genuinely grateful for the efforts of the European Parliament in helping to ensure that this issue has not dropped down the international agenda.
The European Union took an active role during the First Review Conference of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on their Destruction in November 2004, which was referred to as the 2004 Nairobi Summit on a Mine-Free World.
The European Union considers that the First Review Conference of the Convention was an important milestone to take stock of what has been achieved up to now in implementing the Convention and identifying what needs to be done to renew the commitment of States Parties in eradicating the inhumane effects of anti-personnel mines.
There is a risk that we may lose sight of the importance of this issue when debating safely today in the heart of Europe or, for that matter, in New York or Geneva.
I would therefore like to set the scene for this afternoonâs debate with a reminder of the extent and the severity of the problem and why it is important that the European Union and the European Parliament continue to play such a leading role.
It is estimated that between 15 000 and 20 000 people are killed or injured by landmines each year.
These deaths and injuries take place in more than 80 countries around the world, from Angola to Zimbabwe and even closer to home in the Balkans.
Astonishingly, this equates to more than 40 casualties per day, a figure which I am sure everyone here today will agree is simply unacceptable.
The vast majority of these casualties occur in countries no longer in the grip of conflict.
However, landmines do not recognise the end of hostilities.
It is a horrible truth that millions of anti-personnel mines still exist and, in some parts of the world, are still being laid, affecting the poorest people in the poorest countries, the people least able to deal with the threat and the people most in need of our help and support.
Anti-personnel landmines are merciless and indiscriminate.
They cannot be accurately targeted; they do not distinguish between soldiers and civilians, adults or children.
The injuries inflicted by landmines on those unfortunate enough to come into contact with them are truly horrific.
This is no mistake.
Anti-personnel landmines have been designed to maim rather than kill their victims.
The victims of landmines suffer horribly, being literally blown to pieces.
Put simply: landmines cause deprivation, random death and untold suffering in many innocent civilian populations.
So it is right that the international community should take action and that the European Union should be amongst the front-runners.
The Ottawa Convention or âMine Ban Treatyâ prohibiting anti-personnel landmines has enjoyed wide international support and there are now 152 signatories.
Much progress has been made to combat the scourge of these terrible weapons since the Conventionâs entry into force in 1999.
The Convention is a success story.
Before the Convention, 34 nations were thought to be trading in anti-personnel mines. Now, apart from some illicit activity, virtually no such trading is taking place.
54 nations used to produce anti-personnel landmines; today 15 nations are thought to have the capacity to produce mines, but most of these countries are not actually doing so.
Seven years ago mines were used in 19 countries; now it is probably 5.
Effectively, the ban on these anti-personnel mines is global because of the huge and appropriate stigma now attached to the use of these weapons.
Over 37 million stockpiled anti-personnel mines have now been destroyed.
Large areas of the world have been cleared of mines and made productive again.
These are achievements that the international community can be proud of and would never have come about were it not for the Mine Ban Treaty.
But that does not mean we should relent on our objective for a complete universalisation of the Ottawa Treaty and we must work towards an agreement to ensure that the comprehensive action plan at the Nairobi Review Conference is implemented fully.
Standing here today before you, I am particularly proud and grateful for the role that the European Union has played in the fight against anti-personnel landmines.
The European Union has helped maintain political cooperation as well as practical assistance.
I fully support the European Unionâs goal to âdrastically reduce the lingering threat and impact of landmines in the context of increased local security and regional confidenceâ.
Some may argue that the European Unionâs target of âzero victimsâ is too optimistic and is, indeed, unachievable.
But it must remain our goal and we are committed to work towards reaching this target.
The European Unionâs 2005-2007 mine action strategy operates on the basis of three thematic objectives: to reduce the anti-personnel landmine threat, to alleviate mine-victim suffering and aid socio-economic reintegration and to enhance local and regional impacts of effective mine action capacity.
In pursuit of our aims, we have demonstrated both political and financial commitment to making them a reality.
We will continue to do so.
The European Union has sought to promote all efforts likely to contribute to the goal of the total elimination of anti-personnel landmines, including through joint action and diplomatic dÃ©marches, dialogue with third-party countries, as well as activity in international fora.
There is still much to be done.
The European Union has and will continue to back policy in this area with resources.
Financially it is projected that the total European Union assistance for mine action under our 2005-2007 strategy will amount to at least EURÂ 140Â million, which will be linked to the European Unionâs wider development goals.
Member States are backing this up with additional bilateral funding to countries in need.
It is clear that where there are landmines, there is little prospect for development.
The very presence of mines exacerbates poverty by preventing the productive use of land and infrastructure, while the cost of treating injured survivors of landmine accidents drains the poorest nations of already scarce resources.
This is why humanitarian de-mining is particularly important.
We will continue to support mine action focused on the poorest countries.
Future mine action will depend strongly on incorporating mine action into countriesâ development plans.
Failure to do so will adversely affect the hopes to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, which will be such a focus of the Millennium Review Summit in September.
Let me conclude by saying that the European Union is determined to achieve the complete elimination of the threats posed by the landmines, by promoting universality, destroying stockpiles, clearing mines and assisting victims.
We do so in close cooperation with the international community, be it governments, international organisations or, indeed, non-governmental organisations.
Let us continue to take concerted action until the last anti-personnel mine is cleared from the face of the earth and the target of zero landmine victims is finally achieved.
Â Â  . Mr President, besides being extremely important to the international community and to the European Union, the topic of landmines is also of great personal interest to me.
During the war my father trod on a land-mine and had a leg amputated, so you can imagine that in a way that marked my whole childhood.
I therefore, as Foreign Minister, felt very strongly committed to the fight against landmines and I think it is a centrepiece to our work on human security.
As we have heard, landmines remain a threat in too many countries.
Five years after the Mine Ban Treaty entered into force and after the successful outcome of the Nairobi Review Conference last year, the international community, with the European Union as a leading force, has achieved significant progress towards a world without landmines.
To date 144 countries have ratified the Mine Ban Treaty.
Whilst we have indeed achieved great successes, a lot remains to be done and there can be no long-term security without human security.
Support for international mine action therefore continues to be amongst the most important political priorities of the European Union.
Our efforts to combat landmines are an integral part of our foreign humanitarian and development policy.
In response to the Nairobi Action Plan, the European Commission adopted the second Mine Action Strategy for 2005 to 2007 at the end of last year.
Its overarching objective is a zero-victim target.
What we want is a world where no-one will be injured or killed by landmines.
This is not a remote political dream. It is an achievable goal.
To make it reality, the Commission is further strengthening international assistance in mine action, by strongly encouraging States to ratify the Mine Ban Treaty and also by helping them implement it.
In this regard, it is my pleasure to announce that, following the recent ratification by the Ukrainian Parliament of the Mine Ban Treaty, the Commission and the Ukrainian Government have just agreed the details of a major project for the destruction of land-mine stockpiles.
We have explained to our Ukrainian partners that they needed to ratify the Mine Ban Treaty before we could release any funds.
This is therefore an encouraging example of concrete cooperation that promotes universal adherence to the Treaty.
Our strategy is supported by a budget of EUR 140 million, 10% more than for the 2002 to 2004 Strategy.
This money is well spent, not just on marking, clearing and destroying mines, but on alleviating the suffering of the victims, socio-economic reintegration and the enhancement of local and regional capacity.
To give you just one specific figure, in Afghanistan we shall have spent approximately EUR 40 million between 2001 and 2006, in order to make the country safe for the civilian population.
I would like to stress that since the signature of the Mine Ban Treaty overall financial support from the Community and the Member States reached a record figure of over EUR 1 billion, almost half the global budget for land- mines.
This proves that here too the European Union is a global actor that can make a difference and it also proves that the European Parliament and the Commission, together with the Council, are a strong team in foreign affairs.
I very much welcome and support all your initiatives and thank you for having put them on the table.
Finally, I would like to say that we currently face heavy weather, but that is no reason to become introspective.
We must remain firm in pursuing our ultimate external policy goal and that is a secure Europe in a better, more secure world.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner for her remarks and commitment.
I particularly welcome the British Minister of State for Europe, Mr Douglas Alexander.
It is very nice to see him here.
I have been involved in action against the scourge of anti-personnel landmines for some 10 years now.
It is a pity that we still have to raise this subject.
As the Minister has mentioned, many of the poorest parts of the world are still afflicted by these weapons.
It is estimated that there are still about 15Â 000 mine victims every year and millions of mines are still stockpiled.
The fact is the armed forces of afflicted countries are not involved enough in mine clearance.
Too much is left to NGOs and the international community and there is a danger that the political campaign that supports mine action will head off in other directions instead of concentrating on what really matters: making safe those areas where the suspected presence of mines is a bar to normal life and economic development and assistance to mine victims.
It is most important that the landmine problem is, to all intents, overcome by 2010, in just five yearsâ time, and does not become one of those problems that never go away.
This requires accelerated commitment of political will and of resources by the international community and the affected countries.
The Commission is to be congratulated for the size, quality and continuity of its contribution, but it needs to attach even higher priority to this problem and we need to ensure the right multiannual commitment of funds and ensure that money is well spent.
It is also important that we remain sharply focused, taking account of the requirements of our own professional and responsible armed forces.
Some seem to forget that it is not the western democracies that are the problem.
For the most part, they are part of the solution.
I refer to our own governments â the British and other European governments, and also that of the United States, which is among the worldâs largest contributors to mine action.
The PPE-DE Group is putting forward its own resolution and is not able to support the resolution by the other political groups, which emphasise widening the campaign to include anti-tank mines and other categories of munitions.
This week attention is focused on Africa at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles and here in the European institutions.
Let us remember that many African countries are amongst the most afflicted by landmines and their presence is a major barrier to the rapid development that needs to take place across the continent if the people of Africa are to escape from poverty.
Let us renew our commitment to overcome the awful impact of anti-personnel landmines.
Â Â  . â I too was moved by the interventions by the President-in-Office of the Council and by the Commissioner, who referred to an incident that must have taken place during the Second World War.
Yet statistics still show that 20Â 000 people a year are victims of mines or abandoned ammunition, of whom 8Â 000 to 10Â 000 are children, who are killed or mutilated, usually by anti-personnel mines.
These immoral weapons continue to have a social, economic, environmental and humanitarian impact on the population, and thus represent an intolerable threat to the human safety of whole communities.
The Ottawa Convention is a huge step forward in the fight against this scourge, but much remains to be done, as we heard from Jody Williams and Ambassador Wolfgang Petritsch on the information day arranged here in Parliament on 16Â June.
Quite apart from the international obligations to which the States Parties are subject, the international community has a duty to eliminate once and for all not only anti-personnel mines but any mines or devices that may kill or mutilate indiscriminately.
Countries such as my own which have placed mines in other countries in wars of a colonial nature, or otherwise, now have a special responsibility to help remove those mines and to support victimâs rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
Europe in particular must continue to play a leading role in this field and must extend that role to other aspects of disarmament.
The production, trade and use of anti-vehicle mines, cluster munitions and light arms present challenges that must be addressed without delay; if not, the momentum will be lost.
Member States and Members of the Commission need to show a united front and to speak with one voice.
They must speak more loudly and more effectively to promote the universalisation of the Ottawa Convention on all international fora and in relations with third countries, emphasising the need for it to be ratified and implemented.
To this end, EU countries that have yet to sign or ratify the Convention must do so without delay, and join the 144 countries that consider this and other aspects of global disarmament to be key elements in the lasting stability of our planet and everyoneâs security.
As the Nairobi Review Conference concluded, the priority is to work towards a world free of mines.
We owe that to the thousands of communities whose development has been undermined by these and other weapons that kill and mutilate at random.
We owe it to them in the name of human rights, of human safety, of peace, of the very values on which the EU is based, and this is reflected in the resolution that we have tabled.
Â Â  Although a large number of countries have prohibited the use, storage, manufacture and distribution of anti-personnel mines and have committed themselves to their elimination by ratifying the convention, anti-personnel mines and other forms of land-mines continue to exist.
Only yesterday a Slovenian military vehicle hit a mine in Afghanistan.
They lie hidden in the countryside and around inhabited places, threatening humans and livestock, bringing death and inflicting physical and psychological damage with resultant social and other long-term consequences.
The world has still not rid itself of the menace of this, the most inhumane of the weapons that pollute our planet.
I understand the situation and the historical circumstances in the three Member States of the European Union that have still not ratified the convention, but now is the time for some changes.
Other means should be used to prevent the danger of military conflicts in Europe.
There are more victims of mines than we might think, or that we are aware of.
The victims are not just innocent civilians, mainly farmers and their offspring, who, if they survive, are damaged both psychologically and physically, and marked for the rest of their lives.
Their parents, their relatives, their neighbours and friends are victims, too.
It is right and proper that in our resolution we also talk of money for the rehabilitation and reintegration of victims.
Bringing such people back into society is a long-term and extremely demanding process if a complete and genuine rehabilitation is to be secured.
However, any process of mine-clearing is much more valuable than dealing with the consequences of an explosion or rehabilitating the victims.
In Southeast Europe, too, less than one thousand kilometres from Strasbourg, we are still registering new victims of mines, so we must continue the process of clearing mines until the last mine in Europe has been removed.
If we do not do this more quickly, we will be faced with new victims, and we will not be able to act persuasively or successfully in other continents if we cannot put our own house in order first.
Only a world without mines can allow the return of refugees and a regeneration of farming, which is a crucial economic factor, particularly in countries where wars have raged.
Â Â  Mr President, just a few weeks ago a bus in Nepal drove into an anti-tank mine that had been put on the road by rebels.
More than 60 civilians died.
That incident â just one among many thousands â highlights the appalling damage that can be caused by modern anti-tank mines.
The ban on anti-personnel landmines set out by the Ottawa Treaty was an important first step.
However, for a truly mine-free world, it is vital that we go beyond this and call for a comprehensive ban that covers all types of mines, including anti-tank mines and fragmentation bombs.
I am sorry that the PPE-DE Group cannot join us on this.
The horrific incident in Nepal illustrates the urgent need to allow specialist NGOs to involve non-state actors as well in cleaning mines from areas under their control.
We must not forget the role played by financial institutions.
I warmly welcome the initiative taken by private Belgian banks to stop investing in companies involved in the production of landmines.
The EU and Member States should work hard to make this fine example of corporate social responsibility legally binding throughout Europe.
I hope we will send a strong message tomorrow by adopting this excellent resolution and take forward the vital campaign to finally eliminate the scourge of mines, which has killed and maimed so many.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is only right that we have had this important debate.
I have appreciated the lively and thoughtful discussion we have had in the limited time available to us today.
Indeed we have heard the moving personal testimony of the Commissioner and seen her personal commitment both to this issue and to this agenda.
As we have heard, there is almost universal agreement on the need to tackle the terrible problems caused by anti-personnel mines.
There is equally a recognition that people of our constituencies all across this continent expect nothing less of us.
Let me respond to some of the main points that have been raised in the course of our debate.
I begin by paying tribute to the long-standing work on this issue by Mr Van Orden.
He spoke with real knowledge and a sense of urgency, given the scale of the challenge we face.
I join him in congratulating the Commission for its work and paying tribute to the work that it has undertaken on this issue and recognise, as he made clear, the particular challenge faced by Africa in relation to the clearance of mines.
All of us, with a sincere regard for the condition of that continent, recognise what a significant contribution the removal of mines can make to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals there.
Mrs Gomes spoke in particular of the risks mines pose to children, while recognising the significant step forward represented by the Convention.
I agree with the initial point she made, that Europe has a leading role to play in this regard.
Indeed the European Union has been at the very forefront of the fight against anti-personnel landmines.
I can assure her that we will continue to be so.
Under the 2005-2007 strategy, we are aiming for the ambitious goal of a zero-victim target, where no one will be injured or killed by landmines.
This strategy represents a common goal that all 25 Member States share.
Mr Kacin spoke of the contemporary threat posed by landmines with reference to the recent incident in Afghanistan.
On the issue of universalising the Convention, as part of the action plan agreed by the First Review Conference of the Ottawa Convention last December, the European Union is committed to promoting the universalisation of the Treaty and the international community is making progress: 152 countries have now signed the Convention and 144 have ratified it, so the Ottawa Treaty is now very much the international norm, although that does not mean that we should ease up on our efforts to universalise it.

Mrs Lucas paid rightful tribute, I felt, to the important work of non-state actors in relation to the ongoing work both of universalising the Treaty and of continuing to make the case for further action to be taken.
We have had the opportunity and indeed I believe that we now have the responsibility to make a real difference to the lives of millions of people around the world by taking action in relation to mines.
This is an opportunity to help free them from the shadow of fear that anti-personnel landmines cast over their daily lives week-in and week-out and we have a responsibility to meet that challenge head on and deliver real results that will help deliver prosperity and security for future generations, not just on this continent but on all the continents of the world.
I am grateful for the contributions that I have heard to the debate this afternoon.
I have been heartened by the commitment of the Commission.
I can assure you that the UK Presidency will continue to take action on this important subject.
Â Â  Â I have received six motions for resolutionsÂ¹(1) to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 7Â JulyÂ 2005.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0247/2005).
We will be taking a number of questions to the Council.
Â Â  . Madam President, I am grateful for those words of welcome.
The question raised by the honourable Member concerning the Parthenon marbles does not fall within the Communityâs sphere of competence.
This is an issue for the United Kingdom and Greece, which should be addressed bilaterally by their respective authorities.

Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I congratulate you on winning the 2012 Olympic Games and suppose that your government is interested in developing a spirit of ecumenicity with a view to organising these Olympic Games; I therefore wish to ask the Presidency if it intends to offer its good services by communicating with the British Government. so that it makes a decision on what the European Parliament has been calling for since 1998: for the Parthenon marbles to be returned within the next few years.
Â Â  . First, let me thank the honourable Member for his kind words of congratulation to the United Kingdom on securing the 2012 Olympic Games for London.
I would have been delighted if any European city had secured those games, but I was particularly delighted that London has been successful today in Singapore.
I hope that it will be a truly outstanding European event, and I am sure all Members of Parliament will be warmly invited, along with citizens from right across this continent.
On the specific supplementary question that the honourable Member raised, I can assure him that the British Government is fully aware of the views of the Greek Government and the views previously expressed by this Parliament on the issue of the Parthenon Marbles. The United Kingdom Government considers that this is a matter for the trustees of the British Museum, who are, in the case of the United Kingdom, independent of government.
I understand that the position is that the British Museum considers the British Museum to be the best place to house the Parthenon sculptures.
I reiterate that this is not an appropriate matter for the Presidency to deal with; it is better taken forward by bilateral discussions between the Greek and United Kingdom authorities.
Â Â  While you are absolutely right to say that the issue of the Parthenon Marbles is a bilateral issue between Greece and the United Kingdom, would you not agree that there is a need to further discuss our common European heritage and to find ways of sharing, to the best effect, Europeâs valuable historic resources?
Â Â  . The point made by the honourable Member is an important one in terms of work that can be done collaboratively.
I can assure him that, if one looks, for example, at some of the treasures from the art world that have been brought to the United Kingdom and taken to other European countries in recent years, it reflects that fact that there is much sharing of cultural heritage across European boundaries.
That does not, however, diminish the points that I made.
In this case, the matter is more appropriately dealt with bilaterally between the respective national authorities.
I would also reiterate the point that the British Museum trustees are the appropriate body with whom these discussions should be taken forward, rather than it being a matter for national governments in the first instance.
Â Â  . The Council shares the view of the honourable Member that efforts must be pursued in order to make more effective the fight against torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment throughout the world.
Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, to which all EU Member States are a party, provides that no state shall expel, return or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.
Regarding the assertion of the honourable Member that, both within and outside the European Union, certain states have seized and rendered terror suspects from one state to another that is widely recognised as employing torture as an interrogation technique, the Council is not aware of the âmounting evidenceâ claimed by the honourable Member.
It is for the Committee Against Torture set up by the Convention Against Torture to monitor the implementation of the Convention.
The Council is, and will remain, actively committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other cruel and inhumane or degrading treatment, in line with the EU guidelines on this subject.
Â Â  I have heard the answer and am quite happy to forward evidence in my possession, through my office, to the relevant committee and, indeed, to the Presidency.
It surprises me somewhat that they do not have that information.
I can tell the House in very clear terms that there are disturbing allegations that EU Member States themselves have allowed their territory to be used as landing points for planes used in extraordinary renditions.
Member States that allow their territory to be used in this way and allow flights to leave in such circumstances are colluding in serious and persistent breaches.
What action does the Council plan to take to investigate these allegations and, if Member States are found to be responsible for such breaches, is the Council prepared to take action under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union and suspend certain membership rights of those states?
Â Â  . Madam President, in light of your direction, I shall keep this answer brief.
I note the offer made by the honourable Member to pass on the evidence apparently in his possession to the Committee against Torture, which has been set up by CAT to monitor the implementation of the Convention.
I would simply reiterate that the Council is and will remain actively committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, in line also with the EU guidelines on this subject.
Â Â  .
The state of play of the implementation of the legislative instruments relevant in the fight against terrorism is set out in Document 8211/05 Add. 2 Rev. 1, which will be distributed to the European Parliament.
The tables indicate that, although not all instruments have been fully implemented, considerable progress has been made since last year.
The Council plans to update the tables contained in the aforementioned document regularly and, on that basis, to discuss with all Member States the state of play with regard to implementation.
Â Â  In January the Commission reported that only three Member States had fully implemented the Framework Decision of June 2002 on joint investigation teams by the deadline, not including the UK.
The Commission said it encountered many difficulties in gathering the relevant information.
Is it not time to stop the tradition whereby the Council does not name and shame those countries not implementing the Framework Decision?
Is it not also necessary that the Council take advantage of the provisions in the current Treaty to convert the hopelessly ineffective as well as undemocratic intergovernmental provisions in the law enforcement area to Community competence so that suitable enforcements of the law are agreed by the Member States?
Otherwise, how are we ever going to combat crime and terrorism?
Â Â  . Madam President, I note the tenor of the question.
The specific matter raised is an issue that I will certainly look into in the course of the Presidency.
I would say, however, on the general question of why the European Union has not made further progress on counter-terrorism legislation, that substantial preparatory work on counter-terrorism legislation has been carried out under previous presidencies.
We anticipate that we will be able to agree a framework decision on exchange of information and the European Evidence Warrant under our Presidency.
The framework decision on data retention has been held up by concerns about its legal base and by the lack of a common understanding between Member States.
Â Â  . The honourable Member is undoubtedly aware that in deciding that Turkey fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria sufficiently to open accession negotiations, the European Council on 16 and 17 December 2004 clearly stated that the Union would continue to monitor closely the progress of the reform processes within Turkey.
In that context, the specific case mentioned by the honourable Member is known and has been followed closely.
Without going into the details of the ruling given recently by the Turkish Supreme Court, the Presidency can state that it has prompted some concern on the part of the Union with regard to respect for both freedom of expression and association, and for the cultural rights of minorities.
The proceedings are still under way and the trade union organisation in question has also stated that it might appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.
The Presidency can, nonetheless, assure the honourable Member here and now that, if need be, and while respecting the principle of the independence of the judiciary, the Union will not fail to raise this issue with the Turkish authorities, as it does regularly in the various fora for political dialogue as well as within the bodies of the Association Agreement regarding any problems that arise in implementing the reform process.
Â Â  I should like to thank the Presidency for its answer and, above all, for its promise to address the practical issue of this Turkish teachersâ organisation in direct bilateral contacts with Turkey.
This very remarkable decision involves a violation of basic union rights and the right to organise.
An infringement of freedom of expression and minority rights in Turkey also arises from one and the same decision.
I therefore think that this case is incredibly central to Turkeyâs democratic credibility.
I also wish to put the following question to the Presidency: can negotiations concerning EU membership be entered into with Turkey as long as this type of decision is taken there?
Â Â  . Although I am respectful of the point made by the honourable Member, it is important to recognise that the Turkish Government has made enormous progress over the last couple of years through the adoption of a series of constitutional and legislative reforms.
Major reforms include the abolition of the death penalty, new protections against torture, greater freedoms of expression, association and religion, ratification of international agreements on human rights, greater cultural rights for Kurds and others, and reduction of the militaryâs role in the government.
The December European Council to which I referred endorsed the 6 October Commission recommendation that â and once again I quote â âTurkey has met the Copenhagen political criteria that accession negotiations be openedâ.
The Councilâs conclusions welcomed the decisive progress made by Turkey in its far-reaching reform process and express confidence that Turkey would sustain that process of reform.
Turkeyâs human rights record will be the subject of intense scrutiny during the accession negotiations.
We remain confident that all remaining concerns will be addressed during that accession process.
Â Â  Supreme Courts are by definition laws unto themselves and I think you are absolutely right to emphasise that this one unfortunate and unsupportable decision should not in any way impinge on the progress of Turkey towards membership of the European Union.
They have, as you have outlined, made significant efforts to meet European norms and we should not blow this one incident out of all proportion.
Does the Council agree?
Â Â  . I am happy to concur with the opinions of my fellow countrymen.
I would certainly say on a serious basis that real and significant progress has been made.
There is clearly further work to be undertaken, but it would be unfortunate if those who have wider objections to this issue did not recognise that this is a single decision within a process that is heading in the right direction, although there is a significant amount of progress still to be made.
Â Â  I also welcome the Councilâs answer to the question, but I should like some clarification.
Does the Council believe that the Turkish Constitution, as it has now been interpreted by the Supreme Court, is compatible with the European Unionâs Charter of Fundamental Rights?
I am thinking, in particular, here of Article II-72 on freedom of assembly and association, which particularly emphasises the freedom to form and join trade unions, and Articles II-81 and II-82 of the same Charter on non-discrimination and the need to respect linguistic diversity.
Â Â  . We are clearly concerned that on 25 May the Supreme Court ruled that the Egitim Sen should be closed down on the grounds that its by-laws contradicted the constitution by advocating mother-tongue education.
The decision is especially disappointing after the case had twice been dismissed by the Turkish Labour Court, which had noted that mother-tongue education is permitted under European law.
Again I would reiterate the general point in relation to freedom of expression that free speech is beginning to take hold and beginning to flourish in Turkey.
Recent reforms include allowing broadcasting and teaching in Kurdish and constitutional amendments strengthening the freedom of the press and recognising the supremacy of Turkeyâs international human rights obligations.
There is mounting evidence that the judiciary is now increasingly relying on the European Court of Human Rightsâ rulings as a basis for its judgments.
That is surely to be welcomed by all Members of this Parliament.
Â Â  . The Council has expressed its view on this matter on a number of occasions.
In any event, it may be recalled that the Council has been steadfast in its support for the pursuit of efforts to achieve the reunification of Cyprus and in its desire to see all Cypriots living together as citizens of a reunited island within the European Union in the near future.
It is against this background, and with this in mind, that the European Union has been examining measures capable of putting an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and facilitating the reunification of Cyprus.
More specifically, as regards the Commissionâs proposals relating to part of the instrument of financial support for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community and the exchanges with zones where the Republic of Cyprus exercises no effective control, Council bodies have already carried out important work.
The fact that certain difficulties â particularly as regards direct exchanges â remain to be overcome, means that these two proposals still cannot be adopted.
However, the Council can use the Presidencyâs good offices to assure the honourable Member that it will continue working to encourage the islandâs economic integration and to improve contacts between the two Cypriot communities and within the European Union.
Â Â  I welcome the Minister to the House.
I hope he is enjoying the experience.
I wonder if he could tell me whether or not he agrees with the comments made by President Papadopoulos who said recently that proposals to open direct trade with Northern Cyprus would have no real or substantive economic effect but would amount to a political demand aimed at politically upgrading the north?
Would he agree with me that the treatment of Turkish Cypriots â who are after all EU citizens â by their neighbours on that island, which amounts to nothing less than economic apartheid, is unacceptable and must be stopped, and will he give some indication of the practical steps his Presidency will take over the next six months to bring this about?
Â Â  . I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question.
In relation to whether I am enjoying the experience, I think it is still too early to say.
On the substantive point of the need for direct trade with Northern Cyprus and the query that was directed to me in relation to the views expressed by others, the Councilâs position remains that which has been previously stated.
We continue to believe that direct trade will help to narrow the gap in economic development between the north and the south of the island, promoting economic cooperation and business ventures between the two communities.
Assisting the economic integration of the island would also boost significantly the prospects for reunification, since it would make a settlement easier and, frankly, less costly to accommodate.
In relation to the specific actions that will be taken under the United Kingdomâs Presidency, the Government wishes to see these regulations agreed as soon as possible, in order to fulfil the Council mandate to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.
So, in consultation with the Commission and other Member States, we will carry forward work on the dossiers left by the Luxembourg Presidency.
Â Â  . The Council has expressed its concerns regarding human rights in Burma at several meetings with Burmese leaders, most recently on 6 May, at a ministerial meeting with Burma held in the margins of the Asean Ministerial Conference in Kyoto.
At the EU-Asean ministerial meeting held in Jakarta in March, the Presidency met with a senior Burmese official to inform him of the European Unionâs concerns and to encourage his authorities to attempt to initiate a dialogue with all the countryâs political and ethnic groups in order to facilitate reconciliation and democracy in Burma.
On 17 June 2005, on the occasion of the 60th birthday of Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the Presidency made a declaration on behalf of the European Union in which it reiterated its concern at the current situation in Burma and the renewed tensions involving the nationalities, especially the Shan state and the Karen.
In that declaration it was pointed out that the European Union is committed to supporting national reconciliation and respect for human rights and democracy in Burma and a request was made to the state Peace and Development Council to enter into a genuine dialogue with the NLD and with ethnic representatives to find peaceful political solutions that take into account their legitimate concerns.
Â Â  . On behalf of Simon Coveney who raised this issue, the question to the Council has to be: given what you have just outlined, how effective has all of this been and what other steps might be taken?
I do not think anyone is satisfied that the actions so far have yielded any results.
Â Â  . I am speaking to Parliament today as a representative of the Presidency, but I can assure you, not least from my previous work as a Foreign Office Minister in the United Kingdom Government, that I am fully aware of the efforts that have been made by the British Government, and by Europe more generally, to try and bring about the resolution that all of us would seek in the face of the present human rights abuses in Burma.
Our commitment in Burma is to promote human rights, democratisation and sustainable development as far as we can, using all the tools available to us.
The European Union remains, I am delighted to say, at the forefront of international efforts to press for improvements in human rights in Burma.
Opposition groups, including the National League for Democracy, acknowledge and welcome the continued political and practical support of the European Union.
Human rights violations have been highlighted in successive highly critical resolutions on Burma in the United Nations General Assembly and in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
The Burmese authorities can be in no doubt about our views.
The EU troika expressed our deep concern over the situation in Burma directly to the Burmese Foreign Minister in Kyoto on 6 May.
We continue to believe that it is essential for the regime to enter into a genuine and inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy, and with ethnic representatives.
Only such a dialogue can promote a peaceful democratic future for all Burmaâs people.
I would, however, add this additional remark.
While I am proud of the work that the European Union and European Member States have taken forward on this issue, I think it should be recognised that it is also important for other Asian neighbours of Burma to continue to take action and step up their efforts on the human rights abuses.
The failure in previous resolutions before the United Nations to secure the active support of other Asian partners to the kind of initiatives necessary to bring this degree of pressure to bear on the Burmese regime was a matter of disappointment to us.
So I can assure you that from the Presidencyâs point of view we will maintain the pressure at European level, but we are cognisant of the responsibility of others outwith Europe as well to continue to make the case for change to the Burmese authorities.
Â Â  . The Council supports the establishment of an EU human rights agency, which will play a major role in enhancing the coherence and consistency of the European Unionâs human rights policy.
Following the adoption by the European Commission of the proposal to establish the fundamental rights agency, the Council will place the proposal before a working party for examination.
As for the protection of minorities, the honourable Member is kindly reminded that legislation has already been adopted in an effort to tackle discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation.
The European Commission is due to report in 2006 on the state of transposition of Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC.
Furthermore, the Council takes note of the communication of the European Commission of 1 June 2005 on non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all, a framework strategy, in which the Commission proposes to establish a high-level advisory group on social and labour market integration of disadvantaged ethnic minorities.
Under the United Kingdom Presidency, the Council, as well as the European Parliament, will deal with the European Commissionâs proposal for a decision on the European Year of Equal Opportunities For All â i.e. 2007 â built upon four key themes: rights â raising awareness of the right of equality and non-discrimination; representation â stimulating a debate on ways to increase the participation of under-represented groups in society; recognition â celebrating and accommodating diversity; and respect and tolerance, promoting a more cohesive society.
The total proposed budget is EURÂ 13.6 million, which would cover preparatory actions in 2006, as well as the activities due to take place during the European Year itself in 2007.
Â Â  I hope it was not the Scottish accents coming across.
The President-in-Office is extremely clear.
I should like to welcome him to his office with no irony at all â as we have heard from one or two other Members â and thank him for that very positive answer.
I would like to remind the President-in-Office that the United Kingdom has implemented all the directives that he mentions.
We have taken a lead on this.
Many Member States have yet to implement anti-discrimination legislation.
Could I ask whether you agree with me that the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, which has broad support in this House, is something that could be strongly developed under your watch and that we should ask the Member States who have yet to implement anti-discrimination legislation to do so as quickly as possible?
Â Â  . I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question.
I am respectful of the expressed desire that I speak slightly more slowly.
I hope it was a reflection on my speed and not my accent.
I can assure you that if I appeared speedy in my initial answers, it was only through my desire to reach as many questions as we can in the course of the limited Question Time available to us today.
I am also grateful to the honourable Member for acknowledging the work of the United Kingdom Government on this particular issue.
I personally judged that it would be deemed rather unpresidential for me to boast in that regard, but I note the comments he has made.
I am grateful for his warm welcome to my speaking role today.
The United Kingdom welcomes the Commissionâs proposals, and the Presidency also does so, on the establishment of a fundamental rights agency.
We are in favour of an effective, independent FRA, with well-defined work objectives that do not duplicate the work of existing bodies.
That was the subject of a discussion that I held with colleagues in the Council of Europe this morning, just across the river.
We believe that the agency should give priority to areas such as racism and xenophobia, building on work already done by the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia.
We will work with other Member States to develop the details during the course of our Presidency.
Â Â  Without wishing to undermine the very serious question put by my good friend and colleague Claude Moraes, I notice that you welcome this particular agency.
I wondered if you could share with us your thoughts on how many agencies you believe the EU should have and whether you would agree with me that the EU generally needs fewer agencies and more action?
Â Â  .
I do not wish to break the consensus that appears to have broken out in the Chamber when answering the honourable Memberâs question, but I have never seen a contradiction between the establishment of a necessary agency undertaking important work and action being taken by the European Union.
Perhaps that is simply something on which we disagree.
Â Â  Minister, welcome to your debut in the European Parliament.
On the issue of the Fundamental Rights Agency, I have deep concerns about the risk of duplication with the existing excellent work within our own Parliament in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the work of the Council of Europe and the UNâs Human Rights Commission.
How can you ensure that there will be no be duplication and therefore no waste of EU taxpayersâ money?
Â Â  . I am certainly alive to the concerns that the honourable Member has raised.
Indeed, it was the subject of lengthy discussions this morning with the Council of Europe, which has expressed similar concerns in terms of how we avoid duplication.
Sometimes, the language that is used in terms of synergies and complementarity should not mask the important question that he has asked in terms of the importance of being rigorous as regards the role of the FRA.
I believe it is necessary for the Presidency to be clear that steps will be taken to ensure that the FRA avoids duplication, as his question suggested.
The Presidency has worked closely with the Council of Europe, which supports the establishment of the FRA.
We believe that the FRA management board could include a representative of the Council of Europe and an observer from the proposed European gender institute in order exactly to avoid the kind of duplication raised by the question.
This is a matter on which we will need to have continuing watchful eyes.
In that sense, I am grateful to him for raising this question.
It is not a matter that will be finally be resolved today, but it merits continued and detailed reflection in the weeks and months ahead.
Â Â  . The Council refers to its reply to Written Question E-0229/02.
Regulation (EC) NoÂ 2560/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19Â December 2001 on cross-border payments in euro has applied since 1 July 2002 so far as electronic payment transactions, cash withdrawals, and card payments are concerned, and since 1 July 2003 to cross-border credit transfers.
It provides for charges levied by financial institutions for cross-border transactions between Member States and the euro area to be aligned with the charges levied for similar transactions within the Member State in question.
Other Member States may apply the regulation to cross-border payments and credit transactions in their own currencies.
It is recalled that the Commission has exclusive right of initiative in the field of Community regulation referred to by the honourable Member.
However, should the Commission decide to send a proposal to that effect, the Council of course would consider it.
Â Â  Thank you very much for that answer.
Like you, I am very familiar with the ruling of the 2001 Council, to which you referred at great length.
However, putting that to one side. Would you consider personally that it is a matter of concern that international banks are making huge amounts of profit at what is now the touch of a computer button for people transferring money within the internal market?
Â Â  . It is fair to say that, due to the nature of the international capital markets, this is not the only instance in which, by the touch of a button on a computer keyboard, vast amounts of money can be made.
Indeed, we have some experience of that in the United Kingdom, though â I am glad to say â that was before the term of office of this government.
However, the honourable Member raises an important point and, should he wish to correspond further with me, I would certainly make sure that those representations are passed on to the relevant people.
Â Â  I would like to bring to your attention a constituent who has just emailed me about outrageous FIFA charges for World Cup tickets for 2006.
It may interest you with regard to the London Olympics.
Apart from the price of the tickets, he was charged EURÂ 24 for the use of his MasterCard.
The tickets only cost EURÂ 149. Is it not time to look, as my colleague said, at the fact that so much money can be made by those who do so little?
Â Â  . The honourable Member raises a very important matter on behalf of one of her constituents.
As a Scotsman, I have to say that I fear the question of World Cup tickets may prove only to be of academic interest to me, but I am sure for many other Members represented in this Chamber it will hold greater significance than for those of us in Scotland.
As I have already made clear, though, in relation to the original question that was asked, it should be recalled that the Commission has exclusive right of initiative in this field of Community regulation and therefore I think if there are particular concerns in relation to the credit card transaction in question it would be appropriate that these matters also be raised with the Commission.
Â Â  . Madam President, I am happy to take questions 9, 10 and 11 together.
As the honourable Members are aware, the Council is committed to the fight against incitement to hatred in broadcasts.
Article 22(a) of the Television Without Frontiers Directive provides that Member States should ensure that broadcasts do not contain any incitement to hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality.
However, the directive does not apply to broadcasts intended exclusively for reception in third countries, nor to broadcasters not under the jurisdiction of a Member State.
Following the measures taken successfully by the French, Dutch and Spanish authorities on the basis of the directive, Al Manar is no longer broadcast by any EU-based satellite company and the Television Without Frontiers Directive no longer applies to it.
The Council discussed the issue of incitement to hatred in broadcasting from countries outside the European Union at its meeting on 23 May 2005 and took stock of work initiated to respond the problems posed by satellite broadcasting of non-EU channels in the European Union.
This followed a meeting of the presidents of national broadcasting regulatory authorities on 17 March 2005, which agreed to reinforce cooperation between the regulatory authorities and identified concrete measures to strengthen this cooperation, notably information exchange regarding channels authorised in Member States, establishing a contact point within each national authority.
In the Council, delegations took note of the measures and proposals outlined to combat incitement to hatred in broadcasts.
They recognise that consideration should be given to the means of combating more effectively the broadcasting of such material in the context of the revision of the Television Without Frontiers Directive, notably the adaptation of this instrument to the most recent technological developments.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to thank the British Presidency for its firm and measured response.
I should also like to offer you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my very best wishes for success in tackling the European challenges ahead of you.
The underlying problem of this issue, however, is that of the relationship between the European institutions and those in third countries who actively promote terrorism.
Today, in fact, I read an article in the press saying that there is an active campaign in Iran to incite people to commit suicide attacks in Israel and Iraq.
I should like to know what the Presidency has to say about that.
Â Â  . I am grateful for the honourable Memberâs generous words and good wishes at the outset of our Presidency.
As I sought to reflect in my initial answer, we wholly condemn actions which are taken towards inciting the kind of terrorism and acts of violence which he describes and I hope my earlier remarks reflect the seriousness with which we regard this problem.
Â Â  I would like to thank you for your considered reply and also for the fact that the British Government has belatedly given consideration to banning Hizbollahâs so-called civilian wing, whereas in fact there is no difference between the civilian and the military wing.
Today was a great day for the city that I represent, London, in our winning the Olympic bid for 2012.
One of the messages from the Prime Minister in Singapore was that the Olympics will be used as a vehicle for peace and friendship amongst nations, as a way of combating this kind of hatred between peoples.
What more can be done to stop EU Member State registered companies giving advertising revenue to television companies like al-Manar?
In addition, what pressure can you bring to bear through the Council on the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia to stop them broadcasting to the Arabic-speaking communities resident in EU Member States listening to this hate-filled type of broadcasting?
Â Â  . First, let me say that I would disagree with his characterisation of the British Governmentâs position in relation to Hizbollah, but this is not the forum or the occasion to explore these issues, which are more directly of relevance to the national authorities of the United Kingdom than to our role as the Presidency.
I am, however, grateful to the honourable Member for his warm welcome to his home cityâs success in securing the Olympic Games and let me assure him that there are plenty of opportunities in bilateral forums and indeed in contact between the European Union and other nations outwith the European Union to raise exactly the kind of concerns of which he spoke this afternoon.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, I would like to thank and congratulate the Spanish authorities, who have, in turn, just banned the television channel Al-Manar, which we are discussing here, from being broadcast via their satellite Hispasat.
Having said that, I would like to ask MrÂ Alexander two specific questions, because our information on latest developments seems to differ, as do our interpretations of certain articles in the Television Without Frontiers Directive.
France has therefore ordered Eutelsat to stop transmitting the signal.
Very good.
What of Globesat, which is a subsidiary of FranceÂ TÃ©lÃ©com and which has not, as far as I am aware, stopped providing the signal to other satellites that, in turn, transmit this signal beyond the borders of the European Union?
Your answer appeared to me to be rather vague about the intentions of Nilesat and Arabsat, the Egyptian and Saudi satellites, which, by my reading of Article 2(4), are indeed covered by the provisions of the Television Without Frontiers Directive.
As you know, we have an association agreement with Egypt, so will this issue be raised?
Has it already been?
We have a Council on 13Â December: do you intend to discuss it then?
These are specific questions.
Â Â  . I would simply make a couple of points.
First, I am unaware of the disparity of which the honourable Member speaks, but if there are issues of factual disagreement between us then I would be happy to receive representations in that regard.
The other point I would make is the basic one that Community law does not apply to broadcasts intended exclusively for reception in third countries and that is also a factor in our discussions.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, MrÂ Alexander, Spain did in fact resolve this problem only last week, but France has unfortunately not yet followed suit.
MrsÂ Ries is absolutely right in this respect.
This begs the question of whether a certain amount of pressure should not be brought to bear on the French authorities, and above all on the authorities of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, as MrÂ Tannock rightly said a short while ago.
In my opinion, this is also a task for the Council, and one that calls for a certain degree of diplomacy.
MrÂ Alexander, I wish you much success in your role as President-in-Office of the Council.
In view of the fact that Scotland will not be playing in the World Cup, Bertie Vogts should probably be sacked from his job as coach.
Â Â  . The honourable Member attaches great importance to diplomatic discussion of these issues.
This is clearly an issue not solely of broadcasting, but also of getting to the root of those organisations or individuals who seek to perpetuate hatred and misunderstanding, when we stand for greater understanding and reconciliation of great faiths and of great peoples.
So I take on board the importance of diplomatic representations being made.
In relation to his second point, I think this is factually accurate in the sense that Bertie Vogts has already left the coaching role for the Scottish football team, but then I thought it might be not very of me to point that out, given that we have reappointed a Scotsman to that role, apparently to no great effect so far!
Â Â  As its author is not present in the Chamber, Question No. 12 lapses.
How will the proposals for an External Action Service be affected by the failure in the ratification process of the proposed EU Constitution?
In view of the demise of the Constitution, and thus of the anticipated basis for action, what steps does the Council propose to take to reverse the presumptive steps already taken in preparation for the introduction of the External Action Service?
Â Â  . Following the declaration by the Heads of State and Government on 17 June on the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, the Council has not taken a decision on what further steps, if any, might be taken on the preparations for the introduction of the European External Action Service.
Â Â  Since the External Action Service would exist to assist the Union Foreign Minister, since the Union Foreign Minster can only exist pursuant to the Constitution, and since the right to act on behalf of the EU only arises on foot of the EU itself having a single legal personality, does it not follow that its legal authority arises from the Constitution?
Since there is a pause for reflection with regard to the Constitution, should the same not apply to the External Action Service if that pause is genuine, rather than cosmetic?
For if implementation action continues, is the Council not then flying in the face of the public rejection of the Constitution and all its manifestations?
Â Â  . Clearly the future of preparatory work on the European External Action Service is tied up with the future of the Constitutional Treaty.
The honourable Member is right to acknowledge that there is now a pause for reflection following the decisions reached at the Brussels European Council just a couple of weeks ago.
That time â now for reflection, as identified by the European Council â will continue for a number of months.
Let us be clear, first of all, that the preparatory work to date has consisted of discussions between the Member States, the Council Secretariat and the Commission, as tasked by the Heads of State and Government in October 2004.
It is the case that the Luxembourg Presidency took forward preparatory work as tasked by that intergovernmental conference and, indeed, by the December European Council.
This work, however, has not pre-empted the ratification process: it has consisted of discussion and exchange of ideas in Brussels.
As I said in my initial answer, no formal decisions have been taken.
Â Â  Does the Presidency accept that the Constitution in some places makes mandatory things that are already perfectly possible and legal under the current Treaties?
For instance, the Council could decide, by changing its rules of procedure, to meet in public when dealing with legislation.
National parliaments could be better involved with early information, and some aspects of the External Action Service may, for instance, be explored in due course.
I note that Mr Allister prefers not to go down that route.
Presumably, he, as a good federalist, wants the external representations of the Union to remain under the Commission and not under Mr Solana.
Â Â  . I will not intrude in the private discussion between the honourable Members as to who is a federalist and who is not.
Let me simply say that I am on record in the United Kingdom as saying that one of the obvious areas where there is scope for progress in relation to greater transparency within the European Union is the European Council in its ability to meet, when in legislative mode, in public.
That seems to me to be common sense.
However, we also need to reflect the fact that the decision reached at the Brussels European Council two weeks ago was for a period of reflection.
It is necessary, therefore, to reflect that in the priorities that we will be developing in the course of the coming year.
There will be plenty of opportunities, both for Members of this Parliament and, indeed, for European leaders, the European peoples and the public within Europe, to take part in those discussions during the period of reflection.
Therefore, the first priority must be to hold discussions relating to the period of reflection rather than to move immediately towards changes â whether great or small â in relation to the actions of the European Council or, indeed, some of the issues anticipated in the Constitutional Treaty.
Â Â  . The Council regards the case of Luis Posada Carriles as a bilateral matter between Venezuela and the United States.
The Council would like to remind the honourable Member, moreover, that the case of Posadaâs deportation is still and that the United States authorities have not officially rejected a formal Venezuelan request for extradition.
Without prejudice to the outcome of the Posada case, it should be noted, however, that the European Union condemns all acts of terrorism regardless of their target or motivation.
In the European Council declaration on combating terrorism of 25 March 2004, the Union and its Member States pledged to do everything within their power to combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Union, the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the obligations set out under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373.
In this context, the Council recalls that all EU Member States are party to the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the safety of Civilian Aviation, which makes it an offence to endanger the safety of an aircraft in flight and requires states that have custody of offenders either to extradite the offender or submit the case for prosecution.
Â Â  Minister, this case creates great social alarm because, despite the fact that this is a bilateral problem between Venezuela and the United States of America, those countries must not give the impression that they are sheltering or protecting people accused of terrorist crimes, including in the case of people linked to the intelligence services, as in the case of Mr Posadas, who was actually on the payroll of the CIA.
To a certain extent I welcome your reply, because it suggests that it is essential that no horrendous terrorist crime, such as this one, should go unpunished.
Â Â  . With the greatest of respect to the questioner, it would be injudicious to be drawn into general discussions of this case given its status as at present.
I have noted what the questioner said, but in light of the fact that the matter remains , what I have said fully states the Councilâs position.
Â Â  . Following the reply given by the Council representative to Question H-0377/05 during Council Question Time at the last European Parliament plenary session in Strasbourg on 8 June 2005, the honourable Member asked a supplementary question concerning the state of play as regards the transposition of Council Framework Decision No 2002/465/JHA of 13 June 2002 on joint investigation teams.
In reply to Question H-0377/05, the Council representative stated that 21 Member States had notified the General Secretariat of the Council that they had transposed the framework decision, but in two Member States the draft legislation transposing this decision had been, or would soon be, put before Parliament and that one Member State had announced that it had transposed the decision in part.
The supplementary question put by the honourable Member was aimed at finding out what the situation was in the 25th Member State.
On the basis of the information obtained, the Council can inform you that the 25th Member State â namely Italy â has informed the General Secretariat of the Council that the provisions implementing the Council Framework Decision of 13Â June 2002 on joint investigation teams and the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 29 May 2000, are contained in draft law C2372, tabled by the government on 20 February 2002 and currently undergoing scrutiny in joint committees 2 â justice â and 3 â foreign affairs â of Italyâs Chamber of Deputies.
No estimate can be given for the moment of how long the Italian Parliament will take to approve this bill.
Â Â  Thank you very much, President-in-Office.
I do not think I have ever had such a full reply to a question. I am very grateful for that.
I must also say that I have never seen the Council benches so full.
I think this is the first time that the people on the Council benches outnumber the rest of Parliament put together.
What an impressive start you are making.
My supplementary question is this: there is nothing wrong with the President-in-Office saying he does not know the answer to the question, as he did in his previous guise a month ago, and promising to write to us.
However, is he now saying that a promise to write to us after Question Time will not produce a reply and that we must put down a supplementary in order to get the answer?
Or, if he does not know the answer, will he in future do what he said in his previous life and write to us as he promised?
Â Â  . I am grateful for your words of congratulation to the Presidency for the fullness of our benches, but I fear I have already learned at my initial appearance at this Parliament that what you lack in quantity you more than make up for in quality in relation to the questions that you asked.
In relation to the specific point that was made by the honourable Member in relation to correspondence from the presidency, it is a matter that I will look into, but I will look into it in light of the fact that we have endeavoured in the course of the reply I have given to offer as comprehensive an answer as possible to the question posed by the honourable Member.
Â Â  . The Gleneagles G8 summit, taking place in Scotland this week, will focus on two key issues: Africa and climate change.
Africa, because the continent contains 18 of the worldâs poorest countries.
It is currently not on target to meet any of the UN Millennium Development Goals first set out at the Millennium Summit in 2000.
The continent needs a step change in development, financing, health, education, governance and the capacity to trade in global markets and programmes for dealing with killer diseases and building African peacekeeping capacity.
Climate change is our additional priority, because it is clear that our world is warming up.
Major irreversible change in our climate is a real threat and the most important issue we face in the long term.
Tackling the problem needs a global approach.
The summit is an opportunity to move forward the debate at the highest political level and to help forge a common vision.
The European Union plays a leading role in both issues and has already agreed policies on them.
The G8 agreement does not bind the European Union, but may serve as a catalyst for future discussions within European Union structures.
The G8 Summit outcome may give rise to discussion in the relevant Council formations.
For example, the 12Â July Ecofin meeting will discuss development financing.
All political and legislative initiatives at European Union level will, of course, follow the normal EU procedures for discussion, agreement and adoption as appropriate.
Â Â  Before getting to the substance, I too should like to congratulate the President-in-Office, not just for the quality of his responses but for their speed.
He might be interested to note that I was speaking to a group of Scottish visitors just before coming back here for Question Time.
They asked me about the G8 and I told them that I had a question â No 16 â but there was no chance of reaching it, so I am very pleased that we have indeed reached it.
He is absolutely right to say that the G8 does not the European institutions, but it would be foolish of the EU institutions not to respond to the outcome of the G8 discussions.
He has already given a partial answer to this question, but will he go further and consider asking both the Commission and the Council Secretariat systematically to go through the G8 conclusions to see where follow-up action is required by the EU institutions?
Â Â  . It is a benign coincidence that the United Kingdom holds both the Presidency of the European Union in the second half of this year and the chairmanship of the G8.
I believe it allows an opportunity for effective synergies to develop between the work of the European Union and indeed of the G8.
The evidence I would cite in support of that contention is already clear.
If one considers the truly historic decision taken by European Union Development Ministers within the last month to effectively double the level of aid provided by European Union Member States by 2010, from approximately USDÂ 40Â billion to USDÂ 80Â billion, it is clear that it has already established a very important benchmark for the G8, as it gathers in Scotland this week.
The European Union deserves fulsome tribute and credit for its long-standing interest in issues of development related to Africa.
If I might be so bold, with the permission of Parliament, I think the United Kingdom also deserves credit in this instance for having decided to put the issue of Africa at the top of the international agenda of this weekâs G8 meeting.
I would say, however, that the conclusion of this discussion will not be at the conclusion of the G8 Summit this week.
In the course of our European Union Presidency over the next six months, there will, of course, be this weekâs G8 Summit in Gleneagles. There will then be the Millennium Review Summit in New York in September, followed by the next critical Ministerial Meeting of the Doha development round in Hong Kong in December.
Each of those represents a vital staging post on the onward march of progress towards helping many of the worldâs poorest countries and the peoples of Africa.
If you need any further illustration of the critical contribution that European Union institutions can make to that progress, one need look no further than the decisions that will be reached in Hong Kong in December, where I personally hope the European Unionâs Trade Commissioner will be able to advance an agenda that is pro-growth in Europe and pro-poor in the world.
Â Â  Can I say first say to the Minister that I have been very impressed with the British Government in its general handling of this issue, and I congratulate you.
I do not want to take from that by saying that Mr Blair really is not making sense when he says he is listening to the people on the subject of the Constitutional Treaty. The people are not talking about the Constitutional Treaty.
We are talking about the Constitutional Treaty.
They are talking about the developing world.
Please continue to drive that agenda.
You have given great leadership on this issue.
Please do not drop the ball.
After the G8, after your Presidency here, we need that leadership very badly.
Â Â  . I am grateful to the honourable Member for his warm words of support for the leadership that Britain has offered both in the G8 and in the European Councils on this important matter.
We are definitely in agreement that the peoples of Europe care passionately about the issue of development.
I attended the rally that took place in Edinburgh, in my country of Scotland, at the weekend.
If, like me, you had been able to see in excess of 200Â 000 people gathered in that city, you would have been in no doubt whatsoever about the extent to which both the European Union and the Government of the United Kingdom are acting with the full support of people from right across Europe in pursuit of the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
However, it must be recognised, notwithstanding the level of public support for the action we have taken and, I hope, the further steps that we can take this week at Gleneagles, that the scale of the challenge we face is profound.
If you take, for example, the Millennium Development Goals, and in particular their aspirations for sub-Saharan Africa, the timescale set out by world leaders back in 2000 was 15 years for the achievement of those Millennium Development Goals.
At the present rate of progress in sub-Saharan Africa, some of these Millennium Development Goals will be met not in 15 years but in 150 years.
We are categorically of the view that this is too long to wait.
That is why we are so proud of the work that European Union institutions and European ministers of development â and, indeed, as reiterated in a decision by Ecofin when it met last month â have carried out in relation to advancing the cause of development in recent months and weeks and why we are determined to use the opportunities, not just of our Presidency of the European Union, but also the opportunities presented by the G8 this week, the Millennium Review Summit in September and the Doha talks in December, to try to continue to advance this vital and important agenda.
Â Â  As its author is not present in the Chamber, Question No. 17 lapses.
Can the Council please advise on the next steps for the review of the Working Time Directive?
Â Â  . As the honourable Member is certainly aware, the Commission submitted an amended proposal regarding the revision of the organisation of the Working Time Directive on 31 May 2005 following adoption of Parliamentâs opinion at first reading.
This proposal was discussed by the Council on 2 June.
However, owing to the short period of time left for examination, the Council was not in a position to assess all its implications.
The Council therefore instructed the Committee of Permanent Representatives to examine the amendment proposal with a view to the Council reaching an agreement as soon as possible.
Â Â  â MrÂ Alexander, I would like to know the UKâs position on the opt-out.
Do you stand by your position in favour of the opt-out or do you have alternative solutions?
Â Â  . I am not convinced that this is either the forum or the occasion on which to advance the United Kingdomâs position on this, given my responsibility to answer on behalf of the Presidency.
As with every incoming Presidency, our responsibility is to seek to lead and also to find consensus, but that consensus will inevitably and appropriately involve the United Kingdom, as well as the other Member States of the European Union.
Â Â  . The Communityâs responsibilities in the field of public health are set out in Article 152 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
In particular, Article 152(5) states that Community action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care.
The Council, therefore, has no competence as regards euthanasia.
Â Â  Thank you, Minister, for that reply.
In April this year, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe rejected by a large majority a draft measure to legalise euthanasia in Europe.
At the same time, in the Netherlands, where euthanasia has been legalised, it is reported that assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia are now responsible for one in 40 deaths.
Given the rise in euthanasia tourism, does the Council agree that the coordination between Member States at EU level on this issue would now be prudent, taking into account the principle set out in the Treaty that the death penalty is not one which should be available in Member States?
Â Â  . With the greatest of respect to the questioner, I would reiterate the point I made in my initial answer, that the European Community does not have competence for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care.
The present Treaty is quite clear on this point in relation to Article 152(5).
As such, the Council has no competence as regards euthanasia and so it cannot create legislation on this issue.
It cannot specify the roles and responsibilities of healthcare workers regarding euthanasia because Member States have the sole competence in this area.
It is therefore for Member States to ensure that they have procedures and provisions in place to define the roles and responsibilities of medical and nursing staff.
Member States are also responsible for monitoring these procedures.
Â Â  . The European Union has closely followed the evolution of the situation in Togo.
In a statement issued in the aftermath of the elections, the Presidency expressed its grave concern regarding the situation in Togo following the elections on 24 April and paid tribute to the people of Togo who took part in the ballot despite difficult conditions.
The Presidency also condemned the wave of violence and launched an urgent appeal to all the parties to restore calm.
In a declaration issued on 3 June, the European Union expressed its support for the initiatives taken by the African Union through its Peace and Security Council, in particular the appointment of a special envoy to facilitate dialogue between the Togolese parties and the decision to send an observer mission to monitor the political, security, social and humanitarian situation, as well as the human rights situation in the country.
The European Union also urged the Togolese authorities to carry out an impartial, exhaustive and credible investigation into the acts of violence against the civilian population.
The European Union raised the issue of Togo at the latest ministerial meetings with the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States, held on 11 April and 18 May respectively.
During those meetings it had the chance to discuss the complexities with regard to African mediation efforts and election monitoring.
The European Union declares that it is ready to support the national reconciliation process and it will continue to monitor the political situation in Togo closely, particularly in relation to the 22 engagements undertaken by the Togolese Government during the consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement and reproduced in the Council Decision of 15 November 2004.
The next legislative elections in Togo figure among the election monitoring priorities established by the Commission for 2005.
The Commission will send an exploratory mission, which should report on the advisability of sending an election monitoring mission if a number of conditions are met: first, if a government is in place; second, if a consensus exists among the main political parties to respect the results of the elections: and, third, there is real progress on the 22 commitments.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am much obliged to you for the detailed answer you have given and would just like to ask whether it is, in your view, conceivable that the European Union will, in the immediate future, intervene directly and actively in the peace process in an attempt to bring about new elections in the immediate future.
Â Â  . I reiterate the point I made in my earlier statement that the Commission will send an explanatory mission, which should report on the advisability of sending an election monitoring mission if a number of conditions are met, and I set out those conditions.
In the first instance, we would want to be clear as to the findings of such an exploratory mission in relation to further work that could potentially be done in that area.
Â Â  . As rightly pointed out by the honourable Member, as things stand at present and under the agreed framework for EU-Nato relations, Cyprus and Malta do not take part in EU military operations conducted using NATO assets, the so called âBerlin Plusâ arrangements.
Likewise, they do not receive NATO classified information or EU classified information containing or referring to NATO classified information.
This state of affairs necessarily has implications for Cyprus and Maltaâs participation in EU-NATO meetings, as well as in some internal EU meetings.
It will not, however, affect the rights and obligations of EU states in their capacity as EU members, in particular the entitlement of Cyprus and Malta under the EU Treaty to participate fully and without discrimination in defining and implementing the CFSP, including defence aspects.
The Council is fully aware of the problem and, in the absence of complete resolution of the issue, has been raising it constantly over the past year with the parties involved.
Turkey has been asked to help resolve the problem, but for the time being the complexity and the wider implications of the issue have made it difficult to achieve much real progress.
Questions on how the North Atlantic Council interprets and applies its own decisions, including that of December 2002, should properly be addressed to NATO.
I note, however, that requests to extend the scope of EU-NATO dialogue beyond military cooperation in crisis management have come mainly from NATO.
The Council is happy to consider such an extended dialogue, provided that all 25 Member States are present at the table.
I should also like to note that, at the most recent meeting between the European Union Political and Security Committee and the North Atlantic Council on 27 June 2005 in Brussels, it proved possible to hold a formal exchange of views on Darfur with all 25 EU Member States participating.
I would like to consider this a first, even though small, step forward to more significant progress on this difficult issue.
Â Â  â I would like to give special thanks to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Alexander, and start by wishing him every strength and every success in his job and that of the British Presidency.
I understand from your answer, Mr Alexander, that the European Union and the British Presidency do not agree with the approach and the interpretation which Turkey gives to relations between the European Union and ÎÎÎ€Î.
You will surely agree that neither Cyprus nor Malta are Member States of the European Union with reduced institutional parity within the framework of the European Union.
Does the British Presidency intend to take any specific initiatives to resolve this very serious problem which Turkey is creating?
Â Â  . Obviously the basis of the question reflects the fact that two organisations, in particular the European Union and NATO, must both agree on the agenda of any meeting in advance.
As I made clear in my original reply, it is not for me to comment today on how NATO interprets and applies its own decisions in this respect.
I would merely reiterate what I said in my initial answer.
Â Â  . In its conclusions on Cuba, which were adopted on 13 June 2005, the Council drew on the 1996 Common Position, the relevance and validity of which it reaffirms.
Consequently, the European Union aims to encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people.
This approach has never been called into question by any of the Member States.
The Council has taken a firm position, especially in relation to the human rights situation which, according to these conclusions, should be raised at every high-level visit.
This Council has also expressed regret at the lack of any further advance since the release of several political prisoners imprisoned in March 2003.
It has, in particular, condemned the action taken by the Cuban authorities to curb freedom of expression, assembly, and freedom of the press.
Furthermore, the Council has categorically condemned Cubaâs unacceptable attitude to foreign parliamentarians and journalists who attended the Assembly to Promote Civil Society, on 20 May 2005, and were either expelled or denied entry into Cuba.
Moreover, closer relations with the peaceful political opposition and with broader sectors of Cuban civil society through intense and regular dialogue decided at the end of January have produced satisfying results.
The Council decided to maintain this dialogue and indeed intensify it according to the agreed guidelines.
These meetings of representatives of the European Union and of the Member States with the peaceful opposition will continue to take place.
The Council has decided to reconsider its position in the context of evaluation of the common position in June 2006.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MadamÂ President, I should like to ask the Council representative to inform the House of the specific measures that the Council intends to take.
The fact of the matter is that members of the opposition are still held in Cuban prisons, having been sentenced to many years of imprisonment.
The European Council supports the lifting of sanctions against the Castro regime, despite the fact that the EU should insist on respect for human rights when pursuing its foreign policy.
I would ask whether the time has not come to change our tactics for dealing with the Castro regime, and to stop being guided exclusively by the policies of Zapatero and Madrid on the matter.
Â Â  . I shall begin with a couple of points of history and then speak of the future.
On 31 January the European Union agreed to intensify its dialogue with the peaceful opposition in Cuba and then on 13 June, conclusions also noted that the expulsion of EU deputies and journalists, which prevented them from attending a meeting of civil society on 20th May in Havana, was unacceptable.
The European Unionâs cohesive approach to human rights in Cuba was recently shown at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in April when Member States jointly co-sponsored the resolution, drawing attention to Cubaâs human rights record.
I can assure the honourable Member that the European Union will continue to use every opportunity to call for the release of all political prisoners and will urge the Cuban Government to apply greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, political reform and further economic liberalisation in Cuba.
Â Â  As the speaking time set aside for Question Time has expired, Questions Nos. 23 to 42 will be answered in writing(2).
That ends Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr Timothy Kirkhope, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, 1. on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Agreement between the European Community and Switzerland concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland [13049/2004 COM(2004)0593 C6-0240/2004 2004/0200(CNS)] and
2. on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen Acquis [13054/2004 COM(2004)0593 C6-0241/2004 2004/0199(CNS)] (A6-0201/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, I very much welcome your Houseâs endorsement of the conclusion of the agreements on the association of Switzerland with the Schengen and Dublin .
This positive stance is made all the more important by the fact that the political processes required by Switzerland for these agreements to be ratified have now been completed, the most important stage in them having been, without doubt, the referendum held on 5Â June.
We, too â and your House not least â should all make good use of this favourable response on the part of the Swiss in order to foster a positive attitude towards the European cause, and this will of course involve the completion of our own procedures with the minimum possible delay.
The agreements were signed on 26 October 2004 in Luxembourg and augur well for the continuing development of relations between the EU and Switzerland.
Swiss association with the Schengen Agreement will bring many practical benefits for EU citizens too, particularly for the many thousands of commuters and travellers, whether for business or other reasons, who are obliged to cross the border on a daily basis, for whom life will be made much easier once the agreement is implemented.
Moreover, the agreements relating to Schengen and Dublin also enhance security by means of cooperation in combating crime and in the exchange of data across borders.
It is for this reason that it is so important that Parliament should endorse the conclusion of the agreements.
It is, however, unfortunate that differing views are held on the procedure applicable to this end, by the Commission and the Council on the one hand and by Parliament on the other.
Having once again examined its position, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it ought to be possible to agree on one point, namely that neither agreement is an association agreement within the meaning of the European Communities Treaty, even though the word âassociationâ occurs in their titles.
Apart from that, though, the Commission does take the view that these agreements do not create any kind of specific institutional framework for the cooperation processes.
The mere existence of a mixed committee is not sufficient to have that effect.
The point I particularly want to make with reference to this is that the mixed committeesâ sole function is to rule on whether or not the agreements should remain in force in the event of Switzerland failing to discharge its treaty obligations, specifically the transposition of the Schengen or Dublin into domestic law.
It also has to be said that these mixed committees are entitled to exercise influence to a considerably lesser degree than the mixed committees already in existence, as established through other bilateral agreements with Switzerland.
For these reasons, the Commission regards the legal position as being that neither agreement requires assent.
The Commission therefore sees no reason to amend its proposal for a decision.
Thank you for your attention; I look forward to the debate with interest.
Â Â  . Mr President, like a curateâs egg, as they say, that introduction by the Commissioner was good in parts but not in all parts.
I am greatly honoured to have conduct of these matters.
My respect for not only the institutions of Europe but also for the Swiss institutions and people knows no bounds.
It was only because of the willingness of the Swiss people, through their referendum on 5 June, to see greater cooperation between Switzerland and the EU that I was able to proceed with my proposals.
As the Commissioner has already pointed out, these are good proposals.
They are radical, particularly from a Swiss perspective, because although Switzerland retains its independence, if the report is adopted its borders will now effectively allow more movement of people.
It will retain strong control over movements of goods but there will be greater movement of people, much better cooperation between law enforcement authorities and, through Switzerland's involvement in the Dublin , close involvement in determining who is responsible in the case of difficult asylum applications.
These are all very good, progressive and acceptable developments.
They could well be the start of many more agreements based on a similar approach, an approach that was adopted previously with both Norway and Iceland and is now being used with Switzerland.
As I said, I very much respect the decision of the Swiss people on 5 June and I am therefore happy to proceed.
However, although I have heard the Commissioner's explanation on the mixed committees and hence the legal base, I still have considerable problems.
I look at this not so much as a lawyer myself, but on the basis of our legal advice, which appears to be ambivalent.
From my point of view it indicates that the right procedure would have been the assent procedure rather than consultation.
That is the basis on which I intend to proceed.
I still hope that we might be able to reach an accommodation here, because the purpose of my two amendments to this report is to make sure that this is an assent and not a consultation procedure.
Obviously there might be an ongoing dispute.
I am disappointed in that part of the Commissionerâs speech, because she seems to indicate that she is happy that her legal advice is better than mine.
I suppose you do not always have the same legal advice when you have two lawyers, any more than two economists ever agree on financial matters.
Nevertheless, I feel very strongly that this is important, not only in this particular case but also for other matters and agreements that we might bring to Parliament for consideration in future.
My committee is quite clear about this, having taken advice, and I too feel very strongly.
I do not want to be seen to be blocking progress or obstructing the will of the Swiss people, who are very interested in the outcome of our discussions and what I am doing here.
However, it is in everybodyâs interests that we make it clear that the European Parliament very much guards its right to be involved in assent procedures in the limited fields in which they apply.
We feel very strongly about that.
I hope that the Commissioner will be able to reconsider.
The Council is not present, but it had a similar view.
I would like to see the matter reconsidered, because these freer relationships can only be to the benefit not only of the Swiss people but also of all of us in the European Union, especially its institutions, and in particular the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I propose to start by raising a number of issues relating to the Schengen Agreement, for I have a very clear recollection of the circumstances surrounding its adoption, which was heralded by a number of things happening at borders, where customs checks were abolished and VAT was no longer to be levied; veterinary controls at borders were abolished, the collection of statistics at borders was consigned to the past, and checks on branded products came to an end.
At the same time, export subsidies and import levies were done away with too, the effect being that the borders really were open.
Last to go, and at the hands of the Schengen Agreement, were controls on persons.
The very opposite is the case in Switzerland, where all the things I have listed remain in place, and only controls on persons are to cease.
I therefore want to raise the question of whether our Swiss neighbours have not managed to extract the only raisin from what I, in this House, have called this very dry bread, and, in these negotiations, they appear to have done just that.
At any rate, that is the impression that the people in my electoral district on the Upper Rhine get; they are constantly pointing out the ways in which the things that the Swiss regard as important have actually been dealt with.
There are, though, very serious problems â the noise made by planes at ZÃŒrich airport is one of them â that have been left untouched, even though they are bilateral in nature, affecting both Switzerland and Germany alike.
The second issue is no less important and has to do with farmers on this border.
The very great difficulties that the German farmers face have to do with the fact that the Swiss pay much higher subsidies, so that the Swiss farmers are able to pay higher rents, and now they are going to get aid from the European Union too.
It is enough to defy anyoneâs powers of comprehension.
If adequate account cannot be taken of these interests, then something has gone wrong with the negotiations at some point.
Our opinions differ as regards the legal basis.
It is our belief â and our own Legal Affairs Committee confirms it â that these mixed committees really are institutional in character.
That being so, I do not think this House is in a position to deliver a definitive opinion, and so we will have to go on discussing this.
I do not therefore think that it will be possible for the European Union to ratify this agreement at present.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member whose electoral district is directly adjacent to Switzerland, I do of course share with Mr von Wogau a fundamental interest in good, and above all close, cooperation between the European Union and that country.
Although I do not wish to say anything about the legal basis, on which I can do no other than agree with MrÂ Kirkhope, Members of this House are getting the impression that cooperation between the Member States on the one hand and the European Union â with which Switzerland has been in negotiations â on the other is not all that our constituents have a right to expect.
I do believe, though, that, despite everything, this agreement adds up â bearing in mind the fact that the Agreement on the free movement of persons has to be added on 25 September â to an advance for those who live in our electoral district, for Schengen and Dublin are about closer and therefore better cooperation in the control of persons and are thus of benefit to internal security.
It is not only the Swiss who stand to gain from this; so do our fellow-citizens.
It is, though, because both the European Union and Switzerland must benefit from their mutual cooperation that I share the view that the Schengen Agreement and the Agreement on the free movement of persons must complement one another like two sides of a single coin.
Particularly in view of the ongoing problems with borders, which we will be discussing with our Swiss opposite numbers at the meeting of the SINEEA delegation in Fribourg next week, it is right and proper that the Commission should tell them that we have to regard Schengen as inseparable from the Agreement on the free movement of persons, and this, as Mr von Wogau so rightly said, should not, if at all possible, be seen as the end, but rather as the beginning, of a process by which the Swiss will come to agree to other closer cooperative relationships.
It is because I believe this to be in the interests of the people on the Upper Rhine that I regard Mr Kirkhopeâs report as worthy of support, and, although it is not for me to give an opinion on the legal issues he has addressed, it has mine.
Â Â  â Mr President, one might be forgiven for thinking that this debate is only of interest to the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, yet this is not the case â it is of interest to the whole of Europe.
I should like to begin by commending Mr Kirkhope on his efforts to defend Parliamentâs prerogatives.
I wish to congratulate the Commission on the initiative and to say to the Commissioner that it is very important that Switzerland can become the third country from outside the EU, after Iceland and Norway, to be involved in the execution, implementation and development of the Schengen acquis and the Dublin/Eurodac system.
The fact is that the Swiss people decided in a referendum, as mentioned by Mr Kirkhope, to have closer ties with the EU by integrating the Schengen area, which allows free movement, and by means of the Dublin Agreement, which covers asylum policy.
I welcome Switzerlandâs participation in these systems, which will eliminate certain obstacles to free movement and will strengthen cooperation; this is vital in view of the countryâs geographical location.
Switzerland stands to gain politically, in terms of greater stability in its geographical neighbourhood, and economically, in terms of the benefits of greater flow of movement.
Accordingly, Switzerland will have to accept and apply the Schengen acquis in its entirety, which is not true of all EU Member States, given that derogations are only provided for in relation to the future development of the Schengen acquis, a prerequisite seen as necessary for the conclusion of an agreement on taxation of savings.
As regards the second agreement, Switzerland will have to accept, implement and apply the current and future Dublin/Eurodac acquis with no exception.
I should like to conclude by pointing out that these agreements mark a welcome shift towards closer relations between Switzerland and the EU.
This also demonstrates to other countries that it is possible to strengthen ties, to pool efforts and to work closely together on policy with the EU, without necessarily formally becoming a Member State.
Â Â  . Mr President, perhaps I might start by replying to the questions in general terms.
I think we are all, when it comes down to it, glad that we now have these agreements, that one of them has already been approved by a referendum, and that we can embark on the process of ratification.
As has already been said, that is very important, not only because it can be a model for other countries, but also because it will offer the Swiss people a chance to draw ever closer to the European Union.
Since the legal issue has been mentioned, it is that in particular that I would like to revisit.
The legal services of both the Commission and the Council have given their opinions on this.
Even though Mr Kirkhope has already done so, I would like now, again, to confirm the position.
Article 300 of the Treaty establishing the European Community specifies four instances in which the conclusion of an international agreement requires assent on the part of the European Parliament. The first is where the agreement is an association agreement within the meaning of Article 310 of the Treaty establishing the European Community; the second, agreements establishing a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures; the third, agreements having important budgetary implications for the Community, and the fourth, agreements entailing amendment of an act adopted under the procedure referred to in Articles 251 or 252 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
In all other instances, Parliament can only give its opinion.
The Commissionâs legal service takes the view that this agreement cannot be seen as included among the instances enumerated above and that the mixed committees established by it have only limited powers, specifically in the field of dispute resolution.
Although I have of course taken note of what you say, I must uphold this as being the Commissionâs opinion.
I would like to briefly respond to the issues addressed by Mr von Wogau and also referred to by Mr Schwab.
We are, I think, fully aware of the problems and issues that they have mentioned, which have to do with cooperation between areas, and, in particular, between regions.
Although such issues as agriculture and aircraft noise are predominantly bilateral in character, I am aware of the connection, and while unable to put forward any solution right now, I can assure you that we are aware of the problems, which we can perhaps again put on the agenda for occasional discussions with the Swiss.
I have, at the present moment, nothing further to add, and ask your House to continue with the relevant procedures.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Gabriele Zimmer, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the impact of the lending activities of the European Community in developing countries [2004/2213(INI)] (A6-0183/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, todayâs debate affords me the opportunity to present the report that I have written, on behalf of the Committee on Development, to discuss in particular the effects of the European Unionâs lending practices, involving specifically in this instance the European Investment Bank.
The primary object of the report that is before you today, and on which you will be asked to vote tomorrow, is to make the European Investment Bank a major, and above all, an effective instrument of development aid.
Today, many of you have shown your support for the âMake Poverty Historyâ campaign, and that is, of course, a laudable thing to do, but, if we â as this House has done symbolically â take part in âWhite Band Global Action Dayâ, we also have to discuss the extent to which the development aid for which we can claim credit to date actually does what we, again and again â not least to the outside world â claim that it does.
Todayâs poverty already has a history, and part of that history has to do with the mistakes that have been made in development finance over recent years and have had the consequence that today, still, 2Â 736 million people â amounting to almost half the worldâs population â have less than two dollars a day on which to live.
I would like to return to an element in this morningâs debate that I regard as directly relevant to this report.
Movements in Africa have been persistently critical of the way in which the countries of the North exercise control over them; what they want from us above all else is an all-out war on poverty, hunger and disease, and an agreement on our part to the complete and unconditional cancellation of the poorest countriesâ debts, so let us give them that.
They also call for more, and in particular better, resources to be allocated to development aid than have been to date.
There is no doubt that one of the errors of the past â and one that has to be addressed with reference to the European Investment Bank â was the lack of coordination among the various bodies involved in development finance.
Despite the Barcelona agreement, they still, to far too great a degree, operate in parallel â the Commission alongside the Member States, multilateral and national development banks side by side â and ultimately counter-productively.
It is for that reason that this report attaches great importance to the need for the EIB, in taking up its new tasks, to give priority to coherence, transparency and, above all coordination, from the very outset.
Among the most fateful errors, though, was the widespread attempt to use what was termed âdevelopment financeâ as a means of developing our own economic relationships abroad and enabling European businesses to open up markets in the South.
If you take a look at the limitations placed upon the European Investment Bankâs mandate, particularly as regards loans in Asia and Latin America, you find that virtually word for word.
The European Investment Bankâs shareholders, namely the Member States of the European Union and the Commission, are currently engaged in negotiating a new mandate for the EIB to grant loans outside the EU, but these negotiations are, I believe, actually being conducted to an increasing extent by financial experts, with less and less involvement of experts on development.
Nor, so far, have they drawn on Parliamentâs expertise.
Yet this new mandate must contain a clear commitment to the tasks particularly associated with the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and to the combating of poverty in the countries to which money is lent.
In order, though, that this House may be enabled to monitor how this new mandate is worded, it is, I believe, necessary â and something that this report demands â that Members of this House be informed of the progress of negotiations as early as September this year.
It is not acceptable that we should be presented with a .
No longer can the progress of the war on poverty be measured only by reference to figures for economic growth, which often â and particularly in the case of rural areas â conceal increasing poverty, or, indeed, by reference to the level of direct foreign investment, which the bank cites as an indicator of success but is not suitable as such, for it says nothing about the number of jobs created or about the effects the investments have on society or the environment.
To take an example: today, in Zambia, the EIB is helping Swiss and Canadian companies to start up large-scale copper mining operations; almost all their profits will go out of the country, while toxins will remain in the rivers to ruin agriculture throughout entire regions.
Such things may appear in accounts as foreign investments, but they make no measurable contribution to combating poverty.
The report before you today also contains a range of practical proposals as to how the EIBâs loans can, in future, be put to better use in developing countries.
These proposals are made in the context of the Millennium Development Goals and in harmony with the UNâs objectives, and a large number of detailed proposals have been made as to how progress can be achieved in this area.
There is one problem that I particularly want to highlight.
I believe that the European Investment Bank still pays far from enough heed to the requirement that it should apply the Millennium Development Goals as indicators, enabling it to assess the effects of its own operations after the event.
It relies on general data, which I do not believe to be sufficient, particularly when one draws comparisons with the effectiveness with which the national development banks of certain Member States already operate.
It was the tsunami that showed the urgent need for change if the EIB is to be able, in emergencies, to make proper loans independently of external economic criteria and provide really effective help.
For this, it needs a clearer mandate from its shareholders, the Member States, so I ask you, tomorrow, to vote to adopt this report, for by so doing you will maintain the productive and cooperative relationship between this House and the European Investment Bank, and we will be enabled to make progress in the field of development aid.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrsÂ Zimmer, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating MrsÂ Zimmer on her report on the impact of the European Investment Bankâs activities in developing countries.
We think that this report raises many very important issues, and I will not pretend that I do not largely agree with their analysis.
Before commenting in more detail on the report itself, let me first give my impressions of the situation regarding the implementation of the investment facility.
Some of you will know that I wrote to MrÂ Maystadt in February this year, expressing concerns about the Cotonou Investment Facility.
I am happy to say that the situation has improved significantly since then.
One of the improvements that I have noticed is a greater willingness to take the risks inherent in investment in developing countries; another is the systematic application of a new framework seeking to measure the impact of operations on development.
We are talking to the EIB about simplifying the decision-making structure for the facilityâs projects.
In short, we think that the investment facility is on the right track in the ACP region.
I would now like to make five comments on the report, starting with services of general interest.
We entirely agree that it is necessary to improve the provision of services of general interest in developing countries, for example in the water and transport sectors.
As many of these projects are not viable in commercial terms, they obviously require an element of subsidy.
Consequently, we have proposed to the Member States that, for the next budgetary period, we should double the interest subsidy package that accompanies the investment facility in the ACP countries, and increase it to EURÂ 400Â million.
With regard to cooperation between the EIB and the Commission, we recognise that even more needs to be done to improve the infrastructure in developing countries.
The Commission is preparing a communication on Africa, as you know.
This communication will propose a considerable increase in the availability of regional and transcontinental infrastructure.
This objective will require substantial efforts to be made to improve coordination between the EIB and the Commission, as well as with other financial bodies and institutions.
In this context, a group of officials from the EIB and the Commission is currently analysing how our two institutions could improve cooperation in the future.
Clearly, it will also be important to cooperate with other lenders, as I have just said.
With regard to micro-lending, we fully support the reference to micro-lending in the report.
As the United Nations has declared 2005 to be the International Year of Microcredit, this subject is a political priority.
In this regard, the Commission recently decided to make Commission aid for micro-lending considerably more professional.
An important pillar of this new approach is to step up cooperation with those banks that specialise in development, particularly the EIB, with regard to the provision of microcredit.
Consequently, the Commission strongly supports the European Parliamentâs call to increase the EIBâs microcredit aid.
Turning to the development indicators, here too we recognise that the EIB needs to adopt the Commissionâs key indicators to assess the results of its operations and to set up an independent evaluation unit.
Finally, with regard to the review of the external lending mandates, we recently proposed, at a meeting between the Commissioner for External Relations and PresidentÂ Maystadt, to increase the development aspect of the EIBâs external activities, outside the ACP region.
The review of the external lending mandates, which the EIB and the Commission are now beginning, provides the opportunity to do so.
I should not like to finish without paying tribute to PresidentÂ Maystadt and his team, who, certainly during all our meetings and whenever we have been in contact, have shown themselves to be very open-minded.
Within the EIB Presidency, at any rate, there is clearly a considerable openness to development and if PresidentÂ Maystadt cannot go any further in terms of effectiveness, it is partly because, unfortunately, there are rules and his goodwill has its limits.
That said, he is someone who is very open to reform.
He is even studying the options for reforming the EIB, to make it more sensitive to development issues and to ensure that, within the decision-making bodies, the development aspect is taken more broadly into account, which is clearly difficult as things currently stand and given the composition of the decision-making bodies.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating MrsÂ Zimmer on her excellent report and congratulating the Commissioner for his proactive initiatives.
I know he has been going up and down to Luxembourg to see MrÂ Maystadt and I think something very good is going to come out of all this.
The EU is the largest aid donor in the world.
The EIBâs lending facility is four times the size of the World Bank.
But you, Mr President, know everything about the World Bank.
Who knows anything about the EIB?
Unless we do something about it, we could even change the EIBâs name to the European Invisible Bank. The EIB should be Europeâs premier financial institution for lending and development.
It should lend to infrastructure and to SMEs. It should lend microcredits.
It should lend beyond the EDF. It should be able to lend to all the developing countries that the European institutions help.
The EIBâs statute needs to be strengthened by Parliament: to create a legal base, to have a grant funding element so that its lending and its interest charges can be much more competitive and be given with some security.
For example, if the EIB were to lend at 1% a EUR 1 billion loan, it is only going to cost EUR 10 million.
If it were to charge 2%, it is only EUR 20Â million.
What is EUR 20 million in our development budget?
Very little, but it would enable the EIB to give billions to create infrastructure, create small businesses, create microcredits, and it would cost our Community aid budget EUR 20 million.
That is all we are talking about.
I think it is high time we did this.
Â Â  . First and foremost, I would like to thank MrsÂ Zimmer for her excellent report and all her hard work, and to thank the European Investment Bank for its cooperation.
I am convinced that we all have a responsibility to explore and to deal with the problems of the developing world.
I welcome the policy set out by the European Parliament, the Commission and the British Presidency regarding this issue.
Developing world countries should not have to subsist merely on aid; possibilities must be opened up for bringing their economies to life.
Instead of economic paralysis, a way out must be created for them.
I would like to draw your attention to the following points that are being realised via the European Investment Bankâs lending activities.
The European Investment Bank supports the objectives set out by the European Union in the Cotonou Agreement and in the eight Millennium Development Goals.
The fact that the bank takes into account the views of non-governmental organisations and public opinion, even at the project monitoring stage, is important.
Environmental impact assessment and an environmental impact statement have now been integrated into the project cycle, while attention will continue to be focused on the social and employment policy consequences of the investments.
A comprehensive anti-corruption policy and an open, transparent process of negotiation and concluding contracts will create a sound basis for this â the parties must namely put in place appropriate internal inspection mechanisms to expose corruption.
Lastly, I would like to highlight an issue that I consider to be a priority: in developing its lending to the private sector, it will now be possible to monitor respect for human rights and compliance with ILO labour standards and OECD guidelines.
I believe that the only instruments worth applying are those that bring effective development and not merely transitional solutions to the problems of the developing world.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner Michel, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mrs Zimmer for this fine report.
The importance of the European Investment Bank is underlined by two facts; one is that the EURÂ 40 billion it lends make it the worldâs biggest public source of credit, while the other is that its active presence in over 100 countries makes it, as a development bank, second only to the World Bank in terms of size.
The problem, though, is that its statutes stipulate that the European Investment Bank is not actually meant to function as a development bank; they in fact impose upon it the obligation of adjusting its interest rates in line with what the market demands, that is to say of not offering particularly low rates of interest in order to promote objectives in such fields as development policy.
It has, however, been required to apply its lending policy towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and this, although something that is very much to be welcomed, is a contradiction, and one that ought to be resolved by the bank undergoing a fundamental reform.
I believe that some fundamental thinking needs to be done about whether it might not be rational and proper for the Bankâs funding of development to be separated, institutionally speaking, from its European activities.
It is because I believe that a political solution needs to be found to this ongoing contradiction that I regard this as the principal subject for attention in any discussion about the Bankâs policies.
Until such time, though, as such a fundamental reform is got underway, there is a need for other practical steps to be taken towards improving its policies and in order to enable it to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
One thing that I believe has to be done is for the granting of loans to be guided by the need to address poverty and meet social, environmental and human rights criteria, which must take precedence over financial and technical considerations, and which the Bankâs management must ensure is put into practice.
Secondly, I think it very important that the Bank should make more use of the instruments for interest rate subsidy provided for in the Cotonou and MEDA agreements, in order to become able to finance the development of small and medium-sized enterprises by means of loans at lower rates of interest.
The difference between these and the high rates that the Bankâs statutes oblige it to charge can then be made up by means of subsidies.
The third thing that has to be done is to assess and take into account the social and environmental effects of large-scale infrastructure projects, and to do so to a much greater extent than before.
It is particularly important that no support be given to projects that do not meet the criteria of the World Commission on Dams, that is to say major dam-building projects.
These three things I do believe we can put into practice right now, and then, in the long term, there will be a need for a fundamental debate on reform.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the socialists of the new Italian Socialist Party.
First of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent job she has done.
The principal operational recommendation of the UNâs Millennium Project stipulates that all developing countries, still in conditions of extreme poverty, should adopt bold national strategies so as to be able to achieve over the course of a decade the objectives agreed on.
The countries in question should draw up precise financial plans, set out the extent of internal resources that can be invested in the plan and how much will have to be obtained from donors.
It is clear, in fact, that the fight against poverty is primarily the responsibility of the developing countries themselves, even though it is equally obvious that the achieving of the Millennium Development Goals nonetheless requires a substantial increase in public aid, to eliminate the poverty trap.
In this context, EU action, even though it has got off to a good beginning, must be rapidly improved and the mechanisms relating to action must be made more flexible and dynamic.
On the basis of concrete and operational experience, the appropriate and necessary improvements should be made.
There should, of course, be greater consistency and synergy between the various European aid programmes, bringing together European development policies, such as the Millennium Objectives laid down in 2000 and the Cotonou Agreement, and the EIBâs policies.
2005 is the year of micro-credit.
It is particularly important to adopt further instruments to stimulate the investments of small and medium-sized businesses and to encourage entrepreneurship, especially among women and young people.
I would also like to emphasise one final point.
In two weeksâ time a delegation from this Parliament, of which I will have the honour of being a member, will visit the areas in Indonesia struck by the terrible tragedy of the tsunami.
An entire region of our planet now sees its future compromised.
With regard to this situation it is our responsibility to give the EIB a new, specific emergency mandate, with a view to allowing these people to make a start on their future in a less troubled manner.
Lending a hand by giving practical support to people who are on their knees, trying to get up, is a duty of solidarity that Europe cannot and must not shirk.
Â Â  Allow me to make a few final remarks on the importance of the EIBâs external activities in the developing countries.
As I said at the beginning of the debate, the EIB is a very important partner for the Commission when it comes to implementing new political initiatives, particularly the provision of infrastructure in Africa.
We appreciate the progress that the EIB has made.
Several recommendations from Parliament are encouraging it to continue down that path.
We will continue to assist the bank in its efforts and we will endeavour to increase the possible synergies between our two organisations with the aim of improving aid to developing countries.
Many of the answers to the questions and remarks that have been put forward, and rightly so, clearly require, or in any event entail or would entail, an updating or amendment of the statutes.
It is clear that with the current statutes it would not be possible to meet the wishes that have been expressed.
We could consider various changes, but I am not going to discuss that subject today.
Suffice it to say that we are considering it, even if, politically, I have the feeling that it will be difficult to achieve.
For the time being, we can already work towards renewing the mandates, and we can also consider altering the make-up of the Board of Governors, for example by introducing parity between the representatives of the Finance Ministers and the ministers responsible for development.
Indeed, at the moment, the statutes and the composition of the Board of Governors pose a major problem.
You did, I think, say as much in your speech, and others have also mentioned it.
If I might make a personal observation, for this to be possible, the Finance Ministers will have to come to believe that the Development Ministers have a contribution to make to the Board of Governors, so that we can move away from a purely financial way of thinking, which I fear is not the right approach.
On the other hand, PresidentÂ Maystadt is currently exploring an option that would involve creating a subsidiary of the EIB, dedicated to development, with a Board of Governors made up solely of development representatives.
That subsidiary could then have the interest-rate subsidy at its disposal and would therefore have much more flexibility to integrate the considerations and requests that have been raised regarding, for example, the social aspect.
You are right: certain goods and services cannot be commoditised or, in any event, cannot be commoditised under the same conditions as others.
The environmental aspect, and all issues of this kind, are components that are strictly development matters and that require different financial treatment, which would tend to involve subsidies.
I broadly agree with everything that has been said, but we must make do with what we have for the time being.
We must make the EIB work better, contribute to improvements and, at the same time, reflect on its future.
However, I must point outÂ -Â and this is extremely importantÂ -Â that all of the teams with which I have worked so far, in both the presidency and management of the EIB -Â we have already had several meetingsÂ -Â have struck me as showing a modern and open attitude to these possibilities.
I must say that usually we are faced with much greater conservatism when we want to carry out reforms of this kind.
It is therefore interesting that within the EIB we can count on this open-mindedness, this flexibility and this mentality.
I sincerely believe that they largely share the concerns that have been expressed here.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the Commission on the implementation of the Community action plan FLEGT (Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am of course delighted at the interest that you are taking in the Community action plan on forest law enforcement, governance and trade, FLEGT.
However, it is not enough to have an action plan: it must still be implemented.
That is why the Commission adopted proposals for implementing this plan in JulyÂ 2004.
These proposals comprise a regulation establishing a voluntary licensing scheme for imports of timber and a recommendation for a directive on a mandate to negotiate partnership agreements with timber-producing countries.
The Council is currently examining these proposals, and I hope that an agreement will be reached this year.
In the meantime, we have released EURÂ 17Â million to finance pilot programmes relating to the fundamental aspects of the action plan, in particular to encourage independent monitoring of logging operations, to strengthen local civil society and to encourage the private sector to follow the broad political guidelines set out in the action plan.
We have also released EURÂ 3Â million to support the international and regional dialogue on improving forest governance and combating illegal logging.
A technical assistance programme costing EURÂ 15Â million is also expected to start in Indonesia inÂ 2005.
We have also endeavoured to develop a common approach with the Member States of the European Union.
As part of our joint work programme, bilateral agencies of European lenders are currently holding informal consultations on FLEGT partnership agreements in potential partner countries, including Ghana, Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Malaysia and Indonesia.
That should make it easier to hold formal negotiations on partnership agreements once we have a mandate to negotiate on behalf of the Community.
In the Commission we are also analysing the feasibility of having additional legislation to support the FLEGT action plan, in other words something rather more coercive and proactive.
The evaluation is in progress and is taking place in close collaboration with the Member States, since many of the potential measures are clearly matters of national competence.
The options evaluated include public procurement policy, money laundering, stolen goods and anti-corruption legislation, in addition to the feasibility of practical aspects of the new legislation on monitoring imports of illegally logged timber.
I hope that this work will reach a conclusion during the course of this year.
To conclude, I would like to say a few words about the calls for a unilateral ban on imports of timber of illegal origin.
Personally, I perfectly understand the interests behind these calls.
However, a unilateral ban on importing illegally logged timber into the European Union would not, it seems, provide our customs authorities with an instrument enabling them to confirm the legality of the timber.
To achieve this, we need the full and complete cooperation of the exporting country, which is why the Commission has proposed a voluntary system based on partnerships with the producer countries.
These partnerships will combine a whole raft of governance reforms in the producer countries with measures to stop timber of illegal origin from being imported into the European Union, in particular a licensing system for imports.
This approach would enable us to deal with both the problem of supply in the producer countries and that of demand on our own markets.
Â Â  . Mr President, every so often I am in touch with Father Hector Turrini and he with me.
This is in order to keep him alive.
He is a priest living in Acre in Brazil.
He and his mission seek to protect the local communities from the loggers.
Some of his mission have been murdered and he tells me that he expects one day to be killed himself.
Those are the lengths that illegal loggers will go to for criminal gain at the expense of the environment, local communities and even human life.
In Papua, Stone Age communities are exposed, their health contaminated, their cultures destroyed by loggers bulldozing their greedy way through rainforests.
The European Union is still one of the largest importers of illegally sourced timber.
In Europe we have lost most of our ancient forests and woodlands, to the detriment of our environment and our native species.
It is not too late to protect the less developed parts of the world and thus protect the two-thirds of the worldâs land animals and plant species that live there.
But we need to move fast.
Papua New Guinea has already lost 65% of its rainforests.
Globally, 10 million hectares are lost every day.
Since 1970 an area of rainforest the size of France has been lost in the Amazon.
Twenty million people in the Amazon and 12 million in Africa are at risk, not to mention the great apes and other species of mammals and birds found nowhere else in the world.
In 1998 the G8 agreed that action was needed.
In 2003 the FLEGT was designed to help developing countries to stop illegal logging and to reduce the trade in illegal products, particularly those that come into the European Union.
But it is not yet being implemented.
The Commissioner has helpfully told us what action is being taken.
I would say to him that every day we delay, lives, livelihoods, environments and species are being lost.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am very pleased that you are here this evening, Commissioner, because it gives me the opportunity to thank you for your contribution to this morningâs debate on poverty.
At the same time, I think that this eveningâs topic also relates to development and even, as MrÂ Bowis said, to life and death.
Mr President, this morning we had a long debate about poverty.
We talked about how we can resolve it and about governance issues.
Illegal trade is a key factor in bad governance.
As we have just heard, the European Union is one of the biggest importers of illegal logging.
When the governments of developing countries do not get any revenue, do not get their duties, that is money that could have been spent on the Millennium Development Goals.
This is a very important issue in terms of both development and the environment.
I am glad that the Commission is taking action.
I am glad that the FLEGT is going to be implemented, but I am not sure that it goes far enough.
I am not sure whether any voluntary measures go far enough.
You said something, which I did not catch, about some kind of ; I am not sure what that means.
We need something more than voluntary systems and something more than a trade measure.
We need something that is an environmental measure, using the proper environmental parts of the Treaty.
We also need something which can be debated in the public domain.
We do not want something done through trade, with Parliament only having an opinion; we want codecision on this very important issue.
You are a relatively new Commissioner.
You have inherited this dossier from your predecessors.
I hope that you will bring forward proper legislation under the environmental heading and tackle this very important development issue, which is vital if we are ever to make poverty history.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all can I say how glad I am that we are having this discussion tonight.
Illegal logging has not, until now, been given the priority it deserves in the Commission or the Council, despite the fact that half the logging in vulnerable regions is illegal and that every year an area of rainforest the size of Belgium disappears.
The motion for a resolution deals comprehensively with actions that can be taken to stop illegal logging, but the most important thing is that some action is taken.
This is a case of the best being the enemy of the good.
We do not need further delay while we argue how far action should go.
Voluntary partnership agreements are a good place to start.
Developing countries will need support to get the necessary certification systems in place, but such support is already available as an element of development cooperation, as the Commissioner has just indicated.
It is widely believed that voluntary partnerships will not put a stop to all illegal logging.
I hope, therefore, that the Council and the Commission will clearly flag up right now that further action is anticipated down the line in order to deal with the refusniks who are not prepared to go down the path of voluntary agreements.
However, there are several things we can do from the European side to make voluntary agreements a success.
Twenty per cent of timber in Europe is purchased by governments, so Member State public procurement policy has a huge role to play.
By insisting that governments purchase only legal timber, Member States can wield an enormous carrot, pulling producer countries towards certification.
So far, unfortunately, only five EU Member States have moved towards a public procurement policy.
Secondly, we can make use of consumer power.
Over 70 European timber firms have already signed up to a declaration committing them to trading only in legal wood.
They are not being altruistic. They know that consumers do not want to buy furniture from illegal sources and that people are quite prepared to pay a little bit extra to make sure that their tables and chairs have not added to the destruction of the rainforest.
