There is actually a lot to be said, now that the lies used by the British-American Empire to justify its brutal aggression have been revealed as what they are. It claimed the war was about enabling the UN to disarm Iraq.
That was a lie.
The war had in fact been planned from the outset, regardless of any developments. This has now been revealed.
You ventured to say the Security Council was stalled because it had not voted a resolution authorising the war. That was a lie.
The Security Council was not stalled. It had adopted a procedure that was working.
Iraq was supposed to be weakened. It had been systematically starved for ten years, and forced to disarm in exchange for promises of peace.
It was meant to collapse during the first few hours of battle.
That proved to be another lie. Iraq is offering strong, often heroic resistance.
The people of Iraq were going to greet the troops of the British-American empire as a liberating army.
That too was a lie.
The people perceive the troops as an army of occupation. Iraq was said to possess weapons of mass destruction.
The whole spectrum of falsehoods on this subject has been aired, from the most sinister to the most ridiculous. I have in mind Tony Blair's statement on 5 February.
He brought shame upon himself when he presented a report justifying aggression. Eleven of the 19 pages of the document were based on a student diary dating back some ten years.
To date, the only weapons of mass destruction recorded are the millions of sophisticated bombs and missiles the Anglo-Saxon empire is using to wipe out Iraqi towns.
As a lawyer, I have noted the cynical violation of all the legal provisions the British and Americans themselves put in place to prevent war.
As a European, I regret the hatred of the Western world resulting from the use of the empire's bombs. Sadly it is justified.
As a Christian, I am aghast that a blatantly unjust war should be waged in the name of God. I believe in calling a spade a spade.
Tony Blair is merely an urbane murderer.
As for George Bush, he should stop appealing to God, unless it is to beg Him to keep the blood of innocent Iraqis from staining the hands of the American people.
That Saddam Hussein's regime is a threat to world peace cannot be disputed, given the facts.
Since its defeat in the first Gulf War, Iraq has been the object of many resolutions, with which it has generally not complied.
This has never, however, resulted in their being enforced under the auspices of the UN.
For a long time there were even attempts to have the sanctions against Iraq lifted.
There was also barely any international reaction at all when the inspections were cut short on account of Iraq's failure to cooperate.
Yet Saddam Hussein's obsession with the production of weapons of mass destruction was well-known.
Since then, his people have been oppressed and refugees have been and still are coming to our EU Member States.
Iraq remained a festering sore.
There is no sign of peace there.
Because of the secret service, however, there is apparently great stability, which cannot, unfortunately, be attacked from within - I see no sign of it being so.
Our patience with this can run out too quickly, indeed, but patience can also degenerate into indifference.
For many years this was apparent in our attitude towards the dramatic events in Yugoslavia.
Who is not still embarrassed by that?
We now know that anyone who wants to establish justice must in extreme cases accept the support of force, including military force.
Is there, however, sufficient formal basis under international law for the coalition's military presence?
I quote Max van der Stoel, a well-known Socialist ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs, High Commissioner for minorities at the OECD, a well-known, important Socialist spokesman.
Yesterday he said the following in the NRC-Handelsblad: 'Yes, this basis is not convincing, but I do not doubt the coalition's moral justification of this action for a moment, I do not doubt it for a moment.'
I find that a good left-wing stance.
The debate at the time was about whether intervention should take place immediately, after one or two weeks or after six weeks.
This debate is not sufficient to drum a clear message into the minds of those who risk their lives in the field.
There is little point in their looking back.
The question is whether we should now wish the coalition forces a swift victory so as to avoid long-drawn-out misery both for the public and for themselves.
My group would like to make it clear that when push comes to shove, they all really support the armies, in the same way as they support the people who need to be liberated as quickly as possible.
I cannot imagine that any of us would not support the armies now.
We are not very quick to demonstrate on this side of the Chamber, but I was surprised to see large pieces of paper with the word 'Peace' written on them hung up on the other side, while no one ever stopped to wonder what discontent there was in Iraq, and I do not remember seeing any demonstrations against that, not even in this Chamber.
I think that it is important that justice takes its course for Saddam Hussein.
It is a matter of regret that the UN Security Council has forfeited authority.
Vetoes are being used in a dishonest way, and votes are up for sale.
The UN per se and its services will be more important than ever in post-war Iraq.
We must realise that this matter is a serious warning to the EU, which is obviously still not capable of or willing to defend European principles and values wherever it is necessary to do so.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I vigorously contest what Mr Oostlander has said.
I did not think much of the placards behind me either, but - particularly as their group has fewer placards on display - he should have a word with his colleague Mr Helmer, who held up a placard bearing the word 'Blitzkrieg'.
Now, anyone can use placards to express his intellectual stance, and Mr Helmer has done so today, seeming to be the intellectual heir of the people who once held such placards aloft.
Mr Oostlander, if you quote Max van der Stoel and say that the basis may not be convincing, but that, in moral terms, the action is justified, you can also try putting it the other way round and saying that an action is justified only if it is taken on a truly convincing basis.
If there is even a whisper of doubt, you are assuming responsibility for endangering human lives.
War must always be the last resort of politics, but it cannot be the last resort as long as the policy is a matter of doubt.
If ever there were an avoidable war, this one is it.
A few days ago, ladies and gentlemen, we were presented with the option of coming to a decision on the basis of reports from two respectable diplomats, Mr Blix and Mr ElBaradei.
They said, or rather Mr ElBaradei said, that there were no nuclear weapons, and that they had found none, and Mr Blix said that his mission had been successful and that we could, given a couple more months, disarm Iraq peacefully.
The two gentlemen who made these proposals were not radical socialists, nor were they anti-American agitators; on the contrary, they are thoroughly respectable diplomats from the United Nations, and were showing us a peaceful way ahead, for which there was a majority in the Security Council.
There was, though, also a minority, to which the Pope could have given his apostolic blessing, had they nonetheless voted for this war because they had forged a coalition - not of the willing, but of the wilful - which wanted this war to happen come what may.
I am not impugning the many Members here in this House who believe, on the basis of profound inner conviction, that this tinpot dictator can be got rid of only by the use of armed force.
That is one way of looking at things, but not in the least does it alter the fact that these two gentlemen I have quoted showed us a peaceful way forward, and I have heard all those in this House - including those in your group, Mr Poettering - who have said that this was the right way to go.
If this was the right way to go, why do you not summon up the courage to say that the war is the wrong way?
That, after all, would be the logical conclusion to come to.
Let me say again that those who defy all reason by going down this road also bear the responsibility for the bloody consequences along the way - consequences about which we will all be talking for a long time yet, because we will all be suffering from them.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your speeches.
I would also like to thank everyone who mentioned the Greek Presidency.
I shall try and reply briefly to two or three questions.
Many of you appealed directly to the Greek Presidency to take the initiative and state a specific opinion or take specific recourse to the United Nations.
But what is the presidency's role?
The role of the presidency, not just the Greek Presidency, but any presidency, is not to decide what the European Union's position is.
It is not to welcome one opinion and condemn another.
It is not to express its own views, because Greece too has its own views but it cannot express its views as the views of the Union.
The role of the presidency is to try and marry differing opinions and to follow the rules in order to bring about a result in the form of a unanimous or majority opinion.
If it cannot manage to do that, then it has no place.
The role of the presidency therefore, and I should like to emphasise this, is to defend an important virtue, the virtue of cooperation, the virtue of joint endeavour and joint action.
That is the first thing it has to do.
And that is what the Presidency is working at, because otherwise it will end up with precisely the opposite of what it is supposed to achieve: division.
And we do not want division, especially in these difficult times.
My second point is that a number of honourable Members referred to the Union's foreign policy, again saying that it is non-existent and that nothing has been done.
We heard the President of the Commission say that a European Union peacekeeping force will most probably take over the role of the NATO force in Skopje this week.
This is unprecedented and is the outcome of serious effort in the foreign policy sector.
Anyone listening to the heads of the Balkan countries over the last fortnight, following the assassination of the Serbian prime minister, will have realised that the Western Balkans have high hopes of the European Union.
Why?
Because the European Union has applied a foreign policy.
There are several other examples of the really creative presence of the European Union I could mention.
Are there only a few?
Yes!
There are only a few.
And we failed to unite our position on the basic, moral issue of war or peace.
We have failed to do so on numerous other issues.
But we do not write off what we have done and nor does this mean we must write off what has happened and stop making an effort when it comes to our common foreign policy.
We have to make that effort.
I agree - and this is my third point, because I have heard numerous opinions which are just not realistic - with what Mr Cohn-Bendit said, that compromises are needed.
Compromises are also needed because you will be debating the problem of Iraq tomorrow.
There are a number of issues where I believe, if you pass a resolution, the Presidency and the Commission and the European Union will be able to move forward, such as the need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Iraq, including - as one member said - on the Turkish border, the need to deal with serious humanitarian problems by mobilising the aid provided for and the central role of the United Nations in the political, economic and social reconstruction of Iraq.
If we say it here loud and clear, we shall create frameworks, we shall create commitments.
And, of course, we must not forget the peace process in the Middle East and the importance of transatlantic relations.
The Union's foreign policy, like every other policy, is created.
This endeavour has its triumphs and setbacks, but the policy is still created.
And it is up to us.
If we simply say that the Union is out of its depth and we throw in the towel, then we do not want a Union.
But we do want a Union!
And we want a strong Union.
That is what we are striving for and that is what we must strive for.
Finally, I should like to refer to a number of comments made on economic policy.
First of all, this is a long Presidency text because it is now standard practice in the Union for each spring Council to reiterate all the previous resolutions for the record.
The second point is that there are numerous questions, references and issues which refer back to committees, but if you read the text and the texts it refers to, such as the resolutions of the ?cofin Council, you will see that many of the issues raised are answered.
The Stability Pact, for example, was examined by the Ministers for Finance, who said that it must be maintained, that this is neither the time nor the place for flexibility and that there is a risk of inflation.
I leave it to you to decide whether or not they were right. It was examined.
That is clear from the text.
It is also clear from the text that war can upset the best-laid plans.
It is important to remain level-headed.
It is important not to panic, not to believe that we need to take measures here and now or here, there and everywhere.
We need to keep moving steadily forward on the course we have set.
I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this is one of the main messages of the efforts made in Brussels; that despite the adversities, despite the difficulties, we have a great deal in common, a great deal in common, which we cannot put to one side, which is why, especially in these difficult times, we need to try and express what we have in common and move forward together.
Mr President, the resolution Parliament is now on the way towards adopting is backward-looking.
Instead, we should have turned our attention to the future.
In my view, it is incomprehensible that, in recent days, so many people have expended so much effort on working out how to deplore the decision taken by the American and British governments concerning military action in Iraq, an action to which my country subscribes.
If we did in fact have to be backward-looking, we could have made better use of our time and energy in working out how to condemn the Iraqi regime, which for 12 years has ignored every UN resolution.
It is not the coalition that is responsible for the war in Iraq; it is Saddam Hussein and his regime.
I must therefore vote against conclusion number 3, and I am unable to deplore or regret the decision taken by the coalition. It was Saddam Hussein who forced them to take it.
By an unfortunate turn of events, Saddam Hussein has succeeded in dividing our world, and we must hope that the day will soon come when he can be brought before an international court and tried for his crimes against humanity.
Now, we must look forward, as in part does the resolution, I am pleased to say.
Now, it is a question of preventing as much suffering as possible in the wake of the war.
The Iraqi people have suffered enough. We must therefore be ready to come to their aid, and as soon as possible.
We must take joint responsibility for peace and freedom in Iraq. We must help the Iraqi people to a dignified life in a democratic society, a community founded on the rule of law in which human rights are observed and minorities respected.
That is the most important aspect of the resolution we are to vote on.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our resolutions become no more convincing the more self-righteously we belabour one another with judgments about what is wrong and what right.
We should be helping to find ways out of the crisis.
Firstly, the war must be brought to an end as speedily as possible, with the minimum possible damage being done to people, and Saddam Hussein and his criminal regime being disarmed.
Secondly, the Iraqi people must then have the opportunity to take their own decisions, and the United Nations - rather than one of the belligerent parties - must assume responsibility for the reconstruction of the country.
To this reconstruction, thirdly, the European Union must make a determined contribution, it being in its own primary interest that peaceful development should take root both in Iraq and throughout the Middle East.
We are currently finding out how much we are affected when the opposite happens.
Fourthly, we must reinvigorate the transatlantic partnership and rebuild a relationship of trust with the United States of America, which will, for the foreseeable future, remain the only power capable of guaranteeing order and security on a global and regional scale.
All credit for that to the Americans, to whom we Germans owe a great deal, for they stood up for our freedom at a time when that freedom was menaced by Soviet Communism.
Then their soldiers had the responsibility of guaranteeing the freedom of our capital, Berlin.
It is for those reasons that I am in solidarity with the United States, even though this solidarity has a critical edge to it from time to time.
Solidarity of this sort is not to be abandoned out of hand when there are differences of opinion, for we see no alternatives to the Atlantic Alliance, any more than there are alternatives to European unification.
Mr President, I would like us to cast our minds back to September 11 2001.
After those events we all agreed that the world had changed.
We appreciated that global terrorism, a terrorism well-financed and organised with no clear political objective beyond creating chaos, required a new approach to security.
It was clear that we can no longer take a passive approach.
We can no longer sit on the sidelines tut-tutting when faced with dangerous, repressive regimes prepared to murder their own people, threaten regional security and nurture terrorism.
We saw that we needed a pro-active approach, we needed to develop a concept of global justice for all people and to build a worldwide security system based on active involvement.
We followed through on that in relation to Afghanistan, but now when faced with a difficult and dangerous crisis, we seem to have retreated into a comfort zone of our old certainties. We have particularly retreated to the cold war attitude towards the United States.
We feel that the transatlantic relationship is some sort of zero-sum game.
For one side to win, the other side has to lose.
If we continue that process the world will become much more secure because every issue and every crisis will be divisive as we try to gather around separate poles.
We need transatlantic partnership for the benefit of world security.
We must ensure that we get global certainties and agreements for the future and not re-fight old battles.
It may well be that the structures we set up after the second world war are not suitable for dealing with the post-September 11 world.
In that case we should be working to the future, thinking about how we rebuild Iraq with United Nations support and how we secure peace in Iraq whilst respecting the rights of Iraqi people to their own future.
As I speak, many thousands of my own countrymen and women are putting their lives at risk to free a people from tyranny.
Many people do not agree with that war and I respect their views but I ask that this Chamber respects the position of the men and women whose lives are at risk.
I am frankly amazed that, amongst all this talk of legality, I have not heard one word about Iraqi treatment of prisoners of war, which is contrary to the Geneva Convention.
I have not heard one word of condemnation of Iraqi troops killing their own people in Basra.
Imagine what British troops feel like seeing that happen and being powerless to stop it.
Mr President, naturally I too regret that the United Nations have not found a solution to the conflict in Iraq.
I also think, however, that we must all acknowledge that this stage in the discussion is now finished and that we in Parliament must stop shadow-boxing with the past.
After all, we all agree that Saddam Hussein has been categorically opposing the United Nations for the past 12 years.
Throughout his rule he has oppressed his people and violated international law in many areas.
That is why the members of the Security Council accepted Resolution 1441, and they must therefore now bear the consequences.
Anyone who does not do so is, despite protests to the contrary and perhaps also unintentionally, implicitly helping to keep Saddam in power.
Explain that to the inhabitants of Basra, who are being fired at by their own Iraqi army.
This does not help international law and the Iraqi people in the slightest.
The crisis once more makes it painfully clear that we need a European foreign and security policy and ultimately a European defence force so that we can play a role in the next crisis.
It is no use lecturing other people about international values if you are not able to enforce international law yourself.
I felt that the European summit was not able to avoid deadlock on its other subject, the Lisbon process.
Of course, this will get us nowhere when it comes to economic liberalisation.
Good intentions are all very well, but I would like to see the Commission set up a strict schedule for the implementation of the measures so that the Member States can be reminded of their responsibilities.
To conclude, therefore, I warmly welcome Commissioner Monti's initiative in investigating the banned state support for the French energy group ElectricitÃ© de France.
It is absolutely essential that we complete the internal market in order to be able to continue to compete with the USA and Japan.
Mr President, on behalf of the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, may I start by protesting that President Cox prevented a demonstration in opposition to the war, bringing the members into conflict with the staff.
Even today as imperialist aggression is on the rampage in Baghdad and Basra, Mr Simitis, ignoring the fact that a nation is being murdered in Iraq as we speak, is concerned solely with how big business can increase its profits.
Mr Simitis did not have the sensitivity to express even the slightest criticism of the invaders out of respect for the feelings of the overwhelming majority of our people, the millions denouncing this illegal and criminal imperialist incursion and calling for an immediate end to it.
Of course he talked of the need to restore peace in the region, once the imperialists have won you understand, but his main concern was how Iraq is to be divided up.
The complicity of the European Union was also confirmed by the European Council, which basically covered for the members of the European Union taking an active part in the war and all the other countries providing every sort of facility for the invaders, with the Presidency's country at the top of the list.
And those who sign and support motions for resolutions in the European Parliament which do not clearly and frankly condemn this crime and call for an immediate end to it are equally guilty of complicity.
The dirty imperialist war met with heroic resistance from a nation defending its national independence, awakened consciences and provoked massive and continual demonstrations of protest.
The war was an excellent opportunity to reinforce the so-called Lisbon strategy and promote measures to step up the attack which, in the name of competitiveness, is directly affecting the employment, social, insurance and pension rights of the workers.
This policy will not go unanswered.
Workers, young people and whole nations are rising up in protest and forming their own rallies, their own fronts against this imperialist tornado in order to shift the balance of power and overturn this rotten and barbaric system.
Mr President, I must admit that it feels slightly surreal wanting to talk about other aspects of the Summit apart from Iraq, particularly given that some of the other things that the Summit dealt with are not exactly going to help us towards a more equal or a more peaceful world.
I want to pick up on certain aspects where, for once - unlike last year's Spring Summit- we looked at issues relating to global equity to some extent.
For example, Paragraph 60 onwards of the Presidency Conclusions mentioned promoting sustainable development on a global scale.
Those Conclusions talked about enhancement of corporate social and environmental responsibility, both at EU level and internationally.
I would hope that it would apply to such issues as the granting of contracts on a fair and open basis - rather than giving them to your rich friends.
The Conclusions also mention the means of promoting sustainable and fair trade.
I wonder if we have actually proofed some of the other policies that we came up with at this Spring Summit against those ambitions or, indeed, ambitions to encourage export credits that are consistent with sustainable development when certain Member States pay out over 50% of their export credits to enable arms deals to go ahead.
I hope that, in the aftermath of this Spring Summit, we are going to pay attention to the policies that we talked about there.
I hope that we are going to carry those forward seriously, because we need to examine this ideal of becoming the world's most internationally competitive continent in the light of asking ourselves what the implications are for the global losers if we are the global winners, and what this is going to do to enhance stability, equality and justice in the world.
Mr President, I should like to appeal for calm and tolerance in the House.
After all, these are the cornerstones of European integration. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats attempted to table a resolution on the basis of the Council's declaration.
Unfortunately at this stage consensus appears impossible. Some of the approaches put forward seem to aim in practice at calling for the European Union to become part of the movement of non-aligned countries.
My group argues on the contrary for strengthening the transatlantic axis as a strategic priority for the European Union. We agree with the Council on this.
It is therefore somewhat surprising to hear the Commission praise an initiative for common defence beyond the territory of the Union. It might be termed an extra-Community venture.
No eyebrows should be raised if others now table further proposals.
The Council devoted a good deal of time to discussion of the eagerly awaited post-war period. It sent out an unequivocal call for European Union involvement in rebuilding Iraq.
I congratulate it on that. I would however point out that at present what is required of us is humanitarian aid for those most in need.
I would have welcomed more specific details of action taken by the Commission in that regard. I trust this objective will unite us all, and that we will be prepared to regroup under the European flag as we strive towards it.
A further issue that brooks no delay is ending the conflict in the Middle East. I would have welcomed the Commission's comments on this too.
Mr President, nobody in his or her right mind welcomes this war or any other.
We cannot however fail to deal with international terrorism or threats to our security. We cannot either fail to deal with the state of complete bondage the people of Iraq have had to endure up to the present.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of Iraq seems to have divided the world into two opposing camps.
However, the peace demonstrators have stood up in the whole of Europe and throughout the world in order to protest against the strongest military power in the world.
Without the backing of the UN Security Council, the United States has attacked Iraq, but we now know that their battle plans had been ready for a long time.
We believed that a peaceful solution was possible in Iraq, thanks to the intervention of the inspectors, but the decision had already been taken.
All wars in the Middle East have always ended in disaster.
Why, then, are we incapable of learning the lessons of history?
Our construction of Europe is based on right, rather than might.
Yes, but we cannot deny that the European Union is experiencing a real crisis.
What is this right that we are talking about?
How can we forget Article 11 of the Maastricht Treaty, which compels all Member States to define and implement a common security policy in line with the United Nations Charter?
The UN Charter has been flouted.
Article 2 of that Charter asks all States to refrain from threatening the territorial or political integrity of any other State or to use force against that integrity.
What has happened to our compliance with that article?
Does this mean that there is no longer any law, any treaty, or any charter which is able to resist the law of the strongest power?
That is a frightening thought.
It would be a defeat for democracy, and we do not accept it.
This war is a disaster from the moral viewpoint.
All the great principles of our civilisation cannot be trampled underfoot in this way.
What price will we have to pay for this inability to learn lessons from the past and for the fact that we have delayed too long in building a political Europe that would be capable of facing up to the United States?
It is time for us to react if we want a strong and independent Europe.
It is time for us to put in place a common defence policy, and it will be necessary for us to provide ourselves with the resources to do so.
We need to move, to make the Convention a success and to make our future together a success too.
Mr President, if EU leaders were actually to deliver the goals set last week of the central role of the UN, an EU capacity in foreign and defence policy and strengthening the transatlantic partnership, most of the public would cheer.
Our leaders are letting us down.
One of the few silver linings of this illegitimate war is that even in the UK more people realise how crucial it is to have a single European voice.
Chirac should realise that making the EU a rival of the US is a no-brainer.
Blair needs to understand that the route to partnership with Washington is via Brussels.
On Iraq, what was missing from the Summit conclusions was a reference to preserving the devolved administration of the Kurds in the north.
The Kurds have been betrayed so often, but this time we must guarantee their freedom and identity.
They must enjoy self-government within a federal democratic Iraq.
I absolutely agree that Iraq must observe the Geneva Conventions on prisoners of war, but how hypocritical it is for Rumsfeld to insist on this while denying such protection to those prisoners illegally detained in Guantanamo Bay.
Mr President, the war being waged against Iraq is an imperialist war.
A nation is being massacred so that half a dozen trusts, whether they are oil companies or not, can redistribute the cards and the markets amongst themselves.
The present war is directly in line with so many other wars fought in the past by the great powers, by Britain and the United States, but also by Germany and France, acting sometimes together and sometimes against one another, in order to exploit the Middle East and to plunder its wealth.
Words such as liberty, democracy and the condemnation of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship are merely hypocrisy to conceal a war of banditry.
While the armies of the two greatest powers in the world are still crushing Baghdad beneath their bombs and forcing the inhabitants of Basra to die of hunger and thirst, their major companies are already sharing juicy contracts, like vultures squabbling over the corpse of a country that they are in the process of murdering.
At the European Council, ministers from countries taking part in the aggression against Iraq and those from countries claiming to be opposed to the war came together to produce a single declaration, as if nothing had happened.
What better illustration could there be of the fact that, despite of their differences of opinion, they are, above all, accomplices?
Mr President, of course a democratic process is needed in Iraq, but war is never a solution.
It is unfair, because it kills innocent people, and, as the Arab proverb says, a killer is never a benefactor.
Despite that massive rejection of this war by public opinion, the Council remains silent, whereas we ought to have condemned it.
It is simplistic to believe that the objective of the United States is to control energy resources.
We must recognise that Bush has succeeded in bringing off a double tour de force. He has made people forget not only that his country is going through a social and economic crisis, but also that every day the Israeli army of occupation murders dozens of Palestinians.
Israel continues to violate international law with complete impunity.
The Americanisation of the world, and the re-drawing of the geopolitical map of the Middle East - are not these the real objectives?
The European Union must play a vital role in rebuilding peace.
It must help to create conditions in which the rights of nations can be respected and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States can be guaranteed.
In order to do this, however, it urgently needs to provide itself with a common foreign and defence policy.
The future of Europe depends on it.
Do we want to have a Europe of soldiers in the service of an American empire, or a Europe of independent citizens who respect fundamental rights?
At the next meeting of the UN Security Council, Member States must take a wide-ranging initiative in order to impose the force of law as against the law of force.
Mr President, divisions have emerged within the Council over the choices made this week but, if we care about having a Europe which is politically influential, we have to look to the future and work for the Europe of the future.
Europe has to have a single foreign policy and a single defence policy, to take a leading role on the international stage and to be able to guarantee peace outside its borders.
We will have to achieve this objective during the second half of this year and, in this connection, I must reply to the disagreeable words spoken by Mr Watson, who clearly knows little about and has difficulty recognising what it means to be pro-European.
Clearly, as far as he is concerned, being pro-European means always saying yes, but if we sometimes say no, we might build a better Europe.
It would be an extremely grave political error not to heal the present divisions.
The Italian Government's statements which move in this direction certainly give us hope, and I believe President Prodi will be in agreement with the Italian Prime Minister when he meets with him in Rome on Friday.
The strong, influential political Europe of the future cannot, however, be created with an anti-American stance.
It is appropriate to point this out in this Chamber for there are still those in Europe who place the greatest western democracy and Saddam Hussein's despotic, criminal regime on the same level.
The killer's name is Saddam Hussein; we cannot and must not adhere to the slogan: 'Neither Bush nor Saddam'.
When Europe has rediscovered the reasons for its strong unity, it will have to participate directly, under the aegis of the United Nations, in the construction of the new Iraqi democracy, once it has assisted with the humanitarian needs, the result of a conflict which Saddam Hussein could have avoided by accepting his proposed exile, mentioned several times by Mr Pannella.
It must be a Europe which has relations with the moderate Arab countries, which strives for the security of Israel and for the construction of a new Palestinian state: in short, a Europe which guarantees peace in the Mediterranean and in the Middle East.
Mr President, on 17 February, the European Council declared that the United Nations must remain at the centre of the international order and that it wished to attain the objective of disarming Saddam Hussein peacefully, saying that this is what the European people want; it declared that its support for the United Nations inspectors although saying that it did not want the inspections to continue indefinitely, and, in fact, the inspectors had put forward a plan for disarmament which also had a time limit.
Today we are here in Parliament, not least on behalf of those European people, of that public opinion referred to by the Council, to hold to account first of all those European governments which have supported, are assisting and are participating in a unilateral war which we condemn unreservedly.
We are on day seven, and the dramatic events tell us that it will not be a blitzkrieg.
Nevertheless, our anti-war position does not mean siding with that regime, which must account for its crimes before international courts, and it does not mean being indifferent to the dangerous path being opened up by the violation of international law and the many other violations, such as the use of prohibited weapons, the suffering inflicted on the Iraqi people, the treatment of prisoners and the fate of the Kurdish people.
Then there is the Middle East.
Certain interventionist quarters have said that this war will resolve the Middle East question.
We do not think this is the case.
We can see that things are getting increasingly worse: on the one hand, this war is helping the extremist, group Hamas, and, on the other, the Israeli army is continuing its actions.
Lastly, I would like to ask the European governments: what are you gaining from this terrible experience?
I would like to say to the Member States: incorporate, introduce federalist elements into your European foreign policy.
If you do not do so, we will not have a common policy.
Can you not see that, even without powers, the Commission is currently a point of reference while the role of the High Representative has been destroyed because of your differences?
Once again - it has already happened in the Balkans - we are powerless and at a highly critical time. Remember that the sum total of 15 or 25 national policies which satisfy longstanding interests, will never constitute a European foreign policy.
Mr President, I speak on behalf of the British Conservative delegation at a time when a war is being fought in Iraq - on all our behalves - to remove a threat to our own people and to lift a tyrant from the backs of the Iraqis.
What a disgrace it is that there are so many apologists for Saddam Hussein in this Chamber.
Listening to them I now understand the concept of the big lie.
I want to pay tribute to the British, American and other armed forces engaged in Iraq and express my condolences to those families of our servicemen that have suffered loss.
My own constituency of East Anglia has lost Tornado aircrew from Royal Air Force Marham in Norfolk.
The Colchester-based 16 Air Assault Brigade is also very much in the front line of the conflict, along with units from all over the United Kingdom.
We acknowledge the strong moral and practical support for the coalition from the governments of Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and so many other European countries.
However, this is a conflict which could have been avoided had the international community spoken with genuine resolve and made it clear to Saddam that it was united in its determination to disarm his regime with speed.
I have to say that the poisonous thread that has run through the diplomatic manoeuvrings in the run-up to the Iraq war has been anti-Americanism.
It is this same vitriolic anti-Americanism which inspires so many in this House and elsewhere to try to build separate EU structures to replace those in which our American friends have a key role.
I am thinking particularly of the European security and defence policy, which is not about security but about the trappings of the EU State.
It creates no additional military capabilities, just duplicative and divisive structures from which important allies are deliberately excluded.
This is a time when we should be doing just the opposite.
When the conflict in Iraq is over, North Americans and like-minded Europeans must make the necessary political and material commitments to revitalise the transatlantic alliance before it is too late.
We need to rebuild a western strategic culture.
Mr President, Thomas Friedmann, an American, gave it as his opinion that 'this war is not a war of necessity, but one that is clearly deliberate'.
In 'Le Monde', Alain Pellet took the view that 'aggression is still aggression, even if it is on the part of a great democratic empire and directed against a bloody tyranny'.
This is especially the case when such aggression begins at the very point when the Security Council and the inspectors are succeeding in keeping Saddam Hussein's regime in check and are beginning to disarm it.
I am particularly struck by the fact that a section of Europe's governments is the cause of many deaths and injuries, and, indeed, of massive destruction in an already poverty-stricken country, or at least regards such things as acceptable, for private wars such as this can also be uncommonly contagious.
I am reassured, though, by the fact that Europe's people condemn this war and have no wish to dance blindly and uncritically to the US administration's tune.
Europe's citizens give us cause for hope, and their love of peace should be the foundation on which we construct a common foreign and security policy.
The USA's status as a military hyperpower means, however, that it will not work without a military component.
We simply have to be prepared to consult among ourselves on where we should concentrate our military expenditure.
The next test of our mettle, though, is almost upon us.
With firms close to the US administration - such as a subsidiary of Halliburton - being awarded government contracts worth billions, and, according to newspaper reports, British firms also queuing up in America to get their slice of the cake, Europe is organising humanitarian aid, but it must not stop at that.
We have to use a Security Council mandate as a means of gaining for ourselves a substantial role in the reconstruction of Iraq, of an Iraq in which all - Sunni, Shia, and Kurd - can live in freedom and peace, free from dictatorship whether at home or abroad.
Taking it for granted as I do that nobody will have anything like the decisiveness required to implement the UN's resolutions on Palestine and Israel, it will again be Europe that has to take action for a just solution in the Middle East.
I nevertheless hope that Great Britain and a number of other supporters of this American war will spare a thought for Europe and slowly come to realise that, in the coalition of the willing, the only will that counts is that of the USA.
I do not believe that Europe exists to pick up the pieces left behind by others; on the contrary, we need our own identity and our own common foreign and security policy!
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe that the war currently raging in Iraq is the USA's private war.
It has too many repercussions for that, not only on the surrounding region, but also on Europe.
This also means that it is otiose to wonder whether it might perhaps have been possible to prevent it.
Saddam Hussein himself could certainly have prevented it, if he had kept to at least one of the seventeen resolutions passed by the UN Security Council.
It would also have been one of his primary duties to give his people, whom he had decimated with weapons of mass destruction, the chance of a decent existence as human beings by ensuring that the sanctions imposed on his country could be lifted.
We can but hope and try to do whatever we can to prevent these innocent people from having to pay a high price for this regime and for the war it has caused.
I can also understand why many people take to the streets in a kind of impotent rage, believing as they do that warfare cannot, in the twenty-first century, be a legitimate political tool.
I can also sympathise with the Catholic Church and the Pope, whose attempts right up to the last moment to prevent armed conflict were, in the final analysis, motivated by concern for the Christian minority in Iraq, and were, alas, rewarded by no more success.
Diplomacy stood not the least chance of success, and all the peacekeeping institutions that arose out of the aftermath of the Second World War - the UN, NATO, the European Union - have sustained damage.
For us Europeans, there is just one question left to be answered, and that is whether we still have the desire to influence the course of world history or whether we want to opt out.
If we are to stay in, the first thing that will be needed is a reshaping of the trans-Atlantic relationship, and the second will be a definition of the fields of action in which the European Union has to assume responsibility in the context of security policy.
This should also determine what resources are allocated to enable such a policy to be actually implemented.
Any policy must in any case be founded upon the common interests of all, and must enable Europe to be one of the poles in a multipolar world.
Mr President, entirely in line with the people of Europe, on 30 January last the European Parliament, with a comfortable majority, declared itself to be against unilateral military action in Iraq.
Such a war, we said, would not be in compliance with either international law or the United National Charter.
An illegal and neo-colonial war is currently underway.
Every day it shows us its real face.
Instead of condemning it and calling on the Security Council to ensure that international peace and regional peace are respected immediately, the European Council of 20 March was unable to agree on anything other than an anodyne declaration.
This declaration said that the United Nations must continue to play a central role during and after the crisis.
The word 'continue' here is doubtless a bad joke which slipped into the text by mistake, because before the crisis the United Nations, as we all know, had been flouted and swept aside by the United States, with the complicity of two Member States of the European Union.
The absence of any formal Commission proposals and the rule of unanimity no doubt explain why the European Council was incapable of looking after the interests of the European Union, and incapable of saying, loudly and clearly, that the interests of the Union are best protected by multilateral action and that the rule of law is always preferable to the law of the strongest power.
President Bush now has the war he always wanted, the war that he decided to wage a long time ago.
As one French newspaper described him, he is in the position of a new-look Doctor Strangelove.
Ample proof has now been provided that some Member States do not want an independent common foreign and security policy.
Well, political Europe will be constructed without them, in the same way as monetary union was.
Mr President, it is quite a few years since the Lisbon targets were established.
Since then, many fine words have been spoken about the significance of the Lisbon process.
The objective was to catch up with the United States economically by 2010.
Unfortunately, this has been mostly a matter of words.
I have still not seen the necessary reforms of the labour market that are a condition for growth and so also for more jobs.
Nor has the equally important liberalisation of, for example, the gas and electricity markets taken place.
Comparison with the United States clearly shows how far we are from achieving the targets set in Lisbon.
In the United States, the economic situation is considered to be very worrying, in spite of the fact that growth is significantly higher in the US than within the EU.
The Americans have made it clear that they will not just sit and watch while the economy deteriorates.
They have responded with deep tax cuts.
That is something which the EU Member States should also do, and as a matter of urgency.
If a country like the United States, with its relatively low taxes, can reduce them further, so too in all likelihood can the EU Member States, throughout which taxes are significantly higher.
An employment strategy was discussed at the European Council, but no such strategy will ever provide increased growth and lower unemployment.
There are no short cuts.
We do not need any more fine words or proud declarations.
Action is what we need.
As long as the EU just talks while the United States takes action, the economic gap will continue to widen, to America's advantage.
The year 2010 will continue to recede ever further into the future.
Mr President, I am of course not speaking on behalf of my colleague Mr Sakellariou, but, as he is unable to speak at the moment, it is my turn!
Let me get to the point and say that I am thinking of Afghanistan.
There, we all joined together in doing our bit in a just cause; we were all glad of the degree of success we achieved in combating terrorism in that country, and there was agreement among ourselves that the people of this earth, be they Muslim or Christian, should not have to be at war with each other.
It was precisely for this reason that we succeeded in Afghanistan, for we were able to make it clear to Muslims that it was side by side with Muslims that terrorists had to be fought.
The situation in Iraq, though, is quite different.
There, we have not yet succeeded in persuading Muslims that a war there is as necessary as it was in Afghanistan, and their scepticism is something I share.
While there really are not yet sufficient reasons for it, this war is - unfortunately - a reality.
My fear is that, this being so, we will, once this war is over, have to deal with the problem of huge differences of outlook between Muslims and Christians.
It is probable that, after the war, much of the work we have been doing for decades will have to be done again.
Where some things are concerned, we will have to begin again from the ground up in order to convince Muslims that Christians do not actually have anything against them.
Unfortunately, though, it will not be possible to get that point across to the Muslims in Iraq.
Mr President, I deplore the war and I deplore the fact that it started without a UN mandate and without having exhausted all the ways of achieving a peaceful solution.
I also, however, deplore the challenging behaviour of Saddam Hussein who has continually managed to ignore the UN resolutions.
Most of all I feel sorry for the victims and regret the human suffering that is without doubt much greater than we can imagine.
Regretting and hoping that the war will soon be over is not all that there remains for us to do, however.
We still have our responsibility for the future.
We must try to alleviate the suffering by immediately making every effort to provide humanitarian aid.
We must strengthen our relationships with Arab countries and give the Mediterranean dialogue a real chance to succeed.
We must invest as much as possible in a definitive peace process in the Middle East.
We must also not forget about repairing transatlantic relationships, whilst enforcing respect for our autonomy.
I hope to find this all in the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow.
Last but not least, however, we must do all we can to eliminate the divisions in the European Union.
Our Member States must use the old, tried-and-trusted European formula and talk to each other, even on matters relating to foreign affairs and security policy.
It is high time all the Member States together took another look at the common foreign and security policy and the defence policy, and the best place for that is the European Convention.
There is a working party there that is actively working on foreign policy, and there is also a working party there that is actively working on defence policy.
The people in the Convention are motivated to talk to each other and to everyone; they are not divided into groups according to the fault lines that the Iraq crisis has exposed.
Let us encourage the Convention to reorganise its powers and its structure in such a way that the political will to cooperate is at least given a chance and encouraged to develop where it is lacking, and let us force the heads of government to sit down together, particularly when things get difficult.
Mr President, I am glad that Commissioner Prodi pointed out the disparity between the financial costs of this war and those available to meet the needs of humanity.
There is something surrealistic - and in fact disgusting - about squandering money on a fully-contrived war and then handing out lucrative contracts to favourite local firms to repair the damage caused by that very war.
(Applause from the left)
I will, however, move on now to the economic part of the Spring Summit, focusing upon two aspects: progress in innovation and enterprise, and environmental protection.
Every Spring Summit seems to me like a non-stop re-run of the Delors White Paper.
That is also somewhat surrealistic.
As far as research and development is concerned, let me be positive.
I am glad that Commissioner Prodi is going to look at the EIB because, frankly, that institution is inefficient and ineffective in aiding those firms which could be innovative and competitive if they just had that helping hand.
Good for him.
As far as environmental protection is concerned, let me highlight intelligent energy, for which I am the rapporteur in this Parliament.
This is a programme that was presented many months late by the Commission - it should have started in January this year.
That is not efficient, and it is most certainly not competitive and dynamic Ã  la Lisbon Declaration.
This programme, I am sad to say, has been cut by the Council.
As rapporteur, I am currently weighing up whether to accept a reduced programme which will actually happen or whether to argue for what should happen.
Let us be clear that we are not matching our words with deeds.
Mr President, we all agree in acknowledging that, if Europe does not speak with one voice, it is a powerless Europe, but also in this debate, it seems that it is hard for the European Parliament to have one single voice.
If we do not want the war to halt the path towards the Constitutional Treaty and towards joint foreign and defence policies, we have to prevent the rift which has divided Europe in recent weeks deepening.
We were in agreement in condemning Saddam's regime; however, we had different opinions on pre-emptive, unilateral war, since mainly innocent victims pay the price for war and since the post-war situation is still completely unclear.
But what is the realistic thing to do now?
We have to avoid making it more difficult for dialogue between old allies who feel the weight of their responsibility for the world's future.
We must participate in providing humanitarian aid, granting the United Nations the central role of the mandate also in the subsequent stage, in reconstructing Iraq.
We must heal the rift between Europeans starting with what unites us.
This is the challenge which the Spring European Council tried to keep sight of and this is why President Prodi also reminded us of the burden of war on Europe's economic revival.
This is the challenge that Parliament too must address.
We must take steps towards peace - starting with peace in the Middle East - and towards the political unity of Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Item E of the Council Conclusions states that the European Union is committed to keeping its leading role in sustainable development, both at home and abroad.
It is therefore perfectly clear to me that what is currently going on in Iraq is in contravention of Item E of the Council Conclusions.
For the war in Iraq is not sustainable; it is bringing suffering and devastation upon the people and is weakening across the board the industrialised countries' position in the global context of sustainable development.
Money is being wasted on it rather than being put into sustainable investment.
In the United States, it has been estimated that the war will cost USD 90 billion in the best-case scenario, and USD 1 000 billion at worst.
We have already gone beyond the best-case scenario, as the war has already gone on longer than the USD 90 billion estimate assumed.
That far exceeds the mere USD 50 billion that all the industrial nations together spend in a year on development cooperation.
In view of this, we can indeed say that money is being wasted rather than being spent in a sustainable way.
Secondly, I get the feeling that sustainable development is being relegated to the bottom of the list even within the European Union.
On the credit side, I acknowledge that reference is made to the promotion of environmental technology and of clean transport, but I do believe that we have to generally press forward with more vigorous ecological renewal of our industrialised society if employment is to be generated and sustainable development advanced, as, without it, both these objectives will remain beyond our reach.
So clear benchmarks are needed for what we want and for the methods that will enable us to monitor it; sustainable development needs clear goals and clear indicators in the same way as employment policy does, for sustainability is not a fig leaf, but a modern garment that would suit the EU well.
Mr President, every spring I have been critical of the fact that we are moving further and further away from the Lisbon objectives, rather than getting closer to them.
My criticisms are directed not so much at the Council - least of all the country that holds the Presidency, Greece - or the Commission.
The main focus of my criticism must be the nation states: the keys to Europe's development are in their hands.
I am quoting a greater voice than my own: The European Round Table of Industrialists, expressing its concern and furthermore issuing a word of warning:
I would like to discuss three things.
Firstly, I noticed that the emphasis at this summit was on industrial policy and entrepreneurship, which I believe to be justified in today's adverse political and economic conditions.
We must place the emphasis on the real economy.
I believe, however, that this should also filter through to other files that were mentioned in the summit conclusions.
This is called 'coherence of policy'.
I would in particular like to mention the takeover directive, the new merger regime and public procurement procedures.
It would also be appropriate to place greater emphasis on the effects these have on the economy.
I would like to invite the Council and the Commission to tell us how they assess these effects.
Secondly, the Council has decided to set up a European employment task force, and in the debate in the plenary session held in preparation for this summit this plan, which was the bright idea of Blair, Chirac and Schroeder, took me by surprise because these self-same governments are making impending concrete policy plans more difficult.
I was referring to the temporary employment directive on which the Council of Ministers has still not taken a common position, even though the directive is a key example of the kind of flexibility and security we must have in the labour market.
It is particularly disappointing that it is taking so long for the position to be taken.
I myself was very surprised that the Council's conclusions are now mentioning December 2003, whereas on 6 March the Council of Ministers was talking about efforts to arrive at a common position by the June session.
I would therefore like clarification on this point.
As far as the task force is concerned, new ideas are always welcome, but it is actions that are most important.
The third point concerns pensions.
The summit brought to a conclusion the first open coordination cycle on pensions.
It is a good thing that a second cycle has been agreed and that the accession countries will also be specifically involved in this one.
I am assuming - and I would also appreciate confirmation of this - that the interim evaluation that was scheduled for 2004 is still in the planning stage, and I would in particular like to see the Commission and the Council put forward concrete proposals to solve the labour mobility problems and fiscal problems surrounding pensions.
Mr President, I do not know whether to comment on the hysterical remarks by some Members of the House, or simply to ignore them. There have been calls for some Western leaders to be brought before the International Criminal Court.
Such statements are sectarian, irresponsible and deny themselves all legitimacy inasmuch as they fail to call for the same treatment to be meted out to Saddam Hussein although he alone is responsible for this crisis.
No single political group or Member of this House has a monopoly over the cause of peace.
I can understand that this cause generates strong emotions.
There are two possible responses to the impotence demonstrated by the European Union. One such response involves behaving in an insulting and dismissive manner, casting blame on each other and perverting the noble cause of peace for particular national interests.
A Member of this House did so referring to the situation in the Basque country.
He failed to ascribe any responsibility for that situation to those who attack freedoms in the area on a daily basis or to those who have been in government there for over 20 years.
The alternative response involves the responsible approach adopted by the Greek Presidency, making a virtue out of a necessity.
The Presidency endeavoured to learn the lessons of this crisis and take a long hard look at the future.
The European Union has actually become an economic power.
It is now a commercial, financial and industrial power.
Unfortunately, however, it does not make its weight felt as it should in the international context. Consequently there is currently no alternative to the transatlantic axis, Mr President, at least regarding security and defence.
This is probably due to our own shortcomings.
Each and every one of us is to blame for the situation.
Mr President, I therefore wish to condemn the cynicism and hypocrisy of many Members of this House.
They talk until they are blue in the face about the need for a common security and defence policy.
When they go back in their constituencies, however, they are incapable of asking their voters to endow that same security and defence policy with the necessary resources. They have failed to understand that a united Europe can be strong whereas a divided Europe is bound to be weak.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, under the present circumstances, reconfirming the Lisbon objectives would appear to be of somewhat secondary importance because we are, of course, all concerned about the war, its huge political consequences and the human tragedy.
I am here to talk about Lisbon, however, and I think that the agreement reached at the Council about common action by the European governments is an important element of political stability with the present split in Europe.
It was important, in these difficult times, for the European governments to express a common political will to continue their efforts in the social field.
It is equally important for these targets to be closely linked to education and research.
This meets the expectations of European citizens, who know full well that we cannot achieve more and better jobs and greater economic growth without education and research.
We will, of course, have to be highly critical when it comes to meeting the targets.
We are seriously behind schedule, as everyone admits, and that should spur us on to even greater effort.
In order to make progress, we need more cooperation on investment programmes in all sectors, including training and lifelong learning which, together with education and research, are communicating vessels.
Education must prove that it knows how to incorporate European culture and sciences, the learning process, in order to produce learned students with job prospects.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe the discrepancy between words and deeds to be a fundamental problem running right through this whole debate.
Let me give a few examples of what I mean.
The Barcelona Summit decided on a study of what are termed the Basle II effects on small and medium-sized enterprises and banks.
To date, it has not been completed.
I take the view that if any study is completed only after the Basle Committee has produced its resolution and after the Commission has decided on a draft directive, it amounts to the squandering of money, to a betrayal of trust and to treating with disdain the resolutions of Parliament and of the Council.
No sooner do we decide on the Stability and Growth Pact, than people question it - some because of Lisbon, some because of the war in Iraq, and others because they lack the courage to reform or because it threatens their comfortable positions.
Rather than ignoring resolutions, we should be implementing them and taking them seriously!
The Lisbon Council resolved unanimously to make Europe, by 2010, the most competitive and knowledge-based continent, a continent fostering social cohesion, promoting sustainability and creating new jobs.
Where is the actual timetable?
Where are the detailed objectives?
Where is the road map?
Where are the specific and verifiable programmes in all the Member States?
Good and ambitious objectives need to be followed up by concrete action, or else we lose credibility.
Let me now turn to Iraq. We are working towards a common foreign, security and defence Policy, but when it comes to the crunch, each does his own thing.
We want to strengthen the UN, but not even the EU's two permanent members of the Security Council are making any effort to find a common approach.
As President Prodi has shown us, we make demands of the Convention, yet we fail to comply with our own codes of conduct.
We have a chance; it is called 'more Europe'.
It is also called 'more United Nations'.
We will find our opportunity if we stop setting national interests against European objectives, what nations do against what Europe resolves, the trans-Atlantic alliance against a self-confident and enlarged European Union.
Let us follow up the summits with the necessary actions, and let us punish with sanctions any breaches of the Treaties for political reasons.
Those who do not take themselves seriously will not be taken seriously by others, and a more serious approach to things will be worth our while.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it has been with much concern that I have followed this debate and the preparation of tomorrow's motions for a resolution.
The fact is that two trains are going to collide head-on here, all because we are arguing about who is slightly more, or slightly less, to blame in this matter.
I too have my own personal views on the subject, but they will not help us to make any progress.
We must not allow our capacity for action to be destroyed now by a dispute about who did what badly three or four weeks ago or six months ago, with this war as the result of it.
We should bear in mind the fact that essential elements are at issue here.
This is about such questions as how we deal with the victims, and how we secure the region's stability, as well as about Europe's capacity for action in the Middle East and about how we, within the Quartet framework, at last bring about sound solutions.
How can we, in this matter, put this failure on Europe's part to good use in order to move the Convention forward, in order to prevent Europe's weakness being the cause of the next such situation, and how do we acquire capacity for action by means of better mechanisms that enable us to unchain the political will that we share?
Thirdly, this is about how we handle trans-Atlantic relations in future, about in what ways we can put them on new and more stable foundations.
How do we gain acceptance for our knowledge that force is not the appropriate way to create a new world order?
In particular, how do we save a multilateral world founded upon compromise and upon mutual respect?
Mr Poettering, the chairman of my group, made reference to Richard Perle.
I do not consider it acceptable for the United States to oblige others to accept its unilateral approach.
The United States cannot decide, alone and on the basis of its own national interests, what is right in this world and what is not.
That approach, which Mr Perle advocates, for example in an article in today's 'Berliner Zeitung', is quite simply unacceptable, for it means that we Europeans have no part whatever in any decisions affecting our vital interests; it means that we are unable to defend our interests, and also prevents us from making any contribution to world peace.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to bow my head and turn my thoughts to the civil and military victims on all sides, and say that I deeply regret all the suffering caused in the opening days of the war.
Let us hope that it will come to a speedy end.
Generally speaking, this conflict brings three thoughts to my mind.
Firstly, how can we learn from our differences, so that the European Union can find itself again at last, and can speak with a united voice in international affairs?
The European Union was built up over time and through various trials.
More often than not, great advances have followed serious crises.
The trial that Europe is currently passing through is not the first and it will certainly not be the last. and we must therefore be optimistic.
The most important thing is to examine and to understand, after the war, the reasons for our present differences.
Are they fundamental reasons?
Are our positions irreversible and irreconcilable? If they are, that will cause serious difficulties in the future.
Is it not more likely that they are merely the result of a lack of consultation and coordination?
It seems to me that it is now a matter of urgency that Europe, without harming its transatlantic partnership, should provide itself with the means of being independent and powerful, and should provide itself with a real common foreign and defence policy.
Independence does not mean breaking alliances.
My second thought is about the future of Iraq.
This time, the United Nations must fully play its part in the reconstruction of Iraq, so that the country can provide itself with a representative government which is willing to live in peace with its neighbours and is capable of playing an active part within the international community.
Reconstruction must be carried out, first and foremost, for the benefit of the Iraqi people who have suffered so much for so many years.
The Iraqis must at last be able to benefit from their country's wealth, which is enormous.
Thirdly, I wonder whether we have the capacity to give an appropriate welcome to the candidate countries next year.
Are we ready?
That is what we should be asking ourselves.
In order to welcome the candidate countries in the best possible circumstances, it seems that three conditions will need to be met.
Firstly, we need to be reconciled on the subject of our values. Why should those not be the values of the old Europe?
Secondly, our institutions, which find it difficult enough to operate when there are only fifteen Member States, need to be changed, and that means that the Convention must complete its work in the best possible conditions.
Thirdly, we have to be able to cope financially.
I have set out the problem, but it is not my job to provide the solution to it.
My most cherished hope is that, after this war and after we have passed through this crisis, the Union, whether it has fifteen or twenty-five Member States, will be independent and finally able to speak with a single voice.
Mr President, there is no split between Europe and the USA, as it is claimed. Instead, the split is between France and Germany, principally, and 19 other pro-US new European governments.
Efforts must now be made to tone down the rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic.
I salute the courage of EU candidate countries who have backed the coalition with specialist forces.
At a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy last week, Britain was accused of being a rogue state headed by a war criminal.
This shows the 'Alice in Wonderland' level the debate has now reached.
By joining forces with Germany in the way it did, France has alienated America, undermined the UN, sent the wrong signals - signals of division - to Baghdad and exposed the impossibility of ever achieving a single foreign and security policy.
Saddam Hussein has attempted illegally to acquire weapons of mass destruction for years.
Regime change is the only way to ensure a disarmed and peaceful Iraq and prevent ongoing brutalisation of its people by the Butcher of Baghdad.
The Allies will install a representative government and must prevent refugees flowing out and instability in the region, as well as facilitating the return of the Iraqi diaspora to rebuild their country in safety.
We must guarantee that its massive oil wealth be used to build prosperity for its peoples, not for arms purchases.
This war is morally and politically justifiable and its legality is vested in current UN Security Council Resolutions 678, 687 and 1441.
However, the appeasers in this House might like to explain why they embraced a war in Kosovo that involved no weapons of mass destruction or threats to neighbouring states and that had no UN authority whatsoever, and yet find it so difficult to take action against a genocidal dictator who has started two wars responsible for the deaths of almost a million people and who has gassed his own people.
We must end this tyranny and free the Iraqi people once and for all.
On the Lisbon Process, I am delighted that the single market and the need for regulatory impact assessments is now back on the agenda.
My party will continue to oppose tax harmonisation.
Nevertheless, in this area in particular, action will speak louder than words.
The debate is closed.
I have received 12 motions for resolutions, 6 on Iraq and 6 on other matters discussed at the European Council, under Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
The next item is the report (A5-0077/2003) by Mr Brok and Mr Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Budgets, containing the European Parliament's recommendations to the Council on the introduction in the draft Accession Treaty of a financial framework.
I must inform the House that the Greek Presidency told the European Parliament some time ago that the President-in-Office of the Council would have to leave for the airport straight after his speech in order to be in Greece this evening ready for tomorrow's meeting of the Council and the representatives of the countries of Latin America.
The Presidency trusts the House will understand.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to use all my speaking time, Commissioner, as this is a matter of public knowledge.
What we are dealing with here is the fact that the wording of Article 32 and the declaration of Annex XV to be primary law mean that the Council is in breach of its Agreement with Parliament.
This has to do with Parliament and the candidates for accession not being dealt with in the same way as the other Member States.
This is quite clearly a legal problem, and it is also a problem in terms of a fundamental issue.
Those of us who sit on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy take an interest in the equal treatment of the candidate countries, but - as Parliament's fundamental rights are involved - we especially support the position of the Committee on Budgets as well, for budgetary law is the prerogative of any Parliament, and must not be set aside even in a situation such as this.
I do not understand the Council.
Although our dialogues made reference to many options and possibilities, which are also contained in the draft resolution on which we will be voting tomorrow, the Council has adopted none of them, even though that would have made it possible for us to come to an understanding by now.
Responsibility for this lies with the Council.
I am perfectly aware that the Greek Presidency of the Council is making every effort to resolve this, so I am not attacking the Presidency; this is more about the conduct of a number of the Member States' governments.
I get the feeling that the government of my own country also has a part in this, and not one about which we can be entirely happy.
I regard it as an unworthy trick to confront ten countries that have made the journey, by way of a great process of transformation, from dictatorship to being invited to join the European Union, with a situation that makes them insecure, and, at the same time, to go about curtailing Parliament's rights, even though it was the advent of democracy that was crucial in overcoming dictatorship.
That the Council should behave in this way leaves me baffled.
Let me ask the Presidency's representatives to inform their colleagues that we will not allow the process of European unification to be wrecked by tax inspectors scrutinising certain aspects of the administration of power.
We know perfectly well that, financially speaking, we cannot push this too far; it would be disproportionate to take excessive advantage of a Budget, for that is not what we are aiming for.
What we are working towards here is a right and a matter of principle.
I think the Council must be able to summon up sufficient creative thought to enable us to resolve this matter, so that the requirements of the law are satisfied and, on 9 April, we in the European Parliament can give the green light to the accession treaties being signed in Athens on 16 April.
Whatever happens, we want that date to be kept to; it is a duty laid upon us by history.
How will it look if, because of disputes about the Budget, we vote on 9 April for a deferment and the Hungarians hold their referendum on 12 April?
Are we to sacrifice the stuff of history for the sake of a financial issue like this one?
So I urge you to get into gear and get a move on once and for all, so that we can come to a speedy decision on this matter and do justice to our historic mission!
Mr President, this Brok-Wynn report has some fundamental statements in it.
The first one, in the first paragraph, is our commitment to making sure that enlargement takes place on 1 May 2004.
Let us be clear: that it is an objective which we all want to reach.
But in achieving that objective, I for one will not see the rights of Parliament sacrificed.
We have a battle going on at present between two institutions as to what Parliament's rights are and what they are not.
Whether the Council respects our rights and our prerogatives remains to be seen.
Paragraphs 3 and 4 spell out some pretty clear pictures.
Paragraph 3 warns the Member States that if Article 32 and Annex XV are maintained in the Accession Treaty in their current form, Parliament will regard this as an infringement of its prerogatives in budgetary matters.
Paragraph 4 goes on to say that the Parliament 'considers the Member States' approach to be a breach of the principle of loyal cooperation between the institutions' and that it 'interprets this approach as a signal that the Council intends to abandon the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Perspective included therein'.
Those are not threats, but statements.
I guarantee you now there will be no IAA if Annex XV goes into the treaties unamended or without any guarantees that Parliament's rights can be maintained.
I now turn to Paragraphs 6 and 7 in the current text of the report.
There will be an amendment from the PPE-DE and PSE Groups to Paragraphs 6 and 7, to remove the figures, to delete Paragraph 7, and to put in a statement which will mention our rights again, because this is what this debate is all about.
Tomorrow we will have a trialogue and, hopefully, we will try to get an agreement on a draft declaration.
If we get that agreement, it would certainly be the minimum that I could accept because what we will be doing is agreeing a declaration on how to violate the Treaty.
That is what we are doing.
We are going to agree on how we can violate the Treaty because of Annex XV.
For many years this Parliament and the Committee on Budgets have fought for the rights and the prerogatives of this institution.
We are not here to sell those rights for 30 pieces of silver.
Even if we can agree figures for category 3 in this declaration, do not take that as a sign of Parliament selling itself just for a small amount of money.
I do not intend to be known as the Chairman of the Budgets Committee who sold out those rights for such a small amount of money.
My job as Chairman is to make sure that the rights and privileges that we fought for over so many years are maintained, and I intend to do that.
I make it clear now, and I said it in the Budgets Committee, that if Annex XV is maintained in its current form and if we have no guarantees about our rights I will vote against the Accession Treaty documents.
I may be the only person in this room to do so but I will certainly vote against because I feel that strongly about it.
If we get an agreement in the trialogue tomorrow, we can all celebrate.
There will be something to be cheerful about.
If we do not get an agreement, I should like to point out to the Greek Presidency that if there is another trialogue next week, it can certainly be held in Athens because two of us from that body will be there next week.
We can have the trialogue in Athens and try again.
If, at the end of the day, we cannot get an agreement - and this is the important point - I have no doubt that this House will not delay the vote on 9 April.
The loyalty of this House, as Elmar Brok has said, is to get enlargement in place.
But I will tell you one thing, colleagues: you will not have an interinstitutional agreement and war will have been declared as far as the budget goes for 2004.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Wynn, who respectively chair the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Budgets, have highlighted a very important aspect of the enlargement process in their reports, namely the financial perspectives of enlargement.
On the question of the adjustment of the financial perspectives in order to take account of enlargement, I can assure you that the Greek Presidency, and I am delighted that the speakers acknowledged this, demonstrated that it had the political will to resolve the problem which arose with Parliament right from the start.
And, as President-in-Office, I can assure you once again that the adjustment of the financial perspectives will be exercised in full application of Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
I should also like to make clear that no one in the Council disputes Parliament's prerogatives in budgetary matters laid down in the Treaty or the perspectives in the Interinstitutional Agreement.
I should like to inform the House, with regard to the question of the adjustment of the financial perspectives, that Mrs Schreyer gave an initial presentation of the Commission proposal on budgetary matters in Athens on 20 February.
The Presidency asked for this item to be retabled at the tripartite dialogue scheduled to be held in Brussels on 27 March, tomorrow in fact, with a view to settling the matter.
We know, and I personally know, that this is an important and complicated problem.
We understand the sensitivities of the European Parliament and, in accordance with our programme, when this tripartite dialogue is held tomorrow, I should like to be optimistic that an agreement will be found and that the good cooperation between the budgetary authorities achieved over a number of years under the budgetary procedure will continue.
As, therefore, there will be negotiations on the matter tomorrow, I would rather say no more today.
However, I do want to assure you once again that the Presidency and the Council have the political will to settle the matter.
In conclusion, therefore, may I say that I trust that the obstacles to a positive vote by the European Parliament on 9 April will be removed and that we shall have the pleasure of witnessing the signing, on 16 April, in the presence of the President of the European Parliament in Athens, at this historic moment for the European Union.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is approaching a very great event.
The most ambitious enlargement in its history is within our grasp.
This brings to its conclusion a work process lasting many years, and, in Copenhagen, the candidate countries and the Member States were able to come to a good result even on financial issues, which are always tricky.
The financial perspective now has to be adapted to enlargement, and the procedure for this was decided on, as long ago as 1999, in the Interinstitutional Agreement, which states in very clear terms that this decision is to be taken jointly by the Council and Parliament on a proposal from the Commission.
For Parliament now to say that a deal is a deal is of course to the point.
The Commission very much regrets the present conflict between the institutions, and I do not want to conceal the fact that the Commission advised the Council to take a different course.
The Commission had advised the Council to make explicit reference to the Interinstitutional Agreement, and particularly to Article 25.
In the present situation, the time for finding negotiated solutions is running out.
The last few days have seen all the parties engaging in dialogue in great depth in order to resolve the issues.
It has to be borne in mind that the draft Treaties have now been finalised by the Member States, and also by the candidate countries.
The search for a solution to the present difficulty has led the Commission to concentrate on the second way referred to in Mr Wynn's and Mr Brok's joint resolution.
That Parliament should highlight two alternatives is seen by the Commission as a clear expression of Parliament's constructive attitude.
The Commission proposal for adapting the financial perspective to enlargement was submitted as long ago as the beginning of this year.
It is made on the basis of Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
Should both parts of the budgetary authority so desire it, the Commission is now prepared to submit forthwith a proposal for the revision of the financial perspective.
This would be done on the basis of Part C of the Interinstitutional Agreement, and the proposal could contain an increase in the upper limit for Heading 3, that is, of the budget for internal policies.
This would indeed be in the spirit of enlargement, as it would create additional financial facilities for helping the enlarged Union to grow closer together.
Whilst I believe that we are on the right track, I have to tell you, honourable Members, that tomorrow's Budget trialogue - which we should take seriously - is doomed to be a success.
The procedures and deadlines leave us, in practical terms, no other choice.
We should make every effort to resolve this issue before the treaties are signed and before Parliament's resolution, so that, in time for 9 April, the financial perspective can be adapted to enlargement.
I am convinced that all the parties are aware of their great responsibility and will make it possible for us to do what history requires of us.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you may be quite sure that the European Parliament will play its part with all the power at its disposal and with great commitment - a commitment shared by all the groups and by all the committees that are particularly concerned with Heading III, because it involves over thirty codecision procedures that will be affected by these decisions.
Being conscious of the political responsibility involved in ensuring that the timetable for enlargement is kept to, we have also indicated our willingness to adapt the financial perspective, and to do so if possible before the enlargement agreements are put to the vote.
It is quite clear, though, that you can take it as read, in view of the manifest legal problems that we have to work through at present, and of the opinions and interpretations with which experts have provided us, that we will do everything possible to save and defend Parliament's rights within the institutional structure.
No decision will be taken here on the basis of an exchange of rights for money.
In tomorrow's trialogue, the Council has the choice of doing a deal with us or accepting responsibility for the legal, institutional and budgetary problems that the coming months and years will bring.
It is obvious that, despite all their efforts, the Commission and the Council have underestimated the institutional dead-end into which their stubborn refusal to let go of Annex XV and its integration into primary law have led us all.
This is not just about Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, but about the many statements that were constantly being made on the basis of last November's agreement, and about common statements arising from many codecision procedures on the multiannual programmes, which repeatedly declared that adjustment of the financial perspective would, at this point in time, be carried out on a joint basis.
Mr President, please permit me another reference to Heading VII.
It is important to me that we hold fast to the de facto impossibility of carrying out a revision by transferring the aid programme for Turkey from Heading IV to Heading VII and then leaving everything in Heading VII just as it is.
We therefore still regard adaptation of Heading VII as a precondition.
This is about pre-accession aid, but also about special and privileged partnerships with the European Union's neighbours.
It is with this in mind that we will, tomorrow, try to negotiate constructively and find a way on which we can agree.
Mr President, in the course of the last few months I have had the privilege, on a number of occasions, to declare to this Parliament that the Group of the Party of European Socialists strongly supports the accession of 10 new Member States to the EU on 1 May 2004.
Over the past few weeks our group has actively supported all the preparatory work to enable the European Parliament to give its assent to the accession treaties with all of the ten future Member States.
We sincerely want the official signature of the Accession Treaty to take place on 16 April in Athens.
On every occasion I have emphasised the importance of this enlargement process for the further development of the EU and its contribution to the strengthening of democratic structures.
It may, therefore, come as something of a surprise to people that today I have to declare that a delay in the final stages of the enlargement process cannot be completely excluded.
This is not because we do not want these countries to enter, it is not because we are dissatisfied with the negotiations, and it is most certainly not because we have found some bureaucratic institutional or technical arguments to reconsider our previous commitments to the enlargement process.
The European Parliament's rights of decision on the budget, including the long-term financial perspectives, are among its most fundamental rights.
A limitation of those rights by a sole decision of the European Council must be regarded as a serious attempt to limit the democratic foundations and the democratic functioning of the European Union.
The Council's decision to include, as part of the treaties - for the first time ever - the negotiation results in the final aspects of accession must be considered as a serious limitation of Parliament's budget rights.
Our colleagues in the future Member States must be aware that this attempt to limit one of Parliament's most fundamental rights is unacceptable, particularly at the moment when the European Convention is considering a further democratisation of European institutions.
We consider it as a joint objective.
For those who are already Members, as well as for those who soon will become Members, Parliament's rights will be strengthened as a result of the enlargement process and not weakened.
Not only do we care about Parliament having those rights, but we believe Parliament should be able to use those rights.
That is why we believe that the financial framework resulting from the negotiations must be considered as a minimum amount, not a maximum amount.
Our group does not want to block enlargement.
We do not want to delay enlargement.
We have a joint objective to make a success of this process.
Strengthening, not weakening the European Parliament's rights must be part of that success.
We are convinced that the future MEPs from the new Member States will support our demands.
I am sure that the Council will find a solution to this unnecessary conflict, but it must fully respect Parliament's budget rights so that we can ensure that the final stage in the enlargement process will proceed without any delays.
Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party strongly supports the accession to the European Union of the candidate countries and the swift handling of the Accession Treaties.
My group, however, is very sceptical as to whether the good levels of cooperation that have existed up till now between the Council and Parliament in budgetary policy can continue.
When the Copenhagen Summit approved the Accession Treaties for the new Member States it also endorsed the necessary financial framework.
There were no discussions at all with the European Parliament with regard to this financial framework, so it cannot be binding on Parliament.
Parliament's budgetary authority is defined in Article 272 of the EC Treaty.
Now that the Council is to include the financial framework in the Accession Treaties, it is to become EU primary law. That would be a restriction of Parliament's budgetary authority beyond that contained in the EC Treaty.
This is a clear infringement of the EC Treaty and Parliament's competence.
In future Parliament's competence would be determined under the EC Treaty, which would apply to the old Member States, and by the Accession Treaties, which would apply to the new Member States.
The situation must be considered a mess on the part of the Council.
We doubt in particular whether we can even discuss the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary policy and its review.
Parliament obviously just has to exercise the competence bestowed on it by the EC Treaty fully, as the Council does not respect interinstitutional cooperation.
Mr President, I wish first of all to congratulate Terence Wynn and Elmar Brok on their initiative of tabling this motion for a resolution, which is unquestionably of the utmost importance and extremely timely.
I have already expressed my agreement with this line of action in the exchange of opinions held on the matter in the Conference of Committee Presidents.
I now express this agreement once again - with the particular gratitude and commitment of myself and my group - with the clear and rigorous way in which the motion tabled has addressed this matter.
Indeed, we cannot easily accept the way in which the Council position clearly relegates the powers of the European Parliament to second place and clearly limits these powers, in patent breach of the Treaties and of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary matters.
Nor can we remain indifferent to the fact that the principle of the equality of Member States and the rule of budgetary unity are being trampled on.
Even less can we accept that sums that should not even be considered as the minimum necessary for implementing enlargement should be set as maximum allocations.
I shall not dwell on this issue of the sums earmarked for enlargement, since our position on the matter is already common knowledge, but it is nevertheless worth underlining that, if anything can be emphasised with regard to the position adopted in the motion for a resolution on increasing appropriations for category III of the financial perspective, it is the terms laid down and the obvious clear-headedness of the approach to the matter.
I do not think that the European Parliament can go further than it does in the motion for a resolution.
This is obviously not the time to call enlargement and the timetables planned for its implementation into question.
It is crucial, however, at least at this final stage of the process, to ensure a minimum of objectivity, transparency, and respect for the candidate countries and that an end is put to the tight-fisted policy of providing limited means, which has dogged the enlargement process from the very beginning.
It is also crucial, in our opinion, and for this very reason, that a rigorous and firm position of the European Parliament does not collapse at the first sign of rejection or of limited agreement by the Council, which, incidentally, must fully assume its responsibilities for the potential consequences of its unacceptable attitude, which is in clear breach of norms and practices that have been agreed and signed.
Mr President, I am still not quite clear as to whether the problems we are having are caused by an enormous blunder on the part of the Council or whether this is part of a clever strategy.
Either way, neither of the two options is particularly attractive; let us suppose that the Council just stupidly forgot that the Interinstitutional Agreement in Article 25 specifies that the Council and Parliament must take decisions on changes to the financial perspectives on account of enlargement together.
Let us suppose that it simply did not know that ignoring this article violates the agreement on loyal cooperation between the Council and Parliament and therefore blows it out of the water.
The problem we are then faced with is that the understanding of Parliament's role and its budget rights has apparently not filtered through into all layers and the fabric of the Council.
It is a blessing in disguise, however, that this problem is easy to solve, because once it realises that, the Council can simply obtain the amounts from the Treaties.
It is, however, more likely that the Council was perfectly well aware of this all along but was gambling on the fact that Parliament would not demand its rights, since delaying the ratification of the enlargement is a nuclear option for which very few Members of Parliament would be keen to take responsibility.
Parliament is not, however, prepared to proceed to the agenda without further ado, and so the Council is now willing to negotiate on texts; however, these texts will not make the problem go away because the Council wants to keep the amounts in the Treaties unchanged, which in fact violates Parliament's rights.
Yet it is prepared to state that this resolution leaves Parliament's rights intact.
What nonsense is this?
I agree with Mr Wynn; I can only conclude from this that the Council is offering to ignore the Treaties in future, a kind of Dutch toleration policy.
Drugs are banned under criminal law, but the government and parliament have agreed to tolerate their use.
And that is how it will be in the Treaties. The amounts will be prescribed but in practice things will turn out differently if the Council and Parliament agree to that.
I would, however, now like to ask my fellow Members how likely it is that the Council will comply with such a statement loyally and in good faith by 2006.
I do not have much faith in that.
Anyway, my group regards this action as an infringement of the Interinstitutional Agreement, and we will therefore not hesitate, if necessary, to make full use of our rights under Article 272 in the next Budget procedure.
Although the Dutch policy of tolerance is at least pragmatic, this proposal by the Council is also completely absurd in practice, since it is impossible to govern with amounts written in stone.
Supposing there were to be an accident at a nuclear power station, such as that at Temelin in the Czech Republic?
Would we first have to have a Treaty Amendment with ratification before we could earmark additional funds?
I think that even the Council would have to admit that it would not like to suffer a self-inflicted injury.
Mr President, the accession of an unprecedented number of new Member States looks likely to bring with it an unprecedented conflict between the Council and Parliament.
A balance of powers between the institutions is essential for the stability of cooperation within the EU.
What the Copenhagen Summit laid down in Annex 15 concerning the financial perspectives for accession countries affects the budgetary right of this Parliament as established in Article 272 of the Treaty.
The Council and Parliament are the two arms of the budget authority and must respect each other in that.
That is why we also have the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999.
Unilateral establishment of financial perspectives is incompatible with this, even if it were understandable in the light of the situation on conclusion of the accession negotiations.
We do not have a hidden agenda in this matter.
We do not want to jeopardise the Interinstitutional Agreement; still less do we want to jeopardise the signing of the accession treaties.
Nevertheless it seems as if the Council is in fact doing this by undermining the budget right, which is one of Parliament's essential prerogatives.
The Presidency has informed us that it has not managed to remove Annex 15 as it is about impending primary legislation.
So Article 272 of the Treaty, the budget right, is valid primary legislation.
As both arms of the budget authority have to agree every year, it is now important that they reach out to each other, preferably tomorrow, but in any event within the next two weeks.
If we do not succeed with an EU of Fifteen, we are putting the EU of Twenty-five at risk.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while there is a real war raging, we shall not run the risk of having an inter-institutional war.
I believe that the Council, which is well represented by the Greek Presidency, is measuring the amount of unanimity which is emerging from the speeches of representatives of political groups within Parliament, so as to be able to say where it is absolutely necessary to adjust its aim.
Parliament must defend its prerogatives, and it is right to do so.
The Commission, for its part, must defend the spirit and the letter of the Treaties.
All this is part of our agreements and of straightforward cooperation between institutions.
One can understand the political reasons which led the Council, in Copenhagen, to adopt a certain number of measures.
However, that must not be done at the expense of the integrity of the prerogatives of the institutions, starting with Parliament.
I therefore appeal sincerely to the Greek Presidency, and I am sure that it will listen to me when I ask it to do everything in its power to ensure that we find our way out of this impasse, so that the Athens ceremony does indeed take place and so that it is not, as it were, obscured by a conflict which would otherwise run the risk of calling into question either the enlargement - and no one here wants that - or the spirit of the inter-institutional agreements that exist between us.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Council representatives, at this stage of the debate I do not imagine a single Member of this House is unaware that the inclusion of Annex XV is most unfortunate. It is unfortunate in a legal sense because it calls into question specific rights of the European Parliament.
It is unfortunate in a political sense because it poses a serious threat to the reputation of this House, of the Council itself and of the Commission as guardian of the Treaties. Indeed, it puts the whole enlargement process at risk.
This unfortunate situation impacts us all. I should point out that it is particularly painful to those of us who have long argued in favour of the usefulness and validity of an interinstitutional agreement providing credibility and stability for the Union's financial framework.
In our innocence we believed the interinstitutional agreement was binding on all parties. Much to our dismay, however, we now find it only seems to be binding on certain Council officials when it suits them.
My group is of the opinion that such delicate implementation calls for a stable and permanent financial framework, recognised by all.
It was not necessary to include the Annex in the Treaty. Confidence in the interinstitutional agreement would have sufficed, but you lacked that confidence, gentlemen of the Council.
A fresh negotiating proposal is on the table. This proposal finally provides for Annex XV to be included in the Treaty of Accession, albeit only because you are unable to turn the clock back and retrieve this unfortunate situation, gentlemen.
You are nevertheless in a position to prevent further damage and accept the proposal our representatives will take to the tripartite dialogue tomorrow.
If you fail to do so and bring rigidity and intransigence to bear on what is currently only an unfortunate situation, the scene will be set for something worse. Then the interinstitutional agreement some of us believe in almost blindly could become the collateral victim and suffer the most damage.
I could give a louder warning but it would be hard to give a clearer one.
Mr President, I never thought I would be driven to make the speech you are about to hear.
You and I are but two of the many who suffered long years of dictatorship. We all wholeheartedly supported the idea of the reunification of Europe and the creation of a democratic Europe once the countries in the other half of the continent achieved democracy.
In this regard, we were well pleased with the outcome of the Brussels and Copenhagen Summits.
The results might not have been remarkable, but the conclusions were acceptable and took account of the balance between the institutions. Then the text of this draft Treaty suddenly appeared.
I should emphasise that the Treaty has not yet been signed and therefore everything is still open to amendment.
This includes the deletion of Annex XV we have heard so much about.
The reason is that it contains fixed budget items, together with guidelines on agricultural spending.
In other words, it amounts to suspending the European Parliament's rights up to 2007 in some cases and up to 2013 in others. This is inconceivable.
We seem to have fallen down a black hole and be back in 1970. I find it quite intolerable.
The book entitled Allegro ma non troppo by Carlo M. Cipolla comes to mind. It deals with the basic laws of human stupidity.
I should make it clear this is not intended as a personal reference to our friend on the Council. A stupid person is defined as someone who causes damage to another person or a group of people without any advantage accruing to himself or herself, or even with some resultant self-damage.
That is exactly what happened here. A text was introduced in an attempt to harm Parliament.
The result was to damage the enlargement process and introduce unexpected hurdles when we all believed a solution was within our grasp. An unprecedented dispute then arose because precedents were ignored.
There is no Annex XV in the Treaty for the previous enlargement involving Sweden, Finland and Austria. It is a new invention and that is really why the difficulty emerged.
Ladies and gentlemen, as other honourable Members have made clear, Parliament is committed to enlargement on 1 May 2004. We are not in any way committed to a celebration on 16 April in the shadow of the Acropolis, however, though we would like to be part of it.
We hope to be there, but we cannot accept the creation of different classes of Member States.
We cannot accept restrictions on the competence of the European Parliament either.
We would therefore like to make it quite clear that we are concerned about competence, not about money. Ladies and gentlemen, we will not sell Parliament's birthright for a mess of pottage.
Mr President, I too find it sad, as well as quite unnecessary, that we should have this dispute about the budget.
It is hard to understand why the Council should disregard Parliament's powers and not implement the revision of the multiannual budgetary agreements, or financial perspectives, as might otherwise have been anticipated and as was done in the case of previous enlargements.
Parliament has certainly shown great understanding for the fact that the difficult negotiations concerning the new Member States' portion of the budget for agriculture and for the Structural Funds are not to be reopened, but we have indicated that what is required must be examined under the heading of internal policy, or expenditure category 3, for there are a number of problems and, if we do not adjust the budget in the next few years, high-priority areas such as the social dialogue, internal security, training, police cooperation and the creation of a secure working environment could suffer as a result, and we should be unable to fulfil our political priorities.
Allow me to give an example.
Many ordinary people fear that enlargement will mean competition from the new Member States in the shape of businesses that do not care two hoots about the working environment.
The new Member States must of course implement EU legislation on the working environment, but what really counts is what is happening out there among businesses.
There is a need to change the culture and to bring about greater awareness, both among businesses and employees, of the need for a secure working environment, and that is something we can do through our agency in Bilbao and by way of the social dialogue.
What it requires, however, is an adjustment of the budget, partly because the pre-accession aid in the shape of the Phare programme will dry up as from the end of this year, so the work will in actual fact come to nothing if we do not take action.
The Council must respect Parliament's powers, Article 272 of the Treaty and the Interinstitutional Agreement. Anything else would be unacceptable and a declaration of war.
Mr President, I must admit I was astounded by the polemic launched by the European Parliament against Annex XV to the Accession Treaty, which is accused of violating both the inter-institutional agreement of 6 May 1999 and at the same time the rights of this House, by fixing ceilings for additional spending linked to the arrival of new Member States for the period 2004 to 2006.
Admittedly the normal budgetary procedure for the Europe of fifteen, in which Parliament has the right of codecision, was not followed.
However, was it actually relevant, since we are now talking about a future Europe consisting of twenty-five members?
Finally, will the decision not be taken in a much more solemn and legitimate manner by the Treaty itself?
If Parliament's powers had been cut in favour of a ministerial committee, an obscure committee, I could understand its protests.
In this case, however, it is the people who will take the decision.
How can the European Parliament protest when it is the people who are deciding on a question for themselves?
Once again we see the effects of Parliament's navel-gazing and of its perpetual struggle to increase its privileges, which make it lose sight of both the undeniably greater legitimacy of the people and the fact that it is in everyone's interests that the process of enlargement should advance smoothly.
Mr President, in order to avoid potential misunderstandings, I too want to emphasise that I am in favour of enlargement, by which I mean enlargement as soon as possible.
The states that want to join us have undertaken a great endeavour, but the resolutions passed by the European Heads of State and of Government in Copenhagen have needlessly created a grave and extremely difficult situation.
Their decision puts them in breach of all the Treaties currently in force and of budgetary law, Parliament's most important prerogative.
The Council's actions could be read as a denunciation of the Interinstitutional Agreement in accordance with Article 26.
With the serious issues within the European Union relating to enlargement having to be resolved and resolution of those relating to the Treaty of Nice still a long way off, that this should happen is the Council's crowning failure!
It baffles me that such a thing is possible when the Council and the Commission have so much expertise at their disposal, unless the intention is to openly provoke Parliament.
As we all want enlargement, we are faced with the problem of retrospective damage limitation.
When I see, though, how the Council treats treaties and the European Parliament, I have the gravest concerns about what is coming next.
Transparency, democratisation, integration and cooperation are empty words if you do the very opposite.
At the moment, I do not trust them.
As the resolution of this difficult problem will be the subject of ongoing negotiations between Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission even after this decision is adopted, Parliament would be well advised to keep an open mind on all the options for dealing with the accession treaties in April.
As I know from personal conversations with them, many Members of this House very much doubt - just as I do - whether, under such conditions, they should give them their approval.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
The next item is the joint debate on the Reform of Staff Regulations:
Report (A5-0069/2003) by Mr Malcolm Harbour and Mr Manuel Medina Ortega, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending the Staff Regulations of officials and the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the European Communities (COM(2002) 213 - C5-0262/2002 - 2002/0100(CNS))
Oral question (O-0019/2003 - B5-0087/2003) to the Commission on the reform of staff regulations.
Mr President, I am very pleased to be opening the debate.
I am drawn to speak before my co-rapporteur merely by reason of being first in the alphabet and not of seniority in this Parliament.
First of all, I very much enjoyed working on the report with Manuel Medina.
I first became engaged in the whole project of the human resources reform in the Commission at the end of 1999 when I was first appointed provisional rapporteur - and subsequently confirmed as rapporteur - for Parliament on the overall strategy.
For me, tonight will hopefully be the major culmination of the process.
I do not believe we will have further debates like this - I see the Commissioner is enthusiastically agreeing with me.
That does not mean to say, however, that this Parliament will not be continuing to take a keen interest in the whole process of the reforms because the regulations themselves have to provide the right framework in which the reforms are carried out.
I also wish to thank colleagues here tonight from the various committees involved.
We may not have accepted all their proposals but I want to assure them that we have considered everything very thoroughly indeed and we want to thank them for their contribution and for working with us.
The report we have put before you tonight, colleagues, contains 55 proposed amendments to the regulation package.
That may sound like a lot, but when you look at the size and complexity of this package you will see that we have actually concentrated on improving and clarifying the basic provisions of the regulations.
There is one important new principle which I will come to later, but the real point I want to make to colleagues tonight is that our role has been to check methodically that the regulations deliver the reforms that you supported strongly when I presented my report to this House in 2001.
That has been the central part of our task.
It has not been our task to attempt a re-negotiation of fundamental parts of the package.
The Commissioner has spent enough time and has had enough trouble dealing with that process.
Our job has been to look at the politics and the strategy.
You will see that we are basically satisfied that this framework of Staff Regulations will deliver the core parts of the reform: the move to a personnel system where members of staff in all the European institutions will be properly compensated, will be able to exploit their talents and encouraged to progress their careers in a system that rewards their efforts.
That has meant a new grading structure and a new appraisal system.
They are absolutely crucial and we have not sought in any way to alter that part of the process.
In these reforms across the institutions we also introduce a new category of contract staff.
Again, that is an area we have not sought to change.
In the areas we have looked at, we have done so very much in consultation with other institutions, because it is important to understand that these regulations apply all across the European institutions.
Part of our job as the rapporteur team has been to consult staff and executives in other institutions to make sure their needs are fully catered for.
We are proposing more flexibility where institutions want to use it in the grading structure, particularly to retain staff with linguistic duties and specific positions where institutions feel that contract staff may not be appropriate.
Tonight I should like to point out specifically the important task of Parliamentary ushers.
What about the new principles?
My colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, will say more about this, but the major new point of principle is to propose to you that the existing pension system in today's world ought to be simplified by removing the current weighting system that is based on a pensioner's final place of residence.
In contemporary society and with more mobility we really ought to be contemplating a simpler, less bureaucratic system.
We are not at all convinced that the present system can be fully justified in today's world.
I know there are a lot of discussions going on about the pension system at the moment and the Commissioner may, indeed, refer to that later.
I want to conclude by referring to the politics of the current situation going forward.
We are very conscious, in this House, that the Commissioner is engaged in a major negotiation with Council.
We are only here as an advisory Chamber, but colleagues expect us to press the Parliament's point of view as far as we possibly can.
We are following the negotiations in Council very closely and we know that pension issues are very important there.
We will be recommending to colleagues in the House tomorrow that they approve all the amendments, but that we should withhold our vote on the final legislative resolution until such time as we are satisfied that the Commissioner has achieved all he is setting out to achieve.
Also, with the oral question that we have tabled for the House tonight, we are asking the Commissioner to come back to this House with the results of the final proposal so that we can ensure he delivers what we are all looking for: the optimum framework to carry the European institutions forward in this current century with an optimum personnel policy for the independent and quality staff we are looking for across the institutions.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Harbour for his kind words.
I think we have worked together to the very best of our abilities in producing this report.
We come from different countries, from different political backgrounds and have different sensibilities. This allowed us to approach the issue with a certain degree of impartiality.
The work done by Commissioner Kinnock gave us a starting point. His work included a number of fairly well-balanced proposals seeking to make administration more flexible, to encourage the appointment of good staff and promotion on the basis of merits and qualifications.
It was a good basis on which to build.
As rapporteurs, we had the opportunity to interview staff representatives and representatives of the institutions. We found the Commission had done good work.
In my opinion, this is a good and well thought-out package. It could fully meet the needs of European Union civil servants.
I would like to draw the attention of the House to the quality of the work of the civil servants of the European Union.
At present, we have 25 000 civil servants who administer a substantial budget on behalf of a Community of 15 countries and a population of 380 million people.
The European Union has significantly fewer civil servants than a large city would have, even though the EU budget is probably considerably larger.
I feel the European Union civil servants do a sterling job.
I do not want to introduce any regulations that would prejudice them or create situations that would lead to labour disputes.
Like Mr Harbour, I would like to draw your attention to certain statements made by the Council that appear to seek a penny-pinching cutback in the pension plan, in complete contradiction to proposals forwarded to us by the Commission.
That said, I believe the amendments Mr Harbour referred to are reasonable and necessary.
He made special mention of the correction coefficients amendment.
It makes no sense that when staff retire from working for a European Union institution, they can choose to live in any country, but the value of their pension depends on what country they chose to live in.
Like any other administration, the European Union must pay all civil servants the same level of pension. It must allow civil servants to be able to select the country they wish to live in permanently.
They may wish to live in a cooler place, a hotter place, somewhere cheaper or somewhere more expensive. We must however ensure they have a free choice.
I would also like to mention another clause I feel is quite important. The staff regulations contained an anachronistic rule, similar to an ecclesiastical nihil obstat.
This rule stipulated that civil servants could not publish a piece of work without the approval of their superiors. In my opinion, we now live in a society which is sufficiently free and civil servants are sufficiently responsible for this rule to be dispensed with.
Civil servants understand what they can write. If they were to publish something that damaged the institutions, we would be able to assess whether it was against the law or merely comments they were free to make.
We should not introduce preventative censure measures.
Furthermore, I think it would be impossible to implement them. I cannot see Commission civil servants reading the works of more junior members of staff dealing with subjects as banal as the structure of the Commission or the structure of the European Parliament.
The report also includes proposals to modify the regulations for people of a different sexual orientation, namely gay men and lesbians.
We have sought to prevent civil servants of a different sexual orientation from being denied cohabitation benefits because of their sexual orientation and as a consequence of very strict legal criteria. To this end, we have endeavoured to find a flexible formula.
Mr President, I believe the proposals we have put forward are balanced. I believe Parliament should have no difficulty in approving them.
I think both the Commission and the Council should recognise that they represent Parliament's wish to collaborate. I therefore hope that the Council in particular will approve the package, taking account of the amendments we propose.
Thank you for your attention, Mr President. I trust that tomorrow's comments on the subject of the oral question will help to clarify the situation with regard to this threat to the pension plan for European Union civil servants.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteurs for their splendid report. I do this in all sincerity and not just because it is my duty to do so.
They have managed to achieve a wide consensus on a subject that is clearly onerous, difficult and complex. I would also like to thank the committee for the effort they have made in negotiations and in reaching an understanding that has resulted in this positive outcome.
My fellow Member Mr Corbett, who was the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has been kind enough to let me speak in his place. This shows the extent to which members of this committee worked in harmony with each other: a member of one particular group is prepared to allow a member of another group to replace him.
We all understood that the task was to amend the Commission's proposal in order to make it more effective. The two rapporteurs have just explained some of these amendments.
I would like to refer to one of these amendments which I believe to be very important for Parliament and for the other European institutions.
The amendment distinguishes between an institution supporting decisions regarding staff and the decisions themselves. The latter have to be made by each of the institutions.
As for the elimination of correction coefficients for pensions, I agree with what the two rapporteurs said.
I would like to make one further comment. Those who have made equal contributions during their working life as civil servants have the right to equal pensions when they retire.
Mr President, this is how the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has contributed to the report.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of the report. We are convinced it represents an improvement on the Commission's proposal and that it will make the already excellent European civil service even more dynamic and efficient.
Indeed, this is the aim of the reforms. I would like to echo the previous speaker's praise of the civil service.
It is ready to incorporate the know-how of civil servants from the ten countries who will become members of the European Union next month. In this process of reunification, the European Union will practically double in size and its population will increase by a third.
A large number of new civil servants from different cultures will have to be incorporated into the complex system and its administrative procedures. The new civil servants will need to assimilate to the culture of the European civil service.
I think therefore we were right not to introduce a radical reform but rather a gradual one.
This reform allows the most antiquated concepts to be eliminated. At the same time, it allows new civil servants to benefit from the wealth of experience of current civil servants who have served the European Union for many years.
These are the staff who have ensured that the European Union is more than a mere alliance or a group of countries. They have ensured that the Union has brought peace to many and a whole host of benefits to its citizens.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists I should like to express my satisfaction with the work that has been carried out by our committees, and in particular by the rapporteurs, Mr Harbour and Mr Medina Ortega.
Thanks to this work, the draft regulations drawn up by you, Commissioner, now constitute, together with the amendments which I hope you will accept, a balanced whole which should give the staff of our institutions regulations which bring together both tradition and modernity.
Tradition is important, because we are very attached to the idea of preserving the great principles of a civil service which is independent of lobbies or other influences, a civil service which is competent and is recruited through objective and rigorous competitions, and a civil service which has rights and duties that are absolutely clear.
We are also in favour of modernity, however.
After more than thirty years of good and loyal service, the staff regulations for the European Civil Service were in need of serious reform.
Having said that, every innovation has to be assessed in the light of the objectives being sought.
For example, the use of a new category of staff, namely contract staff, however useful it may be, must not lead to the abuse of this formula, because that would run the risk of weakening recruitment conditions and would undermine the workings of our institutions.
Moreover, although we can congratulate ourselves on the equilibrium that we have succeeded in reaching, it is still important that the Council should not disrupt this fragile equilibrium.
My concern follows the Council's reactions, in particular, to two important questions which are marginal to the regulations but which the Council wants to add to them in order to make an overall package.
These two questions are, on the one hand, the multi-annual salary adaptation method and, on the other hand, and most important, the pension scheme.
On this last point we are rather concerned, Commissioner, because we are seeing the Council link the adoption of the regulations to the adoption of a new pension scheme, whereas you yourself have not yet said anything precise about pensions, and we know how explosive this issue is.
This is why several groups, including ours, have tabled an oral question about pensions, so that you can give us the information that we need before we give the definitive green light to the reform of the staff regulations.
Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to join the House on this debate on the report on the staff regulations, not only because it is always an honour to speak in this House but also because when there has been a very extended period of consideration and so many meetings, a certain family feeling develops.
I am very pleased, therefore, to join so many friends tonight who have been my partners in discussion for what seems like an extremely long time.
It was, however, a very worthwhile experience.
I should like to start by expressing my very deep gratitude to the rapporteurs, Mr Harbour and Mr Medina Ortega for their very thorough, thoughtful and constructive work on this important issue of the reform of the staff regulations.
I also pay tribute to the intensive efforts undertaken by the other members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and to the opinion-giving committees and their draftspersons.
Very substantial work has been done in this House by everyone concerned.
I know that the staff of the institutions will recognise the fact that serious and committed attention has been given by Parliament to their statute, their employment conditions and their future.
I think it will assist the House if I begin by referring to the issues raised in the oral question tabled by four political groups in the House.
I was naturally going to highlight several pension issues in my statement this evening.
I therefore welcome the questions because they give me the first opportunity since last Wednesday's General Affairs Council to focus explicitly and publicly on those matters.
Responding to the question may mean that I take a little more time than was originally anticipated.
I hope that in a good cause you will bear with me.
To help to ensure clarity I should like to ask the House to refer to the draft guidelines that were adopted without change as the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 18-19 March 2003.
That document has been circulated.
I regret that it is only in French and English at this juncture.
If honourable Members look at Paragraph B of those conclusions they will see that the Council instructed Coreper to prepare a more detailed position, 'on the issue of adaptation of the pension system'.
If Members then turn to Paragraph D, they will see that the Council called on the Commission to 'table by April 2003 a detailed, technical working document setting out a proposal to guarantee actuarial balance as from 1 January 2004'.
Examination of those paragraphs will show that the only request to the Commission was for a proposal for the methodology for a study which would then facilitate calculation of the contributions required to ensure actuarial balance in the pension system.
Therefore there was no request to the Commission to submit, in the words of the question, a detailed document that includes a change in the pension scheme.
Obviously, the Commission will not be producing such a document at any stage.
We have never produced such a document and we are not going to do it now.
Achieving and maintaining an actuarial balance is clearly a somewhat different issue.
As honourable Members will know, this has always been the obligation under the present Article 83(4) of the Staff Regulations, even though the requirement has not been made consistently operational.
The Commission's proposal on modernisation of the staff regulations has always, therefore, included a commitment to ensure actuarial balance.
Of course, the issue was discussed and negotiated in detail with the trade unions and in the interinstitutional staff regulations committee well before the Commission proposal went to the Council and came to this House last year.
So, there is nothing new about the Commission's commitment to secure actuarial balance.
There is nothing that has not been fully debated and assessed.
There is nothing that was not made known and made clear to Parliament and the members of the EU civil service and their staff representatives.
All that the reference in the General Affairs Council conclusions relates to is the need for an up-to-date actuarial study that will enable the Council and the EU civil service to know, well before 1 January 2004, exactly what the contribution rates by Member States and by staff will be.
Meanwhile, the instruction to Coreper in the General Affairs Council conclusions is to provide a more detailed position on adaptation of the pension system that, in the words of the conclusions, is more consistent with the trends prevailing in Member States.
That in itself is not surprising since it is obvious that demographic changes, the Lisbon strategy and indeed the policy approach of the Commission and of this House to so-called 'active ageing' will always ensure that Member State governments give attention to issues of retirement and pensions.
That reality has in fact ensured that several Member State delegations have put forward a paper on pension parameters for the European Union civil service, and it is being considered by the Council.
Our response has been to point out that whilst we recognise the need to ensure consistency with the social and economic policy on employment and ageing which we, in the Commission, advocate, we also emphatically require proper account to be taken of some basic facts about the employment age profile of the European Union civil service, which are of great relevance to any consideration of pension parameters.
Those facts are, in brief: first that that average starting age of employment in the EU civil service is 32 years and 34 years for policy grade officials.
Any calculations that made a full pension dependant on more than 35 years of employment and payments would consequently be entirely unrealistic.
Second, there is the fact that, as your rapporteurs point out, whilst the official pensionable age in the EU civil service is relatively low at 60 years, the average real retirement age of 63.1 years is about three years later than the average retirement age in Member States and one year later than in the Member State with the highest average retirement age.
In many respects therefore, we are implementing a core policy of the Lisbon Strategy and we have been doing so for several decades.
Against that background and in the context of actuarial balance, the Commission has, in the course of negotiations, indicated some willingness to consider a degree of possible modification of the formal pensionable age.
I should like to emphasise that there has been absolutely no conclusion of any kind on that point, or indeed on the other points.
In this and in all other matters we have strongly emphasised the need to ensure that the acquired rights and legitimate expectations of present staff are properly respected.
That clearly manifests our position.
It answers the first question in the oral question.
For reasons of emphasis I repeat that any discussion of any potential changes would have to fulfil that requirement on acquired rights and legitimate expectations.
Increased understanding of those facts induced the Council to ask Coreper to go away and, as the conclusions of the Council show, prepare a more detailed position by the April General Affairs Council.
In addition and to complete the picture, the GAC conclusions include Paragraph C that proposes further discussions on the weightings that are currently applied to EU civil service pensions in different Member States.
I know that there are a number of amendments before the House relating to these weightings.
The issue is a source of general concern in this House and indeed in the Council.
Since we are in negotiations, the Commission can only say at this juncture that we hear those concerns and while we may not support the amendments that have so far been offered, we are aware of the need to deal with this matter within the overall balance of the negotiated final package.
I reiterate that in this context, as well as in the wider spheres of reform, the Commission will at all times actively seek to uphold the accumulated rights and legitimate expectations of current staff.
That is a principle that we uphold and it is one that is understood by Member States.
I also emphasise that we are conducting the negotiations on the basis of the fundamental principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.
Any decision on any issue would be subject to reaching an agreement that is mutually satisfactory in overall terms.
I would add that we are engaged in complex and sometimes necessarily delicate negotiations; we are not engaged in polemical exchanges.
We have confidence in the strength and the realism of our arguments and of our arithmetic.
We will continue to strive to ensure that our partners in negotiation in the Council will accept both the arguments and the arithmetic.
That, obviously, is our sustained and unchanging objective.
I regret that I have had to take time to give a detailed response on the important question put by honourable Members.
I think you will understand that I wanted to give full answers to the questions on this important issue of pensions.
I warmly welcome the fact that the report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market before this House for debate reiterates strong support, as we have heard from the rapporteurs, for the overall reform package and does so in serious, practical terms.
In particular I welcome the realistic commitment to the importance of maintaining competitive levels of pay and pensions; a commitment to the introduction of what has become known in shorthand as a promotion guarantee on a collective basis - and I emphasise a collective basis; and a commitment to the inclusion in the staff regulations of 'the method' as the rational, economical and stable means for adjusting pay and pensions.
Moreover, I am pleased to say that the guidelines adopted by the General Affairs Council of 18-19 March 2003 echo many of the principles stated by Messrs Harbour and Medina Ortega in their explanatory statement and they are equally reflected in numerous amendments before us today.
In particular, the guidelines in the Council conclusions - Paragraphs E, F and G respectively - express support for the broad pay and allowances proposals as a good basis, support the transitional arrangements for the new career system and express an openness towards the inclusion, on a finite basis, of the 'the method' in the Staff Regulations.
In response to the amendments, I will first list the many that the Commission can readily support.
Indeed, I will summarise them because I do not want to test the patience of the House.
Amendments Nos 7, 8, 9 and 48 on the strengthening of interinstitutional cooperation; Amendment No 20 on whistleblowing, Amendments Nos 12 and 14; Amendment No 13 on the opening of the assistant 1 to assistant 3 career bracket for specific duties including the duties of parliamentary ushers; Amendments Nos 9, 25, 48, 50 and 51 tabled by the rapporteurs relating to the status of the staff of the political groups - this means of course that the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 32 and 60 which go well beyond the position set out wisely by the rapporteurs; Amendment No 17 on sexual harassment, we can accept; Amendment No 18, Amendment No 19, Amendments Nos 33, 34 and 35 on staff absences; Amendments Nos 42, 43 and 44 on disciplinary procedures; Amendment No 38 on the duration of the membership of the joint advisory committee for professional incompetence - that does not mean that it is in favour of incompetence, of course - it should be the joint advisory committee on professional incompetence.
There is second group of amendments on which the Commission is prepared to maintain an open mind during negotiations on the overall package or to accept some of the amendments, at least in part.
The Commission cannot at this juncture give a positive response to amendments on weighted pensions.
However, as I said, we are of course conscious of the widespread political concerns relating to pension coefficients and of the need to deal with the matter within the overall balance of the total package.
The Commission is prepared to accept Amendments Nos 52 and 54 on the limitation of levels of function of contract agents and on the duration of those contracts; Amendments Nos 14, 15, 26, 29 and 30 relate to central provisions in the context of a new career system, Article 5(3) on the criteria for appointments to the administrator and assistant function groups; Article 31 on the organisation of competitions for higher grades, including middle management grades, and Article 45 on the certification procedure for transfers from assistant to administrative function groups.
All of these Articles have, I am glad to say, been subject to intense discussions in Council and Coreper.
The compromises reached as recently as last week will be seen to reflect many, if not all, of the objectives aimed at by Members of this House in their amendments.
Article 31 now allows for the organisation of competitions, for instance, at administrator grades 9, 10, 11 or, on an exceptional basis, 12.
Remembering that administrator grade 12 will correspond to a higher level than today's grade A4, the total number of candidates appointed to vacant posts at these grades will not exceed 20% of the total number of the appointments by external recruitment to the administrator function group in any one year.
That compromise goes further than the outcome sought, for example, by Amendment No 26.
On the certification procedure, Article 45a now makes provision, in Paragraph 2, for the European Personnel Selection Office to determine the contents of all examinations organised by the institutions in order to ensure that the basic requirements of a transfer are met in a harmonised and consistent manner.
That should make Amendment No 30 redundant.
On Amendments Nos 58 and 59 on Members' assistants, this House knows the Commission has been and always will be very aware and sympathetic to the concerns about this issue in Parliament.
Honourable Members will however be aware that of course several Member States do not share our joint enthusiasm and there is much work to be done independently of the negotiations on the staff statute.
On Amendments Nos 71 to 74 inclusive, on the recruitment of third country nationals with a permanent right of residence, the Commission is aware that there is a discussion amongst political groups about the possibility of finding a compromise arrangement on this issue which is of concern to many honourable Members.
While sympathetic, the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments as they are currently formulated and therefore I have to reserve my position on this question for the time being.
Finally, and I am grateful for the patience of the House, there are inevitably some amendments which the Commission cannot accept because they would tend to detract from the overall proposal.
I will just pick a few, by no means an exhaustive list, but I must say it is outweighed by the number of amendments that we are readily accepting.
We cannot accept Amendment No 16, Amendments Nos 14, 15, 26, 29, 30 and 75 - for the reason that I mentioned earlier, i.e. that they are unnecessary because of positive developments in Council on these questions; Amendments Nos 53, 55 and 76 on contract agents - because, as I said earlier, the Commission supports Amendments Nos 52 and 54 from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market; Amendment No 32 on the extension of Article 50 to administrator grade 12 - we do not think that would be appropriate; Amendment No 63 on sexual harassment where the Commission supports the text put by the rapporteurs in Amendment No 17, and finally Amendment No 64 on the expatriation allowance, for the very direct reason that the Commission retains the view that the allowance for staff who are expatriate workers is objectively justified and indeed objectively necessary.
As the House knows, we have from the outset been committed to providing reforms in the Staff Regulations which would facilitate radical modernisation whilst upholding the current conditions of employment and improving the career development of members of the European Union civil service.
The reasons for that are, I hope, recognised to be practical and justified and not insular or conservative.
There is a direct connection between reform, motivation and necessary material security.
It is both realistic and relevant to acknowledge and to provide for that.
This very substantial report from honourable Members recognises that practical reality and is a significant step towards the fulfilment of our commitments.
I warmly thank all who have been engaged in the compilation of Parliament's view and I very much look forward to the adoption of the report in the House tomorrow morning.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like previous speakers, I should like to thank all those who have spoken on this subject, a subject we have debated on many occasions.
I also share Commissioner Kinnock's opinion that we have become used to working together and that very special links have been created.
I am speaking now, however, as the spokesperson for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets and, as such, I welcome the Commission's assurances regarding the cost of reforming the staff regulations of the European Civil Service.
If the working hypotheses are confirmed, the reform as a whole will be of limited cost to the Union's budget and it ought, in any case, to be possible to finance it in the context of the current financial perspective.
This is absolutely essential and I should therefore like to give Commissioner Kinnock full marks on this point.
This initial finding leads me to make a few additional comments, however.
First of all, insofar as the reform package negotiated with the unions observes the principle of rigour, it seems to me that there is no need for the Council to demand that rights acquired by civil servants in relation to pensions should suddenly be called into question.
The need to make savings on pensions is not urgent, and if the Council really wants to find ways of making savings, it should quite simply and quickly approve our proposals regarding the staff regulations of our parliamentary assistants.
Secondly, we think that pensions should not be a taboo subject.
Improvements are possible and it seems to me, for example, that there is no longer any case for continuing to use the correction coefficients.
I would also have liked to see mechanisms put in place to ensure the long-term viability of the current pensions system, precisely because we must protect civil servants' interests.
This cannot be done, however, without acting gradually, over a period of time, and above all in a spirit of consultation and dialogue.
Thirdly, and finally, on a broader level we must not lose sight of the objectives of this reform, which led us to encourage reform in general and the reform of the staff regulations in particular.
It is - and always should be - a question of improving the efficaciency and the performance of the European institutions in the service of the Union.
It is in the light of those objectives that we shall evaluate the appropriateness of each measure and judge the success of the reform.
Mr President, the European Commission, whatever may be said to the contrary, is a fact of political life and has a burgeoning public sector in which its rapidly developing separate administration is the prime factor.
And although this administration is expanding continually and taking on new duties, the necessary adjustments have not yet been made.
Its staffing regulations are in need of reform now more than ever if we are to successfully modernise its personnel policy.
We all know that technological progress has invalidated traditional staffing structures, as the private sector realised some time ago.
We likewise know that the European Union is promoting a series of policies, such as measures to improve employment standards, combat discrimination, reconcile working and family life and introduce flexible employment.
It would be strange if it failed to incorporate all the policies which it promotes for European society and European businesses in its own bureaucratic mechanism and if it failed to set an example for a new public administration standard.
Time is short and I should therefore like to focus in my speech on three amendments.
The first concerns the adoption of an amendment introducing a weighting into pension calculations, regardless of the pensioner's place of residence.
The Commission proposal to introduce a weighting to adjust pensions to the purchasing power in the pensioner's place of residence runs counter to the Community principle of equality and the right of free establishment.
I support the amendment by our group to secure a climate of peace within the institutions' administrative services.
It is important to emphasise that, in the new working world which is emerging, safeguarding mutual trust on all sides is the key to increasing productivity.
Finally, I think that we should vote in favour of adopting the amendment by our group changing contracts of fixed duration to contracts of indefinite duration where five-year contracts are renewed for a further five years.
I think that this, in conjunction with recruitment of contractual agents, will allow us to achieve flexibility with the required degree of protection.
Mr President, like everybody else, I too would like to pay tribute to our two rapporteurs for their cross-party working.
Indeed, I must say that when Mr Kinnock referred to a family reunion I feel like something of an interloper.
We wanted to ensure that the ELDR voice was heard tonight, heard to congratulate our rapporteurs and the Commissioner and to say that we very much support the work that is being done in this reform process.
It is a recognition that we are moving towards a modern civil service for Europe and a proper career structure for those who work in it.
There perhaps has to be a certain irony that we, as legislators, spend much of our time demanding change and modernisation of those we legislate for.
