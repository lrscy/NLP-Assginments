These concepts are not a threat, but the key to economic prosperity.
My experience is that those in our new Member States have felt rather offended at the unwillingness to give the labour force from the new countries freedom of movement from the beginning.
Indeed, even those countries that, like my own, are, from day one, opening the borders to workers from the new Member States have introduced monitoring of the labour market and restrictions on access to social benefits.
My Baltic and Polish friends wonder what kind of opinion we have of them.
I have to admit, moreover, that delight at the fall of the Berlin Wall and EU enlargement has turned too quickly into anxiety about the changes that may follow in their wake.
We have forgotten too quickly that many people from the new Member States did in fact leave behind rich and secure lives in the West in order to travel back to economic uncertainty and develop their countries.
Too often, we forget our experience of previous enlargements involving poorer countries, which have of course produced good results.
Moreover, we attach too little importance to the many advantages we may derive from sharing the workload among us.
Rapid economic growth and the dynamic in the new Member States will act as a breath of fresh air for the economies of the old Member States.
We must help to create that growth, partly through grants from the regional funds for developing the countriesâ internal structures.
EU aid of up to four per cent of gross domestic product per year is a large amount for the new Member States, but a modest amount for the existing ones.
There is some justification for putting a question mark over whether it will be at all possible to use the large transfers at the rate we should like to do.
These are matters we shall work on: simpler administration and greater opportunities for having the money used as intended.
We must be ambitious and pin more of our hopes on training and research so that we develop the new Europe in accordance with the guidelines and objectives laid down in the Lisbon process.
As the Commissioner pointed out, we must also do a lot of work on developing the social dialogue.
It will be a difficult task, but I believe that, if we support, for example, the work being done through the agencies in Bilbao, Thessaloniki and Dublin, we shall have a good opportunity to take this process forward.
Â Â  â Madam President, we all rejoice in welcoming the peoples of the ten new Member States of the European Union.
Enlargement brings the hope of peace, cooperation and valuable exchanges between peoples.
Nevertheless, we must not deceive ourselves about the problems that confront us.
In the countries that have just joined us, average gross domestic product per capita is equal to only 45% of the average in the Fifteen.
In order to be considered, these countries have had to drastically restructure their economies.
They were required to implement the liberal model, introducing market mechanisms with competition as their sole model, which was to the detriment of a social policy founded on solidarity and economic cooperation.
At no time was the Commission willing to take into account the grave economic and social consequences of this headlong rush.
The Europe that these countries have joined is, however, beset by crises.
The Lisbon strategy, launched in 2000 with the aim of securing full employment and a very high level of competitiveness, has failed to achieve that.
For the first time in ten years, the Commission has admitted that employment is falling and, like the Council, is worrying about how serious the movement towards de-industrialisation is.
It has enacted one directive after another, opening up postal services, energy and air and rail transport to competition, while refusing to carry out any sort of serious review of how this might affect jobs, the environment and prices.
At the Barcelona European Council, the Heads of State or Government decided by common agreement to defer the retirement age, but there is, all the same, an unsustainable contradiction between trumpeting the priority to be given to jobs and speeding up the introduction of more flexible working practices, cutting wage costs while allowing gigantic industrial mergers and restructuring to go ahead.
Imprisoned by the thinking of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability Pact, the Council and the Commission are refusing to face up to their consequences.
This adds up to a heavy burden for the peoples.
We are a long way from the objectives of the Treaty of Rome and its avowed intention to promote improved living and working conditions for the workforce, enabling them to have equal access to progress.
The struggle for jobs and against social exclusion, for better purchasing power and working conditions, to maintain and extend the rights of businessesâ workers, must become the European Unionâs first practical priority, although defence and the improvement of public services must not be forgotten.
This will require a profound change in the EUâs economic and monetary policies, which are guided solely by the demands of the financial markets and rules of competition that stifle any industrial strategy.
The objectives of the European Central Bank must be redrafted to include job-creating investments and industrial projects.
Giving the European project a new direction will mean abandoning dogmatism and accepting the need to reflect on other options and discuss them.
No employment strategy can be crowned with success unless workers really are given the power to intervene to suspend planned redundancies, and to halt the mergers in progress.
Any merger agreement must include social clauses.
There must be penalties for failure to abide by directives on the consultation of workers.
Finally, Madam President, Europe, as a source of hope, calls out for that which is best in each people to be shared and pooled.
The intervention of workers and citizens will be indispensable in building tomorrowâs Europe.
That is the Europe we are to build.
What my group has done over the past five years has been a demanding labour, and many of the fields are still open.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the euphoria that has erupted in this House, which I also detect among the leading European politicians, is understandable, but I do, of course, ask myself if the people feel such enthusiasm too.
Without a doubt, Europe is an unprecedented success story, and I will just mention the key words âpeacekeepingâ and a âplace of tradeâ.
Europe evolved as an economic area and, above all, in the hope of creating peaceful cooperation in Europe after 50 years of war.
Today we face what may be our next major challenge, in that we are in a position where we are too small as individual nations to be able to position ourselves in a globalised world, but we become strong enough when we come together.
All that will, however, only count if we are capable of creating an awareness of Europe in the minds of 450 million Europeans, and this Parliament, too, is called upon to do so.
I doubt that it is there at the moment and we will see how big the turnout is in the European elections.
We need a constitution, we need a common foreign policy, but the Europe of the regions too must not be lost as a value.
As a Community of shared values we must, of course, export values as well as goods.
Only when we, in Europe, are capable of winning back the leading role in the fields in which we were strong, above all, in the area of knowledge, will we have the credibility to also export values such as overall quality of life, peacekeeping and sustainability as a basis for responsible policies.
During recent decades, though, we have encouraged people to be aware of what they are entitled to, and this will not help Europe grow; at best, it will increase unemployment, poverty and corruption.
This is why I believe that we as individuals, the regions, the Member States and the EU as a whole, must have higher expectations of ourselves; not of the Community, the State or the EU, but rather each part should have higher expectations of itself.
This is because what matters is not just stressing what we have achieved, but instead focusing, above all, on what we intend to do, which is a good deal more.
That alone that will make us strong.
Â Â  Looking at the half emptybenches one can conclude that many of us are still under the influence of the exciting events of enlargement, but work must continue.
The greatest round of enlargement to have taken place in the European Unionâs history has provoked extensive debates about the need to reform the European Union, with the most significant manifestation of these efforts being the preparation and discussion of the draft European Union Constitution.
There is less thought and talk as to how the socio-economic effects of European Union enlargement can be turned into a success for the fifteen-member European Union, as well as the New States.
The European Union has been joined by countries with fundamentally different levels of economic, and consequently also social, development.
This means that enlargement demands a new understanding of ways to ensure the socio-economic growth of the European Union.
I will remind you that the common market of the European Union was created with the aim of promoting the competitiveness of its members and is based on four fundamental freedoms.
Almost all the 15 Member States of the European Union, excepting the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden, the latter with an admirable parliamentary vote against what the government was offering, have introduced a transitional period for the free movement of workers from the new Member States.
Shortly before the time when the basis for the remaining three came into force, there were ever more forceful voices talking about tax dumping, unfair tax competition, speaking about the need for tax harmonisation, even though the European Convention had recently rejected this idea.
There are fears about the possible movement of capital towards the new Member States, to be followed by a possible transfer of jobs in an eastward direction.
Economists will never cease debating the right level of taxation.
As far as I know, up to now only Austria has reacted appropriately to the possible flight of jobs, by planning to lower its corporate tax level.
Ireland's taxation policy has made it especially attractive to investment from multinational companies (as an example).
In my opinion the decisions by Sweden, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Austria show a healthy approach to the challenges presented by European Union enlargement.
Only in this way will the expansion of the European Union unleash unique opportunities for the unification of Europe and more quickly resolve the stresses of domestic policy in the Member States.
We must look at things realistically â the support for the New States from the European Union's common funds, which I value very highly, no matter how well targeted and endowed with no matter how much of a multiplying effect, is insufficient to rapidly overcome the existing socio-economic differences between the existing Member States.
The enlargement of the European Union ...
Â Â  Madam President, when, between 10 and 13 June, European Parliament elections are held in the 25 Member States, a dream will come true.
According to the opinion-formers, these elections will pass judgment on the policies of governments in office, rather than on those of the European Parliament.
It is evident that no direct connection is made between the situation in the Member States and the policies we adopt here.
In the run-up to the elections, there is a website in the Netherlands entitled âgeenwoorden.nlâ.
Rather than words, after all, the voter wants to see action and find out whether the parties and MEPs have delivered on their election promises.
The citizen is entitled to a government which honours its promises and which translates good intentions into proper policy.
If I extend this parallel to the Commission, it appears that today's declaration is once again full of good intentions and wishes, and once again I cannot shake off the impression that these will not be taken any further.
Over the past months, I have, at various times during debates on economic policy, drawn attention to the stranded Lisbon process.
This process is well and truly stuck because the Member States are waiting for each other to implement the measures.
The Member States are themselves responsible for implementation, and you will appreciate that with 25 Member States, a few countries should take the lead.
We in this House do not need to sit back and watch passively; we can define the Lisbon objectives in our resolutions more effectively.
We will then attain achievable objectives, and you will see that achievable objectives can be implemented.
It is high time we focused on European socio-economic policy.
The Member States should implement that policy and we must monitor the implementation of the agreements reached.
In that way, the elections may not be about settling scores, but instead about giving a mandate.
Â Â  Madam President, Members of this House have been entrusted with a great responsibility.
We are responsible for the citizens of the European Union, for their prosperity and their welfare.
Entry into the European Union on equal terms is an expression of historical justice.
These were the words of the Holy Father John Paul II, the supreme authority in this world. Robert Schuman, a great statesman and patriot, shared these views.
They inspired the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community and the EEC.
The aim was to create peace in Europe and in the world, as well as prosperity for the people.
What, though, is the reality?
There exists a bipolar Europe: a Europe of the rich, and a Europe of the poor.
A different outlook on the economy is required.
We must immediately move away from the worst versions of neoliberal policy and globalisation.
The solution is not a free-market economy, but a social market economy in keeping with the social teachings of various religious groupings.
It is wrong for a countryâs population to be divided into a small group of rich citizens and a large group of poor ones.
We are opposed to wealth creation at the expense of the poor.
We advocate involving the rich in assisting the poor.
We must commit to the economic development of all of Europe through the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and job creation.
Only then shall we effectively eradicate poverty and unemployment, the plagues of the twentieth century.
Only then shall we take the economic lead over the USA and Asian countries such as China and Japan.
We should have no reservations about working jointly with Russia and Ukraine.
Poland entered the Union on demeaning, unequal terms.
The Polish negotiators are to blame for this.
They proclaimed a great success, while the truth is different.
Production is decreasing.
Production quotas and production limits are putting us back by 24 years in the production of tobacco, for example.
The figure for sheep farming is 35 years.
For milk production it is 52Â years, and for steel production 34.
We shall call those responsible to account in the future and make them take responsibility for their actions.
From a country exporting foodstuffs and steel, Poland has become an importer.
Self-Defence is calling for renegotiation of the Association Agreement.
The only way to eradicate poverty and unemployment is to exploit the productive capacity of our industry and agriculture to the full.
The European Union must return to the highest values.
It must put the individual, the family, work, and a dignified life first
in order not to lead to social revolution.
The alter anti-globalists are right.
Having first dealt with extremism, we must work together to find a way out of this situation.
The European Union and Poland both need Self-Defence.
Â Â  â Mr Lepper, I have to cut off your microphone.
I very much regret that.
Let me remind you that speakers who do not have the speaking time that they would wish may submit in writing the speech they would have liked to give.
This document will be made available to them to publicise as a speech made in the plenary session of the European Parliament.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, fellow Europeans, a little more than 20 years ago, the European Parliament passed a declaration that condemned the occupation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union and demanded our freedom.
Today, we are at last all together in this room as free nations and free European citizens, to decide jointly the future of our continent.
I am deeply moved that, in this historic session of the European Parliament, the first plenary session since enlargement, I have the opportunity to speak to you in my mother tongue.
Enforced divisions are thus at an end; Europe is one again.
Presumably it is this historical perspective that enables new Member States to see the European Union, not just as a common market, but as something more: a common home based on common values and perceptions.
Today there is no longer an old Europe and a new Europe; just one Europe â our common home.
It is for this reason that here and today we must ask, not, âWhat can Europe do for us?â but, âWhat can we do for Europe?â
This is even more important in the light of the fact that Europeâs economic and social situation cannot be considered to be rosy.
We must face up to facts.
Europeâs development has slowed significantly during the last decade.
Although the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy are in every way correct, we have to admit that, following its adoption, the gap in competitiveness between Europe and the United States has widened rather than narrowed.
With this in mind, some have mockingly alluded to the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchevâs promise to overtake America in ten years, which ended in his country falling even further behind.
I do not want the same fate to befall the Lisbon Strategy.
To ensure this, the new European Commission, together with the Parliament, must act decisively to find the means to force the governments of the Member States that have reacted coolly to the reforms to implement them.
I very much hope that the European Unionâs enlargement will also add impetus to this process.
Yes, the GDP of the new Member States is lower than that of the older ones.
Nevertheless, contrary to the view of the earlier speaker, I do not believe that we have joined the European Union in order to live comfortably for the next century from the support coming from wealthier Member States.
Such an attitude would be immoral and ruinous for both Europe and ourselves.
Estonia cannot look only to financial gain in Europe.
Our aim must be clear: to achieve as rapidly as possible â in the case of my homeland, Estonia, I believe that time to be at least 15 years â a standard of living such that we no longer need assistance from wealthier European countries.
In order to achieve that goal, we have to maintain our high growth rate and liberal economy and not take the route of tax harmonisation, which would be disastrous for Europe.
I also hope that the accusations levelled at new Member States will not be repeated, since only by growing rapidly and by developing tax competition throughout Europe can we make the whole of Europe more competitive.
Â Â  Mr President, I am delighted to have the honour of taking the floor for the first time during a plenary session of the European Parliament now that Poland is a member of the European Union.
Being among the best is ennobling.
At the present, Poland has an economic growth rate of 6%.
Membership of the European Community gives us the chance to consolidate this growth and to accelerate development.
Pursuant to the Lisbon Strategy, the European Union, is aiming to become the strongest and most competitive economy in the world by 2010.
I believe the Union will achieve this aim.
Nonetheless, economic competitiveness and the laws of the free market are not sufficient to ensure social progress.
What is necessary is sustainable development combining economic effectiveness with the principles of social justice and environmental protection.
The individual should be the subject of all economic processes, and the markets must serve the people, not vice-versa.
This approach will ensure all citizens benefit from the results of European integration.
It will lead to the creation of a society without barriers or divisions.
Sustainable development of the countries of the European Union also involves the development of its regions and the consolidation of local government.
Priority must be given to the allocation of funds from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to investments creating new jobs, and to investment in education, science and new technologies.
I believe that promoting economic competitiveness while respecting the principles of sustainable development will help to improve quality of life for all Europeans.
This is, after all, the goal of our common endeavour.
We can achieve far more if we work together.
Â Â  â Mr President, the fact that we are able to talk today in terms of a European economic and social model is something we owe above all to the self-employed and to microfirms.
Six years ago, in 1997, Eurostatâs figures told us that the Europe of the Fifteen was home to 18Â 802Â 423 businesses, 18Â million of which were microfirms.
Of these 18Â million, half consisted of one person working alone, whilst the other half â some 8.5-9Â million â consisted of businesses employing between one and nine persons.
It follows that the importance of these microfirms must be borne in mind by those who will be legislating for the Europe of the future, and all the more so on a day when we are celebrating enlargement by the accession of new Member States.
Legislation must be adapted to them, must take account of their specific characteristics, of the small size of such microfirms and we must, each and every one of us, consider these self-employed workers, these members of the liberal professions, these traders, these artisans, artists, and farmers as all being brave people, who maintain Europeâs human face through the personal services that they provide, and that is important in an increasingly globalised and ever more high-tech Europe.
I also invite all those who will be sharing in the drafting of future European legislation to adapt it to the specific needs of small enterprises whose energies must be devoted to productivity.
Let every one of them bear in mind that no business started out big and that todayâs start-ups are destined to be the medium-sized and big businesses of tomorrow.
It is economic wealth that makes it possible for this Europe that is so dear to us to provide a high standard of social protection.
It is thus that we will have successful businesses and also be able to guarantee the social Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, those of us in Parliament, and in European society, who want a political Europe and who welcome the new Member States, those who want a Constitution that will take the EU forward as a political entity that is united in its diversity are in the vast majority.
Let us learn from this historic experience, which is unique in the world today, on a continent that, as recently as last century, suffered unspeakably tragic events.
Stateless nations, such as mine, Galicia, are still not recognised as such in the draft Constitution.
Given that what we want is a political Europe, a Europe of the peoples and the citizens, we shall continue to struggle for such recognition and for self-determination within the EU.
Whilst we want a political Europe, Mr President, it must be said that this will not exist without a social Europe, which must be made a reality as a matter of urgency, by integrating our fellow peoples that have a per capita income of less than 40% of that in the Union of the Fifteen.
Against this backdrop, it is paradoxical and irresponsible that the richest States, which claim that they want a political Europe, are attempting to impose a reduced European Union budget as low as 1% of Gross National Income.
This is despite the fact that, with enlargement, the number of inhabitants of regions eligible for Objective 1 (whose income is less than 75% of the average per capita) is set to double; to put it more clearly, this figure is set to jump from 63Â million people at present to 153Â million in the coming years.
Similarly, nothing will be resolved if the budget is limited to the 1.14% proposed by the Commission.
If we continue this way, we will not be moving towards a social Europe.
Funding per capita for Objective 1 regions will be halved, thereby blocking a cohesion policy that has benefited and defined the entire Union.
This will have a negative effect on both the Union of the Fifteen and on the enlarged Union of Twenty-Seven.
Â Â  Mr President, enlargement of the European Union finally took place a few days ago.
Enlargement poses new challenges with respect to how the Union should operate and how joint decisions on its future should be taken.
Speaking as a representative of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, and also as a Pole, I would like to make it quite clear that I am a strong advocate of the concept of a Europe of the nations.
Such a Europe would draw strength from the diversity and richness of all its regions.
It would be a Europe of solidarity.
There is no doubt that one of the most urgent challenges facing the Community is work on eradication of the economic differences that arose within our continent as a result of the settlements at the Yalta conference.
These settlements were imposed on Poland by force.
We therefore now have every moral right to demand substantial support for development.
Currently, the standard of living in all the Polish voivodships falls below 75% of the European Union average.
Some of them barely reach 35% of the Union average.
The Swietokrzyskie voivodship is one such example.
This means the Unionâs policy of aid for poorer regions must be one of the most important issues in the coming years.
In the course of the debate on the European Unionâs budget it should become clear whether the old Member States are prepared to give priority to the principle of solidarity over and above their immediate local economic interests.
I have the honour to address the European Parliament today on behalf of the Malopolskie and Swietokrzyskie District.
I am delighted to be instrumental in ensuring that its voice can be heard in this House, where all the nations of Europe are represented.
The south of Poland is famous for being thrifty and hard-working.
I am therefore convinced that the people of our region will cope and succeed in the new European Union.
Our success, however, the success of these two areas, will require solidarity from you, the representatives of the richer part of Europe.
We need help to develop our infrastructure.
The south of Poland must have better communication links with the rest of Europe.
We need support for the sound and painless restructuring of our agriculture.
Finally, we need programmes enabling the young people of the Malopolskie and Swietokrzyskie voivodships to take full advantage of educational opportunities in the enlarged European Union.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to invite you to Krakow, one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and the capital of our region.
Its glorious history, architecture, and the remarkable character of its people create a unique atmosphere.
Millions of foreign visitors come and enjoy it every year.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a joy and an honour for me to appear in the European Parliament as one of the representatives of the Slovak Republic and also to thank all of you who have been instrumental in enlarging the European Union.
From an economic point of view, however, the new Member States became part of the European Union long before 1 May 2004.
In 1990, shortly after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the end of the Cold War, the countries of the âEastern blocâ had a balance of trade surplus with the advanced Western countries of some USD 10 billion.
Over the subsequent years, this indicator was turned totally upside down and, in 2002, the countries of the former Eastern bloc had a balance of trade deficit with the advanced Western countries of around USD 40 billion.
This occurred because the advanced Western countries took advantage of their superior competitive position to break into the markets opening up in the eastern countries with an annual increase in their economic potential of about USD 50 billion.
This factor was one of the sources for economic growth in the advanced Western countries in the 1990s.
Today, we are witnessing the enlargement of the European Union.
The existing Member States are on the one hand putting on a friendly face towards the new Member States, but on the other hand several Member States have imposed restrictions on the free movement of workers with respect to the new Member States.
I also consider, given these circumstances, discussion on reducing Member Statesâ contributions to the European Union budget to be not altogether appropriate.
If there are doubts about the destination of these resources or the way in which they are expended and used, it is time to look for a more effective model for the operation of the entire mechanism for the distribution of EU resources and not to weaken financially the system of regional and structural solidarity, which could be one of the sources for future economic growth in the EU.
And so, ladies and gentlemen, I should like quietly but insistently to urge you to make sensible decisions which will not disappoint the fragile expectations of the citizens of the new Member States following accession to the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, we must safeguard the European economic and social model.
We hear this from all quarters more than ever, certainly now that Europe is reunified and many people still feel somewhat ill at ease in our big House.
The public appreciates the socio-ecologically corrected free-market economy.
They know that competitiveness and solidarity are key concepts in this connection, and realise that the Lisbon process must be perpetuated and strengthened.
I should like to make a plea for the little ones not to be overlooked in our future socio-economic policy.
We must continue to work on a better entrepreneurial climate, in which more people feel inclined to set up a business and also have the opportunities to do so.
We should in any case pay more attention to SMEs, because two-thirds of employment and added value are created by them.
Why not, Commissioner, include a specific SME Commissioner in the next Commission with a horizontal competence and who, on that basis, would work with the different Commissioners in a matrix model in each of the vertical fields of competence?
Finally, I think we should closely examine the proposal for the internal market directive and fine-tune it where necessary, to avoid having to throw away the baby with the bath water in the social sphere.
I should like to say the following by way of conclusion.
We are now reunited; there are 25 of us and together we will keep going.
The ten new countries that have joined us have demonstrated to us that it is possible to make structural changes and that it is necessary to dare stick to one's guns in order to achieve the long-term goals of peace, prosperity and a good social climate.
Let the journey they have travelled serve as an example to us and let us continue focusing on keeping the balance in Europe between the needs of a smoothly-running market and the wishes of the public.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today is the right time to look at our economic policy from a broader viewpoint, to look squarely at the past of the Europe of the fifteen and at the future of the Europe of the twenty-five.
The first basic point which needs to be made is that the European Union does not have a legal basis for a common â truly common â economic policy, because the Union does not have the competence to make, it only has the competence to coordinate the economic policy of the Member States.
This fragmentation of economic policy is not something which can yield results under the conditions of globalisation in which we live today.
The second point is that we need a bigger strategic initiative, capable of activating the powers of the European economy.
The third point is that, apart from a bigger strategic initiative, the European economy also needs a bigger strategic objective.
The accession of the ten new Member States gives us the opportunity for a bigger initiative, capable of inspiring our efforts.
The economies of eastern Europe can become the dynamo of the new European economy; all it needs is for us, old Europe, to find the courage and the inspiration to imitate the United States of America and mark the end of the cold war with a sort of Marshall plan for eastern Europe, as the USA did at the end of the Second World War.
As regards the big objective, it was given to us in the draft of the new European Constitution, which, for the first time in the history of the Treaties, included full employment in the basic Article 3 as one of the objective aims of the Union, at the same time rejecting the call by the European Central Bank for equal treatment of the objective of price stability.
This latter point is important and we must keep to it, but it is not more important, it is never more important than the objective of full employment, which was an essential element in the old European model and, unfortunately Commissioner, I did not, despite listening to you carefully, hear you mention full employment in your review of the European model.
We must restore this model if we are to bring Europe back to the path of its reconstruction.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this enlargement of the European Union is made historic by the attempt to get countries at very different levels of economic development to work together smoothly and effectively.
Successful completion of that task requires the creation of a sustainable globalisation model that would stop the growth of tensions, disagreements and conflicts that has accompanied the dismantling of former boundaries.
Within the next five years, all of the European Union institutions, including Parliament, will have to face historic economic policy challenges.
First, a balanced solution must be found concerning the problem of harmonising competitive conditions for enterprises in countries at different levels of economic development.
It is evident that countries with lower income levels will not be able to invest as much in social insurance, healthcare, environmental protection and other societal activities as the wealthier countries.
Lower social taxation, however, gives enterprises a competitive advantage in the short term, and this leads to discontentment among enterprises in countries with higher taxation levels.
The movement of enterprises to regions with a lower tax burden destabilises developed societies.
Finding a balance that takes the interests of all the parties equally into account will, even with an in-depth grasp of economic policy and fine political sense, require great efforts in the coming years on the part of the Members of the European Parliament.
As a second challenge, I would highlight the integration of countries with different levels of development of public infrastructure with the conditions of the European economic and monetary union.
The new Members who have shrugged off the former planned economy now need to make enormous investments to modernise the infrastructure of education, science, health care, environmental protection, internal security and legal protection.
The funding of these investments would be possible at the expense of raising the level of taxes without contravening the basic conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact, but this would endanger the already low competitive ability of enterprises that are still in the build-up phase.
Infrastructure investments could be funded by loans, increasing the countryâs budget deficit and the national debt, but this would be at odds with the main conditions for the adoption of the single currency.
This means that if the single currency membership conditions as well as the need for retaining the competitiveness of enterprises are both strictly observed, the necessary development investments cannot be made.
This in turn would jeopardise the sustainability of development and would equate to living at the expense of the nation's future.
Strengthening the unity of the European Union âŠ
Â Â  â Mr President, there are many important rooms in our collective European home.
There are political, economic, cultural, spiritual rooms and also social rooms.
I am convinced that both the European social and economic model are extremely important, if not crucial, for the cohesion of the European Union.
The essence of this model could be boiled down to the simple statement that you have brought together both competition and solidarity.
According to data from research carried out by Pew Global Survey, the views held by both Eastern and Western Europeans, with regard to the market and the social system that should be guaranteed by the state, have a large number of points in common.
This is why today the citizens of ten new countries, including my country, Slovenia, tend to ask two main questions.
Are the days of the previous European social and economic model numbered, and will the European social market model survive in the EU of 25 States?
My reply is that it will.
It must survive.
Of course it will have to respond to numerous changes, for example negative demographic trends, rising healthcare and pension costs and also a more balanced representation of both sexes in the labour market.
I would like to mention the contents of a report prepared for the European Commission by a group of experts led by Jacques Sapir, which clearly calls for European Cohesion Funds to be redirected to the accession States.
In this way they will be available to the people that need them most.
I am convinced that the EU must offer the accession States the same conditions that were offered to the new members in each previous round of enlargement.
Up to now, to be frank, the founder members of the European Union have had priority in the distribution of funds.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the European workforce is expensive.
Sometimes this is referred to as a negative aspect, as a factor that hinders competitiveness, yet this is a good thing.
This provides a decent standard of living for the workforce, for those who are no longer or not yet employed, and for those also who have to be absent from work temporarily.
Price is, of course, an important factor in competitiveness, but it is only one of the factors, the other one being quality.
This is why we were happy to see the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 state that the future of the European economic and social system will stand or fall on success or failure in making Europe the most competitive, knowledge-based economy by 2010.
The key to this, however, is education, training, life-long learning and furthermore, research and development.
We are now in the year 2004.
In the research and development race the gap in favour of the United States has opened even wider.
The harmonisation of the education and training policies of the European states is at a very low level, and the life-long learning concept is not spreading at the speed it should.
As a result of all this it looks as if the US is coming out of recession, in the Far East the dynamic growth of the economy based on cheap labour is continuing, whilst Europe continues to stagnate.
The European social system is, therefore, a value that we must maintain, yet the European economy is less and less able to produce the financial resources for this.
It would not be good for us to remain helpless in the face of this situation, without knowing what to do, but it would be even worse if, despite being able to see the way out, we did very little of what was needed.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian nation had a poet with fire in his heart, SÃ¡ndor PetÅfi, who roused the nation to action during the days of the 1848 revolution with these words: âToday is the right time, but tomorrow may be too lateâ.
In the next five years it will certainly not be the right time for Europe, but perhaps it will not be too late either.
Let us leave this as a legacy to our successors convening on 19 July: it will depend on their wisdom, determination and ability to cooperate whether the unfavourable processes can be reversed or the European social system will remain just a congenial experiment that is doomed to end in failure because of lack of economic support.
Â Â  Mr President, I have the honour of speaking in the European Parliament as one of the first Polish Members and as the first Member representing the Wielkopolska voivodship.
My fellow Members and I are setting fundamental goals for ourselves in the European Union.
Our first goal is a sovereign Poland.
We believe Polandâs sovereignty will be better secured within the European Union than outside it.
We want a strong and sovereign Poland in a strong Europe.
Our second goal concerns the economy.
We are convinced that membership of the European Union gives us an opportunity for economic development that was not available to us outside the Community.
This is why it is important for the European Unionâs economic policy to promote free competition.
Further, economic policy must be based on solidarity, which is a key principle of the European Union.
This will give the poorer new Member States an opportunity to develop.
It is also the reason why we are insisting that the Unionâs budget be maintained at the existing level and not be reduced, and it is why we are calling for structural investment in the new Member States.
I am addressing you as a Pole and as a resident of the Wielkopolska voivodship.
It was in this area, in Gniezno, that Emperor Otto III and Cardinal Robert, representing Pope Sylvester II, met with the ruler of Poland, Boleslaw the Brave, in the year 1000.
At the turn of the tenth century they discussed the affairs of Europe in this very area near the grave of StÂ Wojciech.
Inspired by them we believe that today a happy and peaceful Europe can also only be built in the name of God and Christian tradition.
The people of Wielkopolska, where I live, have always been renowned for their great enterprise and thrift.
The citizens of Poznan, Kalisz, Leszno, Pila, Konin, Gniezno, Wrzesnia, Gostyn, Koscian, Rawicz, Ostrow, Kolo, and many other Wielkopolska cities, towns, and villages will do everything in their power to ensure that Poland achieves success.
We aspire to success for ourselves as well as for the extremely large number of young people in Poland.
My country has recently recorded the greatest increase in student numbers in Europe.
Their number has grown six-fold in the last few years.
It is for the sake of these young Poles that we are striving for a strong Poland in a strong Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the free movement of workers is one of the most important fundamental European rights.
The possibility for workers to move freely is important for both the employees and businesses alike.
The free movement of workers ensures competitiveness and the constant growth of the Union at the same time, yet it cannot be detached from the question of social security.
In terms of the social security network the does not permit discrimination between employees on the basis of their nationality.
One of the most important objectives of the Union that has now been enlarged to 25 Members is to significantly increase its competitiveness, and by doing so, to keep abreast with its most important challengers, the US and Japan.
The Lisbon Strategy that was created in 2000 covers this, and this objective must play a key role in the near future in national legislation and also in the European Parliament.
However, we can only implement the Lisbon Strategy successfully if we significantly increase both the rate of employment and the mobility of the workforce.
Unfortunately, during the last few months, this quite promising process has run aground, and the voices of those who, on the basis of some irrational fear, want to delay the free movement of workers have become louder.
We have all seen the labour market surveys that deal with the expected movement of workers from the ten new Member States.
These data show that barely one perÂ cent of those in active employment expect to find employment in other Member States during the next few years.
The panic is, therefore, completely unfounded, the new member countries, including Hungary, will of course comply with the provisions of the accession agreement, but rightfully expect that the limitations of the labour market will not be born out of crass prejudice and fear.
Provisions made in respect of the stability of individual countries must always be based on specific surveys, and the question of the expected migration of workers from the new Member States must be addressed on an individual basis.
We object on principle to the approach that does not differentiate between the new Member States.
It is in Europeâs mutual interest to make optimum use of the trained workforce and the strategic advantages offered by the flexibility of the labour market, and on this basis to become the fastest growing region in the world.
Â Â  â And now, Mr President, for the social Europe!
It is my belief that, if we want this enlargement to still be a real cause for celebration in the years to come, we have to meet our fellow-citizensâ expectations.
What they ask of us is a social Europe, an economic and social model to be the continuing backbone of our European Union, and jobs for all.
For that, then, there are three great guiding principles.
The first is this: where are we going, tomorrow, to create added value in the European Union?
The EU will have to reflect on this and on what tomorrowâs jobs will be.
They will be local jobs.
They will be jobs that do not exist today, connected with the quality of life, associated with personal services.
We will also need to be able to gain control of our sources of finance and investment.
In those Member States that were until very recently called âold Europeâ and are now part of the new Europe of twenty-five, there are great fears about relocations.
As we now know, there is similar fear among the ten countries that have just joined us about the prospect of a brain drain to the West, and even more so, of businesses taking flight, whether westwards or to India or China.
So this issue of relocations is one that we have to discuss together, as we gain control of our research efforts and denounce national policies aimed at reducing it.
We also have to put in place real strategies for industrial policy.
In the 1990s, we were able to do it in the car industry â and it is thus that the European Union still has today six car manufacturers â at a time when everyone thought the industry was doomed by Japanese expansion.
We have to regain our capacity for strength through unity, or for strength in the Union.
The second great guiding principle is that of rights.
There will be no cohesion in Europe, nor will there be a consolidated social and economic model, if goods simply circulate without there being, as we have defined in the Charter, rights for all, which are a matter for the social responsibility of businesses or of an occupational social security scheme.
Finally, we will need real solidarity around a Budget that it will not be possible to confine, as some would have us do, within the meagre envelope of 1% of GNP.
There can, however, be no Budget solidarity without fiscal solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, enlargement of the European Union from 15 to 25 Member States is resulting in inevitable changes to its economic, administrative, and social structure.
The average gross national product per capita is lower.
Unemployment has risen, and society is becoming more divided.
The number of poorer persons has increased significantly.
There is a greater number of less developed regions, and these regions require support from the Unionâs budget.
At the same time, however, there have been some very positive developments.
Our common market has grown.
Internal competitiveness has increased, which will strengthen our external competitiveness.
Structural and economic changes in the ten new Member States are opening up great opportunities for development.
A so-called baby-boom generation is starting productive adult life in Poland.
For the most part, these young people are, well educated citizens, prepared for the challenges of a modern economy.
A younger generation of Europeans, open to innovation and progress, is our greatest asset.
Social Europe imposes restrictions on economic Europe.
It reduces the competitiveness of the economy.
This does not mean, however, that we must dispense with Europeâs social heritage, which is so important for our citizens.
It need not hamper the search for new tools for development.
Recently I was asked what associations the European Union has for me, what buildings, monuments, historical events, achievements, it brought to mind.
I answered that Europe does indeed have great buildings, magnificent monuments, and beautiful chapters of history.
I said that Europe has wonderful traditions and achievements, but that for me Europe is associated with the values it developed and offers to the world.
These values are democracy, human rights, and security for the individual, including economic and social security.
They have to be the fundamental prerequisites and guidelines for the philosophy and development of the European Union.
Â Â  As a former trade unionistI would like to sayhow happy we are that the Social Charter has been incorporated into the draft European Constitution, given that this was something that I fought for when I was a member of the European Trade Union Confederation executive.
I think the fifteen countries should not worry that the ten new countries will prove a financial drain.
The majority of accession countries know they will have to look after themselves, as the Czech Republic has done.
If we take the Eastern part of Germany, into which billions of German marks have been poured, and compare it with the Czech Republic, we cannot see a great deal of difference.
Mr President, I can speak in Spanish.
As a former union leader, I would like to say that we are pleased that the Social Charter appears in the draft Constitution.
I believe that the fifteen countries must not be afraid of a lot of money going to the countries that have now become Members, because the majority of the countries will have to help themselves, just as the Czech Republic did.
If we compare the situation in the eastern part of Germany, which received huge cash injections involving billions of marks, with the situation in our Republic, we will see that they are not so different.
What should make the fifteen States nervous is the possibility of a social and fiscal dumping zone being created in that area.
According to many of our liberal policies, our countries will flourish if we turn them into areas of this nature.
They say that we must maintain the comparative advantages for as long as possible.
We do not agree.
We are against dismantling the social State in Europe, because that is what most attracts us to it.
I would like our fellow Members from the fifteen existing Member States to monitor closely the attacks on unions in recent times, the attacks in Slovakia, where they want to repeal the law on tri-partyism.
I also believe it will be necessary to ensure that what so often happens does not happen in our countries: the law is included in the Statutes, but is not applied.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcomed the urgency today with which, as this parliamentary term draws to a close, the Commissioner returned to the need, which the last speaker mentioned, for defence of the European way of life to be among our prime objectives.
A liberalist wind, a single school of thought appeared to be attempting to destroy the idea of justice which brings dignity to politics in Europe and in our countries.
I am pleased that the Commissioner reaffirmed this point.
In Italy there is a booklet, âThe Dream and the Choicesâ, a fine discussion by President Prodi available in bookshops.
It points out, with regard to this way of life, what the major social democracies, the Christian school of thought in the social doctrine of the Church, have built in our countries, with different political experiences, since the early twentieth century; and indeed today we are different.
In my opinion, this has to be a prime objective, and in 20 yearsâ time we will be remembered not just for our history, our Christian roots and the beauty of our cities but also for having created a model of relations between people which is among the most advanced in our history.
I will end, today in particular, at the end of this parliamentary term, by expressing a concern: the diffusion, precisely with regard to this issue, of a lack of rules, of the insecurity of young peoplesâ jobs.
Of course, we must defend change, but we must be careful not to destroy young peoplesâ security.
I would like to extend my best wishes to the incoming MEPs for their work.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, in your speech you mentioned Finland, Sweden and Denmark as examples of this European economic and social model.
The excellent levels of social welfare in these countries are due very largely to high taxation, and that includes business tax, taxation on capital and income tax.
This is the way to create viable public services.
Our common task now is to prevent tax competition, which would mean among other things the erosion of the foundation of these European welfare states.
This kind of European prosperity is also based on tripartite agreements â we heard here how there are problems with this in some countries â as well as good labour relations and the fact that issues are discussed and lasting agreements are reached, with balanced growth achieved as a result.
We also have to ensure that this forthcoming services directive, which, after the elections in June, the elected Parliament will be debating, does nothing to promote dumping, something that was spoken of here, but adopts the laws and decrees of the country in which the services are being produced.
Environmental protection also creates growth and stability.
We really have to ensure that we achieve sustainable growth which also allows us to look to the future.
We will not build a European Union with short-term profits.
We have to have sustainable growth, with the environment playing an absolutely key role.
Â Â  Mr President, after spending the past year as an observer in the European Parliament it is indeed an honour that I can, for the first time, address this assembly following the formal accession of my country, Malta.
Over the past year I have participated in a number of committees, primarily the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I have followed many debates and also contributed to various topics, including tabling an amendment that was formally introduced by a fellow MEP.
This amendment to the third cohesion report was adopted in committee and then in plenary.
It is a vibrant example of the opportunity that was given to the accession countries to participate in and influence decisions even prior to membership.
This is also a clear instance of the welcoming attitude of Members of this House towards an observer.
I mentioned earlier the cohesion report.
What better way is there to highlight the economic and social model of Europe, the subject of this debate?
The concept of providing a helping hand to regions and countries that are lagging behind other areas of the Union is an excellent example of solidarity in practice, which forms such an essential part of the European Union.
If one were to ask what the essential characteristics of the European economic and social model are, one would definitely have to include this aspect of support for cohesion and sustainable development, with due consideration given to the quality of life of EU citizens.
It is important to stimulate the economic growth of the EU so as to provide better jobs and a higher standard of living.
However, it also important to focus on a distribution of income that is just and equitable.
This is the first and probably last speech I will make in this Parliament, as I have been nominated to the European Court of Auditors.
I will not vote on this item tomorrow as I believe that one should not participate in decisions when one is directly involved in that same decision.
I will end with a few words in Maltese.
Today we can really say that we have taken our place in Europe.
Maltese citizens are now also part of this much wider project that will increase benefits for all of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, the current European economic and social model has unfortunately not brought about the desired results.
The added impact of enlargement may also put further strain on the system and create new imbalances and unexpected changes in employment patterns and social cohesion.
The scourge of unemployment and job instability within the European Union still defies the many action plans and initiatives for economic and social reforms launched in the past.
Poverty is still with us and the traditional social security systems are threatened.
Add to this certain negative aspects of the impact of globalisation and the picture gets bleaker.
There is no social stability and no real prosperity where there is unemployment, where there are imminent threats to existing jobs and competitiveness is gradually eroded due to macro-economic policies, fiscal measures and constraints that are not adapted to the existing situation on the ground.
It must be said a priori that any corrective measures that have to be taken should in no way have any negative impact on existing levels of social protection.
Ideally in the future the European economic and social model needs to be more flexible in its application.
The same applies to the European monetary and fiscal policies.
Ways have to be found of establishing how flexibility and fair competition can co-exist and how the social market economy will have less of the free market component and more of the social component.
The enlarged European Union presents a whole range of regional and subregional social economic scenarios.
Each has its own specificities and each is in need of its own tailor-made action plan to help attract investment, create jobs, maintain its competitive edge and attract new growth sectors, while ensuring social stability and sustainable growth levels.
Coming as I do from the smallest Member State, which is an island state, I am very conscious that EU-wide economic and social policies applied indiscriminately on a 'one-size-fits-all' basis do not invariably bring about the desired results either in job creation or in a better quality of life for our citizens.
This is why I strongly believe that, to be successful, the future EU economic and social model should have ingrained within it the possibility to be flexible and be applied in a tailor-made fashion to specific sites and situations, as well as being endowed with the necessary flexibility in its application to be effective under different socio-economic scenarios.
Only in this way can we really hope to see further job creation, better quality of life, more prosperity, better social cohesion and more stability within the future enlarged European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my joy at being able to address you now as a full Member of this House from Hungary.
Even 20 years ago, the representatives of the Hungarian National Party regarded the achievement of close union with the countries of the western half of Europe as their main objective.
During the last fifteen years, however, we have been able to learn quite a lot.
The not yet completely finalised political, economic and social changes are quite interesting.
We must work towards the objective that more and more people in Hungary â and in the accession countries â think that joining the European Union is not just a necessary solution, but something that really helps to ensure that people have a secure future.
We have to create an economy where no elements can surface that would distort competition, but which at the same time allows the accession countries, including Hungary, to catch up.
It is imperative that smaller villages, even the most disadvantaged rural areas, should be able to retain their population.
Not only the difficulties associated with the closure of industrial production but also the disadvantages associated with changes in agricultural production, and even in tourism, must be taken into consideration.
In Hungary, for example, Lake Balaton and its surrounding area require development, financial support is needed, because in addition to the main European roads the remainder of the road network should also be further developed, by establishing a north-south axis route in the western and central parts of Hungary.
We can say that we are ready to join the European Union, but further major economic and social changes are required.
The other political party in Hungary talks about modernisation.
I do not think it is fashionable any more to advertise modern socialism, here in the institutions of the European Union, fortunately, nobody talks about it any more.
We agree on the development of a knowledge-based economy and IT access possibilities.
Emphasis must be placed, however, on managing the disadvantages of globalisation, increasing the number of jobs, and enabling the accession countries to catch up, with retention of the main elements of the social model.
Accession will only be successful if the countries catch up with the existing members.
Our wish is to be part of this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the EUâs economic and social policy is important, and the European model is based upon a balance between growth, union rights, good conditions in the labour market and sustainable development.
We must give impetus to this policy.
Where growth is concerned, we must pin our hopes on, for example, research and development, the training of the labour force and investment.
It is at least as important that trade unions exert influence upon developments in individual workplaces and so achieve better working environments.
It is just as important that we make development sustainable in a long-term perspective.
I am optimistic.
I believe that enlargement can be a positive thing, not only for the new countries but also for the whole of the EU, including those of us who have been MEPs and EU Members for some time.
I believe that it can be a success and a win-win situation.
I myself come from the Baltic area and live in Sweden.
I believe that growth can increase through an increase in trade across the Baltic.
It is therefore important that we not compete with one other through social dumping, poorer working conditions or tax dumping that undermines our welfare systems, but that we maintain a high level of rights in the labour market and where our welfare systems are concerned.
When we invest, we must do so in new, clean technology that also creates sustainable development and makes for long-term, rather than just short-term, growth.
I am optimistic, but such optimism depends upon maintaining the balance in the social model.
Â Â  Latvia is proud to be a full member of the European Union's family of nations and that we can work together in a unified way for the good of all of Europe.
We have been working toward this goal for fifteen years.
Our achievements are significant, creating and developing an economy and a social policy.
We have also encountered various problems, however, which are becoming especially relevant in the context of the common European economy and social policy.
One of these problems is the demographic crisis, which affects all of Europe.
Statistics show clearly that all over Europe a so called demographic winter has set in and the question naturally follows: for whom, then, are we creating and building this beautiful, unified and prosperous Europe?
There is no simple solution to this issue and it is not merely bound up with economic and social policy, because it is also a question of values.
Even the best conceived and most balanced employment policy, thorough social protection and a system of pensions, sexual equality and social benefits will not be perfect unless it is grounded in the basic values of society â on ethical and moral norms.
Only a harmonious and sound family is able to ensure that these social values are inculcated in every resident, in every child.
Therefore the interests of the family must be taken into account, and they must be the driving force of all economic and social policy initiatives.
Latvia is aware of the threats posed by the demographic crisis and therefore the issues of family and child welfare have now been put forward as the Latvian Government's priorities.
We call on Europe to take similar action, because only then will we be able to tackle the social problems that threaten all of Europe, which are related to the demographic crisis and the inevitable ageing of the population and the growth in the economic burden on the working population.
Economic and social welfare is not conceivable without the welfare of families all over Europe, because the welfare of the child is dependent on the welfare of the family and that is the basis of a strong, secure and prosperous Europe.
Therefore today I want to call on you, in debating every issue of economic and social policy, to devote particular attention to the basic value and the foundation of society â the family.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, today is the first time that Members of Parliament from the new EU Member States have been able to put their opinions forward.
It is a pity that these opinions are being delivered in such a private environment.
Nevertheless, it is of course an honour for me to appear before the European Parliament.
I come from Slovakia, which, just like the other new EU Member States, has undergone huge changes in the last 15 years, changes which often took decades in the advanced democracies.
These changes have been very painful and have brought with them great inequalities and social injustice.
We are the living proof that, if the social aspects of the market economy are ignored, along with the effects of experimental reforms on the population, and if the invisible hand of the market is continually overemphasised, it is one hundred perÂ cent certain that the result will be enormous differences in standards of living and enormous differences between regions.
I believe that we have had enough fireworks and receptions celebrating the enlargement of the European Union.
It must be borne in mind that the Union now includes countries where average income is about EUR 160 and average earnings are about EUR 360 a month.
Full compliance with the European economic and social model may act as an emergency brake for some Member States.
We may, of course, have great reservations about this model, but socially fairer and more forward-looking models are very difficult, if not impossible, to devise.
We wish to use our experiences from the last 15 years to make as constructive a contribution as possible to the implementation of this model.
We do not wish to be the part of Europe which is only attractive because of its low labour costs and weak social protection.
The introduction of restrictions on the free movement of workers has not been the best of contributions to the European economic and social model.
It is essential to express the conviction that further such âcontributionsâ will not occur and that equality and solidarity will not be restricted to glossy brochures about the European Union, but will be real European values.
Â Â  Mr President, while we are all making statements and giving evidence, I should like to use the minutes of my final speech of this legislative term to try to offer some observations of my own on this issue.
Time is at a premium, but this is a worthwhile exercise.
An even more worthwhile exercise would be to stop the so-called economic and social model from becoming an empty phrase, a hollow shell that has become demagogy, and a mere husk from which we have been extracting the living organisms.
These living organisms are principles and values that must be enforced on a practical basis.
They are achievements and not gifts, achievements that must be fought for and not gifts that are gratefully received, principles that we want to keep and to ensure that they do not suffer a slow and complete demise.
In order to place this in a historical context, I shall cite the example of Portugal.
For decades we were outside the framework of what is referred to as the âEuropean modelâ; thirty years ago, with the âApril 25th Revolutionâ, we won social security, reforms, unemployment benefit and a minimum wage; we won the right to health and education and this became enshrined in the Constitution; work â on land, at sea, in manufacturing and in the tertiary sector â was accorded the value that it merits; public services were created; we sought to link the public, cooperative and private sectors; priority was given to the collective interest, with the economy controlled by democratic politics and not vice-versa.
Politics was no longer in a position to allow major private financial concerns to be established, with various forms of protection.
Thereafter, particularly after 1986, priority was given to nominal convergence, albeit accompanied by actual divergence and an uneven approach at social and regional level.
This occurred because the objective of economic and social cohesion did not turn out as it ought to have done.
We did not want ridiculous budgetary criteria to be imposed, or accounts of benefactorsâ sacrifices and beneficiariesâ gains; what we wanted from the policy was for it to promote cooperation and the transfer of means, with mutual respect and benefits for all.
A profoundly significant enlargement is upon us, which we welcome, with European peoples and cultures coming together.
It will not, however, work this way whilst we fail to take account of the experiences â both positive and negative â of the new Member States.
These experiences must help us to ensure the continued existence of the values and principles that form part of the âEuropean modelâ.
Indeed, because it was not only the Beveridge plan, but also a degree of competition that led to the principles and values that humanised the use of the workforce being enshrined.
It was significant that mention was made yesterday of Reagan and Thatcher, characters who symbolised neo-liberalism, which is governed solely by the rules of the market, and which will stop at nothing to destroy those principles and values.
From this side of the House, I welcome the enlarged Europe and the concept of neighbourhood â as a European model for living and not a symbol of window-dressing rhetoric â which will be the path to follow, provided that we maximise the wealth of various situations institutionally, economically, socially, culturally, and not the ideological straitjacket of an omnipotent paradigm, of an omnipotent neo-liberal, federal and militarised Constitution, on the pretext of the spectre of a threat to security.
I shall finish as I began, Mr President, given that three minutes do not last long.
The principles and values of a new way forward are, from now on, those of genuine solidarity, of peace, of mutual respect of a democracy, which is not confined to the act of voting, but which extends to the citizens, the workers and the people actually participating.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that compared to many areas of the earth, the European economic and social model is as successful as it is, because, in the past, we have developed an economically viable and environmentally friendly transport policy, with sensible general conditions for employees.
By way of example, I would just like to mention the driving and rest periods for road traffic and working periods in the transport sector.
On the one hand, this European transport policy is based on us having already dealt with the different national rules in the transport sector or on us being in the process of dealing with them, and thus creating an integrated market in the transport sector too.
As an example from recent years I would mention the opening of the national rail networks to non-discriminatory use for all railway companies in the Union for freight services from 2006or 2007.
I could, alternatively, give another example of the creation of the Single European Sky from 31Â December 2004.
On the other hand, the European transport policy is based on having come to terms with the thinking and action behind national infrastructure networks and having created and expanded a trans-European transport network within the Union.
In this vein, we adopted the largest revision of the trans-European transport network two weeks ago and thereby getting to grips with the Union of Fifteenâs transport infrastructure and adopting 30 priority projects for the Union of Twenty-Five.
I am assuming that the new Member States will quickly implement the European regulations in the transport sector, if they have not already done so, in order that the internal market in transport may become a reality in all areas of the European Union.
I hope that together we will be able to press ahead with and further develop the European transport policy in the next Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Â Â  Mr President, until recently I was an observer in this House.
Today I am a fully-fledged Member of the European Parliament.
I have noticed that words like solidarity, assistance, and cooperation are often bandied about in the Chamber.
These words do have real meaning.
It sometimes happens, however, that a wonderful idea loses out against ruthless interests.
Work on reform of the common agricultural policy is an example of this.
The Fifteen old Member States used ArticleÂ 23 of the Treaty of Accession concluded between Poland and the European Union to further their own interests.
The conditions applicable to Polish agriculture established in Copenhagen in December 2002 were changed to our disadvantage.
Poland is a country of great opportunities.
With some support, it could develop impressively and benefit the whole European Union.
In over a thousand years of its history, my nation has demonstrated that it is not afraid of difficult challenges.
It has shown itself capable of great deeds for the common good.
It is no exaggeration to state that a Poland with a vibrant economy and enriched by the spirit of its citizens will be an asset to the European Union.
I am convinced we shall not be a burden on Europe.
We shall prove a tower of strength for it.
Poland has never let Europe down, and it never will.
I trust Europe will not let Poland down either.
Â Â  â Mr PresidentCommissioner, ladies and gentlemen, twenty years ago Czechoslovakia split.
The Czechs and the Slovaks were unable to agree on a joint constitution.
Fortunately, we parted on good terms, as friends and in peace.
I am happy we are meeting as friends and in peace again in the European Union and in Parliament.
Czechoslovakiaâs story can serve as a lesson, particularly for those who are set to negotiate the European Constitution.
If no agreement is reached on the European Constitution within an enlarged Europe, this major entity could also break up.
Let us hope that they take heed of this warning.
Talking about the future of our economic and social model, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we will not be the ones who decide the future.
The future will be decided by those who will live in this future, by our children and their childrenâs children.
What we can do for them is to create conditions that will enable them to decide freely on their own model, and it is by adopting the European Constitution that we will enable them to make their decisions freely.
I mention this, because my ancestors decided to surrender their freedom and democracy on the promise of social security.
My generation was, therefore, not free to decide which social and economic system it would like to live under.
I believe that the future social system will be based on solidarity and love for oneâs fellow man.
Let us not forget this is also a Christian value, which is not mentioned in the preamble of the draft Constitution.
I believe that they will be able to decide to go into business.
Conditions must be right, however, for small businesses to flourish, given that out of small acorns large oaks trees grow.
I believe that everything will come right.
I believe that the future for our descendants will be as happy as things were for my generation.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council is in the habit of producing declarations that may be visionary or even grandiose, but are certainly useful. One of these was produced at Lisbon in 2000, where the Heads of State or Government presented us with a strategy extending over ten years, in which time it aimed to make the European Union the most competitive and most dynamic economy in the world.
According to this strategy, a strong economy will stimulate the creation of jobs and will encourage social and environmental policies ensuring sustainable development and social cohesion, which boils down to something that is not the work of a genius and is almost a truism, and, for students of economics and all the acolytes of the social market economy, a post-war concept.
Now that this legislative period is coming to an end, we, the former members, and the new ones whom we have welcomed this week, are quite rightly concerned about the opportunities for implementing the Lisbon strategy.
Within this framework, though, the question at issue is whether we can maintain the European social model in the Europe of twenty-five, which will tomorrow be twenty-seven or even more, is the one that bothers me most of all.
Can we agree that, if the European social model is to be saved, we must not abandon a certain amount of regulation of the market economy compatible with an adequate standard of social security?
This means that certain public services, such as education, health, or culture, would have to escape wholesale privatisation, whilst still being required to enhance their efficiency and keep their costs under control.
If we are to relaunch growth and competitiveness while reducing unemployment, it is not absolutely necessary to dismantle our provident democracy, to abandon redistribution aimed at strengthening cohesion, let alone to abandon our familiar solidarity now that we are in the enlarged EU.
Nevertheless, the speeding up of reforms is an essential condition if the European social model is to be saved in the West and extended to the East, for the only thing that engenders solidarity is the awareness of common interests.
Above all, I hope that the new Parliament, to be elected on 13Â June, will be able, on the basis of this evidence, to save the European social model as an integral part of the aims and objectives of European integration, even if it means that these have to be redefined by all the political and social actors, among whom this House will have a leading role and primary responsibility.
Mr President, this is not a testament, for I want to carry on working here, but I was keen to share with you my profound convictions on this matter.
Â Â  . Mr President, if we could christen this evening's debate and give it a title, we would say it is a debate about solidarity.
This was indeed the word which was heard more than any other this evening.
Of course, the need to strengthen it was emphasised a great many times and I hope, as MrÂ Libicki and Mr Kroupa said earlier, that we shall be able to make Europe and our countries better for us and our children and that we shall be able to live with the democracy, security and freedom which the European Union and the common wish of all the peoples of Europe guarantee us, without sacrificing freedoms.
I have followed the debate very closely, from which I can say that it clearly emerged that economic and social policy cannot be divorced from one another.
Hence, the approach which we adopted last year, when we decided to update and combine these two policy sectors, was the right one.
Now, in addition to this observation, I should like to make a number of other final comments.
The slow economic growth observed during the first years of the application of the Lisbon strategy and, consequently, of the Social Policy Agenda, may create doubts, as MrsÂ Lulling said earlier, about the deeper logic on which the updating approach adopted in 2000 is based.
The fact that several interim objectives will not be achieved in 2005, such as unemployment, as Mrs Ainardi and others pointed out, or the increase in the rate of employment of older workers, which is far lower than the percentage we were aiming for, may feed criticism.
Nonetheless, the strategic choice about economic and social prosperity is the right choice.
Not only must we remain faithful, as Mr Marini stressed, to the principles on which the economic and social model of Europe is based and which are contained in the Lisbon strategy, but also we must remain faithful to the objectives of the specific strategy.
This does not preclude the fact that adjustments may be required as far as the specific policy measures and their methods of implementation are concerned.
It is, however, clear that the European Union should make use of the economic recovery and the dynamics of enlargement to give new momentum to the Lisbon strategy, focusing mainly on certain priorities, such as improving investments in networks and technological know-how, as numerous members emphasised, including Mrs GrossetÃªte, Mr SzabÃ³ and numerous others, strengthening the competitiveness of industry and services and extending active professional life.
For the new Member States in general, they are undergoing and facing, as far as the implementation of structural reforms is concerned, the same challenges which the older Member States faced.
Of course, as numerous members emphasised, including Mr Krasts and Mrs Å lesere, the new Member States do, of course, have greater difficulties in certain cases.
Of course, certain countries, such as Poland, as Mrs Ciemniak said, have high rates of growth, 6%, and have achieved faster reforms in the field of structural reforms.
In this sector of structural reforms, the new Member States must focus in particular on creating conditions for strengthening the increase in productivity, in that productivity levels are generally very low, and in dealing with the high levels of structural and long-term unemployment, to which MrÂ Siekierski referred.
I should like at this point to refer also to a matter raised at the beginning of the debate by Mrs Jensen and repeated subsequently: the question of the free movement of workers.
As you know, provision has been made for transitional arrangements.
This has been translated into various national practices which cover the entire spectrum, from zero to seven years.
Irrespective, however, of any graduations in the transitional periods, which I hope will prove not to be necessary and will be abolished as quickly as possible or limited as far as possible, I must stress that freedom of movement and the right to establish and work in another Member State are fundamental freedoms which are safeguarded under Community law.
Nor should we forget that they are an integral part of the internal market and European nationality.
Furthermore, I should like to stress once again what I said at the beginning of my speech, that economies with a large degree of unification and interdependence, which share a common market need efficient coordination in making and implementing economic policy, both at national level and at the level of the European Union.
All the constituent elements of the economic coordinating framework are closely connected to this overall strategy.
I too agree with those who, like MrsÂ Thyssen, pointed out that the only way to speed up progress is to carry out other reforms.
We must extend our coordination beyond financial matters to cover broader questions of economic policy and we need to take account of both the social and the environmental dimension which Mrs Myller spoke of, referring to what I said and emphasised earlier and which I would like to clarify better now, that the countries which provide a high level of social protection, such as Denmark and Sweden, also manage to be extremely competitive.
Mr President, we must find the political will needed to extend our coordination to all sectors covered by the Lisbon strategy, so that we can achieve more growth and greater employment.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on freedom and security for Union citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my gratitude for this final opportunity to address Parliament on the development of the area of freedom, security and justice in an enlarged Europe.
Over the past five years the Commission and Parliament have together followed a path in which Parliamentâs constructive contribution and cooperation, often in very difficult circumstances and with very tight deadlines, will certainly be one of the defining characteristics of this legislature.
Recent Eurobarometer surveys, carried out for the Commission, have shown a general desire on the part of the citizens for more Europe.
Those expectations are greater still against the backdrop of an enlarged Europe of 455Â million inhabitants.
The EUâs new citizens, in common with those of the rest of the EU, want to live freely in a safe and secure world.
Security is not only a matter of combating crime, it is also a means of ensuring freedom.
These two concepts are inextricably linked and the Commission has always sought to strike a balance between freedom and security.
The third element of this area is, of course, justice, which helps to protect freedom and to guarantee security in an area in which mobility and relationships between people and companies across national borders is increasingly common.
Today, many EU citizens still fear enlargementâs potential impact on security.
It is important that we address those fears rationally.
The process of enlargement has made it possible to strengthen the new Member Statesâ ability to contribute towards developing stability and security throughout the European Union, not only because they have access to the Community but also because of the improvements in the police and the judiciary that the Commission has supported during these last five years.
Negotiations with the accession countries were only concluded when it was decided by mutual agreement that a satisfactory level of compliance with the existing legislative framework and sufficient ability to implement and enforce that framework had been achieved by the new Member States.
It transpires that all of these countries need to make further progress.
The Commission will carry out its usual role of guardian of the Treaties and will continue to offer significant financial assistance as a follow-up to the PHARE projects, which will continue until 2006, and, subsequently, by means of a Schengen mechanism and transitional arrangements.
No less importantly, it must be made clear that all Member States are welcome to enjoy the possibilities of European Union funding under general Justice and Home Affairs programmes, on a completely equal footing.
A further aspect that has been brought to the fore by the media concerns the fear of a massive movement of new citizens across Europe.
As I have had the opportunity to state here, such fears are unjustified.
The Commission has carried out a study showing that over the next five years, around 1% of the total working population of the new Member States will exercise the right to move freely, which amounts to 220Â 000 people per year, in an EU of over 450Â million inhabitants.
I should like to mention, based on my own personal experience, that, on the eve of Spain and Portugal joining the EU, similar fears were raised, which turned out to be completely unfounded.
The Accession Treaty provides for the possibility of the current Fifteen Member States implementing transitional measures.
These measures are adequate and I trust that they will indeed be only transitional.
Enlargement represents a major challenge for certain policies, such as tightening external border controls.
We hope that the External Borders Agency will be operational as of 1Â January 2005 to support the efforts made by the ten new Member States to improve border controls.
As Parliament is aware, internal border controls in the new Member States will only be removed following a process of a specific evaluation and a subsequent decision by the Council.
This two-stage process can only be deemed complete once the Schengen Information System, known as âsecond generationâ SIS, has been established.
The timetabled development of SIS-II therefore constitutes a priority for the Commission and will require the active involvement of all Member States.
In the field of judicial cooperation, mutual trust becomes even more crucial in an enlarged Europe, to ensure that the principle of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions applies across the board.
Accordingly, we must improve certain measures contained in procedural law, such as those provided for in the framework decision on procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings, which the Commission has just submitted to the Council.
We must also enhance mutual trust between all EU Member States by improving knowledge of each otherâs legislative and judicial systems.
At Parliamentâs request, the Commission is in the process of creating an exchange programme for judges from all Member States, in both civil and criminal matters.
Lastly, as regards the policies of Justice and Home Affairs, we face a number of challenges.
One of those is visa policy and, more specifically, the principle of reciprocity in this area, an issue to which the Commission has paid close attention.
In an enlarged EU, so that the area of Justice and Home Affairs can operate, it is essential that the Constitutional Treaty enters into force, that it sets about dismantling the pillar structure and that the codecision process becomes more commonly used, which will guarantee full democratic responsibility for decisions taken in this area.
Judicial control must be improved, extending the Court of Justiceâs competence and granting the Commission powers commonly used in infringement cases.
The draft Constitutional Treaty addresses these challenges, and proposes that qualified majority voting be introduced in the area of common immigration policy, asylum and external borders, and that the provisions be strengthened as regards integrating third country nationals residing legally in the European Union.
The principle of solidarity, which already applies today, will be more clearly laid down in the Constitutional text concerning border controls, asylum and immigration.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to recall, lastly, that 1Â May is not only the date of the accession of the ten new Member States but also the deadline set in the Treaty of Amsterdam for completing the first stage of the phasing-in of the area of freedom, security and justice.
The Commission will soon submit a communication in which it assesses the progress made in the past five years and which will include the first guidelines for future priorities.
These priorities will be based on the shared values of freedom, security and justice in an enlarged Europe and must be based on the advances that we all hope will be provided for in the future Constitutional Treaty, which must be approved, and thus come fully into force, without delay.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly, on behalf of my group, to welcome the 162 new Members of this House, and we hope that this first debate on freedom and security for citizens in the enlarged Europe and, for me, my last one as a Member of this House, will lead to some clear reflections, not only on the framework already created over more than 50 years of the European project, but also on the challenges facing us in this common future we have just begun.
Freedom, security and justice.
In my view, these are areas in which the urgent need to confront the profound changes which are approaching in a Europe of 450Â million citizens and which, unfortunately, as we can see, sometimes moves forward as a result of such tragic events as terrorist attacks and the regrettable deaths of the victims of immigration, has been demonstrated.
It is clear that the great challenge awaiting us is to organise a new geo-political and demographic space in a dynamic, changing and constantly growing Europe.
I would therefore like to emphasise everything the Commissioner has just said on this point.
We have worked intensively over the last five years to enshrine the guarantees and protection of the fundamental rights of our citizens, and the results can be seen, such as the approval of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the steps aimed at approving common guarantees in criminal proceedings throughout the Union and the implementation of the European arrest warrant, a guarantor for one of our principle rights, which is the right of society to pursue relentlessly those who endanger the lives and security of the citizens.
Without forgetting the protection of the victims of crime and particularly the victims of terrorism.
In any process, however, such as the one with which we are currently occupied, we must not forget to look forward.
To this end, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we must change anything that is not working.
It is crucial that we modify the current decision-making method, with its cases of overlapping initiatives or delays resulting from the unanimity rules as well as flagrant delays in incorporating Community legislation into that of the Member States.
We must also reinforce and make progress on the achievements already made.
I would therefore like to insist on the proposal I made in the annual debate on the report on the area of freedom, security and justice, such as producing a Tampere II.
Finally, I believe that the new European Constitution must enshrine the hope represented by the chapter aimed at the regulation of this new area, that is, we must bring the legal instruments into line with the reality of the dangers currently threatening the freedom and security of the citizens.
It only remains for me, Mr President, to thank your Presidency and the Commissioner for your invaluable contribution to the defence of the values and rights of a society such as ours which wishes to feel increasingly free within a new enlarged area, in which security and justice, in turn, also provide the guarantees for that freedom.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by paying tribute to Commissioner Vitorino.
He said at the beginning of his contribution that it would be our last opportunity to hear him.
I hope that is not true and that those Members who return to the new Parliament will again have the pleasure of working with him.
I am sure colleagues will agree he has been one of the best and most accessible of all the Commissioners.
He has worked closely with us in our committee on a very difficult dossier and very challenging topics.
It is our joint challenge to enable everyone in the new wider Europe to live freely in a safer world, of which Europe is just one part.
It sometimes seems that we are playing around with a jigsaw puzzle and do not even know what all the pieces are.
We certainly do not know yet how they fit together.
Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar spoke of the deep-rooted challenges we face.
In the work of our committee on citizens' rights and freedom, the challenge must be to ensure that despite deep-rooted changes we are still able to maintain the rights of over 400 million EU citizens to freedom of movement, a decent education and a decent home.
The enlarged Europe must not be an excuse for us to replace the Iron Curtain with a division between rich and poor people and rich and poor countries.
Rights have to be equal wherever you live within this new Europe, whatever the colour of your skin, your ethnicity, your religion or whether you have no religion at all.
Earlier this afternoon there were some bigoted contributions from the other side of the Chamber about the dominance of Christianity in Europe and how important that was.
I reject that.
It has no place in these debates because people's rights should not be affected by religion, gender, origin or age.
We must do everything we can to protect minorities and to give them freedom from oppression.
This includes the rights, for example, of the Roma people in some of the Eastern European countries.
The Commissioner was right when he said that enlargement is a real challenge and it is not one that we have by any means addressed yet.
We have the challenge of the external frontiers, to which he referred.
In our efforts to control those frontiers and stop supplies of drugs and weapons, we must not make a barrier between our wealthier 25 countries and the poorer states just outside those new frontiers.
I am sure, Mr Vitorino, you share with us the desire to make certain that there is justice in this enlarged Europe.
You spoke of companies and businesses.
That must continue and include freedom of the press â not closing down newspapers, as we have seen in some countries.
There is a right to free television, and free media, not those dominated by a few people with vested interests.
There is a lot for us to do.
Commissioner, you have referred to many of the points this afternoon.
I shall just mention a couple more.
We must ensure that there is no oppression of those people who wish to move around, to exercise their right to free movement.
You. have referred to the hysteria in some of the press about that.
The right to access asylum must be reinforced, because we in this Parliament and the Commission are guardians of those rights: the right to asylum for those in need.
The Commission is one of the guardians of those Treaties and of those rights.
We can look forward to the future with some optimism.
If there is anyone listening who is in a position to look for a new President of the Commission, my suggestion â for what it is worth â would be you, Commissioner Vitorino.
I hope that will be taken on board.
We thank you for all you have done and I thank Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar and other colleagues on the committee for everything they have done over the last few years.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is its values that make Europe great: The values of freedom and solidarity and its determination to adhere to them.
This is why the European Union is one of the most successful, most attractive ventures, as is demonstrated by the present enlargement, because the new Member States and those that will join in the future have chosen Europe largely because of these values.
We are talking about freedom now, the four basic freedoms.
Permit me, Mr President, Commissioner, to talk about one of the four basic freedoms now, namely the free movement of workers.
Over the last few months in all the Member States and yesterday here, in this room, we have all been celebrating the enlargement.
We could freely celebrate the enlargement; we had good reason to do so.
Even so, a small shadow was cast over the celebration: the fact that only three of the existing Member States guarantee the free movement of workers, and only one of them â Sweden â does so without restrictions.
Ladies and gentlemen, we Liberals oppose any restriction on the free movement of workers.
Even a temporary restriction.
We do so firstly on principle, and secondly for practical reasons.
On principle, we are opposed to the fact that one of the basic rights is limited, and on principle, we feel that this limitation negatively affects the festive mindset as regards accession.
There are practical reasons for opposing it as well, and I fully agree with Mr Vitorino.
The fears are exaggerated; every survey shows that the free movement of workers, or the demand for it, is not significant in scale.
As far as Hungary is concerned, we are well aware that it will affect barely 2% of the workforce.
Those affected will be well-trained young single people, 85% of whom want to find employment in other countries for just one or two years.
Ladies and gentlemen, something else is happening here.
The European Union wants to become a region of growth and competitiveness, and the Lisbon Process aims to achieve this.
This will be difficult to achieve unless a unified and flexible labour market is established.
Without this, Europe will never achieve the targets for 2010 set out in the Lisbon Process.
If the workforce is not allowed to move to the production capacities, then the production capacities will move to the workforce.
This connection must also be borne in mind.
For this reason, at the end of my speech, please let me ask the Commission to make a statement similar to Mr Vitorinoâs â in the form of a Commission Statement â for removing restrictions, and we call on the Member States to include this matter on the agenda of the next Council Meeting in June, and to take immediate steps to resolve it.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, I agree with you that the citizens of Europe want more Europe and I believe that, with a view to the future, the communication on the values of freedom and security which the Commission is to present to this Parliament should consider two significant aspects.
It is true that we need greater security â as you have quite rightly said â in order to guarantee freedom, but that guarantee must not take the form currently employed by the United States Government, which identifies security with a reduction in freedom.
If we want more Europe we must provide greater guarantees of democratic freedoms and not take the view that through greater security, with greater resources, only by reducing freedoms, will we guarantee that security.
I would like to say that in order to combat terrorism we need intelligence at European level and coordination of police services at European level as well, elements which must be strengthened.
Furthermore, freedoms have been mentioned, and the European Parliament is the highest manifestation of the largest democratic concentration in the world, but I believe it is clear that the freedoms of the peoples, regions and nationalities existing within the European Union must also be guaranteed.
And the European Union must clearly condemn the massacres which are being committed against the Chechen and Kurdish people and must guarantee the rights of Stateless peoples.
The language, culture and identity of peoples and regions must have guarantees.
In this Europe of ours, in certain States of the Union â specifically in our State â in the name of effectively combating terrorism, initiatives have been taken which are not entirely positive, which have allowed democratic newspapers to be closed.
As a Valencian and as a representative of a people which forms part of the European Union, I believe that this Europe of security and freedom must take full account of the national freedoms of the peoples and regions that make up the European Union.
Â Â  Given that we are talking about the issue of security, I shall talk about external security.
I am convinced the task that the new Member States are facing is to prove their ability to have a wider view.
They must prove that they do not see European integration merely in terms of Structural Funds, the importance of which is often overestimated.
They must prove that they do not perceive European integration in terms of their own problems.
They must prove that they are able to understand and to take responsibility for the further development of European integration.
When we talk about security, we should bear in mind that our security is influenced by our immediate surroundings, by our neighbouring countries, by North African countries and by the Middle East.
These are countries with millions of inhabitants who look toward the EU as their aim and where millions of potential illegal immigrants live.
These people can easily fall under the influence of fundamentalist and extremist ideology and become themselves tools of terrorism, which is today the number one threat.
If the European Union wants to ensure the security of its citizens it must, amongst other things, make its closest neighbours economically and politically stable by increasing their economic growth, reduce the possibility of migration and reduce the growth of radicalism in these societies.
The European Union must use a new financial framework to re-evaluate its development aid policy, and must use adequate resources to ensure that those resources are used effectively.
These are real issues and real problems that must be solved. I am very worried that the abstract intellectual exercises in compiling documents, such as the European Constitution, will not help us greatly in solving these problems.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, Commissioner, it is an honour for me, as the youngest member of the European Socialists, and as a Member of the European Parliament from Hungary and Karcag, to have an opportunity to express my views on a subject that it would not have been possible to discuss 15 years ago.
Not only because a 15-year old would have had difficulty in becoming a Member of the European Parliament, but also because at that time we did not see the slightest possibility of Hungary becoming a member of the secure and free region provided by the European Union.
In the twenty-first century, our freedom and our security have often been in irreconcilable conflict with each other.
Everybody would like to avoid challenges that threaten the security of oneâs nation, but nobody wants to damage our civil, political and social rights won during the eighteenth century and strengthened by many revolutions, including the 1848 and 1956 Hungarian revolutions.
It is difficult to solve these conflicts, but I believe that the Members of the enlarged European Union, together with the citizens of Europe, will be able to find the answers.
The European area of security and the Schengen Agreement provide protection for us.
At the same time, we must not forget that the borders of Europe are not the same as the borders of the European Union.
In our efforts to make the Union safe, we must not ignore our solidarity with those nations whose representatives do not sit here with us at the moment.
Europe, and within Europe, the European Union will only be able to become a great and strong community if its responsibility to ensure its safety goes hand in hand with its unquenchable desire for freedom as well.
Ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to talk to you now about the Hungariansâ commitment to freedom, because you all know my people.
I have often been asked what we Hungarians bring with us into the European Union.
Among many other things, we bring our faith and our readiness to act for a Europe that is free, secure and based on solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, I would also like to pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Vitorino over the last five years.
He really has been a splendid Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs.
I hope we will see more of him, not least because he would help us achieve in justice and home affairs the equivalent of the Lisbon objective to make Europe the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world.
Why do we not have a parallel formal objective, perhaps the Tampere objective, to make the enlarged European Union the international beacon of human rights, protection of civil liberties and keeping people safe?
In justice and home affairs there is not the same sense of zeal from ministers about promoting freedom as about promoting security.
Security is an aspect of freedom because no-one who is unsafe is free, but freedom is also an element in security and no-one is secure if their privacy is invaded or they are wrongly imprisoned or subject to discrimination.
But the Council has failed to speak out against Guantanamo Bay internment and is trying to impose an agreement with the US on air passenger data transfers in breach of European data protection laws.
It has also allowed restrictions on freedom of movement, as my Hungarian colleague has said.
In the accession treaties there is a JHA safeguard clause, but it is focused exclusively on monitoring implementation of mutual recognition measures and framework decisions in criminal law.
There is no clause which will check whether asylum seekers are being left destitute, equal rights are being denied to gay and lesbian people, or ethnic minority people are being abused.
We must have a mechanism of ongoing peer review whereby we have mutual monitoring of the quality of Member States' justice systems.
On immigration we need much better management in the future.
Member States have agreed most of the common asylum policy, but have lowered standards of protection to do so.
Very little is agreed for streamlining the red tape for legal migrants and there is an alarming absence of progressive and active engagement in how to respect diversity and have imaginative integration policies.
The ceremony of raising the ten new flags yesterday was wonderful and moving, but the image it presented was exclusively white.
In my city, one-third of the population is from ethnic minorities.
We have to do better to serve our whole population with just and inclusive policies.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much agree with the last speaker.
In the wake of September 11 much oppressive legislation has been forced through.
This is a major problem because it seems that the rule of law is being pushed aside in the fight against terrorism.
If you push the rule of law aside and ignore it you are in effect allowing the terrorists to win on another front.
Today we had to vote for the third time on what was basically the same issue.
This is very alarming because it showed that there was much unwillingness within the Council to accept the democratic will of Parliament: it obviously hoped that if it asked us enough times it would get the answer it wanted.
In relation to the PNR issue, it is extremely important that citizens have the right to data protection.
We should have the same rights as US citizens if there is any agreement, that is fundamental.
Regarding the issue of Christianity versus Islam there is a major problem.
This is not acceptable.
Europe has to allow all people to live freely within society, whether they are Muslim, Christian or of no religious belief.
Everybody should be entitled to equal rights.
There is a lot of hypocrisy regarding people from the new Member States.
All 15 of the 'old' Member States have introduced measures restricting the rights of the new countries' citizens coming in as regards whether they can get jobs, travel or benefit from social services in the 'old' Member States.
This is creating double standards, which is a major problem.
Finally, on the issue of third country nationals, we have a major problem throughout the European Union with this 'Fortress Europe' mentality, keeping out the so-called non-desirables: non-whites, non-westerners or non-Christians.
In all countries we have a major problem with more and more oppressive legislation being introduced.
Even things like the Geneva Convention are being pushed aside in the interests of keeping people out of Europe.
We have to take down the barriers.
We have to allow Europe to be open and we must help these people.
We have to look at why they are fleeing from their own countries.
That is the way to look at peace, security and justice for all.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise to say a few words of farewell.
That will probably make many people happy and it might make some sad.
It does not make me necessarily glad but, because of now leading the largest party in Northern Ireland, I have more duties at home and I feel I must attend to them, especially at this time when certain talks are taking place.
For the past 25 years I have been a Member of this House, elected at the top of the poll from Northern Ireland.
I have been gratified to have the largest amount of votes cast for any person elected to this Parliament.
Its rapid growth of jurisdiction is the political mystery of the age.
However, I do not believe it is to the best advantage of the European peoples.
Enlargement has triggered the destruction of the cooperation of the sovereign states of Europe and brought about the construction of the sovereign superstate of Europe, the new Tower of Babel.
The effects of the full battle between the voluntary cooperation of the European sovereign states and the dictatorial incorporation of those states into the European superstate have yet to be witnessed.
In our history superpowers have always been detrimental to peace.
The wars in the Balkans in recent years have been conveniently forgotten when fiery advocates of an almighty Europe tell us the new Europe has prevented and stopped wars.
Some prevention, and some stopping.
The present enlargement is bringing with it loads of difficulties, generally in the economic field and particularly in the agricultural field.
Just how serious the reaping in Europe is going to be remains to be seen.
The day has yet to declare it.
I especially welcome the fact that the United Kingdom will have its referendum and that the ordinary European citizens in the United Kingdom will not be robbed of their right to pass their judgement on this momentous decision.
The continent of Europe is not our fatherland and never can be.
The nationalities of Europe are not changed, they are the creation of God.
No matter what sinful man may do, God has enthroned his son King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
He is the King of the whole Earth and he shall reign and rule forever more.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to correct you.
I believe that the Minutes will show that my colleague MrÂ Pirker has given up his two minutes so that I have four minutes.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the eastern enlargement of our European Union on 1Â May, to what are now 25 countries did not happen overnight, but was a ten-year-long process, which demanded an enormous amount both of the old European Union as well as of the new Member States.
In the area of justice and home affairs, many citizens of the old EU Member States were afraid of a higher crime rate after enlargement.
Here, however, the accession negotiations, as well as an enormous amount of cooperation on the part of the new Member States themselves, have enabled us to achieve a great deal.
Who would have thought, ten years ago, that one day German and Polish border guards would together control their borders in joint teams?
The new Member States were also very successful in the area of combating national crime, and so the old Member States often had to abandon their prejudices.
Faced with more and more further threats, specifically from international terrorism, we must, in the future, act even more as Europeans.
After the attacks of 11Â September in New York, we saw what was, unfortunately, a one-off advance in our common justice and home affairs policy, with a great deal decided on in record time: the European Arrest Warrant, a single definition of terrorism, which included a framework for penalties and the freezing of all funds for terrorist purposes.
Unfortunately, after just a year, interest was already waning and we in this House did not even manage to strengthen the Europol structure for combating terrorism.
Once again, nations went it alone, and national plotting came to the fore; only after the tragic Madrid bombings did the issue once again appear at the top of our agenda.
In the Council, the position of Terrorism Coordinator was quickly created, unfortunately without any real powers.
The measures that we adopted after 11Â September 2001 â that is, almost two and a half years ago â have still not been implemented in the Member States.
The upshot is that Parliament and the European Union have done our homework but the Member States have not and so the next important questions are already on the agenda for a now enlarged Union.
Our visa policy must be harmonised and must include the creation of a visa information system.
Border protection standards must be unified and controlled by a European border protection agency and the second generation Schengen Information System must finally be completed.
Europol must be even more closely involved in the national fight against crime and be given more manpower, and we urgently need the European Public Prosecutor, in order to effectively combat the defrauding of the European Union.
Within this framework, the new Member States must take even more decisive action against corruption than has been the case to date.
Cooperation with third countries must also be stepped up since terrorism must be combated, not just in Europe, but also across the world.
We have, in this legislative period, achieved a number of things for the safety of European citizens.
A great deal fell through, though, as a result of the need for unanimity in the Council and because of national egoisms.
This is why there is hardly a content area for which the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty is so important as that of justice and home affairs policy.
The EU of 25 Member States will in future only be in a position to effectively combat terrorism and organised crime if we implement simpler and more transparent procedures.
The Council in particular must change over to majority voting.
In addition, whilst this Treaty is in place, the budget should be significantly increased, since not just agriculture and economic structures, but also safety, cost money.
To this end, I hope for constructive and specially focused cooperation in the newly elected Parliament.
You deserve our thanks, Commissioner Vitorino.
We did not always agree on asylum issues, but we always gave you great support where justice and home affairs policy was concerned and I hope it was this that brought forth applause from the Left, since that shows that in the future we will be in a position to act together and be stronger than we were before.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all I should like to welcome the first decision taken today by the enlarged European Parliament, which rejected the Council's effort to re-table the issue of the conclusion of an agreement on the processing and transmission of personal data on European passengers from airline companies to the US State Department.
The question of freedom and security in the Europe of the twenty-five, which we are debating today, is directly linked, Commissioner, to the security of the Olympic Games being organised in Greece this summer.
The holding of the Games under conditions of security has always been the only headache, even from ancient times, which is why the truce was the most serious part of the preparations, so that athletes and spectators could arrive at Olympia in safety.
I believe, even if this sounds romantic, that the promotion of the idea of the truce in modern times and the education of people in peaceful coexistence would cost far less and would have more permanent results than strengthening the forces of suppression and the use of military means.
For the Europe of the twenty-five, the 2004 Olympic Games are a golden opportunity to promote the idea of the truce at global level, by which I mean the ideals of peace, cooperation and dialogue and the rejection of violence as a means of resolving differences.
Unfortunately, the reality of the modern world speaks of the intensification of blind violence, hatred and terrorism.
The publication of photographs showing prisoners in Iraq being tortured and humiliated demonstrates the extent of the brutalisation and barbarity which involvement in wars and acts of violence can generate in man.
At the same time, it demonstrates the degree of freedom of the press which we have achieved and must maintain.
Commissioner, nearly three years since the attack on the twin towers, not only has terrorism not been eradicated, but it also appears to be creating conditions of brutalisation for those who belong to modern democracies and are supposed to be defended with fundamental freedoms and human rights.
Will the political leaders realise that a different strategy for dealing with terrorism and strengthening security is needed?
The European Union of the twenty-five needs to offer an alternative proposal, a new vision and to reply to the crucial question of whether there can be security on a planet with huge inequalities in economic and social development and in the distribution of the benefits of democracy, science and technology.
For the strengthening of security in the European Union, for a more secure world, we certainly need fresh, alternative, non-military policies and strategies and a stronger role for citizens, especially women.
We hope that the new European Constitution will be approved soon and will constitute the democratic framework which will strengthen fundamental freedoms and security in Europe and the world.
Finally, I too should like, Commissioner, to congratulate you on the exceptional work you are doing as Commissioner to promote the area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union, an endeavour which has, unfortunately, proven to be far more difficult than the creation of the single market and the common currency.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, in our solemn speeches, we say that we are all minorities in the EU.
What is good about this is that no one can bully any other group.
The monitoring of minority rights was an important part of the negotiations on enlargement, yet there is no policy for linguistic minorities in the EU.
We have demanded more of the present candidate countries than we did of previous ones.
The situation in Cyprus following the referendum was also the most recent demonstration of the need we have for minimum rules governing the way in which ethnic and linguistic minorities are treated and governing the rights that must exist.
It is therefore important that respect for diversity be a feature of the adopted Constitution and that the EU subscribe not only to the Council of Europeâs Convention on Human Rights but also to the Council of Europeâs conventions on minorities: both the framework convention and the Charter for Regional Languages.
In that way, the EU would quickly obtain a yardstick for policy in relation to minorities.
It should be possible to deal with infringements of minority rights in accordance with ArticleÂ 7 of our present Treaty, in which case a Member Stateâs own rights would be revoked if it infringed minority rights.
It is now time for the EU to go the whole way and recognise linguistic diversity, as well as possessing a genuine strategy for respecting such diversity.
Â Â  â Like the speakers before me, I am delighted to be speaking here for the first time.
I will not be making any particular reference to our national situation in Latvia, nor will I talk about minorities â there will be time for that on other occasions â but about Europe as a whole.
Freedom without security is not conceivable, as we have already heard, but the threats to freedom today are of quite a different nature to what they were in the recent past. If the threat to freedom previously came mainly from other countries, nowadays that is no longer the case in Europe.
The European Union in itself is proof of this.
The threat to freedom comes from within our country â violence is increasing, organised crime, terrorism and corruption are the most direct threats to freedom, to various human rights.
For a long time now the criminal world has not recognised borders, so cooperation between various security bodies in the European Union, as well as beyond its borders, is especially important.
The European Parliament must do everything in its power to ensure this cooperation.
The sense of menace to the individual is today no longer slight.
We must not allow a situation where fear is the defining factor in people's thought and action, where we would be prepared to yield, to compromise with those who do not respect us, because of fear.
In order to guarantee human freedoms, sacrifices must be borne.
Only by certain curbs on freedom can security be achieved.
If, in our discussions of how far freedom ought to be restricted for the sake of security, we keep our ideals in mind â and these discussions should never end â then we will be on the right path.
Â Â  â The European Union â and today I finally have the right to say âour unionâ â has been transformed from an economic union into what we call a union âbased on valuesâ.
The increasing diversity of cultures, languages and religions is undoubtedly one of those basic values.
Human rights are universal and they must be extended to everyone without any discrimination on the grounds of sex, age, material status, ethnic origin, mother tongue or citizenship.
The rights of national minorities are an inalienable component of fundamental rights.
Let us be honest, serious problems in this sphere remain in both the old and the new Member States, including my own country, Latvia.
These issues were included in the Copenhagen criteria for accession.
Experience will show how successfully these criteria are met, but what will happen next?
I believe that we must move on from the rhetoric of human rights to a permanent and practical involvement, we must achieve the adoption of mechanisms for monitoring legally binding statutes and their implementation.
A very important step in this direction has already been taken.
It has already been mentioned today that the draft Constitution included a Charter of Fundamental Rights and that the draft Constitution makes reference to minority rights.
In particular the adoption of a Directive on racial equality must be noted.
These, however, are just the first steps.
I am looking at the theme of our discussion today, Freedom and security for Union citizens Within the area of European freedom and security, freedom, security and equality must be provided for all â even refugees, immigrants and guest workers.
We have a big job ahead of us.
I believe that we, the elected representatives of Europeans, in cooperation with other European organisations, primarily the Council of Europe, will be able to successfully resolve this extremely important challenge.
Â Â  Commissioner, as you know, organised crime is growing very strongly.
It is mainly based outside the Union, but it is attacking our citizens and can cross internal frontiers inside the Union with total facility.
There are record amounts of heroin coming in, cocaine, attacks on the Internet increasing every day, trafficking of illegal immigrants, of women and of children.
There are vast amounts of money laundering, enormous quantities of counterfeit goods and currency hitting us as well.
You know this as well as I. It is very frightening.
However, our law enforcement agencies are only national or local and they cannot cross our internal frontiers.
National politicians do not get credit for fighting crime outside their own countries.
All in all, we are failing to fight international organised crime and that is why it is getting stronger.
I have just presented you with a pamphlet.
I also gave the press a copy this afternoon at a press conference.
It is called 'Europe Needs an FBI'.
Commissioner, I echo the other sentiments â you have been a very good Commissioner in this area.
I hope, whether you stay here or go on to something else, that you will help to stir the national politicians who so far have lacked the will to muster the necessary weapons to fight international crime.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first want to say how grateful I am to President Pat Cox for inviting President Lech Walesa to yesterdayâs flag-raising ceremony at the flagpoles in my home town of Gdansk.
Mr Walesa symbolises the changes leading to political freedom in Europe.
The current enlargement of the European Union means that 450 million citizens now find themselves in an area of incomparably greater freedom, security, stability, and progress.
The Unionâs offer of the opportunity of membership to the former Communist countries induced the latter to accomplish the huge task of reform in order to meet higher standards such as the Copenhagen standards.
This demonstrates that the clear offer of such an opportunity can influence the entire domestic and foreign policy of a country seeking to join the Community.
It therefore constitutes one of the most effective instruments at the Unionâs disposal, and can result in increasing the range of freedoms available to its citizens and their security.
There is, however, a risk that following the current enlargement, the European Union may concentrate solely or mainly on strengthening the integration process instead of exerting an effective influence on its neighbours.
This should not happen.
The new Member States, including Poland, could be very helpful in this regard.
I therefore wish to emphasise the urgency of introducing a bold policy with regard to areas to the south and east of the European Union.
This includes Turkey.
Despite the many current political, cultural, and economic concerns, we should keep membership open to all those willing to fulfil the criteria for joining the European Union.
Finally, I would like to highlight that the policy of increasing freedom and security we are discussing here today and about which Commissioner Vitorino spoke, is provided for by the provisions of the draft Constitutional Treaty.
I have in mind ArticleÂ 58, concerning the European Union and its immediate vicinity, as well as the provisions on the crucial pillars respecting freedom and security.
I would therefore like to state that in my opinion, this draft should be implemented as quickly as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, over the last five years the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice has constituted a large part of the work of the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and we can certainly say that there have been major reforms and tangible progress towards granting increasingly extensive rights to citizens.
Now, as several of my fellow Members have said, the borders of this new European Union have expanded eastwards and down towards the Mediterranean Sea.
Well, we must transfer the experience we have gained and the actions we have taken to these new borders in order, above all, to guarantee citizensâ safety: Schengen will be an acceptable development only when we have firm guarantees, firmer than those we currently have.
Border control is a joint problem, and we must again stress that it is not a private concern for individual outer States.
The instruments to put these synergies into practice are called Europol and Eurojust, which we must support with conviction and, in brief, with adequate resources.
Only in this way can we fight, all together, the dangers threatening the area of freedom, security and justice: illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings, prostitution, drugs and organised crime multinationals; at the top of the list, though, is one obligation: the fight against terrorism.
Lastly, there is a challenge, possibly just as important, waiting for those who will be here during the next parliamentary term: attainment of true European citizenship, swift asylum procedures and truly free and equal freedom of movement for all.
Allow me, in concluding this speech and my time in Parliament, to thank CommissionerÂ Vitorino, flattery aside.
When I arrived here in 1994, I was told that to be a good MEP I would have to criticise and perhaps argue with the Commission every day.
I did not manage this: either I am not a good MEP, MrÂ Vitorino, or you are a good Commissioner.
I think the correct answer is the latter.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has entered an historic new phase with a total population of over 450Â million inhabitants.
Our Union, now enlarged to twenty-five countries, has greater political, geographical and economic substance.
We have begun to share our common interests, both in the area of the economy and the internal market, and in terms of the responsibilities that we face as regards the threats to stability and security, which are not confined to borders.
I refer to terrorism, organised crime, illegal immigration, drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings.
The question of terrorism is an alarming problem that we currently face and should be given maximum priority.
This is a threat to security, to our democracies and to the foundations of our civilisation; more specifically respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, respect for the law and respect for human rights are under threat.
The European Union must do all that it can to protect its citizens, to tighten border controls and to improve security as regards travel documents, by introducing biometric data and by establishing visa systems and the Schengen Information System (SIS-II).
Nevertheless, I should once again like to highlight at this juncture that, if security is to be strengthened, this must always be in compliance with the other two components of our European area, which are freedom and justice.
1Â May also saw great change in the area of Justice and Home Affairs.
A new institutional framework is now in force: in the area of visas, asylum and immigration, codecision with Parliament will enter into force, as will qualified majority voting in the Council.
Parliamentâs role will, hopefully, result in greater efficiency in addressing the repeated delays on the Councilâs part, which many speakers, including Mr von Boetticher, have highlighted here.
Commissioner Vitorino, who is here today, deserves praise for his excellent work in this area and his positive attitude towards working together with Parliament.
It is my wish that the excellent work that he has done here helps him to rise to even higher responsibilities in our Community of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, the right to freedom of movement, that is, the right to select oneâs place of residence, both in the professional and in the private sense, is one of the many important fundamental freedoms and rights enjoyed by the Unionâs citizens from the beginning of its existence.
This right, this freedom, is enshrined in the Treaties.
It is also contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and has its own very practical dimensions.
I refer to the abolition of internal border controls and to the elimination of all administrative barriers to settling and taking up work anywhere in the territory of the entire Union.
From the first of May, citizens of the new Member States may travel throughout the Union without passports.
They have been quick to exercise this right, and have enjoyed doing so from the very first day.
This has given them a real feeling of belonging to the Community, even if they still have to produce identity cards at the borders.
The citizens of the new Member States of the Union understand that a partial restriction on their rights to free movement is justified, until their governments are ready for full integration into the Schengen information system.
The same cannot be said for the restrictions introduced by several governments concerning access to labour markets.
There is no rational justification for these decisions.
They are based entirely on exaggerated fears or cold political calculations with the next elections to national parliaments in mind.
There is no empirical evidence that an immense wave of citizens from the new countries will flood into the old Member States of the European Union in search of work.
Studies by independent research centres presented by Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, for example, suggest quite the opposite.
Over the course of the next five years, economic migration from the new countries of the Union to the old should not exceed 1% of the population of the ten new Members.
The experience of previous enlargements suggests enlargement caused a reduction in the number of economic migrants, rather than an increase.
This is what will happen this time.
The citizens of the new Member States want to find work in their own countries, and they believe that membership of the Union will help them to do so.
I therefore take this opportunity to appeal for restrictions on access to labour markets to be lifted as quickly as possible.
This would certainly not be a disaster for the old countries.
Further, the new Members of the Union would see it as a tangible sign that they too may enjoy the full rights and freedoms available to the citizens of the entire European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, as a member of the Convention on the future of Europe, I participated in the development of the Constitutional Treaty.
May I therefore take this opportunity to express the hope that the new Constitutional Treaty will be adopted this year and that the procedures for endorsing the Constitutional Treaty in the Member States will take place within a reasonable time span.
As a member of the Convention I particularly wanted the Charter of human rights and freedoms to become an integral part of the Constitutional Treaty.
This is not only important for the sake of the Charter itself and its meaning in the European Union but because it has a special symbolic meaning for those of us who come from the former socialist States.
It is also important for the Eurosceptics, who can see that the range of human rights and freedoms is generally more extensive than it is in our constitutions.
I do think, however, that the Slovenian constitution is particularly good.
At the same time this is a clear sign that we have joined a community of democratic States which respect and safeguard human rights and freedoms.
I see Europe as a flourishing community, in which peace, prosperity and the security of people and property are not merely political slogans but a reality.
We must do everything to ensure that terrorism and crime do not grow but are fundamentally reduced.
We do not need large, new bureaucratic organisations at the level of the European Union, but we do need increased cooperation between police forces in the Member States.
As far as possible we need to establish a uniform policy in the fight against terrorism and crime and to increase the effectiveness of our security services through joint action.
It is also important that we cooperate in controlling the external borders of the European Union effectively and that balanced assistance is given to those States that bear the greatest burden in this respect.
Slovenia is a peaceful and safe country where people can walk the streets of our cities safely even during the hours of darkness.
It is well-known that in many places in Europe it is not safe to do so.
I therefore express the expectation that in addition to taking care of economic, scientific and general social development, the European Union will pay particular attention to the security of its citizens and the protection of their property.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will be very brief.
Firstly, on a personal level, I would like to thank those Members of Parliament who addressed kind words to me.
It has been a privilege for me to be the first Commissioner for justice and home affairs.
It has been a very rewarding experience to cooperate so closely and so fruitfully with this Parliament, and especially with the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
This is not just a question of faith.
It is a question of deep belief that the area of freedom, security and justice will, in the years to come, be in the driving seat of the European integration process.
I am sure that Members of Parliament will go back to their electorates in June and feel proud of the work they have done in this area over the last five years.
Finally, Mr President, due to the fact that you personally have chaired most of the meetings I have attended in this Parliament, I feel privileged to that you have been my private chairman!
Thank you so much.
Â Â  The cordial atmosphere in the Chamber is plain to see.
I can also testify to the outstanding cooperation Parliament has always enjoyed with Commissioner Vitorino and I add my congratulations to those offered by everyone else.
I should like to say, very briefly, that it has been a pleasure and also a great honour to chair this sitting of Parliament, which has been attended by the representatives of the citizens of 25 countries.
The debate is now closed.
The next sitting will take place tomorrow, Wednesday 5 May from 10Â a.m. to 1Â p.m.

Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order.
I wanted to raise this point yesterday, but you did not authorise me to intervene.
I want to draw your attention and that of Parliament to the fact that on 29 April the Council signed two legislative acts without having had the opinion of the European Parliament, the pretext being that it had fixed a deadline which we had not respected.
I want to point out that the same pre-emptive deadline has been fixed for today on the draft agreement with the United States on the air passenger data transfers â the so-called PNR agreement.
To avoid the will of Parliament being negated, I request that you send a formal request to the Presidents of the Council and the Commission that they should abstain from taking any decisions before the Court has given its judgment, especially during this electoral period.
This would be the minimum that we could expect in the framework of loyal cooperation between the institutions.
The delay should not be too long because the Court has already announced a deadline of 6 June for the parties to present their arguments and it seems that the Court is speeding up its proceedings and may well reach a judgment before the summer.
In those circumstances, it does not seem too much to ask that the Council and the Commission should respect both our institution and the Court of Justice, and not undermine the rule of law, given that the Court is willing to progress speedily.
I fear these two precedents on 29 April.
I ask you to invite them formally to abstain from signing the agreement.
Â Â  . Mr President, I share Mrs Ludford's view.
I will not repeat what she said. I only want to draw your attention to the fact that yesterday, I wrote a letter to Mr Gargani, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to remind him of the debate held in that committee on 6 April, in which we decided to set the Court procedure in motion.
In that debate, however, another procedure was discussed, in the event that neither the Council nor the Commission would take Parliament's opinion into consideration.
Last night, there was insufficient time to discuss this letter, but the chairman promised me to take note of it and deal with it effectively.
To be on the safe side, I shall also e-mail it to you.
If the Council goes ahead and signs all the same, then I think we should start a different procedure.
I wanted to draw your attention to that.
Â Â  Although the House was somewhat divided on the issue, the majority was consistent in the different votes that have been held on it over the last two-part-sessions.
It therefore seems appropriate that I should remind the other institutions of the concerns of the House in this regard and inform them of the points made here today.
I shall do so this week.
Â Â  Mr President, at last night's meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the chairman, Mr Gargani, and the committee agreed that they wished to stand by the substance of the committee's recommendation to you of 15 April that action should be taken against the Commission for failure to act as regards answering the questions concerning Lloyd's.
Â Â  Thank you Mr Perry.
I shall write to MrÂ Gargani today and copy that correspondence to you.
Â Â  Mr President, you announced during yesterdayâs part-session, 4Â May, that in accordance with Rule 185 of the Rules of Procedure, written declarations that have not received the signatures of a majority of Members and written questions that have not received an answer, and so on, will be deemed to have lapsed.
In this respect, you are basing your position on Rule 185, which states, âAt the end of the last part-session before elections, all Parliamentâs unfinished business will be deemed to have lapsed subject to the provisions of the second paragraph of this Ruleâ.
The third paragraph of the same Rule states, âThese provisions shall not apply to petitions and communications that do not require a decisionâ.
What questions addressed by a Member of this House to the Commission and the Council require is an answer rather than a decision.
We cannot therefore regard all those questions that have yet to receive an answer as having lapsed.
Dismissing political questions out of hand, some of which are extremely important, makes life easier for the Commission and the Council.
Politics abhors a vacuum.
Parliament will continue to function until the new Parliament is up and running, and so will the Commission.
There is no reason why it cannot answer all of the questions that have been asked today.
