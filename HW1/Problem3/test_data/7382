In conclusion, I would like to express satisfaction that only 8% of the investigations instigated by the Ombudsman related to the European Parliament, while almost 66% related to the European Commission.
(SV) Thank you Madam President.
The Ombudsman's criticism regarding a lack of transparency is necessary and badly needed criticism.
I also welcome Parliament's proposal that the Ombudsman should carry out a study of the practical impact of critical remarks that were made, inter alia, in relation to the Commission.
Certainly, Parliament is often touchingly united in criticising other institutions, but there is actually good reason for Parliament also to be self-critical.
The Ombudsman has recently asked Parliament to disclose information on payments received by MEPs for travel and for employing staff, but Parliament has refused to disclose the information, taking the view that it is a breach of data protection.
I believe that this is merely putting up a smokescreen, and I have the support of the European Data Protection Supervisor when I say this.
Payments to staff are obviously public documents.
It is time for Parliament to come clean on payments.
Only those who employ staff on slave-type contracts and other strange contracts have something to fear from more transparency.
It surely cannot be the case that any Members here are afraid of not being re-elected in 2009 if it emerges in the media how employees are treated in certain cases, I say in certain cases.
Thank you.
(EL) Madam President, I should, of course, like to mention that we are examining the 10th report by the Ombudsman, who in 2006 received 3 889 letters or e-mails of complaint, 3 619 of which were sent by individual members of the public.
Of the 3 889 complaints, 3 051 were outside the mandate.
In other words, there were, in a single year, a total of 838 complaints within the mandate.
I therefore think that the Ombudsman's department is large enough in terms of staff and resources to handle 838 complaints, which, of course, mainly concern matters of maladministration by the Commission and the European Personnel Selection Office, and to a lesser degree the European Parliament and the Council.
It is of course commendable that the Ombudsman publishes a list of best administrative practices.
I do not know, however, whether his department allows citizens to make complaints about the operation of his own department.
I regret that the report by the Committee on Petitions refers us only to the European Personnel Selection Office, and not to the European Ombudsman, who until now has not carried out an ex officio scrutiny of his department.
We are therefore requesting not a change in the Ombudsman's Statute, but rather a strengthening of the rights that we already accord him.
This should allow him to show due respect for citizens, be very active in the correct administration of European institutions, and respect the personal data of citizens, Members of the European Parliament, and employees who are required to maintain secrecy.
The European Court of Justice should operate independently, without the Ombudsman's intervention, and there should be respect for the effective international agencies that operate independently to protect fundamental rights.
Our support for the European Ombudsman is not without limits.
Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, and Ms Sbarbati for their excellent work on the Ombudsman's report.
It is important that this debate is taking place at a prime time in Parliament's plenary working day, at a time when it can have a high public profile.
The service that the Ombudsman provides is extremely important for the citizen: it enhances the positive connection between Europe's institutions and the citizen and enriches the legitimacy of the work we do in the institutions, whether it is in Parliament, the Commission or the Council.
The service continues to evolve and that is pointed up quite well in Ms Sbarbati's report, where she makes various suggestions, and the Ombudsman himself makes various suggestions, as to how it could continue to improve.
Certainly, the idea of broadening relations with mediators who deal with issues regarding minors and children is an important development.
At the same time, there is resistance in the system: resistance to transparency, resistance to a common code of administrative practice for all the institutions and resistance, as well, to updating the mandate of the Ombudsman.
I believe the European Parliament should take a more active role, for instance, in dealing with the transparency issue, and I support the Ombudsman's call for Parliament to be more transparent in the publication of allowances paid to Members.
(PL) Madam President, the activities of the European Ombudsman give EU citizens the feeling that they have some protection against inappropriate actions taken by EU institutions.
The material presented raises some issues.
The first of these is that the largest number of complaints submitted to the Ombudsman relates to the European Commission, the European Personnel Selection Office and the European Parliament.
The failure of European institutions, with the exception of the Ombudsman, to implement the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour in accordance with the 2001 Resolution of the European Parliament may be a contributory factor.
The second issue is that 78.5% of the matters submitted to the Ombudsman fall outside his competence, and 93.7% of these complaints do not relate to EU bodies or institutions.
This would indicate that our citizens do not have sufficient information about the work of the Ombudsman or that, for various reasons, they are unable to get important issues dealt with in their own countries.
This matter needs to be investigated.
The third issue is that the Ombudsman should have the powers that are necessary quickly to remove bad administrative practices that give rise to complaints.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report.
Madam President, I would like to welcome our visitors, the citizens, to this debate.
I hope that they understand what the Ombudsman is about, following his very detailed presentation of twelve months' work in a very short space of time.
It is a pity that the Ombudsman receives so many cases that it is not within his competence to resolve, but I understand that these are redirected to the appropriate places.
It is important to say that to people listening to this debate.
Those cases do not fall by the wayside, but are sent in the right direction.
That you are dealing with a certain number of cases and bringing about a resolution is positive, but we need to do a bit more work to educate people about what you do and how you do it, in order to bring even more cases to your desk.
That would do no harm, because I am sure the small number you deal with does not truly reflect the problems of maladministration.
Turning to the Commission, I quite like the idea of a culture of service, but I am not sure that the Commission uses the carrot and stick approach internally to make sure that there is indeed a culture of service.
This is something that should be done through legislation.
Are there penalties for divisions or individuals involved in maladministration when it comes to citizens?
Perhaps that is something we could have a closer look at.
I like the idea of putting forward the star performers and the worst performers so that we can have that comparison, but at the end of the day what people want is results and positive outcomes.
I keep saying to people in Ireland that the Committee on Petitions does not have huge power, but that through the work we do we can act as a pressure point for action.
I wish we had more power, but at least we can use that little bit of pressure to bring about results for citizens.
They are not interested in the process. They just want positive outcomes.
Mr Diamandouros, I wish you well in your activities this year and hope you continue in the same way as in the past.
I will certainly work in Ireland to make sure that we know a lot more about you in the future.
(ES) Madam President, I would like first to thank Mr Diamandouros for his report and to acknowledge the enormous amount of work being done by Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, and to congratulate Mrs Sbarbati on her pertinent report which will act as our guide to assessing the improvements we anticipate for 2007 and 2008.
We welcome the content of the current report, which shows that the task of the European Ombudsman has become established and has bedded in; it also shows increased contact with authorities and with citizens.
Personally, I particularly welcome the agreement with the current Government of Spain on the use of co-official languages - Basque, Catalan and Gallego, as this will bring the citizens of Spain closer to their rights without diminishing the functionality of Spanish, which will prove very useful in future contacts with third country nationals.
There are, however, other aspects noted by Mr Diamandouros himself, which are a source of concern: more than 75% of complaints are not about European competences but national or regional competences.
We therefore take the view that it is a matter of great urgency to strengthen the communication strategy of the European Network of Ombudsmen so that this can be put right.
Another problem highlighted is the fall in instances of maladministration concluded by friendly agreement or consensus.
We supporters of the Ombudsman urge him to improve his know-how and recover his effectiveness in this route.
Persuasion is better than force.
Finally I shall only add that it would be ironic if the legitimate ambition of the current Ombudsman to apply the Code of Administrative Conduct led him to be more diligent outside his home than within it.
(MT) Thank you, Madam President.
The office of Ombudsman is today well established and I would like to congratulate it on its good work.
We now need to look ahead to ensure that the tools that citizens have at their disposal for seeking redress are clear, known to all and function more efficiently.
At present there is too much confusion regarding where citizens should go when they want to make a complaint.
Some appeal to the Committee on Petitions, some to the Commission, some to the Ombudsman, and some appeal to everyone, which results in a great deal of confusion, duplicated work and unnecessary expenses that could all be avoided.
There is therefore a need, as Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m rightly said, for better coordination between the institutions that hear and make decisions on complaints.
For example, there should be a clear commitment regarding the time within which these agencies must reply to citizens once they receive their complaints, and also a commitment regarding the maximum length of time they can take to give a definitive reply.
We still hear all too often about complaints that were lodged years before and are still pending.
As my colleague Ms McGuinness has stated, when a complaint is sent to the wrong agency, that agency should not send a negative reply but should itself pass the complaint on to the correct agency.
Finally, when a citizen formulates his complaint in an unclear manner, because, after all, not all citizens are lawyers, a greater effort should be made to ensure that whoever receives the complaint gives the complainant the benefit of the doubt and does not automatically consider the complaint inadmissible.
I think we have taken huge steps forward and once again I would like to congratulate the Ombudsman, but we still have a lot more to do.
Thank you very much.
(PL) I would like to express my satisfaction that the European Ombudsman fulfils his functions in a balanced and dynamic manner, both in the consideration of complaints, which numbered 3830 in 2006, and in running and completing investigations.
Also encouraging are the good relations between the Ombudsman and EU bodies and institutions, as well as the encouragement given to citizens to exercise their rights.
As we are debating this report, I would like to emphasise how important it is to make sure that there are the necessary budget and staffing resources to ensure that citizens receive rapid and objective responses to their questions, complaints and petitions.
It is obvious that all institutions should work in a constructive manner with the Ombudsman at every stage of the procedure, and the Ombudsman should present Parliament with suggestions that, in his view, would help to improve procedures and make this cooperation even more effective.
In congratulating Professor Diamandouros on his achievements as Ombudsman, I would at the same time like to encourage him to continue his efforts and to promote his activities even more, so that, in the eyes of European citizens, he becomes a guarantor of good administration in EU institutions.
(RO) Ten years after the institution of the European Ombudsman was established, I am pleased to find the evolution of its role and activities in the process of protecting the European citizen.
The 2006 activity report proves to us that, nowadays, European citizens benefit from a true competent court where they can defend themselves against any institution and, in fact, prevent and signal their defective operation.
In other words, we speak today about a true instrument of democratic control, performed in an autonomous and transparent manner, which can only be beneficial to the European Union.
Moreover, I am grateful to the European Parliament's Rapporteur for pointing out the aspects to be improved in the Ombudsman's current activity as well.
First of all, I regret the fact that there are still many complaints from citizens who have not obtained the information requested in their own language.
This proves to us that, in Europe, we still have problems in ensuring full linguistic rights and equality among citizens.
We are on the brink of the year 2008, declared the year of intercultural dialogue, and are forced to immediately correct these deficiencies, which are contrary to the European Union's fundamental values.
In my turn, I welcome the European Ombudsman's communication strategy and I emphasize the need to consolidate it.
The current statistics regarding the complaints that continue to exceed the Ombudsman's competence are a sad finding of the unsatisfactory information level of the citizens, as well as of their understanding and knowledge of the Ombudsman's and other institutions' scope of competence.
(PL) Madam President, Mr Ombudsman, first of all I would like to congratulate the Professor on his excellent achievements and his work for democracy and the observance of citizens' rights in the European Union.
The European Ombudsman is one of the principal bodies in the democratic life of the European Union.
He should guard the democratic equality of all European citizens and act as a mediator between citizens and the Community's organs of public administration, which, for various reasons, do not comply with the standards that have been set.
It is encouraging to see the information presented in the report on the Ombudsman's activities in 2006, showing his dynamic involvement in the public life of the Community and his active cooperation with both EU citizens and the administrative bodies of the European Union.
To improve the effectiveness of the Ombudsman's activities it would be worth considering the possibility of preparing lists of best administrative practice, with exemplary or exceptional cases in which the Ombudsman was involved in any given year, as well as a list of the cases where the actions of institutions were less appropriate.
In addition, in order to ensure that the Ombudsman is fully and decisively involved, support should be given to the idea that the Ombudsman should also carry out investigations in the so-called third pillar, that is, Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters, which would also extend to the activities of Europol.
Ombudsman. - Madam President, first of all I wish to thank Ms Sbarbati, the rapporteur for my Annual Report for 2006 at this year's plenary.
I also wish to thank the very large number of Members who, in fact, took the time to comment on my report.
I am deeply grateful for the interest that this expresses and the guidance that it contains.
With respect to Ms Sbarbati, let me just say that I of course worked very closely and intend to continue to work very closely with the Petitions Committee, with which I have excellent relations.
The Petitions Committee and the Ombudsman will continue to be the major instrument through which this august body will also be able to deal with citizens' approaches to the European institutions.
I take note of your remarks.
I can tell you that I have already launched an own-initiative inquiry concerning EPSO, as you know, but I want to announce it to this body.
I also have taken a strong interest and continue to monitor very carefully developments in the European schools.
I wish to thank Ms WallstrÃ¶m for her remarks.
I note that she has recorded the increase in the number of cases where the Commission apologises for instances in which its services have not abided by best practice.
I am very grateful to her for acknowledging that.
I will be meeting with Ms WallstrÃ¶m in the near future, and I will also be meeting with the Directors-General of the Commission and the coordinators of all the services dealing with the Ombudsman, precisely in order to be able to bring about better coordination and better results.
This is an indication of how closely I am working with the Commission, and I hope to be able to elicit better results to report to you next year, and of course to report to citizens.
That includes the infringement, and I will be dealing with that as well.
On a more general point, let me just say that I am very grateful to you for your general support on broad issues like the culture of service, which is very central to my concerns; for your references to the need for more resources for the Ombudsman; for your support on the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and of the Statute; and for your call for greater accountability, which for me of course is extraordinarily important.
I can also let you know that I have launched, as of this year, a concerted effort to reach out to business associations as opposed to individuals, with an eye to better informing them of their rights as well.
Because of the pressure of time, allow me not to switch languages, but first of all to say to Ms McGuinness and also to Ms Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, that I manage to help 70% of the 70% that are outside my mandate.
Therefore, my work involves not only the percentage that is within my mandate, but on top of that there is a great deal of effort being expended by my staff to be able to help every single citizen who comes to us whose concern is outside the mandate, by referring to the appropriate institution, be it at European or national level.
Therefore, this covers 3 830 cases, not 885.
Allow me now to switch languages.
Ombudsman. (EL) Mrs Panayiotopoulos, I want to assure you that the European Ombudsman is fully aware of his obligation to work within the legal limits.
He will, of course, always work according to the basic principle of accountability to Parliament and to you, and at all times he will be acutely aware of his responsibility.
Lastly, I am doing all I can to promote the creation of a national ombudsman in Italy.
I have been there four or five times and I will continue to do so, hoping that we will be able to welcome an Italian national ombudsman into our midst in the near future.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to respond to two direct questions.
The first concerns the reform of the Statute of the Ombudsman.
I can tell you that, very early on, the Ombudsman kept us informed about the work on the new Statute, and we have been in constant touch about this.
Of course, there are some things we could easily approve, but others are more complicated.
The Commission will formally give its opinion only after Parliament makes its proposals.
We have also met with Ms JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki, and we are looking forward to her report with interest.
The other direct question was from Ms McGuinness about the carrot-and-stick approach and whether we applied it.
No, not enough, I would say - or not yet.
But what we have been doing over the last period of time is to create more of a visibility of these issues and also create an ownership within the Commission for every directorate-general and through all the hierarchical levels in the Commission.
I think that creating that sense of responsibility and visibility will help us to encourage and also sometimes to make it known when we are not pleased with how individual officials are dealing with cases.
I think it is rather rarely the case of an individual official making a mistake; it is more about the culture.
This is what we have in the walls, and this is what we have to change now.
I think the reforms we have taken will move us in the right direction.
Let me just finally mention one thing that I hope will be welcomed by the Commission as well as the European Parliament: we are working with citizens' summaries on our proposals.
Again, to come closer to citizens, we also have to express ourselves not in EU jargon but in plain language, and I hope this will help.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) Mrs Sbarbati's report on the European Ombudsman's activities is evidence of her regard for this institution, which was set up under the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 to defend European citizens in the event of maladministration by Community institutions.
The report rightly emphasises certain priorities for the Ombudsman in the future: the importance of cooperating with ombudsmen in the Member States, for example, and the proposal for better internal supervision of how EU bodies are managed.
It also raises two questions, however, which we omit from the European debate at our peril. On the one hand, the Ombudsman's activities must entail a review of the institution's profile and accessibility throughout Europe.
There is, in fact, a downward trend in the number of cases referred to the Ombudsman (3 830 in 2006, a decrease of 2% from 2005), and complaints tend to come from Member States that already have a culture of encouraging people to raise issues with the relevant national institutions.
On the other hand, the report considers the question of extending the Ombudsman's powers (with regard to accessing documents and the unconditional hearing of witnesses).
No amendment to the Statute of the Ombudsman must be allowed to obscure the major role played by Parliament's Committee on Petitions, which draws its legitimacy directly from the ballot box.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.20 and resumed at 11.30)
Origin marking (written declaration): see Minutes
Announcement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents has taken a unanimous decision, which I am relaying to you, addressing myself in particular to the Council.
In the context of its deliberations on the Commission's proposal for the amendment of the Regulation on the funding of European political parties, the Committee of Permanent Representatives decided yesterday to split the Commission's proposal in two and to adopt the necessary amendments to the Financial Regulation in a separate legislative instrument, to be created on the legal basis that applies to amendments to the Financial Regulation.
This would mean that key elements of this legislative process would be taken out of the sphere of parliamentary codecision and that the Commission, contrary to its own convictions, would have to present a new proposal, while it would also be essential, or at least advisable, to consult the Court of Auditors.
The European Parliament calls on the Council to reconsider its decision.
The amendments to the Political Parties Regulation proposed by the Commission are necessary to overcome practical difficulties that have arisen in its application.
They would also make it possible to continue supporting the development at the European level of political foundations, which play an important part in opening political processes to public scrutiny.
For these reasons, it is imperative that the proposed regulation should enter into force very soon.
On 22 October, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted a report expressing willingness to compromise with the Council to pave the way for the rapid adoption of the proposed regulation.
The splitting of this instrument by the Permanent Representatives has thwarted these efforts.
It is legally unnecessary, undermines the Commission's right of initiative, curtails the rights of Parliament, and is likely to cause significant delays.
On behalf of the Conference of Presidents I call on the Council to overturn at ministerial level the decision of the Permanent Representatives.
I have been asked for leave to speak, but there will be no debate thereafter.
Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - (DE) I am extremely grateful to you for this statement, Mr President, and also to the Conference of Presidents.
It is a serious matter when the European Parliament - the chamber of the people at the European level - is excluded from the legislative process relating to a regulation on European political parties.
That is truly a subject that concerns all of us here, whatever our party affiliation.
It is unthinkable that the bureaucracies in some finance ministries and then their governments should decide on this issue rather than the people's representative assembly of the EU.
We should not stand for that!
With regard to the budget for 2008, let me say that the national governments have wishes which they can only fulfil together with us.
When dealing with the 2008 budget, this Parliament should remember what the Council decided yesterday with regard to this Regulation on the European political parties.
Thank you for your statement.
We have not seen the end of this issue.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, as this House will have understood from what you said, Coreper decided to split the Commission's proposal into two legal instruments: one regulation under Article 199, to which codecision applies, to cover political foundations and campaigning, and another regulation under Article 279, which means simple consultation of Parliament and the Court of Auditors to cover the financial derogations.
The Commission opposed that splitting of its proposal for sound legal reasons, but also for political reasons.
The decision introduces uncertainty as regards timing, when we want the proposal to enter into force before the end of this year so that the foundations can be fully functional before 2009.
That was the whole idea behind the proposal.
We also think that the whole proposal should be approved by codecision, under Article 199 of the Treaty.
We regret, therefore, that Coreper decided, against the Commission's will, to reduce Parliament's role in an issue intimately related to Parliament's business, namely the financing of the political parties.
Just 36 hours after the Committee on Constitutional Affairs approved by a very large majority the Commission's proposal, Coreper decided to follow a route which departed from that of the Commission and of Parliament.
However, our destination, I hope, remains the same: approval of the substance of our proposal before the end of this year.
(Applause)
2007 Sakharov Prize (announcement of winner)
Ladies and gentlemen, I have another announcement to make before we move on to the budget.
At its meeting this morning - Thursday, 25 October - the Conference of Presidents unanimously chose the winner of the Sakharov Prize.
For his commitment to the all-too-long-forgotten victims in Darfur, the Conference decided that the prize would be awarded to Salih Mahmoud Osman.
(Applause)
For more than 20 years, Mr Osman, a human-rights lawyer and member of the Sudanese Organisation against Torture, has been defending countless victims of the conflict in Darfur who have been arbitrarily imprisoned, driven from their homes and tortured or who face the death penalty.
His seat in the Sudanese Parliament now enables him to bring their cause to the attention of the international community, though sometimes at great personal sacrifice.
Mr Osman champions the cause of dialogue and justice against violence and tyranny.
Without democracy there can be no justice.
By awarding the Sakharov Prize to Salih Mahmoud Osman, the European Parliament would like to support the work of this courageous man who has become the voice of Darfur and, through him, to support the establishment of the rule of law in Sudan.
The formal presentation of the prize will take place in Strasbourg on Tuesday, 11 December.
In addition, I should like to inform you that the Conference of Presidents was also unanimous in its view that we should consider an appropriate way to honour the murdered Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, and ...
(Applause)
... the Conference of Presidents will decide at its next meeting what form that tribute will take.
Welcome
It gives me great pleasure to welcome a delegation of Members of the Majlisi Oli, the Parliament of the Republic of Tajikistan, who have taken their seats in the official gallery.
(Applause)
The members of the delegation have come to Strasbourg for talks with their European counterparts in the framework of the third interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the Majlisi Oli.
This is the first time that the interparliamentary meeting has taken place here in Strasbourg.
Mr Makhkamboy Azimovich Makhmudov, who is leading the delegation, is accompanied by Mr Nosir Yusupovich Salimov and Mr Gulkhoja Gangibekov.
I hope that the delegation will continue to enjoy a pleasant and successful stay in the European Union.
(Applause)

Draft general budget of the European Union - Financial year 2008 (vote)
- Before the vote
Mr President, before the beginning of the vote, I want to make the following statement.
As you know, the Committee on Budgets voted on more than 1 600 amendments to the 2008 draft budget.
Inevitably, there are a small number of technical adjustments that I hereby request to be put to the vote in plenary.
After the vote, the Committee on Budgets issued a request to retable the following four amendments:
Amendment 990: + EUR 1.53m on line 16 03 04, commitment appropriations only;
Amendment 24: on line 15 05 55, commitment appropriations only, reserve and remarks as in Amendment 938;
Amendment 989: + EUR 1 million on line 16 03 02, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations;
Amendment 1043: + EUR 1 million on line 15 06 06, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations, plus additional remarks from Amendment 25, with the figure EUR 1 million instead of EUR 1.5 million.
These technical changes and specifications were dealt with and approved at the meeting of Committee on Budgets of 11 October 2007.
As regards Frontex, a technical error was identified subsequent to the vote in committee concerning the remarks.
The correct modification to the remarks is contained in Amendment 1133, which is annexed to the voting list.
Finally, the remarks adopted in Amendment 634 do not appear in Amendments 1018 on budget line 15 02 02 05; 934 on budget line 09 06 01; 938 on budget line 15 05 55, and 940 on budget line 17 02 02.
And, on budget line 09 03 03, the right figure for commitment appropriations should be 5 and payment appropriations 4.85.
I ask the Sittings Service to make the necessary corrections in the Minutes.
On top of that, we held a discussion at the coordinators' meeting yesterday and, according to their decisions, I recommend rejecting Amendment 752 and voting in favour of Amendment 610 on line 16 02 02 (multimedia actions), but taking the reserve from Amendment 752, and rejecting Amendment 1044 and voting in favour of Amendment 32 on line 16 02 03.
- After the vote on Amendment 878
(FI) Mr President, regarding Amendment 878, it has to do with the pilot projects and has been accepted.
There was broad consensus in the Committee that we should add the changes in Amendment 822 to the justifications.
They are otherwise identical, but a minor change has been made to Amendment 822 compared with the justifications for the previous amendment, and I propose that we could vote just on the justifications in the case of Amendment 822.
Thank you, Mr Virrankoski.
I am told that is indeed the intention, but Mrs De Keyser has again asked to speak.
(FR) Mr President, I am somewhat anxious because I see that in Amendment 231 we have voted for a European foundation for the improvement 'of loving and working conditions'.
Surely some explanation is in order!
- Before the vote on Amendment 996
Mr President, I want to propose that we vote only on reserves, and I am in favour of lifting the reserve, because we have got all the information for which we have asked.
- Before the vote on Amendment 21
Mr President, I would just like to remind the House that this is the amendment concerning the Unified Sports Programme for the Special Olympics.
- Before the vote on Amendment 938
Mr President, line 15 05 55 is, I think, covered by my earlier statement, so we do not have to vote on it.
There remains, however, the question of the reserve, Mr Virrankoski.
We do not have to vote on the first part, but a vote must be taken on the second part, that is to say the reserve.
Mr President, in my statement I said 'reserve and remarks as in Amendment 938'.
- Before the vote on Amendment 1043
Mr President, this is also covered by my earlier statement.
- Before the vote on Amendment 752
Mr President, concerning the line 16 02 02, I recommend rejection of Amendment 752 and approval of Amendment 610, but that we take over the reserve from Amendment 752.
I would therefore ask that we vote first on Amendment 610, and then on the reserve from Amendment 752.
- Before the vote on Amendment 990
rapporteur. - Mr President, I think this is covered by my earlier statement.
- After the vote on block 6
Mr President, in Amendment 951, the German text is the correct one.
Some of the other languages contain mistakes, so please follow the German text.
- Before the vote on block 8
rapporteur. - Mr President, before starting to vote on the budgetary amendments, I would like to inform you of a limited number of technical adjustments that need to be made.
First, concerning Section I, in Amendment 1094, only the budget line 20 26 will be voted on.
Concerning Chapter 101, Plenary should vote only on the final amount in Amendment 1004, which is EUR 5 million.
Concerning Sections VI and VII: in Amendment 1013, the second and third paragraphs of the justification to the amendment should replace the respective paragraphs in the justification in Amendment 1001, and the second paragraph in Amendments 986, 1007 and 999.

The political groups have already been informed.

rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I have a request to make on behalf of all democratically minded people.
It is unacceptable for Members of the European Parliament to be dubbed the 'cancer of Europe', in other words to be called after a deadly disease.
This did not happen in Budapest, like the insult to which Mr Schulz referred yesterday, but in Brussels.
In his speech in the plenary chamber of this House, a Member of the European Parliament described critics of the EU as a cancer.
The Member in question was Othmar Karas, Vice-President of the EPP Group.
He said it at the plenary sitting of 10 October 2007.
I demand ...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
That did not pertain to the report.
All I will say on that point is that Members of Parliament should always be exemplary in their words and actions.

(DE) Mr President, I wanted to say a word on this amendment.
We had to make a correction there, and I ask Mr SchÃ¶pflin and other Members to vote in favour, because there was a mistake in the original text.
1992 is the wrong year.
We would keep that mistake in the recommendation if we did not vote for Mr Kacin's amendment.
Let us please vote for this amendment.
- Before the vote on Amendment 29
rapporteur. - Mr President, I have an oral amendment to Paragraph 29, because there is something that has to be deleted.
In the English version, the words 'both entities of' have to be deleted. Otherwise, the split vote would not make sense.
This has been agreed by the PPE-DE Group.
(The oral amendment was adopted.)
- After the vote
Mr President, on a point of order, I rise under Rule 166, which says that the Member shall first specify to which rule he is referring.
I am referring to that one.
I understand that you cut off Mr Martin before he had a chance to finish what he wanted to say.
He was making a point about yesterday.
Yesterday, Mr Schulz made a lengthy political statement without referring to the rule under which he was speaking.
It was allowed by the President, whereas Mr Martin was cut off.
I think there is a bias at work here and a double standard, where those in favour of the EU are allowed to say what they want and those who are not in favour of it are cut off.
Could we have an even application of the Rules please?
(Applause from the right)
I am in the chair today, and I always endeavour to apply the Rules of Procedure as prescribed.

(ES) Mr President, before we proceed to the vote on the report by Mr Cappato, I would like to explain to the House that an error has crept into the Spanish version: in paragraph 1(b), the antepenultimate line reads 'the implementation of pilot projects', whereas the authentic version must be the English one, which reads (EN) 'looking at the possibility'.
Thank you for looking through the text so meticulously.
That will, of course, be corrected.
- Before the vote on Amendment 4
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to forgive you for mispronouncing my name, and, secondly, on Amendment 4, I should like to propose that what might be called the factual part of the amendment, that is, only the first part, should be maintained.
'whereas according to the report by the International Narcotics Control Board there is a global oversupply of opiates for medical purposes',
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment should end here; if there are no objections, in that case we are in favour.
(The oral amendment was adopted.)
- Before the vote on Amendment 5
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my apologies, here again only a factual replacement is involved; as the Afghan law is cited, the appropriate wording of the law should be substituted:
'whereas the Afghan Constitution states that "the state shall prevent all types of cultivation and smuggling of narcoticsâ and whereas Afghanistan's 2005 Counter Narcotics Drug Law provides for the eventual licensed production and distribution of controlled substances in Afghanistan;'

The next item is voting time.
Explanations of vote
The next item is the explanations of vote.
in writing. - We are opposing a continued expansion of the EU budget, which today is already too extensive, with a large part of the funds going to the wrong ends.
Today there seem to be a reciprocal action between new objectives for the Union and demands on financing by the EU.
This means new demands on payments from the Member States, but also that new funds are being transferred to a system which is bureaucratic, inefficient and complex.
Today there is also too large a focus on industrial agriculture and foreign policy and military projects, and not enough on the environment and social projects.
However, there are many desirable initiatives being financed via the budget, and we support reasonable changes to existing means.
We did choose to support the specific amendment 945, since it covers, among other things, aid to Palestine, even though there were other aspects of the amendment of which we do not approve.
in writing. - I completely oppose European funds being used to grow tobacco in the European Union.
Half a million EU citizens die needlessly each year due to tobacco addiction.
We cannot continue to subsidise tobacco growing in the EU.
in writing. - (SV) I have chosen to vote to the fullest possible extent in favour of the Council's draft budget for 2008, and therefore against all increases in expenditure proposed by the European Parliament.
It is extremely unfortunate that Parliament wishes to finance Galileo through the Community budget.
If it transpires that the private operators back out owing to profitability problems, the EU should take the consequences and discontinue the project or allow interested Member States to join in, as happened with Boeing.
I have also been involved in the issue of the abolition of subsidies for tobacco producers and support for wine production, and can only regret that Parliament is not prepared to support those proposals.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Of course no budget is perfect, but we must nevertheless strive to spend common funds in a just and future-oriented manner.
Unfortunately, most of the European Union budget continues to be spent on preserving the conditions of the past.
This is why it is important to ensure that some money goes towards the future, towards research, development and science.
The financing of the European Institute of Technology still needs to be resolved, because the Commission has proposed a bridging solution of a maximum amount of EUR 308 million.
Budapest would be an ideal location for the European Institute of Technology, owing to its excellent research results and the scientific expertise it has gathered in combating climate change.
This is another reason why I am keen to see a resolution to the issue of financing.
We Hungarians are able to provide an appropriate location for an Institute that is modest in size, economical, but all the more rigorous in terms of its intellectual basis.
(LT) Today we have completed the first reading of the EU budget for 2008 and have voted in favour of it.
According to the budget, more than EUR 129 billion will be allocated for commitments and more than EUR 124 billion for payments in 2008.
In comparison to the European Commission's proposal we would like to increase the allocation of payments for the next year from 0.97 to 0.99% of the European Union's gross national income.
I would like to point out that this increase is fully justified and is related to the development of important projects such as the Galileo satellite navigation system and the European Institute of Technology project.
In my opinion, the allocation of additional funds for our commitments in Kosovo and Palestine - that is, for the implementation of the fourth category, 'The EU as a global player' - is very important.
in writing. - (NL) Both rapporteurs on the EU budget, Mr Virrankoski and Mr ItÃ€lÃ€, have rightly taken a somewhat critical line on the increase in the amounts for 2008.
I should like to express my views on that.
Unfortunately the European Parliament is opting in too many cases today to spend more money.
That is why I have a problem with paragraphs 2 and 4 in the Virrankoski report.
That is not appropriate in a European Union that wishes to concentrate on the areas where there is a benefit, the core tasks.
Finally, an additional problem that makes it more difficult to approve the Virrankoski report is Amendment 2 by the Socialist Group.
That amendment proposes that sexual and reproductive rights be included in the position of Parliament.
However, these do not exclude abortus provocatus.
The term 'sexual and reproductive rights' is therefore inappropriate.
in writing. - (SV) Today we Swedish Social Democrats voted on the 2008 EU budget.
We think that the adopted proposal was a good compromise and, even though we lost out in some respects, we fully support the proposal.
We voted in favour of reducing export subsidies in agriculture, but think that it is unreasonable to vote in favour of a complete and immediate withdrawal of aid.
We also voted against continued subsidies for tobacco producers and in favour of limiting the number of Parliament sessions in Strasbourg.
As regards Daphne (protection of children, women and young people against violence), we voted in favour of increasing the appropriation up to the level of the Commission's proposal.
However, we had been prepared to vote in favour of further funding, but were given no opportunity to do so because the amendment never went to vote.
In the resolution from Mr Virrankoski, we Swedish Social Democrats voted against an amendment which, among other things, called on the Commission to ensure that no farmers would receive more than EUR 50 000 per year in direct aid from the EU.
This is a discussion which is ongoing, so we agree with the spirit of the proposal, but do not consider it appropriate to set either an exact sum or specific conditions right now.
in writing. - (PT) As we have pointed out, although it contains aspects that improve the proposal of the Council and the Commission, in the end the draft general budget for 2008, approved at first reading by the EP, does not comply with what was agreed for 2008 in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013.
At the same time as restrictions are imposed on the EU budget, its priorities are defined as competition policy (an example of which is the gradual distortion of structural policy, placing it at the service of the Lisbon Strategy), and the communitisation of 'internal security and immigration control' and the EU's external policy, which promotes intervention and the militarisation of international relations.
Hence our vote against.
The approval of proposals we tabled should, however, be noted, such as:
increase in sums for the Structural Funds, POSEI (Azores and Madeira) and PROGRESS (equality between men and women);
support for cooperation among farmers' associations and other rural activities, and small-scale and family farming;
an increase of EUR 2 million for the programme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the outermost regions, which means an increase of EUR 570 000 for the Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores.
in writing. - (RO) I support the European Union's Budget, in its current form, for several reasons.
The 553 million euro cut-back in agriculture, operated by the Council, was mainly reestablished, and the reserve created on the Commission's administrative funds is justified by the delays recorded in approving the Sectorial Operational Programmes and Rural Development Programmes.
At the second reading of the European budget, the Council of Ministers should not perform additional reductions in the agriculture funds or structural funds.
The amendment submitted in the plenum for limiting the farmers' income to maximum 50,000 euros per year is unjustified.
Such an artificial barrier would prevent the best farmers from developing their work profitably.
Moreover, this restriction will contribute to breaking down the agricultural works and to the decline of European agricultural competitiveness.
For this reason, I rejected the amendment providing for this measure.
The 2008 budget, in the form we adopt today, is a budget that makes the European Union institutions accountable.
I support the proposal to transfer 49 million euros from the funds allocated to the Commission to reserves until it submits a clear report on its human resources policy, especially as regards the recruitment of new employees from the countries that have recently joined the European Union - Romania and Bulgaria.
in writing. - I voted for this part of the 2008 Budget, while supporting the UK Government's position on a range of issues.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of Parliament's 2008 budget motion because it proposes distinct improvements to the draft budget put forward by the Council.
A balance has been struck for 2008 between financing, on the one hand, for external policies such as support for Kosovo and Palestine and, on the other, for Galileo, a project that binds the Member States closer together.
The European Socialists' priorities are thus well reflected in Parliament's position on the EU budget for 2008 at first reading.
I would point out, however, what a modest budget this is: it currently represents no more than 0.99% of the Union's GDP.
This is the first time that the budget has dropped below 1% of GDP.
Yet the Union cannot act in the interests of its citizens if it lacks the resources to do so.
It is time that the Member States shouldered their responsibilities here.
Mr President, I just wanted to say that I was very sorry that we have decided again not to receive travel expenses.
I would suggest to Parliament that, possibly, if they split the price of tickets from mileage, there might be more support in the future.
I think citizens will watch this vote and will again be disappointed.
in writing. - (FR) The European Parliament has defended its priorities well at this first-reading stage of the 2008 budget, and I support what the two rapporteurs have achieved, particularly in relation to cohesion and sustainable growth.
Let us not forget, however, that because the financial perspective for 2007-2013 was pitched too low it will be a poor annual budget - representing just 0.99% of gross national income. Like my political group, I deplore this situation, for it will not allow us to meet the expectations of all Parliament's committees or to devote adequate financing to major forward-looking European Union projects such as Galileo.
We have agreed, however, to support the main thrust of the information and communications policy: we will thus be able to focus on local media, which play such a significant role in conveying information to all the people of Europe.
This is particularly important given the pending question of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and preparations for the European election in 2009.
As the standing rapporteur on information policy in the Budgets Committee, I welcome the possibilities that the new budget affords in this respect.
in writing. - (PT) Of the many aspects of this draft budget for 2008 that could be highlighted, we would like to stress two:
First, how much we regret the inconsistency of this Parliament, which claims that it recognises and preserves the linguistic diversity of Members of the European Parliament, but at the same time refuses to accept the inclusion of a clear reference that it is mandatory for all the official languages of the EU to be available during its meetings, as we have proposed for some years.
Hence the Committee on Budgets' incomprehensible and unacceptable rejection of our proposal that sought to ensure, for example, that Portuguese should be one of the working languages in EU-ACP Parliamentary Assembly meetings, particularly considering the Members of Parliament of various countries represented on the Committee whose official language is Portuguese.
Secondly, the worrying and growing tendency to reinforce appropriations for a 'strong information policy' in the context of the (re)'launch' of the 'reform' Treaty and the next elections to the EP in 2009.
To understand what is really going on, it will suffice to follow the discussion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the review of the European Political Parties Regulation to understand what is really going on.
in writing. - (RO) The current system of proceedings for the plenary sessions at the headquarters of the Strasbourg Parliament and the committee or group sessions in Brussels is inefficient and uneconomical.
It is estimated that over 200 million euros would be saved annually from the European tax payer's money if it was decided to establish the Parliament's headquarters in Brussels, not only due to the inherent cost reduction, but also by facilitating interinstitutional work.
At the same time, groups from the civil society have drawn attention to the serious environmental consequences of the frequent transportation of the European Members of Parliament and civil servants from city to city for the proceedings of the European legislative activity.
For these reasons, I consider that the idea to maintain two annual plenary sessions at the Strasbourg headquarters is unjustified.
This would aggravate the situation of the administration costs, since payments will be made throughout the entire year to prepare such sessions, as regards costs related both to the premises, and to the personnel.
Numerous civic initiatives, of which at least one benefits from over one million signatures from most Member States, request the elimination of the duality of the European Parliament's headquarters.
It is time for this situation to be discussed by the management of the Parliament and the Council in order to establish a single headquarters of our institution.
in writing. - (DA) We members of the Danish Liberal Party (Venstre) in the European Parliament have voted to reject Amendment 8 by Mr Schlyter and Mr Jens-Peter Bonde of the Independence and Democracy Group.
Venstre supports a reform of travel reimbursement so that all reasonable and necessary travel expenses are refunded.
However, this has already been decided by the new Members' Statute, which will be implemented from 2009.
Mr Bonde's proposal has not been thought through and is in breach of the current statute.
in writing. - I voted for these sections of the 2008 Budget.
in writing. - I voted for the reports in respect of the 2008 draft budget, but I did so heavy in heart because it would appear that the expensive circus that is our regular visits to Strasbourg looks set to continue.
It is particularly poignant that we are voting to carry on meeting in Strasbourg on the same day that Air France has decided to leave some of our number stranded, or certainly inconvenienced, because of industrial action by some of its staff.
Martin Luther King once said "I have a dreamâ.
I too have a dream; and that dream is that one day this Parliament has a single seat from which to operate and the Strasbourg circus will come to an end.
in writing. - (PT) A joint effort must be made to try to improve quality standards and the effectiveness of justice.
This is a very sensitive and diverse area, however, which highlights the need to reinforce confidence in order to allow mutual recognition of judicial decisions, thereby contributing towards the gradual development of a European judicial culture.
I support Mrs Esteves' excellent report, the objective of which, in connection with reinforcing the principle of mutual recognition of decisions, is to enhance the prospects of the sentenced person being reintegrated into society, while seeking to improve the protection of victims and prevent recidivism.
This Framework Decision seeks to lay down the rules under which a Member State, within the limits of its competence, must monitor and supervise non-custodial measures (decisions related to the execution of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and additional sentences) imposed by judgments passed in other Member States.
I hope that under the Portuguese Presidency the outstanding questions can be resolved, and that a general agreement can be reached by the end of the year.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which sets out ways to help a sentenced person's reintegration into society, provide better protection for victims and help with the enforcement of appropriate sentences where offenders are not resident.
in writing. - (FR) If ever there was a sensitive subject, it is surely the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters.
The fact is that criminal law in Europe today is not standard - indeed far from it.
Different countries have not only different legal traditions and values but also different criminal laws.
The Member States' criminal law systems reflect their respective identities.
Examples of disparity in criminal law at national level are many and varied.
For example, the protection of freedom of expression and the definition of what constitutes a violation of freedom of expression differ markedly from one country to another.
It would therefore be very dangerous to insist that a penalty handed down in one country should automatically be applied in another: dangerous not only for those who come before the law, but also for the rule of law generally.
So we need to tread very warily indeed here, because it is currently impossible to ensure the application of certain common basic standards in the law of criminal procedure.
I am thinking particularly of respect for the principle of double jeopardy, of the right to a genuine, rather than a merely formal, defence and, indeed, of victims' rights.
There are two fundamental principles that must always be followed and observed - otherwise the rule of law will cease to exist.
They are the principles of legality and legal certainty.
in writing. - (PT) As the report states, the 1999 Tampere European Council endorsed the principle of mutual recognition as 'the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters within the Union'.
A year later the Council approved a programme of measures focusing on this principle, so as to adapt the mechanisms of mutual recognition of final sentences and extend the application of the principle of transferring sentenced persons to cover persons resident in a Member State.
The Hague Programme subsequently set new targets, particularly in connection with the 'fight against terrorism', to make progress in the communitisation of this area, which lies at the heart of the Member States' sovereignty.
In the light of this proposal and as our Parliamentary group has stressed, it is worrying that the report establishes that 'notwithstanding the necessity of providing the sentenced person with adequate safeguards, his or her involvement in the proceedings should no longer be dominant by requiring in all cases his or her consent to the forwarding of a judgment to another Member State for the purpose of its recognition and enforcement of the sentence imposed', particularly since we fail to see how not ensuring this principle is consistent with the aim of the Framework Decision: to help to rehabilitate the person sentenced.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats in the European Parliament voted in favour of the report.
The agreement is a step in the right direction.
Higher demands are placed on monitoring the consequences of the agreement for fish stocks and living conditions for local people.
It is now important to monitor the effects of the agreement properly.
However, we voted against Amendment 7.
We fully support the intention of contributing to sustainable development of fisheries, which is also the aim of the new fisheries agreement.
The agreement must not entail detrimental consequences for fisheries and the population in Madagascar either.
On the other hand, we cannot support the agreement being immediately repealed if it entails detrimental consequences.
We consider that the joint committee that will be formed to oversee the agreement is a better solution for ensuring that the agreement is complied with and that it benefits both parties and the environment.
The agreement will be renegotiated if it transpires that it entails detrimental consequences.
We are in favour of the fact that a larger proportion of the costs will be financed from the European vessels supported by the agreement.
However, we consider that the aim must be for the whole agreement to be self-financed.
in writing. - I voted for this report, which endorsed the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Madagascar.
It is a tuna agreement which allocates fishing opportunities, according to three categories of vessel, to Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom.
It provides fishery resources for EU vessels, whilst enabling Madagascar to receive income for stocks which the country would not have the technical capacity to exploit.
in writing. - (PT) We voted against the report as a protest against the way in which the Commission proposes to share fishing opportunities among the Member States under this agreement.
Contrary to what has always happened in this type of agreement, the Commission is proposing to violate a basic principle that has been a fundamental tool for ensuring justice and equality between Member States and, in practice, a tacit agreement between them.
We consider the failure to apply this principle in this case to be incomprehensible and unacceptable.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats in the European Parliament voted in favour of the report.
The agreement is a step in the right direction.
Higher demands are placed on monitoring the consequences of the agreement for fish stocks and living conditions for local people.
It is now important to monitor the effects of the agreement properly.
However, we voted against Amendment 8.
We fully support the intention of contributing to sustainable development of fisheries, which is also the aim of the new fisheries agreement.
The agreement must not entail detrimental consequences for the fisheries and the population in Mozambique either.
On the other hand, we cannot support the agreement being immediately repealed if it entails detrimental consequences.
We consider that the joint committee that will be formed to oversee the agreement is a better solution for ensuring that the agreement is complied with and that it benefits both parties and the environment.
The agreement will be renegotiated if it transpires that it entails detrimental consequences.
We are in favour of the fact that a larger proportion of the costs will be financed from the European vessels supported by the agreement.
However, we consider that the aim must be for the whole agreement to be self-financed.
in writing. - (PT) I abstained from voting on my report because, although I recognise the urgency of concluding the agreement and consider this proposal to be positive in part as regards the distribution of fishing licences, and given that it is not feasible to amend it, which is the responsibility of the Council and the Commission, I strongly disagree with the failure to observe the principle of relative stability that has always prevailed in previous agreements.
I am also sorry that, owing to possible legal considerations, it is not possible to table various draft legislative amendments to the provisions of the agreement, seeking on the one hand to reinforce civil society in Mozambique, with the fishermen's active participation in preparing future agreements, and, on the other, to optimise international rules on the occupational categories concerned, namely as regards fixing minimum wage rules for ACP seamen.
I felt that the European Parliament's political mandate was restricted in this area, and therefore tabled other proposals for amendments - considered legally admissible - seeking to improve the information forwarded to Parliament and requiring Parliament and the Council to submit a report on the application of the agreement during the final year of the protocol's validity, and before another agreement is concluded on its renewal.
in writing. - (PT) We cannot vote in favour of this fishing agreement, because we believe the sharing of fishing opportunities it establishes among the various Member States is disproportionate and inadequate, since it does not safeguard Portugal's legitimate interests.
This Partnership Agreement between the EC and Mozambique came into force on 1 January 2007 for a period of five years, and, compared with the previous agreement, it provides for an increase of 2 000 tonnes in the Community fishing quota for tuna or tuna-like species.
In the previous agreement, the extent to which Portugal used its entitlement to fishing opportunities (five) was rather high, which is why Portugal asked for nine licences for surface longliners, plus continuation of the opportunities in demersal freezer trawlers fishing for deep-water shrimp.
However, it was only awarded seven licences for tuna fishing.
Bearing in mind the previous distribution of licences and (non-)respect for the principle of relative stability in the light of the increase in fishing opportunities, this new agreement therefore involves a marked imbalance: Portugal only gains two more licences, while the other Member States gain a further 16 (France) and 13 (Spain).
If decisions in the Council required unanimity, that would not happen.
Hence our vote against.
in writing. - I voted for this uncontroversial report, which endorses the proposal for a regulation on the conclusion of a new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mozambique.
The agreement has been signed for a period of five years (renewable) from its entry into force, and it grants fishing opportunities to vessels from Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom.
in writing. - (PT) The purpose of the regulation on business registers (Council Regulation (EEC) No 2186/93), which compiles statistics on businesses operating in the European Union, namely their number, type, size structure and other characteristics, was to provide reliable statistical data for EU policy-makers.
On 1 June 2006, the European Parliament supported the essential aspects of the Commission's proposal at first reading, subject to 22 amendments focusing on the issue of the administrative burden, a clarification of the terms and conditions under which confidential data can be transmitted, and, finally, a series of amendments of a technical and editorial nature.
In its Common Position of 21 May 2007, the Council endorsed all 22 Parliament amendments.
New red tape has subsequently created additional difficulties in the process, however, which has therefore dragged on until this time, involving great cost, something the rapporteur has rightly condemned.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which helps improve those parts of the EU's statistical system that involve registers of information about businesses operating in the Union.
in writing. - (DA) The Danish members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have voted in favour of Parliament's resolution on rising feed and food prices.
It is the delegation's belief that it is necessary to focus on rising feed and food prices.
However, the delegation does not share the belief that it is a good thing that the EU's agricultural ministers recently decided to suspend the obligations for removal in 2008.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to abstain in our vote on Resolution RC B6-400/2007 further to Question for Oral Answer B6-0321/2007 on rising feed and food prices, as we think that the resolution gives rise to doubts concerning the economic situation for farmers in the EU.
The increased prices for cereals and food benefit farmers and can provide a better opportunity to restructure the agricultural sector in the EU.
Furthermore, agriculture, just like other sectors, must deal with certain changes in demand.
On the other hand, we share the view taken in the resolution on biofuels, the large food price increases in the distribution sector, and food insecurity in the world.
in writing. - (PT) The recent rise in food prices is due largely to successive reforms in the CAP, the abandonment of production thereby promoted, and the resulting disappearance of many small and medium-sized farms.
Ignoring the specific reality of Member States to take greater account of the interests of the large agri-industrial enterprises, multinational food distributors and negotiations to liberalise trade within the WTO has helped to change the basis of agricultural activity, leading to a fall in output.
Meanwhile, the use of agricultural products for non-food purposes, particularly for producing biofuels, which they seek to prioritise, will not help to develop agricultural activity and may, on the contrary, replace the production of food products, thereby having a negative impact on the protection of food sovereignty.
We therefore believe it is essential to reappraise the objectives of the common agricultural policy in order to increase food product output, support small and medium-sized agricultural and livestock holdings and moderate consumer prices, reinforcing intervention mechanisms and ensuring appropriate intervention prices.
in writing. - I supported the joint motion for a resolution on rising feed and food prices which addresses the significant shift in commodity prices in the EU and globally.
I also voted in favour of amendments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, which deal with the issue of GM in feed ingredients.
These amendments highlight the realities of the marketplace and merely point out the fact that significant quantities of maize and soya, already being used to produce animal feed in the EU, are of GM origin.
The amendments also address the difficulties in relation to the authorisation of GM animal feed ingredients.
This situation is having an impact on the competitiveness of EU livestock farmers and leads to the paradoxical situation where EU consumers buy meat and livestock products from third countries that use GM feed.
These amendments are necessary to highlight the inconsistency of the EU's attitude to GM and the need for a more open debate about this subject.
in writing. - (RO) I voted in favor of this report hoping that it will have a crucial impact on Serbia's decision to continue the democratic reform and its connection to the European standards, especially in the field of respect for the rights of minorities.
Although the report welcomes the relative improvement of the situation, the latter has still not provided the necessary conditions for true interethnic living together and mutual respect and cases of flagrant infringement of the rights of minorities are still numerous and serious.
Here I refer to a concrete example - that of neglecting the rights of the Romanian community and the Romanian language speakers in Serbia, especially in Valea Timocului and Vojvodina.
Today, I can only find, with regret, that their linguistic rights are refused and ignored, whether we speak of education or religious practice in the Romanian language.
A clear message should be sent to Serbia in this respect: only a truly multiethnic Serbia, which ensures understanding between communities and mutual tolerance, can be considered really European.
(NL) Mr President, I voted against the Martens report.
I have to admit that there are quite a number of sensible points in the report, but to my mind it does not touch on the main cause of Africa's problems, and also it does not send the right signals on the problem of the future, the challenge of the future, which is the flood of immigrants.
Why is it not even possible in a European Parliament report to refer to the main cause of the poverty, hunger, lack of security, social and economic problems in Africa?
The main cause is the bad governments on the continent.
It is the corrupt rulers who do not care about good governance, democracy or human rights, but who in their own countries, with money they steal from their citizens, spend more on arms every year than they receive in development aid.
That is a scandal.
The signal on immigration is also totally inadequate.
Firstly, Europe cannot take any more immigration and, secondly, immigration to Europe by highly educated people from poor countries is a tragedy for the countries of origin themselves.
in writing.
(SV) - We Swedish Social Democrats supported the report, which is good.
There is a need for a partnership between the EU and Africa in order to meet the challenges of the future.
We voted in favour of paragraph 61 because we support free trade.
However, we wish to point out that we cannot create growth through free trade if we do not at the same time invest in education, health and other long-term investments, which also emerges from other parts of the report.
in writing. - (SV) It is clear that sexual and reproductive health is an extremely important issue.
Therefore, the welfare of women and children should not be exploited by the European Parliament in its attempt to expand its authority, as in paragraph 77 of the report.
Moreover, a competent, legitimate UN body is already working on these issues now.
In the light of the unpleasant currents that exist in this Chamber, where many Members actively oppose sexual and reproductive health, both within the Union and elsewhere, it would be a great tragedy if the European Parliament were to be given more power with regard to this issue.
in writing. - (PT) Though it includes aspects we consider to be positive, this report fails to examine the real core of EU-Africa relations, omitting or shirking its key responsibilities and strategic objectives.
The most striking example is perhaps its silence on NATO/USA/EU initiatives in relation to Africa, such as the creation of specific military commands (USA/AFRICOM), the holding of military manoeuvres (NATO), or the growing military presence of the major EU powers ('peace support mechanisms', military missions).
The report also contains aspects that open the doors to intervention - disguised as 'humanitarian', 'conflict management' or 'good governance' - and does not object to the increasing subordination of development policy to 'security' strategies, favouring 'development aid' provided by soldiers or the use of its funds for purposes that have nothing to do with such aid, allocating it in accordance with the major powers' strategic objectives, namely control of Africa's huge natural resources, including oil.
Finally, ascribing value to the constraints it advocates for the 'Economic Partnership Agreements', the report reaffirms the 'dogma' of trade liberalisation as a basis for development.
In support of the EU/Africa Summit, we reject such policies.
in writing. - (PL) Mrs Martens is right to note that the basis for developing cooperation between Africa and Europe should be developing democracy and a partnership based on mutual respect.
It was also right to point out that the partners are equal as regards their rights and responsibilities, but not as regards their level of integration or access to and level of development of financial, technical and human resources.
I would agree that our common responsibility and the primary aim of cooperation between the EU and Africa has to be the elimination of poverty, and that peace is of key significance as a first step towards development.
I believe that, in the spirit of the report, it is important to take into account the real needs of the African population: to ensure proper remuneration for small farmers, increase local production, ensure food safety and the safety of livelihoods, as well as the creation of local and regional markets.
in writing. - (DE) Besides the important discussion of unfair trade policies, the report on the state of relations between the EU and Africa also deals with the prevention and resolution of conflicts.
In this context I should like to refer to the last colony in the world, the last colony in Africa, namely the Western Sahara, which has been occupied by Morocco for more than 30 years.
This occupation infringes international law and is accompanied by flagrant violations of human rights.
When we champion the human rights of the Saharawi people and their right of self-determination, we often hear that we are adopting a pro-Saharawi stance.
That is an appalling attitude, for our sole aim is to uphold human rights and international law.
All European institutions should be devoted to this cause and not merely pursue the economic interests of the Member States.
Europe needs to adopt a credible stance against dictatorships.
Wagging our finger at a few selected dictatorships damages the credibility of the Union as a peace broker, and damages those who suffer oppression and are subjected daily to gross violations of their human rights.
in writing. - (PL) I would like to vote in favour of Mrs Martens' report on EU-Africa relations.
A joint strategy should be developed for cooperation between the European Union and African countries, which should be based on mutual respect and on joint, clearly defined principles and values.
We must take the standpoint of the African party into consideration and focus particularly on the issue of development, as well as achieving the Millennium Development Goals, such as stable growth and development, the eradication of poverty, and assistance in providing access to education and health protection measures.
in writing.
(SV) - We Swedish Social Democrats supported the report, which is good.
However, we voted against Amendment 1, which referred to the use of cluster munitions in two specific conflicts.
We chose to vote against it because we condemn the use of cluster munitions in all conflicts, and not just in specific cases.
in writing. - (SV) There is no doubt that cluster munitions are very cruel weapons systems which cause great suffering to civilians.
It is therefore distressing that the European Parliament is using such an important issue in its efforts to hasten the creation of a United States of Europe.
A ban on this kind of weapon must be implemented globally, through the UN and on the initiative of the nation states, not by the European Parliament.
We therefore voted against the resolution in the vote today.
in writing. - (PT) On 17 September last, the United Nations called on its Member States to take immediate measures to address the dreadful effects of the use of cluster munitions, calling for the conclusion of a legally binding instrument of international humanitarian law that prohibits the use, development, production, stockpiling and transfer of such munitions.
The United Nations requires the destruction of current stockpiles of those munitions, asks for risk mitigation and victim assistance activities, and until such an instrument is adopted, calls on Member States to freeze the use and transfer of such weapons.
As this resolution states, it has been documented that 98% of the victims of these bombs are civilians, causing a high and brutal rate of fatalities and injuries, especially amongst children.
However, the majority of the EP voted against specifying that cluster munitions have been used by the so-called coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and by Israeli forces in the Lebanon.
The arms race must be brought to a halt as a matter of urgency.
Weapons of mass destruction, cluster munitions, depleted uranium weapons and phosphorus shells must be prohibited as a matter of urgency.
We therefore support this resolution.
in writing. - I voted for this resolution, which reaffirms the need to strengthen international humanitarian law (IHL) as it applies to cluster munitions and speedily to adopt at international level a comprehensive ban on the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions.
The House also noted it strongly supports the Oslo Process launched in February 2007.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to explain my voting on Mr Cappato's report, and also to clarify why the Union for Europe of the Nations Group abstained from voting.
I voted against, as I believe this to be a very controversial idea.
Narcotics are the principal business in Afghanistan and to try to control even some part of the production for medical purposes seems to be more than questionable.
For this reason I voted against this proposal.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what Mr Cappato has proposed, and achieved, with this report is to make it known that the European Parliament is in favour of experiments to transform the production of opium in Afghanistan for criminal uses into the production of opium for medicinal uses to treat patients.
I have to say that I voted against, because the worker growing poppies in the field is the real starting point for the deaths and crimes brought about by those who have fallen, consciously or unconsciously, into the net of this terrible scourge of humanity.
In my view, those who have voted for this report are deluding themselves that something that is carried on illegally at present, that is opium poppy growing in Afghanistan, can be eradicated simply by allowing and authorising its use for beneficial purposes.
in writing. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party could not support this resolution, as at its core is a proposal to encourage opium growing in Afghanistan.
This runs contrary to efforts being put in place by the Government of Afghanistan with the support of the international community, and also runs contrary to the wishes of 80% of the Afghan people - the opium industry feeds the Taliban insurgency.
We note that the number of opium-free provinces in Afghanistan has more than doubled this year.
We voted against the original texts in Paragraph 1(a) and 1(b) as we feel strongly that there is no role for the European Parliament in promoting any projects which encourage the production of opium in Afghanistan.
We voted against the report for the reasons above, and also because this proposal is based on a factually incorrect presumption of a global shortage of opiates for medicinal use.
The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has stated that an overproduction in licit opiates since 2000 has led to stockpiles in producing countries 'that could cover demand for two years'.
in writing. - I voted against this report.
There is no shortage of opium available for medical use in the world, and the security situation in Afghanistan does not seem likely to lend itself to secure production and collection of opium for medical purposes.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report.
Attachment is a process by which a creditor can apply to a court to freeze a bank account in order to prevent someone disposing of claimed monies.
It strikes a balance between the rights of creditors to recover debts and the provision of adequate protection for defendants.
It does not conflict with national laws, and should make a common standard procedure available across the EU.
in writing. - (PT) Information from the register of activities shows that the Ombudsman received 3 830 complaints in 2006.
The Ombudsman, however, felt that only 21.5% of these cases fell within his remit, of which 258 led to an inquiry.
In 2006 the Ombudsman carried out 582 inquiries in total, of which 315 were already under way in 2005 and nine were launched on the Ombudsman's own initiative.
Interestingly, as in previous years the institutional body which was the subject of most inquiries was the Commission, which accounted for 66% of the total (387).
This was followed by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), which accounted for 13%, and then the European Parliament, which accounted for 8%.
The most common complaint was lack of transparency, including refusal of information (25%), followed by unfairness or abuse of power and a variety of other types of maladministration.
However, as stated by the Ombudsman himself, there are many cases in which his critical remarks clearly have no effect, but they are without doubt a warning that problems exist, and Parliament should therefore pay them due attention.

Company law (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on company law.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the European private company statute has regularly been on the agenda of the European Parliament and also, as you know, on that of its Committee on Legal Affairs.
Various arguments presented during these debates have demonstrated that a statute for European private companies may bring benefits to small and medium-sized companies, and there has also been support for the idea of a stakeholder consultation.
The Commission recognises that the regulatory framework needs to be adapted to allow SMEs to make the most of increasingly integrated European markets.
We need to make it easier and cheaper for small and medium-sized companies to conduct cross-border business.
It is important to take action that will help those firms to fully reap the benefits of the single market.
The growth of small and medium-sized businesses is crucial, as we all know, for the competitiveness of the European economy, and the Commission can see that a European private company statute could facilitate the expansion of small businesses beyond national borders.
Therefore, by providing an option, it would create more choice for companies, without imposing any additional burdens.
It could well reduce the compliance costs for firms that wish to operate in several Member States.
If this can be achieved, SMEs could have easier access to new markets.
The Commission is therefore aware of the importance of the European private company statute to the Member States of the European Union and to European businesses.
I can assure you that my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy, will proceed with a legislative proposal for a European private company statute, as he declared to the Legal Affairs Committee on 3 October 2007.
This proposal should be ready by mid-2008 at the latest.
As you know, we are currently conducting further consultations on the exact form and content of the proposal, the results of which will then be incorporated into the impact assessment to be completed in the first months of next year.
My colleague Mr McCreevy will be very happy to have a continued dialogue with you once this proposal is on the table.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by thanking you sincerely for your remarks, which bring me neatly to my first point, namely the European private-company statute.
I may say we are delighted that, after protracted difficulties, the Commission has finally been convinced of the need for this legislative draft, and that we can now expect to receive it.
It is to the credit of Parliament that this was made possible by the heavy pressure we exerted.
Be that as it may, we can only rejoice wholeheartedly at the outcome.
I do, however, intend to address a second point to which today's resolution also refers, and on which we are not satisfied with the way things have developed.
I refer here to the 14th Company Law Directive on the transfer of the company's registered office, the place where companies are registered.
For many years the European Commission has had plans to close this loophole in company law.
We have now learned that this has been more or less deleted from the legislative programme, at least as far as the European Commission is concerned, and that the loophole will therefore remain open.
May I emphasise at this point that my political group at least - and, I believe, an overwhelming majority of the Legal Affairs Committee, to judge by the tenor of its deliberations in recent years, and of this House as a whole - has always taken the view that this loophole needs to be closed and that the 14th Company Law Directive is a necessity.
This is not a matter of additional bureaucracy and new corporate obligations.
It is simply about giving companies the opportunity promised them in the Treaty to move freely within the European Union and establish themselves in any Member State.
We have heard that one of the reasons why the European Commission felt unable to move forward on this issue and to present a proposal was its view that the existing merger regulations and other provisions were adequate to guarantee corporate mobility.
I can only say that, if a company cannot move its registered office within the single market unless it founds a new company in another country and then merges with it, the present rules are scarcely exemplary as a means of avoiding red tape or minimising costs.
The ideal would be a sound piece of secondary legislation that guaranteed the right of companies to exercise in practice the freedom that the single market offers them in theory.
One of the arguments advanced for the status quo is that past rulings of the European Court of Justice have greatly liberalised company law in any case.
That is undoubtedly true, but the European Court delivers these rulings for the sole purpose of promoting the full application of primary law, simply because the legislative bodies responsible for the adoption of secondary law, namely Parliament and the Council - though we depend on the European Commission - are not able to enact sound secondary legislation that would actually guarantee the freedoms enshrined in the Treaty provisions establishing the single market.
That is why Parliament is adhering to its position that the Commission's monopoly on the right of initiative binds it to present a proposal for a 14th Company Law Directive in due course.
We ask the Commission to reconsider whether the 14th Directive, which is already on file in the Commission's offices, can be incorporated into the legislative programme in the coming years.
If that does not happen, Parliament reserves the right - as our resolution expressly states - to invoke Article 192 of the Treaty and table a report on its own initiative with a view to requesting a legislative proposal.
And while we are on the subject of company law, let me take this convenient opportunity to say a brief word about the Commission's latest communication on the simplification of company law.
The resolution does not deal directly with that communication, but there is a thematic connection between the two.
I believe we in Parliament agree that we do not support any erosion of the substance of established Community law and practice - the acquis communautaire - as a consequence of simplification measures.
In other words, there can be no question, in my view, of deleting entire directives.
What we can support are measures designed to unburden companies, to minimise bureaucratic and statistical obligations, to relieve companies of the requirement to publish all the bits and pieces which appear in their balance sheets but which may actually be quite unimportant.
I believe there is scope here to cooperate closely with the Commission in order to improve company law.
One other thing that struck me when I read the Commission's documentation on this subject was that there are certain laws we have enacted - one example being the Transparency Directive, adopted in the wake of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act - which contain some provisions that now beg the question of why they are not being reviewed as part of a simplification drive.
I should also welcome further consideration of this matter by the Commission, since such a review would likewise help to improve company law.
on behalf of the PSE. - (ES) Mr President, Mr Lehne has in essence given the view held by the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
He has done so on behalf of the European People's Party Group, and I shall do so on behalf of the Party of European Socialists.
Our concern at present is, as Mr Lehne has said, that we are relying too heavily on judicial development of the law, in other words, on development through the case-law of the Court of Justice.
The case-law of the Court of Justice fills in the gaps left by the secondary law of the European Union, but we do not have secondary law.
The Treaties are very general in nature and provide for certain fields and give rise to various interpretations and do not at present facilitate the establishment of the internal market.
Our proposals are bi-directional, as Mr Lehne has pointed out, firstly they support the offer made by the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on the European private company which would clearly do a great deal to help establish free movement within the European Union, and secondly to try to continue pushing in the field of company law by pressing for a new directive, the fourteenth, which could ultimately supplement those provisions.
I share Mr Lehne's concern that, if we do not adopt provisions on the transfer of company head offices, then we would in fact be leaving a legal loophole open because mergers are a different matter and do not fall fully into this category.
We hope the Commission can include this type of activities in its work programme.
First, I hope that during 2008 and, if possible, before 30 June, the proposal for a directive, the Directive on the European private company statute, will be on the table, and, secondly, it is to be hoped that the Commission does not give up on the idea of continuing to develop company law in fields such as freedom of establishment and change of domicile for companies.
That is the end of my speech.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me answer both questions.
In answer to the first, I think it is clear.
In answer to the second, concerning the 14th company law directive, we had suggested that a further means of improving mobility might be a directive stipulating the conditions for the transfer of registered offices in the European Union.
The results of the economic analysis of the possible added value of a directive were inconclusive; companies already have the legal means to effect cross-border transfer.
Several companies have already transferred their registered office using the possibilities offered by the European Company Statute.
Soon, the Cross-Border Mergers Directive, which will enter into force in December, will give all limited liability companies, including SMEs, the option to transfer their registered office.
They could do so by setting up a subsidiary in the Member State to which they want to move and then merging the existing company into this subsidiary.
In the Commission's view, it is only if this framework is found wanting that future legislative action in the shape of a 14th company law directive can be justified.
Therefore, Mr McCreevy has decided for the moment not to proceed with this 14th company law directive, but I will certainly communicate your concerns again.
I have received a motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly, during voting time.

Iran
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Iran.
author. - (PL) Mr President, once again we are talking about Iran.
I am the co-author of a resolution prepared by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
The situation in Iran is a never-ending story of breaches of human rights.
The European Parliament returns to this issue very regularly, giving the names of more victims and more examples of breaches of human rights.
I have to say with some regret that some of the politicians in the European Union and some governments apply double standards, in that much more is said about human rights in the countries with which there is no trade, where one cannot do business.
In the case of countries with which economic ties are maintained, even unofficially, without saying anything, but making money, people seem to speak about human rights more quietly, in a whisper.
It is very good that the European Parliament is not whispering when it comes to Iran.
In the joint resolution that we are proposing, what I would like to emphasise over and above political divisions, is that we list new, specific and tragic facts that illustrate the drama that is taking place before our eyes in that country.
The attention of the world's public opinion is focused on something else, on certain attempts to create a nuclear power in that country or on the clearly anti-Semitic statements of the President of Iran.
Unfortunately we do not notice the breaches of human rights in that country, so it is good that the European Parliament is considering this issue today.
author. - Mr President, this is not the first time, and I fear that it will not be the last, that this House is called upon to deal with the situation in Iran.
That country, which has all the natural resources for achieving an envious standard of living for its people, is unfortunately sinking deeper into the abyss of dark ages-like totalitarian governance, with the resulting gross violations of the human rights of its citizens, and with Iran becoming more and more isolated from the rest of the world.
The continued practice of barbaric acts such as the stoning to death of citizens, including women and children, and the non-recognition of the quality of the rights of women and of political opponents, is a stigma to civilised living.
Every day, reports reach us of even more cases of arrests, torture and killings of innocent civilians by the authorities of Iran.
(The President asked the speaker to slow down)
I hope that will not cost me time, Mr President.
Incidentally, that is why I speak in English - so that people can understand me without the need for interpretation.
(Applause from certain quarters)
Thank you, Mr Tannock.
Freedom of speech and freedom of the press is pretty much non-existent in that country, and all this at the same time as the secretive work to produce nuclear weapons is going ahead against all common sense and in spite of international outcry.
The Iranian regime, blinded by short-sighted nationalism and extreme religious fanaticism, is following a road that can only lead to confrontation and consequent suffering, mainly to its own people.
Let us once again, on the occasion of voting for this resolution, send a message of support to those Iranians fighting for freedom and democracy, and let us again make clear to the extremist rulers of Iran that our patience is running out fast owing to their foolishly dangerous behaviour.
Can I conclude by informing colleagues of some good news from the United States which I have just received, which is that the US Administration has decided to put the Revolutionary Guards on the terrorist list.
author. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this week we had the pleasure of hearing the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Doris Lessing, who as we know is of Iranian descent, saying what we all think: 'I hate the Iranian government.
It's a cruel and evil government'.
Doris Lessing also said that the reason nobody dares to criticise the Iranian government is because of oil.
I think she could not have been more accurate and could not have put it better.
This policy of appeasement is lethal, not only for the interests of the Iranian people, but also for everyone who wants peace.
The continuation of this policy and the fuelling of the Iranian regime's expansionist and fanatical instincts will be the greatest tragedy we will face in the near future.
I believe we must all be aware of that fact and must reverse this policy.
If we do not, the future will be very bleak, and I would just like to say, Mr President, that this House should send a very special greeting to the Nobel Prize winner for her very judicious words.
author. - (NL) Mr President, in assessing what is happening in and around Iran at the moment, there are four issues to be considered.
Firstly, the appalling human rights situation that has developed as a result of a regime based not on democracy and human equality, but on its own interpretation of the will of God, which gives it the right to imprison, torture and murder others.
Secondly, the attempt by the regime to win mass support, despite its role as a violent minority.
It is artificially attempting to appeal to national pride.
The reason for that pride is the possession of nuclear energy and possibly even nuclear weapons, just like India, Pakistan and Israel, which have not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Thirdly, opposition to the regime.
Both the moderate opposition, which wants a slightly less strict system, as was the case under the previous president, and the real democratic opposition amongst workers and students in Iran, and also amongst intellectuals who have fled abroad.
Fourthly, the American threat to use the same model in Iran as in Iraq and Afghanistan, with a military invasion or at least bombing.
Such an attack by foreign opponents would be counter-productive.
That would encourage patriotic feeling on the part of the Iranians, and they would rally to the support of the hated regime and its nuclear weapons, if any.
My group is not in favour of a military invasion against the regime, or of seeking friendship with that regime out of self-interest.
We should show solidarity with the victims and the opposition.
The regime must not in any way be given the impression that it is possible to negotiate restrictions on the rights of the opposition in exile in Europe, and must not be allowed to spread propaganda by claiming that democratic countries support its misrule.
The European Court of Justice's decision to remove the People's Mujahidin organisation from the list of terrorist organisations should be fully complied with, so that that organisation and other opposition groups do not face any legal or financial obstacles.
author. - (ES) Mr President, I believe there are three elements - at least three - justifying this urgency.
First, as has already been noted, the growing deterioration in the human rights situation.
Secondly, the record figures for executions, not only in numerical terms but also in the brutality with which they are being carried out.
Today we have more executions than there were in the whole of 2007 - 244 in 2007 and 177 in 2006.
The third element is the persecution to which organisations for human rights activists are being subjected, especially those organisations which defend women's rights.
I believe that all this justifies not only this resolution but also, as the resolution states, urging the United Nations General Assembly to vote on a resolution explicitly and unreservedly condemning the violation of fundamental rights in Iran.
This is something we have been asking for for a long time.
We do not understand why there is this reticence about it and I hope that this resolution will at least help to change some minds.
author. - (PL) Mr President, the Koran, the sacred book of Muslims, is considered by outstanding specialists to be a book of love.
But what is happening in those countries that call themselves Islamic countries?
They are governed by extreme radicals.
The only message that comes out of these countries is one of hatred of the outside world, of fellow Muslims and of their own citizens.
What is happening in present-day Iran is absolutely unacceptable.
On many occasions we have already talked in this Chamber of the need to apply radical measures in order to prevent various types of breaches of human rights in Iran.
What is particularly horrifying is the way that the death penalty is carried out.
Carrying out the death penalty by stoning is uncivilised, inhumane, and completely unacceptable to any democracy.
Carrying out the death penalty on minors, which is prohibited in the whole of the democratic and civilised world, continues in Iran, despite the promises of the Iranian government and parliament.
Further acts of hatred are aimed at any opposition - both the very small internal opposition from individual citizens, and the much larger and more organised opposition both within the country and from beyond its borders.
Arrests of journalists, lack of freedom of speech, bans on printing or even speaking under threat of imprisonment or even death, this is a situation that we cannot in any way accept.
Today, any appeals seem almost to be too late.
We should think about more specific restrictions that would force the Iranian government to change its behaviour.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, we in the Commission welcome this new joint motion for a resolution by the European Parliament.
I can tell you that we have all repeatedly expressed our great concerns about the human rights situation in Iran - I, myself, very recently during the UN General Assembly, on the margins of which I met the Iranian Foreign Minister, where, again, I very strongly emphasised all the facts that are there.
I must say that the respect for basic human rights in Iran has continued to deteriorate seriously over the past year and, for this reason, we will also support the new UN General Assembly resolution on the human rights situation in Iran, as we do each year, which Canada is likely to table.
There is a continuous clampdown on freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and political dissent.
There have been new cases of torture and executions of people who were minors at the time of the alleged crime.
There has also been an increasing number of public executions, as Mr Romeva i Rueda said, including in one case through stoning, despite assurances by the Iranian side that stoning was forbidden under existing decrees.
I also very specifically mentioned this case when I met the Iranian Foreign Minister.
Iran has carried out at least 250 executions so far this year - the second highest number of executions worldwide.
We also note, of course, the continuous discrimination against minorities, increasing harassment and the closure of independent non-governmental organisations.
The documented intimidation and persecution of human rights defenders from all sectors of Iranian society has grown, as has the repression of intellectuals, teachers, students, women activists and trade unions.
Only recently, one of Iran's best-known human rights defenders, Mr Emaddedin Baghi, was once again imprisoned under the charge of propaganda against the Government.
And, since July, Mr Mansour Osanlou, President of the Iranian Bus Drivers' Union and the embodiment of an independent trade union movement in Iran, has been under arrest.
Mr Osanlou is in need of urgent medical treatment, which, we have reason to believe, he has still not received.
But we are not remaining silent about such developments.
We have taken numerous steps and repeatedly issued public statements denouncing the ongoing violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran, as well as the country's persistent failure to uphold international standards on the administration of justice.
Once more, I call upon the Iranian Government to fully respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, in line with Iran's obligations under international law and the conventions it has ratified.
I would also like to reiterate our concern about Iran's refusal to resume the bilateral dialogue on human rights it suspended in 2004, which the European Union continues to ask for.
For our part, we remain ready to do so, as we believe in the importance of such a dialogue and engagement.
In conclusion, the Commission is, speaking quite unequivocally, in full agreement with Parliament, whatever the developments on the nuclear issue or on other issues of concern to the European Union.
And we have this double-track approach, which, at this moment, Javier Solana and his new counterpart are working on, and, at the same time, we are also working in the United Nations Security Council with regard to maybe a further strengthening of sanctions.
At this moment, there can be no real progress in the relationship with Iran without a serious improvement in the human rights situation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly, during voting time.
2.
Pakistan
The next item is four motions for resolutions on Pakistan.
author. - Mr President, let me start by expressing my sympathy to the victims of the horrific bomb attack in Karachi.
Our thoughts go out to all of those who were affected by that dramatic action.
Pakistan is a nation which we in Europe should care deeply about.
It is a great trading nation, it is an exporter of people, not least to this continent, and it is a vital ally in the fight against terrorism.
It is a matter, therefore, of great sadness that, in its 60-year history, Pakistan has failed to become a true democracy; but, on the other hand, we should be encouraged by the fact that it has not become a theocracy or even a permanent military dictatorship.
Once again in Pakistan, the window is opening for democracy.
We await the outcome of the court ruling on the legality of the President's election.
We call on President Musharraf to accept the outcome if it goes against him, but I also call on people in Pakistan and throughout the world to accept the ruling of the Court if it rules in favour of the President.
I think it is the only basis on which we can move forward in the country.
In relation to the election in January, I hope that the Government will pursue and continue to prepare for that election, and will make it possible for Ms Benazir Bhutto to campaign in a secure fashion.
In saying that, I know we imply that the Government was behind the bombing; I do not believe that, but we need to make sure that the security of all the candidates is guaranteed and the Government does its best to protect Ms Benazir Bhutto.
I also believe that Mr Sharif should be allowed to return to the country and campaign if he so wishes, and again have his security guaranteed.
The military should stand back during the whole period of the election campaign, and I hope, before January - and, indeed, before campaigning begins - that the President will get himself out of uniform and turn his country into a true civilian government.
That is the best hope for the future of Pakistan, and it is the best hope for relations between Europe and Pakistan: that we get a democratically elected parliament in January, with the President out of uniform, in 'civvies'.
author. - (SV) Thank you Mr President.
First of all, I must say with a heavy heart that month after month here in Parliament we have to decide on different resolutions because such large parts of the world around us fail to respect civil liberties and rights and violate fundamental human rights.
I must say this because I think it is so terrible that it just goes on and on.
We talk about it here in Parliament, we talk about it in so many different contexts, and still it goes on.
As regards Pakistan, which is the subject of the resolution we are now discussing, I want to say that the GUE/NGL Group supports the resolution in its entirety.
The resolution makes a large number of very justified demands on the government in Pakistan.
We in the world around it cannot keep silent about the influence and decision-making power of the military regime in all areas of society.
Power must be transferred to a civilian democratic government.
We must support all voluntary organisations, everyone working for democratic liberties and rights.
I particularly want to stress the importance of paragraph 16 of the resolution.
In that point Parliament expresses its great concern at the fact that a large proportion of Pakistani women are not able to participate in the democratic process.
People are being oppressed in Pakistan by the military regime on the grounds of religion, but we must not forget the oppression to which a large proportion of Pakistani women are exposed.
Our Group wishes strongly to support the entire resolution.
Thank you.
author. - (ES) Mr President, I also wish to say that despite the fact that logically the main responsibility for resolving the situation lies with the Pakistani authorities, that should not allow us forget that the European Union has, and we member countries above all, we Member States, have an enormous responsibility at least not to aggravate the situation.
It is related to the practice, which is also incomprehensible because of its incompatibility with the will to resolve the situation, of continuing to export or seeking to export arms to Pakistan.

To give but three examples: in 2006 the Government of the United Kingdom authorised the export of 15 000 rifles to the region, including Pakistan; France continues to seek to sell Pakistan missiles and radars to build a combat aircraft which Pakistan is allegedly developing with China; and Germany has also been responsible for exporting significant quantities of munitions, arms and other types of military equipment.
I believe that to that end the desire to resolve the situation in Pakistan is incompatible with supplying it under those policies.
I therefore suggest and ask my colleagues to support the amendment seeking the suspension of all types of exports of arms and military equipment until such time as it can be guaranteed that they will not be used to violate human rights.
author. - Mr President, last week's suicide bomb blast in Karachi reminded us of just how perilously close Pakistan has come to anarchy.
The prospect of a nuclear-armed Pakistan becoming a rogue state controlled by Islamist fanatics is, quite frankly, terrifying.
I am not especially a fan of Benazir Bhutto, whose period in office as Prime Minister was marked by widespread corruption, but, ultimately, a democratic and secular-leaning government under civilian control is always preferable to a military dictatorship, compromised in this case by its links to Islamist parties and the Afghan Taliban.
President Musharraf is supposed to be our ally in the war on terror; sometimes I wonder how committed he is to rooting out terrorism in his own country.
Hopefully, Ms Bhutto's return to Pakistan may be a fillip for human rights now.
One major concern is the ongoing repression of religious minorities, including Christians, Hindus and Ahmadi Muslims.
If she is to be taken seriously as a progressive leader of a more modern Pakistan, she must make sure that Pakistan respects its international obligations under human rights conventions.
But, while Pakistan faces many challenges, we should recognise that some progress is being made in some areas.
The economy continues to grow, and Pakistan has also engaged in confidence-building measures with India with regard to the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.
One question which remains totally unanswered is how, legally, the Pakistani Government, in spite of a Supreme Court judgment permitting former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to return from exile to Pakistan, deported him immediately to Saudi Arabia.
How, in international law, can a government deport one of its own citizens?
Nawaz Sharif may yet have a vital role to play in re-establishing multiparty civilian democratic politics in Pakistan.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we must take a very discerning view of Pakistan.
It is a large and important country with a troubled history.
The State of Pakistan was artificially created as a home for the Muslim inhabitants of India, and it therefore has an Islamic identity, which is something we cannot now hold against it.
That was more or less its original raison d'Ãªtre.
This does not mean that we should not battle against Islamic extremism, and indeed the Pakistanis themselves are devoting considerable efforts to that very struggle.
Pakistan was an important ally in the face of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, in dealings with Communist China, and in the context of long-running Soviet attempts to gain influence in India.
It was an important strategic factor for the West.
On the other hand, it goes without saying that Pakistan has internal difficulties, of which we must be aware: a complex and heterogeneous population structure in ethnic and religious terms, widespread poverty and, of course, the need to strengthen democracy and the rule of law.
We must clearly lend the country a very great deal of support in establishing free elections and a stronger independent judiciary, and must encourage the military command to hand over power gradually to elected politicians.
Above all, as Charles Tannock said, we must encourage Pakistan to keep pursuing the confidence-building process with neighbouring India.
In this respect there have been encouraging signs, and the purpose of a balanced policy on Pakistan is to reinforce those signs while expressing any necessary criticism.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the Pakistani people do not deserve military dictatorship, violence and lawlessness.
Therefore, one of key articles in this resolution is the one which reaffirms our solidarity with the people of Pakistan, who share the objectives of democratic governance and transparent, accountable rule, and who act with courage and determination in the face of terrorist and criminal violence.
That is, of course, why we put the stress on the need for a return to democracy and civilian government with free and fair elections in January as being the only way to answer the challenges of Pakistani society.
At the same time, we also stress the need to remove the militarisation of Pakistani society and deplore the failure of President Musharraf to stand down as army chief, as he promised he would.
The rule of law is extremely uneven in Pakistan.
There have been some encouraging developments at times, but these are also accompanied by some very repressive judgments. This falls particularly hard on minorities, religious and otherwise, as well as on women.
We rightly call for improvement in that area.
This as well, of course, as deploring the suicide bombing and the 140 victims and 500 injured last week.
I fear that these could become a pretext for restricting political activity, because already there has been an announcement by the Government that political parties will only be allowed to hold meetings in well-secured parks and public grounds rather than organise processions.
One could see how that might be made a pretext.
Finally, one of the more close-to-home reasons for my wanting Pakistan to fight both extremism and militarisation, and to return to the rule of law, is the impact on British people of Pakistani origin, with the calls, for instance, for profiling or for visa requirements for the United States.
It would remove that threat to people like my constituents if Pakistan were to be a democratic society.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, today on the television yet another bulletin about yet another attack in Pakistan, about fatalities.
This, too, is a never-ending story.
Why do we spend time on this, especially as we are acting on behalf of European taxpayers?
We should remember that the European Union sends significant amounts of money to Pakistan for health care, for the eradication of poverty and for education.
For this reason we have a right to be interested in what is happening in that country, which is, in part, supported by money from our electors.
I would like to draw your attention to issues that have not been discussed here.
First of all to the fact that religious minorities are persecuted and discriminated against in Pakistan.
This applies to Christians, but also to Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists.
I believe that it is worth focusing on this issue.
It is something that disappears from view in the light of these attacks and tragic deaths, but it is a constant feature.
I would also like to point out, and this issue has already been raised, that there is discrimination against women.
There are special hudud decrees for this purpose.
This too should be condemned and I am pleased that we are doing so quite independently of our political divisions.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, we have, of course, all expressed our horror at the shocking attacks in Pakistan last week, which, as the previous speaker said, are a never-ending story.
That should not, however, prevent us from pointing out the essential fact that Pakistan is of course a military dictatorship, that in the official Pakistan there are large-scale violations of human rights and the leader is still above the law.
Pakistan is also, however, a strict Islamic state in which there is no place for people of other faiths or religious minorities and, as has been said, the country has nuclear weapons.
Perhaps - but perhaps this cannot be said - Islamabad is in fact a greater threat than Teheran.
I do not know.
I also have a slight feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu with Pakistan, because just as in other Islamic countries, for instance Algeria at the time, military dictatorships or regimes where the army plays a dominant role prevent Islamic fundamentalists from taking power.
Unfortunately, more democracy often means more Islamic fundamentalism and, paradoxically, less democracy.
This is a dilemma that we cannot solve just like that.
Mr President, the murderous attack on unsuspecting supporters welcoming back Ms Benazir Bhutto in Karachi on 18 October has been another callous terrorist act against the prospects of bringing about democratic change in Pakistan.
The international community watched in horror as more innocent civilians were sacrificed in a nation where the dictatorial regime of General Musharraf is dragging the country into a state of fear and breakdown of law and order.
This brutal individual, with his corrupt governing group of associates, is a cancerous infliction on the people of Pakistan.
Regrettably, he is still in power, largely because he is supported by the West, especially the USA, but certainly also by one or two EU Member States.
The time has now come when the West must immediately pull the carpet from under Mr Musharraf's feet and provide support, not for him, but for the democratic reform forces in Pakistan.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as Pakistan prepares for important parliamentary elections, the situation is, as we all know, very difficult and preoccupying, and I, also, like many of you, have to express that I was deeply shocked by the heinous bomb attack and assassination attempt in Karachi, when Ms Benazir Bhutto returned to the country last week, and also by the terrible loss of life, which has affected so many innocent people.
We would like to extend our full sympathy to the families of the victims, and we also appeal to the Pakistani authorities to bring those responsible to justice.
This attack on a peaceful gathering has clearly demonstrated, once again, all the dangers of terrorism and fundamentalism to the people of Pakistan.
Ms Bhutto was right in describing this horrible event as a blow against democracy, particularly in the present electoral context of the country.
Parliament's wish to express solidarity with the people of Pakistan is both very relevant and timely.
We in Europe should encourage a more open, democratic society and, of course, a strong civil society in Pakistan.
It is also of fundamental importance that the elections should then provide maximum democratic legitimacy to the incoming assemblies, and the vote must be democratic, transparent and giving equal opportunities to all the political contestants.
As you are well aware, it is one of those countries where we might envisage a possible election observation mission.
In this context, my services carried out an exploratory mission in June, and they identified, I have to say, important shortcomings in the framework and the conditions for elections, including concerns about the independence of the Election Commission, the completeness and the accuracy of the voter register, restrictive candidature provisions, as well as lack of transparency in the results process.
However, with urgent political will, there is still time to improve a number of these problematic areas and, therefore, I have not yet taken a full decision on whether we will deploy a fully-fledged election observation mission.
I really have to see the aforementioned elements.
I believe that the majority of people in Pakistan would like to see a moderate, stable and democratic Pakistan, and we should support them in achieving this aim.
We are doing a lot, for instance, on the trade side, in order to help people to get out of poverty, but we also do a lot on the education side, in order not to have pupils and young children being educated in the madrasahs and being educated towards extremism and fundamentalism.
But we should also support this because it is of crucial importance, as has been said, for the whole region, including neighbouring countries like important Afghanistan.
Therefore, we have every reason to stay engaged.
This is what we are trying to do and, therefore, this debate is a very timely one.
The debate is closed.
We will vote on this subject shortly, after the debates.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, I would like first to thank everyone for their support in making Pakistan the subject of a written resolution.
A show of popularity for democratic forces and a clear emphasis on human rights, and not an army, are the biggest barriers to the rise to power of radical groups.
That is why these are things which now require our support, as do religious minorities.
Experience of human rights work shows that freedom of religion is an important indicator of the situation with respect to human rights; it is a kind of litmus test.
The problems are visible first in the status of religious groups and as flaws in the system of freedom of speech and right of assembly.
There is a correlation between the state of play of democracy and the status of minorities: wherever the opportunities the people have to participate are poor, minorities also suffer.
We might say that Pakistan's particular problem is the misuse of the law on blasphemy with regard to religious minorities.
There should be a system of the protection of religious values, not active persecution of people of other faiths.
Although the law is not targeted at any particular religious groups in terms of its content, the everyday reality is otherwise.
Death sentences are handed down mainly in respect of minorities.
Legal reform is crucial.
Only democracy will make this possible.
The unfortunate decision by Musharraf to keep his position as army chief has had an impact on Pakistan's social development these last few years, and has weakened it.
The gradual militarisation of society has been regrettable.
On the other hand, we express our support for Pakistan in its fight against Talibanisation.
We feel solidarity with those Pakistanis who are affected by last week's devastating bomb attack.
Last month I had the chance to familiarise myself personally with the political situation in Pakistan.
I had the honour of meeting representatives of different political parties, senators and members of parliament.
I especially want to mention, however, the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance, whose important work as the representative of many minority groups deserves the attention and support of the outside world.

Sudan: Killing of African Union peace-keeping soldiers
The next item is six motions for resolutions on Sudan and particularly the killing of African Union peacekeeping soldiers.
author. - Mr President, this House has repeatedly been dealing with the dire situation in Darfur, the last resolution having been adopted only in mid-September this year.
The news that, at the end of September, a murderous attack took place against an African Union base in south Darfur, resulting in the death of 10 peacekeepers, the serious injury of eight other personnel, and the apparent taking hostage of approximately 40 people more, has come as a grim reminder that, despite our efforts, much remains to be done in order to secure peace and stability in this sad corner of the world.
We should, of course, recollect that at least 200 000 people have died in Darfur during the four-year conflict, and more than two million people have been forced from their homes.
The September attack on African Union peacekeepers must force the EU and the UN to make sure that peacekeepers in Darfur are adequate in numbers and training, that they are properly and fully equipped and that they are given adequate logistical and other necessary support in order to fulfil their task safely and effectively.
Merely sending poorly trained and ill-equipped AU civilians into highly hazardous situations does not, as has been demonstrated in this case, serve any useful purpose other than to reduce the cost in terms of money but increase the cost in terms of human lives.
An urgent rethink and replanning by the international community is essential.
Last but not least, we must not forget those 40 people still missing and thought to have been taken hostage.
Every effort must be made to establish their fate and help bring them safely back to their loved ones.
author. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, after losing ten men in the raid at Haskanita, the head of the African Union mission in Darfur, General Martin Luther Agwai, sounded an alarm call, highlighting the fact that his forces were ill-equipped and too few in number, and that they could be defeated in a very short time.
There has, as yet, been no change in the situation, and further attacks like that of 29 September remain possible.
The General's alarm call must be heeded by the international community and particularly by the European Union, which could surely issue a powerful appeal for effective joint action by all the Member States involved in providing the promised EU support.
In two days' time, important talks are to take place in Libya between the Sudanese Government and various rebel forces.
It is still unclear whether Abdel el-Nur - the founder of the Sudan Liberation Army, now exiled in France - will take part in these talks.
Indeed, there is just as much uncertainty about other figures representing the array of rebel forces, for their numbers change from one day to the next.
Be that as it may, we have to prioritise these discussions, which have the potential to produce a ceasefire.
So once again we would ask the European Union authorities to spread the word as widely as possible about the importance of the meeting and about Europe's intention to support any positive developments that may come out of it, both militarily and in relation to improving conditions for aid workers, who are operating in a particularly difficult situation.
I would also remind you that the Government in Khartoum, through its actions thus far, bears a huge share of responsibility for today's tragic situation - and not only because it has supported the Janjaweed militias bringing death and terror to black African communities.
It was also the Government that categorically refused, for months, to accept the presence of a Western force in Sudan.
It was also the Government that made it impossible for journalists and foreign observers to gain access to the most troubled regions, even though their work there could make a major contribution to the ongoing mobilisation of international public opinion.
That mobilisation is clearly needed if we are to ensure that all of us in Europe shoulder our responsibilities in combating what must be recognised as nothing short of genocide.
Another important point is that the new European force, due to deploy in eastern Chad and the north of the Central African Republic, will make it harder for the rebels to move freely across the borders with those countries and to pursue their policy of recruiting fighters, willing or otherwise, from refugees' and displaced persons' camps.
Anticipating this obstacle to their activities, some armed groups are already turning their attention to the other side of Darfur, to the neighbouring region of Kordofan, to which Haskanita is a gateway.
Here too, the support the European Union has undertaken to provide may prove very useful, although within a short time it may also prove quite inadequate.
It is thus part of our task to continue doggedly doing what we can to bring about political conditions in which European intervention will be effective.
Surely we have seen enough violence and heartbreak in this region of the world? Not only have hundreds of thousands of lives already been lost, but the social fabric of Darfur is also being utterly devastated, so the task of reconstruction becomes more problematic from day to day.
I do realise that we have a little more time this afternoon, but let us not get entirely carried away, please!
author. - (DE) Madam President, the attack to which this resolution relates was targeted against a diplomatic solution to the situation in Sudan.
The context is quite important, because the attack occurred shortly before Desmond Tutu was due to conduct meaningful talks in Darfur.
It seems obvious that the attack was deliberately timed to thwart the quest for a diplomatic solution, which is so desperately needed in that region.
There followed lengthy speculation, of course, as to the identity of the rebel group that had carried out the attack, which claimed the lives of ten soldiers from the AU peacekeeping force.
The signs seem to indicate that the most likely perpetrators were a pro-Western rebel group.
When we deal with the Darfur issue, it is important not to focus too narrowly, but to remember that the most widely diverse rebel groups from the Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic are operating there in addition to the local armed forces on both sides.
I find it very revealing that the attempt made by the European Union to act on the Darfur conflict through the Chad mission is effectively in a sorry state at the present time.
At the start, the talk was about sending an EU force there.
In fact, a French force with a few additional troops has been sent there under the EU banner.
I have not yet been able to obtain any proper information about that force's actual area of operation.
Although we are still being told that the force is essentially there to protect refugees, most of the refugees are to be found in the border area, which is precisely where the Government of Chad does not want the EU force deployed.
Perhaps the Commissioner can assist again with some information.
What the EU is doing at the moment is definitely not what is needed to defuse the present situation We have to say very clearly that the very thing Desmond Tutu wanted, namely a diplomatic solution, is what we ought to be supporting here.
author. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, following its independence in 1956, Sudan, which is the largest country in Africa in terms of surface area, was supposed to be a home for everyone, for the Arab north and the Black south, for Muslims, Christians and animists.
However, the civil war that has continued for almost 50 years has claimed at least two million victims in that country.
Over 4.5 million people have been forced to leave their homes.
In Darfur, where the conflict broke out at the beginning of 2003, about 200 000 have died and nearly two million have been driven from their homes.
This is the result of terrible battles, purges and terror.
This is currently the most tragic humanitarian crisis in the world, and it is further aggravated by hunger and the lack of water.
One should therefore be grateful to all those who undertake peace initiatives in this tortured land.
We should address such thanks to the African Union, which sent a 7 000-strong peace mission there.
The most recent attack on this mission, which took place in Haskanita, aroused strong objections.
At least ten dead and about 50 lost or kidnapped.
This is a clear breach of existing agreements as well as of United Nations resolutions.
I would like to express my sympathy to the families of these persons.
We should, acting as the European Union, demand that those responsible be punished and that the peace process be reinstated.
The planned forces of the UN mission together with the African Union will number about twenty thousand more soldiers.
However, they must have some possibility to neutralise the armed conflict and help bring stability to this explosive corner of Africa.
I hope that the European Parliament's decision to award the Sakharov prize to the Sudanese lawyer Salih Mahmoud Osman will be helpful in making a breakthrough in the Sudanese drama.
author. - (ES) Madam President, I naturally wish to add my voice to the vigorous condemnation of the killing of the members of the peace-keeping forces.
At the same time, however, I also wish to remember all the civilians who were victims, and who are victims in the situation in Darfur, with particular reference to the brutality with which certain assaults with clear sexual overtones are being carried out and serious violations are taking place in terms of the way women are used on a variety of fronts, including sexually.
I believe that all of this requires not only actions and declarations but a solid investigation which should be carried out not only by the people on the ground but also by the International Criminal Court.
That, for me, is one of the fundamental aspects of this debate.
Secondly, I also wish to note that we should welcome the fact that there is currently permission - to give it some kind of name, from the Government of Sudan to accept UNAMID troops but at the same time we should also note that on other occasions they have broken this commitment, broken this promise and therefore we should maintain a degree of caution.
I believe, naturally, that it is necessary to continue to insist, while at the same time, as Mr PflÃŒger said, ensuring that the forces which go, go with a broad United Nations mandate, and not only to back the interests of one country in particular.
Thirdly, I believe it is also essential and necessary to recall that all aid must be made available, whether political, financial or technical as may be required to perform the duties that that mission will have to face on the ground.
It is not possible to send a mission into the field without its having guarantees that it will be able to fulfil its mandate.
Finally, and again very significantly, I would like to note, and here I undoubtedly go beyond the words of the Resolution, which urges the government of Sudan to follow the demands of the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, to arrest Ahmed Haroun, Sudan's Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, specifically so that he can be held accountable for the displacement of two million people in Darfur, thereby instigating an international trial which should have begun some time ago.
author. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the facts are known: there was an attack on the AU peacekeeping force on 30 September; ten soldiers lost their lives, eight were seriously injured, and forty are still missing.
I was in Darfur with a delegation from our Parliament in July.
During our visit we met representatives of AMIS, the African Union Mission in Sudan.
It was, and still is, an incredibly difficult mission, as we heard from some of these AMIS representatives.
For example, one of the commanders, a Nigerian general, told us that he felt as though he were a priest rather than a soldier.
All he could do, he said, was appeal to people to refrain from evil acts; he had no real mandate to act, and so it is hardly surprising that rebel factions have exploited this weakness.
The West is not focusing sharply enough on Africa.
There is an imbalance between the extent of the tragedy in Darfur and the level of attention we devote to it.
Military operations in Africa are all very well, but there is a danger of Africa becoming a testing ground for that type of mission.
When the EU conducts operations there, its forces must be armed with a robust mandate, appropriate equipment and sufficient manpower.
The duration of the mission must also depend on its objectives.
We must not hide behind others, but must fulfil our own obligations.
This applies to the funding of AMIS and to support ranging from logistics and military equipment to personnel.
