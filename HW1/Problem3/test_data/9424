On the basis of this assessment, the Commission will submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council in 2011 and, if deemed necessary, will propose additional measures.
These measures will include free allocation of greenhouse gas emission allowances to energy-intensive sectors, up to 100%.
The Commission's proposal includes, as a further measure, the establishment of an effective carbon equalising or offsetting mechanism.
The aim is that the Community industrial installations that run a significant risk of carbon leakage should be placed on a comparable, equal footing with those in third countries.
Under such an equalising system, provision could also be made for imposing terms on importers, comparable with the terms applying to installations within the EU, for example, the obligation to return CO2 emission allowances.
Whatever method is agreed and whatever action is undertaken, it must be in full conformity with the principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
This is especially true of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities in the special case of less developed countries.
It must also be in conformity with the Community's international obligations, including Word Trade Organisation rules.
To conclude, the proposal on climate and energy has been collectively approved by the European Commission as a whole, and is therefore supported by all its members.
Thank you, Commissioner, for a very substantial reply to my question, which, incidentally, I tabled long before I realised I would have responsibility as rapporteur for the review of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme situation.
My question was quite specifically about where we stand, 'we' really being the College of Commissioners at this stage, in relation to a possible introduction of carbon adjustment tariffs, or carbon allowances, in the event that we do not get international agreement.
I agree with you very much that we need a level playing field for EU industry and third-country production in this area.
I just want to tease out whether this option - and I am not being protectionist, and I really support the globalised world we live in today - of a potential carbon adjustment tariff is still out there on the table.
I feel it should be, so I am asking you whether that is the position of the College of Commissioners on this issue, to mark the seriousness with which we treat the whole need to reduce CO2 emissions and the whole climate change debate.
We do not need to be aggressive about it, but we need to be determined about it.
Member of the Commission. - I fully agree with you, and this is a very responsible position.
I am very glad that you are going to be the rapporteur for this very important piece of legislation.
Of course, we discussed everything.
I remember that in Nairobi we had a specific discussion on this issue.
We discussed it in my services, with other services and with other Commissioners, and what we concluded as being a wise, balanced position is to include in the proposal a provision which will take care of the problems that energy-intensive sectors could face in the event that we do not have an international agreement, or that an international agreement does not impose carbon constraints in other countries as ambitious as the European Union's.
What we have decided is that, by 2010, we shall identify with objective criteria which are these sectors, and by June 2011 we shall assess the situation of whether we have an international agreement or even international sectoral agreements.
Accordingly, I hope, and I sincerely believe, that we will have an agreement by the end of 2009, one which will tackle climate change problems effectively.
However, if we do not have an agreement, or if it is not ambitious enough, then there are provisions in our proposal that permit us to assess the situation and, accordingly, either provide emissions allowances for up to 100% of the allocations of these energy-intensive industries or permit the inclusion of importers into our emissions trading system and, of course, the obligation to pay for similar amounts of allowances as local producers will do, so equalising the situation - or even a combination of these measures.
Therefore, we are giving the necessary assurance to our industries that we will be looking at the problems.
At the same time, we are giving a warning to other countries: they had better agree on an international agreement.
Therefore, by having this very balanced position, we are achieving all the objectives, and I hope that Parliament and the Council will vote on and adopt the legislation as soon as possible, by the end of the year or early next spring.
(NL) I am delighted with the position of the Commission, of the Commissioner, and the well-balanced approach.
Nevertheless, I have one more very important concern, and that is that we are still exporting old technology to developing countries that is inefficient and also generates emissions.
I would ask the Commissioner whether we can perhaps conduct a complementary policy in this regard that is along the same lines.
Can we expect any such initiatives in the short term?
In a debate this afternoon on the CAP, we discussed imports into the EU and we called on the Commission as a matter of urgency to develop a plan to push through European non-trade concerns in the WTO talks.
Surely the issue of climate change must feature high on our list of priorities and carbon tariffs on imports into the EU is certainly important in this regard.
So I would just like to ask the Commissioner, as Mrs Doyle did in her original question, does the WTO have a view on this, and what is it?
Member of the Commission. - I fully agree that we should not export technologies which are going to pollute abroad.
Actually, our first concern will be that we shall not permit the relocation of sectors or industries outside the European Union, not only because we are going to lose jobs and we are going to create employment problems but also because we do not want to carry on emitting and polluting in countries that do not have carbon restraints as we have.
So we should be very careful and we should apply our utmost attention to not permitting this phenomenon to occur.
Of course, when we are preaching that the main way for developing countries to fight climate change is by improving energy efficiency, we have to be very careful what we are exporting to them.
Regarding the World Trade Organisation position on carbon tariffs, we do not know their position, because the question has not arisen, but, after examination within the European Union, we think that there is no problem, because what we have tried to do with the inclusion in the emissions trading system, which is a bit different from border tax, is to equalise the situation.
We do not favour our industries; we put them in the same position as similar industries and sectors which are producing in countries with no carbon constraints.
By the way, in the United States they are having the same discussion, because in the Liebermann-Warner bill for the introduction of an emissions trading system in the United States they have a similar provision.
This discussion also took place in the United States and they also think that this is compatible with World Trade Organisation rules.
Part two
Subject: Intercultural dialogue in EU
In this Year of Intercultural Dialogue in the EU the Commission has planned many events.
An emphasis should be placed on involving young people in the events of this year so that they may benefit from the rich cultural diversity in the EU.
What specific measures does the Commission envisage in order to involve young people in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue?
Member of the Commission. - (SK) Thank you, Madam President and thanks also to Mr Burke for his question.
I would like to say that the ambition for this year, which is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, is to promote dialogue among cultures as a process through which everyone living in the European Union can improve their ability to engage more extensively and more openly in their daily lives with the complex cultural environment.
It focuses above all on raising awareness, especially among young people, and on training them in active European citizenship that is open to the world, respects cultural diversity and is based on shared values.
In this context youth and education are two key areas for dialogue, along with areas such as migration, minorities, multilingualism, employment, as well as media, religion, art and culture.
The EU cofinances seven flagship projects on a pan-European level, aimed mainly at young people and promoting cultural dialogue among them through collaborative artistic projects, story telling, media projects, media campaigns, urban culture, exchanges between disadvantaged areas or communities and developing dialogue on art, immigrants, immigration and similar topics.
This year the EU is also cofinancing one project for or in each Member State.
The main emphasis is again on youth and education.
We are also in continuous contact with the group directing the Civil Society Platform for Intercultural Dialogue, which includes representatives of the European Youth Forum and EFIL, the European Federation for Intercultural Learning, for example.
To conclude, the awareness campaign on the importance of this year and cultural dialogue encompasses in itself a vast range of activities aimed at young people, based on proposals by civil associations and EU initiatives.
All the relevant information is, of course, available on the Internet, at http://www.interculturaldialog2008EU"
. The whole process is very much based on communication promoting partnerships, and helping to highlight high-quality projects and experiences.
I am convinced that it will strengthen the process: cultural dialogue as a process, rather than as a one-off event.
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your very detailed reply, and I welcome the developments which you referred to.
I know you, as Commissioner, and the Commission are working very hard on this programme.
In relation to the 27 individual governments, what programme have you asked them to get involved in with regard to supporting what the Commission is doing?
In other words, while it is fine that we are putting up seven flagship projects, is each individual government also going to put forward a flagship project within each of their own individual countries?
Member of the Commission. - I said that this is a common cause, a common endeavour, and there are many good ideas and ongoing initiatives at European and national level, plus many at regional and municipal level.
I am happy that there is this kind of strong interest, even internationally, to see opportunities and to seek the opportunity to promote an intercultural approach instead of 'multi-culti' comments and laments.
I think we need this.
I do not intend to read out the projects themselves; they are quite inspirational - especially at EU level - because these were selected from many at EU level, and they are very different to those as the level of the Member States.
In fact we have 28, because in Belgium there are two main communities and support.
We think that the Member States which involve the young generation, which are really open to the future, are probably the best examples of addressing the challenges of living in diversity, and also promoting unity. Projects like Diversidad, which is run by the European music office.
Here we see a combination of very popular activities: music, music interpretation, listening to music, learning via music, and dialogue with urban culture. The International Yehudi Menuhin Foundation; Ton monde est le mien, something which reflects that we need others to understand ourselves; A Unique Brussels, which is a network of EU institutes of culture; Alter Ego, a contribution to intercultural dialogue, cross-cultural understanding, and European citizenship by young people through collaborative art projects, which can make them reach beyond their normal social circles.
One project is by the European Cultural Foundation - Stranger.
This is about young people expressing themselves and creating a platform where they can link their experience to the wider European context.
Last but not least, I think it is very important that Parliament is involved as much as possible, individually or collectively.
There are many occasions - events in Brussels, for example - on different topics connected to intercultural dialogue.
We as a Commission will invite the Committee on Culture as a body (this also means Members) to all the events we are participating in or co-organising.
We will have, for example, a European Youth Week in November, and I think they should come.
Some of the events should be organised in the premises of Parliament in Brussels, with the participation of parliamentarians and, of course, young people from all countries including non-EU members.
There are many occasions where you can have a say and, especially, set an example and show your commitment.
I believe this should not be just a one-year story.
It must be a long-term objective and a process where we learn, participate and mature in order to ensure a better century than the 20th century, which was one of many divisions, conflicts and ideologies opposing human dignity.
So I think there is strong momentum for your involvement.
I am just wondering, in the whole area of intercultural dialogue and the involving of young people, whether the Commission has looked at the excellent work that is being done in the north of Ireland in this particular area: in the north, between the two different communities that have been at loggerheads for so long, and on a cross-border basis.
I think there is something specific there that could be drawn on, and I would ask the Commission whether it has looked at it and, if not, could they do so.
I shall be very brief.
I just want to ask the Commissioner whether there are any measures proposed in the area of volunteering.
This is surely an ideal opportunity for people from different backgrounds to work together by choice, particularly, let us say, in the area of youth volunteering, with programmes that would set out to ensure that people who do not normally volunteer would get involved - because sometimes volunteering tends to be a white, middle-class activity - and in the area of intergenerational volunteering.
Are there any measures in those areas to promote intercultural dialogue?
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, on Northern Ireland, I would firstly like express my congratulations in relation to the new atmosphere and what I would describe as very positive expectations of gradual and sincere reconciliation and commitment to the shared values.
I even plan to go there, which may be the best answer.
I think that greater involvement of Northern Ireland's students, teachers and professors in EU exchanges and cooperation in the ERASMUS programme would also help to bring the larger European community and populations closer.
So I plan to visit this part of the European Union.
Secondly, as regards volunteering, it is a very important topic because volunteering is an expression of solidarity, humanity and togetherness.
On the other hand it is also a non-formal education or learning process.
We need it for employment, new skills, new knowledge and social skills and also for the promotion of citizenship and for values which unite us.
We do more than we used to.
For example in the new programme, Youth in Action, there is a much bigger volume of money and importance in the European voluntary service.
It is now more open to international engagement.
We have larger numbers and I think this is one of the answers.
This year we would like to come up with an initiative on volunteering where more recognition and better conditions for volunteering could be developed.
Of course we need Member States to participate and I am happy that France in particular is willing to deal with volunteering as a topic - volunteering and young people.
This morning I met the minister responsible for health, youth and sport policy and we agreed on certain priorities.
This is one of three priorities for the youth area under the French Presidency, so we will take some steps forward.
The next question on the paper was by Mr Higgins.
I am sorry to say that I cannot accept the question, because he is not in the Chamber.
I know that you would like to work in cooperation.
Unfortunately, the exchange was not notified to us previously and, therefore, according to our Rules, I cannot take it.
I am very sorry I cannot take it and I must give priority to those Members who are present in the Chamber.
Subject: German-Czech-Austrian cultural cooperation
What trilateral or bilateral cross-border cultural cooperation projects has the Commission supported between the Czech Republic, Germany and Austria during the past year, and does it see any possibilities for assisting such projects on a significant scale in 2008?
Member of the Commission. - (SK) Madam President, allow me to thank Mr Bernd Posselt for his question.
I would like to point out that culture and its financing at national level are the responsibility of the Member States.
That is the principle of subsidiarity, which we respect and value highly.
The European Union's task is to support and complement the activities carried out in the Member States, not to take responsibility for them.
Secondly, it is important to remember that the Culture Programme (2007 to 2013) promotes intercultural dialogue, transnational mobility of cultural players and works, and cultural and artistic products.
These projects must involve at least three cultural operators in three different countries: this partly answers Mr Bernd Posselt's question.
Cooperation between operators from the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany can therefore be supported if these partners have been chosen on the basis of the quality of projects submitted as a response to the invitation by the European Commission.
As regards the specific projects of these three Member States financed last year, I would like to point out that the Culture Programme (2007 to 2013) has only been up and running for a little over a year.
We will have to wait some time to find out about the type of projects financed during this short space of time.
In short, the results relating to last year's projects are not yet available.
However, if we look at the period 2000 to 2006, support was provided for 116 cooperation projects and 39 cofinanced projects over a number of years that involved either bilateral or trilateral cooperation between Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic.
Of these projects, 28 were financed from the 2006 budget: this in fact paved the way for the activities of last year (2007).
The complete list of all approved and financed projects is published on the European Commission's website.
I think that that is a comprehensive response to this matter.
(DE) Many thanks, Commissioner, for your reply.
A little while ago you spoke at length about events in Brussels.
However, events in the regions are also very important and I therefore have two short supplementary questions.
Firstly, you have just been talking about bilateral programmes.
Does this allow for German-Czech programmes only, or should three countries be included here?
Along with Austria, this could also be Slovakia or Poland, for instance.
Second supplementary question: does this also cover the Euroregions?
Member of the Commission. - (SK) As I said before, under the new Culture Programme there must be three partners from three countries involved in short, one-year programmes; more partners are needed for programmes running for several years.
The scope or quantity of these activities are thus in a way adapted to the enlarged European Union.
We cannot supplement or substitute, from a small budget, what really needs much greater support from the national governments or regional authorities in large federal states.
As regards what I said about bilateral relations, of the three countries mentioned in Mr Bernd Posselt's question two were in certain cases paired with another country but the issue of participation was thus partially answered.
I want to reassure not only Mr Posselt but also potential partners that cooperation between, for example, regions or Euroregions, between cities as well as cultural operators in the general sense, is today possible and supported not only by the Culture Programme (2007 to 2013) but also by the Europe for Citizens Programme 2007 - 2013.
This programme promotes the involvement of civil society, and its legal basis, inter alia, is Article 151 of the EC Treaty, promoting citizenship defined in cultural terms or with a cultural dimension.
Today there are thousands of examples of well-established partnerships between cooperating local authorities, non-governmental organisations or various associations based on the people-to-people dialogue in civil society.
Thirdly, I would like to add that the Structural Funds are an even greater source of support for the general promotion of cultural aspects and cultural heritage and for cooperation between countries to safeguard and enhance their cultural heritage.
I would like to appeal to the ministers or partners to remember when debating culture that Europe is more characterised by culture than by business or geography.
That is why investment in culture helps to increase our potential, strengthens European identity and makes Europeans more attractive.
This should happen at local level, where people live.
It is not just about Brussels and other capital cities: it is about our regions, towns and villages.
- (LT) I have a question, Commissioner.
As you have said, only the Member States themselves would implement the cultural policy.
Brussels is in no position to do anything about it.
However, in the new accession countries in particular, artists and people involved in cultural activities have been feeling neglected for the last 10 to 15 years.
What is the Commission doing, or what is it prepared to do, to share the good experience of how artists are being supported in the new accession countries, as well as new ideas and projects relating to this?
Could you please give any examples?
(DE) There are also numerous historical pressures in the relationships between the Czech Republic, Germany and Austria.
Are there any specific programmes or rather is the Commission planning to concentrate its main efforts here in order to include the associations of displaces people in these European programmes of work, for example, which would be very important in this regard for a more general understanding?
Member of the Commission. - (SK) Thank you for the additional questions.
They demonstrate that culture, identity and memories are important, as is looking forward and developing culture.
We support these aspects.
I must reiterate that subsidiarity is about responsibility and not about creating an alibi for us so that we can say that we are not cooperating because the matter is a Member State competence.
The Commission genuinely makes every effort to create the best possible environment for cultural dialogue, exchange and cooperation, and I believe that the fruit of those efforts are fairly obvious.
I mentioned the Culture Programme (2007 to 2013) earlier.
Let us compare the numbers: seven years in the past, seven years now.
However, one very important example is the fact that the European agenda for culture in a globalising world was pushed through and approved for the first time last year, not just to the satisfaction of the Commission but to the satisfaction of the EU as a whole.
The proposals were presented in May and approved by the Member States in November.
Secondly, we have succeeded in agreeing that when it comes to culture, to an agenda for culture, we will be using a new method of cooperation, an open method of coordination.
Prior to that, the majority would have said that this would have been unlikely because we would have been unable to reach an agreement due to the differences of opinion.
However, the substance is the key issue: it is important to ensure that this cooperation focuses on practical cultural needs in the broader sense, on the needs of the cultural and artistic sectors, on simply expanding culture.
The Lisbon Council achieved something important in spring last year: cultural sectors or the so-called cultural industry have for the first time been mentioned in the Lisbon Strategy, which is credited with making an important contribution to economic growth and employment.
This helps to overcome the classic dichotomy that culture costs money while business brings in money.
Culture goes hand in hand with values, with the expanding dimensions of sustainable economic development.
A lack of culture results in business problems, as well as political and other problems.
By this I mean that culture should be perceived as an important player and promoted in different ways so that it prospers.
I am therefore glad that even in the Commission we are achieving more success with this more horizontal approach, thanks, too, to last year's decision.
I do not want my answer to be too long.
The new Member States make contributions through their culture, their extensive heritage, their fresh memories of a divided Europe or of a past that was much more dramatic in the second half of the 20th century.
However, in many ways they can learn from the older Member States, which, for example, have much more dynamic methods of financing culture, developing cultural education and dealing with many issues that have to be promoted in the new Member States too.
Policies and governments cannot treat culture as a residual issue: 'if there is money left of course we will give something to the cultural sector, but it is neither a priority nor a key topic'.
Secondly, I would like to respond to what Mr Reinhard Rack said about the burden of the past.
A little bit earlier I touched briefly on the issue of memory: it plays an important role in matters of identity; it teaches us not to repeat the tragedies of the past.
In my response to Mr Bernd Posselt, I referred to the Europe for Citizens Programme 2007-2013.
This programme allows the European Union over the course of these seven years to cofinance projects aimed at keeping alive the memories of the periods of dictatorship, as well as the victims of Nazism and Stalinism.
I think that this is a very important challenge because it helps us to remember that all that we have - freedom, democracy, a united Europe - has not just happened by chance or by default and that there is always a certain temptation, be it smaller or greater, to move towards totality and a form of simplification.
Remember that we need to develop values in each generation: technology and buildings are easy to pass on but values must be implanted in every person's mind and heart from childhood.
I would therefore encourage you to use these instruments for cultural or civil cooperation, to use them to preserve our memories, for the benefit of our hearts and our minds.
In my opinion, that is precisely the task of those who have survived such times, who remember the events, who come from countries that used to be in a sort of grey zone or behind the Iron Curtain.
In any event, today's Union should provide a space for remembering and for developing the Community.
In view of our time constraints we will now move to the questions to Commissioner Mandelson.
Questions 38 to 40 will therefore be answered in writing.
The debate on the Lamfalussy Process was allowed to run 30 minutes into Question Time.
As a result, I could not be here.
I understood questions were starting at 18.00, that there would be 30 minutes for the first Commissioner, and then I would be the second questioner for the next Commissioner.
The procedures of this House are absolutely crazy.
This is supposed to be a model of organisation.
The kind of organisation and the kind of procedures that we have here would not be tolerated in the most disorganised village or town council within the European Union.
It is absolutely crazy.
Question Time should be sacrosanct and there should be absolutely no overrun.
It discriminates against those Members who put down questions well in advance and there is absolutely no excuse for it.
I made the point at the beginning of Question Time that we were running late, and that this was extremely unfortunate.
I will try to find out what the reasons were that we seemed to have so many debates before that had caused that late running.
I take that very seriously, having responsibility for Question Time.
Now, as far as your own question is concerned, I had noted that there are other Members in this Chamber who have waited patiently throughout for their questions to be answered and did not leave for other engagements.
I know that we all have difficult calendars and agendas, but I have had, therefore, to follow the Rules strictly and give priority to those Members who have stayed in the Chamber.
I am sorry, but the Rules are quite clear.
Subject: Settlement of dispute between the EU and the USA concerning GMOs in the World Trade Organisation
On 11 January 2008, the reasonable period of time (RPT) expired for EU compliance with the ruling of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body concerning measures for the authorisation and marketing of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
According to statements by the US Government, the USA agreed with the EU temporarily to suspend the procedure to apply trade sanctions 'in order to provide the EU an opportunity to demonstrate meaningful progress on the approval of biotech products.'
The US also expressed its displeasure at the French Government's intention to activate the safeguard clause to prohibit the cultivation of a variety of GM maize, as other EU Member States have already done.
What is the Commission's scope for negotiation to achieve an 'amicable' settlement of this matter and avoid reprisals against the EU while, nevertheless, enabling the EU to maintain a strict regulatory framework in relation to GMOs?
Member of the Commission. - Settlement of the dispute referred to by the honourable Member would be facilitated if the European Union showed to the complainant that its regulatory procedure was working satisfactorily and led to approvals without undue delay, whenever risks to health or the environment were not identified or were manageable.
Furthermore, a solution would have to be found regarding the national safeguard measures subject to the WTO proceedings, which are found not to be scientifically based and thus not to be compatible with WTO rules.
In both cases, the Commission needs to count on cooperation by Member States.
The obligations on us, therefore, are clear and we cannot evade our responsibilities.
Meanwhile, the United States has agreed not to move to immediate retaliation.
However, respective proceedings could resume following a determination by a compliance panel that the European Union has failed to implement the WTO panel rulings.
The effective functioning of the European Union regulatory system on genetically modified organisms is not only of interest to the WTO complainants but also to the European Union itself.
Most of our current sources of animal feed are countries developing biotechnology products.
Therefore, our timely authorisation of safe GMO products for feed use is necessary to ensure the competitiveness of the livestock industry in the EU.
For example, the EU pork industry is facing increasing difficulties in obtaining feed at reasonable prices, while prices for porkmeat are falling.
In other words, the longer the delay for our authorisations, the greater the risk to farming needs in Europe.
- (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, in the event of a trade war between the EU and the United States over genetically modified organisms, what amount of potential sanctions is being considered, and how will they be applied?
Member of the Commission. - The amount of retaliation would be determined by the WTO implementation panel.
But potential retaliation could be very significant.
Indeed, it could run to hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of trade.
It could be applied to EU products coming from different Member States, not only those that have adopted national safeguard measures against GMOs.
So those Member States responsible would not only be putting their own producers and exporters at direct risk of retaliation. They would, through their actions, be putting in jeopardy the exporters of many Member States besides their own.
I hope that they will consider these implications and these consequences when they come to review the action they are taking.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for his clarity, because this is a huge issue for the animal feed industry.
But does he see - as I see - an increasing unwillingness among consumers to take on board the reality of the EU feed market?
He mentions very effectively the issue of the impact on our poultrymeat and pigmeat sector on competitiveness.
Perhaps at a later stage we can discuss the wider issue of WTO rules in relation to non-trade and the negotiations currently under way on the competitiveness of agriculture in general.
Member of the Commission. - I think that what we are seeing is a great deal of misinformation, misrepresentation and scaremongering, which is influencing some sections of public opinion.
I think that if there were a more representative range of information sources and more objective information given to our public, and some of the ramifications and consequences of some of these actions taken into account, then they would quite possibly come to other conclusions.
Of course consumers should know what they are consuming.
Consumers should also have a choice between GMO and non-GMO.
At the moment they are being denied that choice by prejudice against GMOs.
Subject: In-depth evaluation of Economic Partnership Agreements
ACP governments which have agreed to liberalise trade in goods have insufficient negotiating power on matters of real concern to them.
While they have to make major concessions in the EPAs, Europe is not entering into any binding commitments on important issues such as improving the rules of origin, the allocation of subsidies or the extension of development aid.
Does the Commission agree that these countries should be given more time to arrive at properly negotiated EPAs, that they should have better support in boosting their negotiating capacity, and that an in-depth evaluation and review on the existing agreements - which are still far from being the 'development instruments' they should be - is therefore necessary!
Subject: Economic Partnership Agreements
The expiry of the 1 January 2008 deadline regarding Economic Partnership Agreements with ACP countries has given rise to considerable uncertainty in these countries.
Agreements concluded on exemption clauses for exports, safeguard clauses, improved rules of origin, the allocation of subsidies or the extension of development aid are often inadequate and therefore enjoy little support in the countries concerned.
Is the Commission prepared to carry out an in-depth evaluation of the existing agreements?
What specific measures will it undertake to that end, and within what time-framework?
Subject: Impact measurement of Economic Partnership Agreements
The Commission has recently agreed a full Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the Caribbean, as well as a series of interim deals meant to eventually lead to full EPAs with other countries or regions.
The progress made so far was presented very clearly to the European Parliament Development Committee this January, and we acknowledge the hard work which has been put in from the Commissioner's side.
You also pointed out the tasks ahead, however. Among others, you mentioned that it will be vital to find ways to monitor the implementation and impact of new agreements.
Does the Commission have any rough estimates at this point of the positive impact of the latest agreements on the income of African farmers, as well as on the final prices for European consumers?
How does the Commission plan to go about the development of techniques to monitor and measure implementation and impact?
Subject: EPAs
Can the Commission provide the latest information on EPAs?
Subject: Economic Partnership Agreements
Why have you not managed to convince critics that EPAs are fair to developing countries?
Subject: Partnership agreements with developing countries
Most ACP countries have signed economic partnership agreement (EPAs) with the EU.
A whole series of voluntary organisations do not consider that the agreements will attain the stated objectives, i.e. promoting economic development in the contracting countries.
The Commission's spokesperson has stated that EPAs could in future be put up for debate and thus be renegotiated.
On the other hand, the Trade Commissioner has distanced himself from the possibility of renegotiating the existing agreements.
Can the Commission clarify the situation in this regard?
Will developing countries which have signed partnership agreements with the EU be able to renegotiate them?
Member of the Commission. - Things have moved on since the Commission's update to the Committee on Development in January of this year.
The legal texts have been jointly checked for the Caribbean economic partnership agreement, and we are beginning the process leading to signature and ratification.
In other regions, we have been preparing the interim agreements for signature and have been reflecting on how to replace these with full EPAs.
I have just returned from a visit to southern and eastern Africa taking in Lesotho, South Africa, Botswana and Zambia.
I held ministerial meetings with the SADC and ESA regions, and I had extensive discussions with President Mbeki on both EPAs and the DDA, incidentally.
I was struck in all meetings with ESA and SADC by the commitment of the regions to move forward with the negotiations, not to look back and not to unravel what has been achieved, with all the disastrous implications for trade security that that unravelling would have.
This was reflected in joint declarations in which we made clear our shared commitment to agree full EPAs by the end of this year.
We have also held senior official meetings with central Africa and west Africa in recent days.
Central Africa wants a full EPA by July, and west Africa intends to reach a full EPA in mid-2009.
Finally, the Pacific region is consulting internally, but the agreed objective remains to finalise a full EPA in 2008.
My clear sense is that most of the regions are now coming out of a period of stock-taking and reflection after the developments of last December and are clearly restating their commitment to move towards full EPAs.
This is an important sign that their commitment to integrating trade and development strategies in a progressive, forward-looking way.
It is a commitment I welcome.
Our objectives for full EPAs for whole regions and covering the full range of trade, trade-related and development issues remain unchanged.
In the mean time non-LDCs like Kenya, CÃŽte d'Ivoire and others say they have protected thousands of agricultural jobs through the interim agreements, and LDCs like Tanzania and Lesotho praise improvements in rules of origin.
Sensitive agricultural sectors are protected, and the ACP now have time and space to work out how to reach full regional agreements.
EPAs need to be closely monitored in both aid and trade aspects.
This is why the Caribbean EPA establishes compressive monitoring arrangements, including parliamentary and other consultative subcommittees.
The interim agreements will be replaced with full EPAs that include similar provisions before any substantive liberalisation commitments apply on the ACP side.
(NL) Commissioner, I take note of your answer.
We shall look into that further.
You cannot deny, however, that most ACP countries have a very inadequate negotiating capacity and are sometimes left with no choice, presented with a fait accompli.
Just last week - and this has nothing to do with the ACP countries - I met a trade union leader from Guatemala, Mr Pinzon, who told me about his difficult situation as a union leader when it came to negotiations between the European Union and Central America.
This situation is common in countries where certain communities and positions are extremely weak.
My question is as follows: can the Commissioner ensure that certain rights, for example trade union rights and international labour rights, are made binding in that kind of trade agreement, both Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and agreements with other global blocs, such as Central America, so that those rights are respected?
I am no specialist in the subject, but I have the impression that the agreements contain significant gaps in this regard.
Member of the Commission. - Guatemala, when I last looked at the list of ACP countries, is not included in their number.
We do not have any in Central America.
So, I would advise the honourable Member to find different sources for his information, from those who actually live and work in ACP countries.
Economic partnership agreements (EPAs) were originally conceptualised as trade and development agreements going beyond pure market access.
Could the Commissioner comment on growing concerns that the interim partnership agreements are creating growing trade enmity amongst African nations, the example of Kenya being one?
Kenyan support for these agreements has been viewed by its neighbours as undermining the continent's zeal for a more radical position on EPAs.
Member of the Commission. - I am very sorry, I do not know what neighbours of Kenya have taken this position.
As far as I know, unless the honourable Member can advise me which particular country she is talking about, they seem to have subscribed to the interim agreements in the same way as Kenya.
All I would say is that the interim agreements concern goods market access.
They are interim agreements that were made before the WTO's deadline at the end of December so that countries like Kenya, which are not LDCs and are therefore not covered by 'everything but arms', would have their trade preferences and access to the European market secured, so that there was no trade disruption after 1 January.
It is for that reason that our counterparts in Kenya and other similarly placed countries have recorded their satisfaction with the lengths we went to and the flexibility we showed to make sure that they came over the line by the end of the year.
Would you accept that, apart from making the ACP-EU relationship WTO-compatible, one of the key aims of the economic partnership agreements is to ensure that South-South trade increases?
In that context, would you examine the possibility of increasing and better targeting our aid for trade to make sure that the benefits of South-South trade are realised through these EPAs?
Member of the Commission. - I strongly support that point and I would use this opportunity to appeal to our Member States to fulfil what I regard as their side of the bargain by fulfilling the commitments they have made to provide aid for trade, to match the commitment that has been made by the Commission.
It is a very important commitment that we have made, which Member States have previously said they would match.
I hope they do so in practice now and live up to the expectations of our colleagues in ACP countries.
As a non-specialist in this area - unlike, probably, many of the other questioners - I am just interested to know how, and rather puzzled as to why, the opponents of EPAs made so much of the running in the press.
Why was it not possible to get across better the advantages of EPAs?
Is it simply that those opposing them did not accept the benefits of trade liberalisation, which I do, and just wanted to keep protectionism?
Why is it that the Commission and others were not, perhaps, able to get their voices heard sufficiently in the press?
Member of the Commission. - Where our voice was heard was where it matters - amongst policy-makers, ministers and decision-takers.
I cannot account for the press; the days when I could account for what was written in the press have long since passed behind me.
In the case of many of our negotiating partners amongst the ACP, they took the arguments very well indeed.
Having put in place interim agreements, in most cases now they are very keen not only to sign them fully, but to proceed to negotiate a full economic partnership agreement, to move on from goods to services, investment and other trade-related rules, because they know that is where the further bulk of the development value of these agreements lies.
Obviously, there has been a sort of cacophony put up about EPAs - in the main, though not entirely, by people who are suspicious of trade, are anti-globalisation (whatever that means), and who believe that ACP countries would be better off, in a sense, more isolated from the international economy, but, I would say, trapped in the past.
I do not think that has anything to recommend it, but it has the attractiveness of providing simplistic slogans which are easy to absorb and easy to write about, whereas the actual policy substance and content of what this is about is more complex.
But those who take the trouble to grasp it see the value and see the potential benefits. That is why many in the ACP are trying to grasp them.
(DE) Commissioner, I would be interested to know whether strategies are being conceived for partnership agreements with the developing countries in the field of renewable energies, because it is, of course, important for us that costs are reduced to a minimum wherever production takes place in an exemplary way, while the consumption of dangerous goods is also taxed accordingly.
Could you envisage incorporating this into such an agreement?
Member of the Commission. - There is a sustainability dimension to all the trade agreements that we are pursuing by negotiation and the economic partnership agreements are no exception.
However, we have to be guided by the interests of the ACP countries and their negotiators and by their perception of their interests.
So, whilst we will not be shy in putting such issues on the table, I cannot vouch for the reception they will receive from those with whom we are engaged in these negotiations.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 19.55 and resumed at 21.00)
The situation of women in rural areas of the EU (debate)
The next item is the report by Christa KlaÃ, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the situation of women in rural areas of the EU.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms KlaÃ, and the members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality for their own-initiative report.
We all know that keeping the issue of gender equality high on the agenda requires a continuous effort.
I have always considered the European Parliament as a leading institution in this respect, and I want to pay tribute to the work done to help celebrate International Women's Day 2008, including last week's conference.
I fully agree that women in the countryside should have real opportunities and should be encouraged to use all those opportunities.
Overall, I therefore agree that women in rural areas need particular political attention, and I am glad that this principle is implemented via the Community strategic guidelines for rural development under the third axis, where the encouragement of women's entry into the labour market is stressed as a key action.
The rural economy needs women, not only in order to keep up with economic growth in the rest of society, but also to ensure sustainable rural development, where families and companies see a real future in staying in the countryside.
Before answering some of the specific issues highlighted in this report, I would like to stress that the principle of promoting equality between men and women is central for the second pillar of the common agricultural policy.
In practice we apply it in two main ways.
The first is a creation of an economic opportunity for women through, for example, the promotion of women's entrepreneurship.
Importantly, in the context of the rural development programmes for the period 2007-2013, some Member States have designed specific measures for women; other Member States will give priority to applications from women under certain measures.
The second aspect of the improvement of the quality of life in the countryside: the objective should be a women-friendly countryside, facilitating women's lives in rural areas and allowing women to make better use of their potential.
For example, rural development supports the funding of day-care centres for children in the countryside so that women have the possibility to stay out there but still to take upon themselves the possibilities of a job.
I think these are examples of agricultural common policy actions that contribute to the improvement of the situation for women in rural areas.
I would also like to highlight the LEADER programme in this context, which contributes to improving the involvement of women in the decision-making process in the local action groups.
In fact, the number of projects managed by women is, for LEADER, higher than the projects that are managed by men: for the period 2003-2005, two out of three beneficiaries were women.
Concerning the specific requests included in the report, I agree that there is a necessity to monitor and to evaluate the integration of the gender perspective into the rural development programmes.
Indicators, which will show the results and impact of certain measures in the period - again - from 2007-2013, are broken down by gender, and they should give us the necessary information.
Finally, I would like to mention one point that is not really related to rural areas.
The Commission has initiated an impact assessment as part of the review of Directive 86/613/EEC, which deals with the principle of equal treatment between self-employed men and women, including those in agriculture.
An important point is the protection of self-employed women during pregnancy and motherhood.
A review of this Directive is set down in the legislative working programme of the Commission for this year, 2008, and this will give us another opportunity to support and improve the position of women in rural areas.
Once again, I thank the rapporteurs and all those who have contributed to a very important issue.
on behalf of the PPE-DE group. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal was said about the situation of women last week in relation to 8 March.
Alongside the platitudes, some spoke of the problems that lie behind the averages and become visible if one takes a structured approach.
Women do not live in identical circumstances; their natural aptitudes vary, and so do the opportunities they have and the problems they face.
Women living in rural areas are equally heterogeneous; they have some difficulties in common, but there are others that only occur in particular social strata or groups.
The report by Mrs KlaÃ differs from reports that are framed in more general terms in that it clearly and specifically addresses the difficulties facing rural women and policy deficits in this regard.
There is little point in setting out goals to be achieved in terms of female employment if the flexible background services that are necessary for this, for example transport facilities, are not in place.
The situation of women living in rural areas is generally more difficult; they tend much more often to undertake hidden, unpaid work with no insurance or protection, for example on family farms.
In practice this renders the legal position of these women unclear as regards maternity, sickness and old-age-related benefits.
These issues still await resolution, but meanwhile the exodus from rural to urban areas that can provide better living conditions is virtually unstoppable.
I agree with the rapporteur that greater account needs to be taken of the situation of rural women when distributing and deploying European financial resources. Failure to do so has far-reaching consequences.
Thank you.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, this report sets out the reality of the situation of women in rural areas of the EU, in order to respond to the significant challenges of the additional difficulties that women have in living in this environment.
We are talking about half the population in these areas, therefore mainstreaming gender into the rural sector is a priority, both for the promotion of equality between men and women and for enabling economic and social growth in the countryside.
While women encounter genuine difficulties in integrating into the labour market or reconciling work and family life, these difficulties are heightened when we are talking about a rural environment.
It is therefore necessary to promote initiatives and policies that tackle these challenges so that there might be effective equal opportunities.
Despite our differences, we can agree that women in rural areas need special, joint political attention, promoting rural development initiatives that encourage them to participate in economic and social life and curb the migration of women from the countryside to the city, which is an increasingly concerning reality.
We are indebted to the women of our villages, who have contributed incalculably and almost invisibly to the development of the countryside.
Recognising them should go hand in hand with policies driven by the Member States and regional and local authorities that foster improvements in living conditions and remove the barriers that currently exist.
Therefore, expansion of public services, improving training, access to new technologies and support for innovative business projects are fundamental for achieving these objectives.
We also call on the Member States to develop the legal construct of shared ownership, in order to ensure that women's rights in the agricultural sector are fully recognised.
This is the only way that we will be able to ensure that equal opportunities become a reality for European women in the countryside.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on raising such an important issue as improving the situation of women in rural areas of the EU.
Recently we were discussing the matter of Europe's demographic future.
We enumerated many reasons for its bleak appearance.
This problem is even more acute in rural areas.
We need to do all we can to provide country dwellers, and especially women, with the right conditions for life and economic and personal development.
Social exclusion and poverty probably relate to women from rural areas in particular; I say probably, because there is a need for better statistics on this.
The key to improving the situation in this regard may be for the spouses of those who are self-employed, including rural women, to have a right to their own independent social and pension rights.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, mainstreaming gender in the rural sector is necessary not only to promote equality between women and men, but also to help economic growth to be based on sustainable rural development.
Our Group therefore strongly supports the KlaÃ report, essentially because of three elements.
Three of the aspects that it highlights are the most important in our view: 1) it asks for statistics on the rural world to also be disaggregated by gender so that women in rural areas cease to be an invisible group and that the work that they do is explicitly valued; 2) for the relevant local, regional and State authorities to encourage the participation of women in local action groups and the development of local partnerships under the Leader axis; and 3) the request to focus in particular on improving transport infrastructure in rural areas, and establishing positive measures to promote access to transport in order to curb social exclusion, which particularly affects women.
However, I would also like to propose and support the amendment tabled by my colleague Iratxe GarcÃ­a, asking for the text to include an explicit reference to the need for Member States to develop the legal construct of shared ownership, in order to ensure that women's rights in the agricultural sector are fully recognised, with the corresponding protection in the field of social security and recognition of their work.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) The situation of women in rural areas is very much affected by the situation of agriculture, suffering the consequences of the common agricultural policy's unjust measures, which have caused increasing numbers of small- and medium-sized farmers and family farmers to abandon production.
In many cases this leads the men and young people to emigrate, leaving the women with the children and the elderly, condemning them to poverty; that situation is made worse in the rural areas of some countries such as Portugal with the closure of schools, health and maternity centres, post offices and other public services.
That is why this policy needs to be abandoned.
We are therefore also tabling some amendments in order to stress that the common agricultural policy needs to be reviewed, taking account of this problem and strengthening aid to maintain family farms and develop the rural world, whilst attaching maximum value to the work of women, including migrant women, who also work in agriculture.
We therefore hope that our proposals will be accepted.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, since I have been given the opportunity to speak in the debate on the situation of women in rural areas of the EU, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the situation of women in villages and suburban areas in the new Member States in particular is difficult and sometimes dramatic, partly because of the introduction of EU policies that impose various kinds of limits and restrictions, causing poverty and social exclusion through job losses and unprofitable production.
In typically agricultural regions, and not only those in eastern Poland, thousands of families are threatened with the loss of their means of subsistence because their farm is unprofitable, the sugar factory has gone bankrupt or closed down, limits have been placed on fish catches, only certain types of soft fruit are subsidised and there are penalties for the overproduction of milk.
These are the reasons behind the lack of development of infrastructure and communications as well as the provision of education, health care and various other services that will not come into being while there is a lack of economic development.
This kind of development-disrupting policy is also prompting young people, including women, to leave for the city and to emigrate abroad.
The LEADER programmes are capable of helping women from only a few regions (those that are attractive to tourists or known for their unique regional products) and will go nowhere towards compensating for the losses suffered by the rural populace who are still waiting for the lofty phrases, the sustainable development, equal opportunities and complete non-discrimination that are to be found in the documents to be realised in practice.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, nothing that we are hearing today and are tabling in terms of demands is new.
We repeat that it is nothing new, whether in the reports on 'Women and industry', 'Women and health' or 'Women in rural areas'.
We have not yet achieved equal pay for equal work, nor do we have more women in positions of leadership and more flexible child care.
All these problems are multiplied in rural areas.
The distance from home to work and poor transport links are a major problem here.
The shortage of local continuing and vocational training is also a problem.
As already mentioned, broadband access is a must today, but it is scarce in rural areas.
This means we need measures but primarily we need to raise awareness of what it is like for women in rural areas.
This also means, however, that we have to take greater account of the gender aspect in all EU support programmes - whether for the development of rural areas, the Social Fund and the like - and make the programmes contingent upon how they continue to be used.
Austria, incidentally, leads the way in this and will have a law in place as from 2009 - gender budgeting - in which all gender aspects are included.
I think this would be worth emulating.
(PL) Mr President, much has been said and there have been many discussions in recent years about the role of women, their rights, their position in society and their occupational situation.
Today we are debating the situation in which rural women find themselves, and it is right that we should do so, for it is rural women, especially those in regions of retarded development, who work hardest and benefit least from the rights they are due.
A woman in the city will have a flat with all mod cons, easy access to equipment, education and culture, a right to maternity and parental leave, and the opportunity to work and enjoy the benefits of civilisation.
A woman in the country will often have a home with no plumbing and numerous duties in the family and on the farm.
She cannot count on placing her child in a crÃšche or kindergarten and her contact with culture and the world will often amount to limited radio and television broadcasts.
A woman from a small village out in the sticks, living on a family farm, is virtually deprived of any opportunity for occupational, social, political or cultural advancement.
Please note that funds for culture are mainly directed towards centres located in cities.
In the cities we have just about everything.
In the country there are only amateur activities, and those activities are often organised in private houses and at the expense of the people involved.
Much is said in the European Union about lifelong learning, and this should indeed be the case.
Let us have some thought, though, for women in such programmes.
In my opinion it is high time for a sensible programme for women that is financed from the EU's budget.
(SV) Mr President, vigorous and sustainable development demands that the situation of women be taken into account.
The participation of women is necessary for positive development.
Women who live and work in the countryside, like women in other environments, live in an unequal society.
Hence work to achieve equality is just as important for all women, in all the different environments and situations of life.
In this report I would especially draw colleagues' attention to the importance of supporting the GUE/NGL amendments tabled by Ilda Figueiredo, in particular Amendment 9, from which it is clear that the equality problem must also be taken fully into account in a much needed review of the common agricultural policy.
Without the active participation of women we shall not succeed in achieving the aims of sustainable economic growth.
That applies, as I have said, in all environments of life.
We need equality for the survival of the countryside, we need it for women and we need it for the future.
(BG) Mr. Chairman, Mme Commissioner, Colleagues, First of all I would like to congratulate Ms KlaÃ for her excellent report.
Being a member of the Committee for Regional Development from Bulgaria, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that rural areas have different development potential.
However, there is something that will certainly contribute to better quality of life in the rural areas, and especially the situation of women there. This is the provision of transport and social infrastructure, accessible social services in the villages, such as raising of children, care for aged and sick persons, communication services, and establishment of cultural and sports centres.
In this respect, the adequate support for the rural areas through financing from the EU funds is of paramount importance.
Therefore I would like to recommend better alignment of the urban and rural issues.
The development of rural areas should be coordinated with the activities performed within the framework of the regional policy.
I believe that an integrated approach to the convergence and development of rural areas, taking into account the role of small and medium-sized towns in them, rather than a separate approach like the one we have had so far, would increase the efficiency of the EU assistance and contribute to the improvement of living conditions, especially those of women.
(PL) Mr President, the situation of women in rural areas compares distinctly unfavourably with that of women in the cities.
Access to health care and education is not the end of it.
If I may, I would like to draw your attention to points 4 and 10 in the report, which stress the need to even out social and economic rights for women who are self-employed or who work on family farms.
This means in particular the right to paid maternity leave and to an earnings-based pension.
In some countries there are actually legal prohibitions on formal employment and social insurance for partners working on family farms and in family businesses.
The effects of these regulations chiefly impinge on women, and they should be changed as soon as possible.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
(ES) Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs KlaÃ on her report; not only is it useful, but also Mrs KlaÃ has worked very hard, so I would like to thank her very much.
I would like to point out that not all women in rural areas live in the same way.
The rural world is not homogenous.
On the contrary, frequently their worlds are very different.
However, above all, we need to attract women to the rural world and prevent the exodus that is occurring increasingly, because the position of women in our society progresses slowly, but at least it is progressing in the urban world.
Nevertheless, in the rural world, not only do they carry the work inside and outside the home, but at the same time they also care for dependents and, on top of this, these women do this under much worse conditions than in the urban world.
Therefore, attracting women to the rural world should be done not only by improving their personal welfare, but also the economy of rural areas, an economy that is above all agricultural, as you well know, Commissioner.
However, in order for this economy to be strong, the common agricultural policy needs to be supported and strengthened, while at the same time, of course, it has to be taken into account that the technical and social situation needs to change, and soon.
(RO) I am glad to be given the floor concerning a reality that is much ignored, namely the position of women in rural areas.
Although the system of legislation and norms valid at Union level, as well as at the level of each and every Member State, precludes any kind of discrimination, it is obvious that there is a significant discrepancy between the life of women in urban areas and women in rural areas.
Romania, like other new Member States of the European Union, is in a much worse situation than the general one described in the report.
Given the background of deindustrialisation in the 1990s, there was a phenomenon that the West European countries have not encountered: migration from town to village as a solution for economic survival.
In our region, poverty in rural areas has affected and still affects women above all, and they have become the most vulnerable victims of trafficking in human beings.
Unfortunately, industrial agriculture, which could have attracted part of the female work force in the villages, itself underwent destructuring.
Public health, education, transport, water and sewerage services underwent an accelerated worsening, such services being practically absent in many villages in the less developed countries of the European Union.
Women in rural areas, especially young or middle-aged ones, could develop independent economic activities if they had access to bank loans and I believe we should discuss the opportunity of establishing a bank that would grant micro-loans in rural areas.
(PL) Mr President, in rural areas women are a social group that is particularly prone to discrimination.
Because of the traditional division of roles and the weak infrastructure in many areas, such as child care, for example, many women never feature in the official labour market, but at the same time they are not registered as unemployed.
Women carry out work that is comparable to an occupational activity but is not recognised as such and is neither protected nor paid.
Member States, together with the European Commission, should find a solution as quickly as possible to the problem of the substantial group of women assisting with farming and in small and medium-sized enterprises who, in many Member States, suffer from a lack of legal status.
This leads to financial and legal problems for these women in relation to the right to maternity and sick leave, the acquisition of pension rights and access to social security.
For the sake of harmonious development, Member States should ensure the creation of high-quality jobs in rural areas through such measures as promoting enterprise among women, increasing their qualifications and providing easy access in all rural areas to standard 21st century infrastructure and services.
Finally, I would like to congratulate Mrs KlaÃ on a very well-compiled report.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur.
It would be better if we were talking about the situation of people in rural areas rather than women, and indeed many of the problems for women also affect men in rural areas, but women have particular issues and I acknowledge that in this report.
That said, the quality of life for people who live in the countryside can be better in many cases, where they have sufficient resources, than in the city.
I think the problem has always been that women's work has not been measured, has not been paid for and therefore is not recognised.
In some countries, some progress has been made on this, but I think Member States differ in how they treat women.
I would like to mention a particular role that women play, and perhaps it has not been addressed yet.
Women are still, in my view, the primary motivators and educators of children and they are generally the ones who decide whether a child will farm or not, and often decide the future of rural areas.
We need to pay particular attention to that so that they have a positive view of agriculture, and not a negative one.
Lastly, few women own land and few are in farm organisations.
That needs to be addressed.
(RO) In 2006, in the European Union, the ratio between the income earned by that 20% of the population with the highest wages and the income earned by that 20% of the population with the lowest wages was 4.8.
Unfortunately, in Portugal, Lithuania and Latvia, this ratio exceeded 6.
It is obvious that the population in rural areas has lower wages than in urban areas, and this situation is even more obvious in the case of women.
In order to improve the situation of women in rural areas, we need to efficiently use the structural funds.
The development of transport infrastructure, education, health services, communication infrastructure and information technology and of the service sector in rural areas will result in the economic development thereof and, implicitly, in the improvement of women's status in rural areas.
I close my statement by saying that rural areas can transform, by means of investments, the available lands into industrial parks to offer jobs.
An effective transport infrastructure could result in the distance being measured in time and not in kilometres, so that the people that work in urban areas could live in rural areas thus contributing to their economic development.
- (LT) Today's discussion is extremely important, as it covers the subject of the situation of women in rural areas, which continues to be rather worrying.
One of the key issues remains that of low employment levels among females in rural areas, especially in the new accession countries, resulting in women from rural areas finding themselves in social isolation more often than city females.
First of all, in order to increase employment levels among women from rural areas, they should be encouraged to start their own businesses.
To achieve this, governments must supply relevant information on how to start a business, as well as improve women's ability to use modern information technologies, thus building their self-confidence.
Moreover, statistics show that women in rural areas have much lower education and professional skills levels compared with city women.
This often means that they find it more difficult to adapt to the challenges presented by the market, to find new methods and forms of agricultural work and alternative agricultural activities.
I would like to urge the Member States to present a framework of action to encourage women in rural areas to seek knowledge and education.
The LEADER project should deliver more efficient aid in order to overcome the problem.
Thank you.
Mr President, in acknowledging the hard work that our rapporteur, Ms KlaÃ, has put into this report entitled 'The situation of women in rural areas of the EU', I would have to ask: compared to men in rural areas or women in urban areas?
What is the context in which we are talking here?
There is no such homogeneous group as 'women in rural areas of the EU'.
I am a woman from a rural area of the EU, but the lady who lives down the road from me with six or seven children and a husband who is unemployed, and who cannot afford her rent or mortgage, is a different type of woman in a rural area.
It is not a homogeneous group, and we must be very careful in this issue.
Many women in rural areas have an urban lifestyle; others have a lot of poverty and hardship in their life.
You have an urban lifestyle in the middle of the countryside if there are two cars outside the door, all mod cons, ICT and perhaps a foreign holiday a year.
So let us give it some context.
The real issue here is the restoration of choices to all women: the choice to marry or not; the choice to have children or not, to have a career, to have further education or not, to stay at home, to go out into the workplace, to start a business or to have access to property.
A few years ago when I went to buy an apartment in Brussels, the Brussels bank manager would not sign off my mortgage unless I got my husband to sign it.
This was only a few years ago in Brussels.
I got my mortgage and my husband did not sign it.
Might I say that I objected strongly!
So the access to money, property and business - there are lots of different types of women in rural areas.
Mrs Doyle, I can assure you I would never have turned you down for this mortgage.
(RO) The success of the Lisbon Strategy involves sustained economic growth both in the urban areas and in the rural areas of the European Union and women play a crucial part in the development of these areas.
I praise the drafting of this report which, apart from analysing the condition of women in rural areas, also proposes concrete recommendations in order to improve their condition in the context of globalisation and achievement of the Lisbon goals.
From the multitude of incentives and conditions to be observed for this purpose, I would like to underline the importance of a major factor, namely education.
The statistical data that are available to us show that a small number of women in rural areas have access to higher education due to financial difficulties, but also due to the precarious quality of educational activities in such areas.
The women in rural areas should benefit from enhanced access to education and lifelong learning, as well as to opportunities to reconcile family life with professional life.
It is a key element that should be consolidated along with the active role of women in politics and the socio-economic development of rural areas.
(SK) Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to congratulate Mrs KlaÃ on her excellent report.
I come from a new Member State with a relatively strong rural population.
Over the last 45 years it has remained stable, with only a small fall-off of 14%.
Due to economic policies, rural regions are more prone to changes today.
There is a well-known process in operation involving firms relocating from rural to urban areas.
Public policies, however, should be such that this so-called modernisation does not take place at the expense of women in rural areas.
I would like to invite the Committee of the Regions to study this area and begin a broad consultation in the rural regions to learn more about life there with all its advantages and disadvantages.
I would also like to invite the Commission and the Council to direct their programmes, especially those involving micro-loans, towards women in rural areas, too.
(RO) Dear colleagues, as we are discussing a matter related not only to the issue of equal opportunities, but also to the development of rural areas in general, I will refer to the measures that are applicable at Community level in this field.
The programmes and the funds of the 2nd pillar of rural development have, in terms of percentages, more significant resources than the special programmes of the European Union for equal opportunities.
If we succeeded in facilitating the access of women to programmes such as LEADER, dedicated to rural development, we would have much more to gain than if we used only the resources within the EQUAL, PROGRESS or DAPHNE programmes.
In the European Union budget, the funds for rural development are as high as 11%, whilst the entire sector of citizenship, which includes the programmes for equal opportunities, does not even reach 1%.
This is the great challenge for the European Union in this case: succeeding in communicating, mobilising and facilitating the link between European funds and the various projects which could be initiated in rural areas by women.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I thank the House for a very encouraging debate with some fairly dedicated speeches - I really enjoy that.
The discussion we have had tonight makes it clear again that the situation for women in rural areas really needs specific attention.
Although I feel that some of you are a little pessimistic about the progress that has been made, I want to approach this from a more positive side.
I think that quite a lot has been achieved, especially through the rural development tools, and I am confident that we are heading in the right direction when it comes to improving the position of women in rural areas.
Many of you have mentioned that mainstreaming the gender issue into our policy and broadening its scope to the wider rural economy will enhance its effect.
I fully subscribe to this approach.
We should not limit our focus to the farm sector only.
Embedding our policies in the needs and opportunities of rural society as a whole will create a multiplier effect that will also benefit the whole agricultural sector.
The Commission will closely monitor this aspect with the implementation of the rural development programmes.
Several of you mentioned the importance of broadband networks in rural areas.
Here I have to say that there is a possibility within the third axis - the diversification axis - of the rural development policy to go into areas that, from an economic point of view, are not economically viable for investors.
Those are remote areas where Member States can use the rural development policy to secure a broadband connection.
I can only encourage all Member States to take this into consideration when they plan their investments or the use of their rural development policy.
Some of you also mentioned the 'hidden work' that is being done by women on farms.
I acknowledge that our statistics do not always reflect this fact.
We should, using all the different tools, try to encourage women to seize the opportunities to gain their economic independence by giving them the associated social rights.
For me, better possibilities for taking up part-time work for women in agriculture would be a huge step forward in strengthening rural incomes and also to help sustaining life in rural communities.
I must say that I travel quite a lot in rural areas and I am always very encouraged when I meet women who cross the borderlines and take part in the work of the different farmers' organisations.
I know it is a big step for the first women to enter into these organisations but sometimes it spreads and it is not so difficult for the next one, although it requires some change of approach on the men's side to accept that women can contribute on an equal footing in this area.
I think there is quite a lot more to be said on this subject, which should not be pushed into the background.
Let me assure you that I will wholeheartedly back all initiatives that can improve the position of women in rural areas, because I really think that we need this special approach from the female side to the diversification of rural areas.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contributions to the discussion.
We had a really good discussion here in this round.
Commissioner, thank you, too, for your statement that the review of Directive 86/613/EEC on the principle of equal treatment is still taking place this year, in 2008.
We have sent a reminder on this and we think it is time to review it.
We are unable this evening to adopt any European regulation for improving the situation of women in rural areas.
Mrs Doyle, I know that the situation of women is not the same everywhere.
It would also be dull and we do not want that at all.
However, women in rural regions do, of course, have the same conditions and they have to struggle with the same disadvantages as women living in towns and cities.
We have pointed this out here.
We are initiating the discussion process and we are asking the Commission and the Member States to ultimately bring about changes as well.
The report should raise awareness of this.
There are good examples in Europe and according to the principle of best practice we also want to highlight these examples for emulation.
We can also introduce a lot that is good here.
We want to broaden the view.
Women in rural areas are not only farmers; women in rural areas are also on their way to becoming employed, and they have to combine family and work.
In the end, being personally affected is the best testimony.
We need the contribution of women in our organisations.
Mrs McGuinness has just been speaking about contented mothers who are also able to bestow contentment on their children.
We shall also have contented women when we do something towards their equal treatment, towards their fair participation.
Our concern here is that young people will also then stay in the villages again.
It would be exciting, Commissioner, to have a list of all the many opportunities that ultimately present themselves for women in the European Union.
We are constantly asserting that these are concealed in many cases under the cover of other programmes.
Perhaps we could manage to say just once that women are involved in one programme or another, in this way or that.
This constantly creates problems, even when it should be sorted out locally.
Perhaps we should schedule this as a start in order to be able eventually to say to those responsible in the regions: we can achieve improvements for women here.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 12 March 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) In terms of employment, a comparison of urban and rural areas reveals that a widening abyss is developing.
Women living in rural areas are particularly disadvantaged.
Their chances of social integration, of obtaining employment, and of access to child-related, educational, health and social institutions, are less.
They constitute one of the most vulnerable groups in society, as they are much more exposed to the risk of poverty and marginalisation.
Where they do manage to obtain employment, their wages lag considerably behind those of their urban counterparts.
Cumulative social disadvantage engenders social tensions, as the social welfare system is at its most inadequate in the most disadvantaged communities, while the worst infrastructural deficiencies are also to be found here.
In the absence of other options, agriculture, with its short-term advantages and lower standard of living, has the effect of conserving the tension-rife rural employment situation.
The solution lies in concerted action; local authorities, governments and the European Community all have a role and a responsibility in this regard.
Multi-faceted adjustment programmes need to be put in place.
Opportunities for adjustment must be provided for the rural population by creating alternative employment opportunities, developing infrastructure, initiating training and further education programmes facilitating adaptation to market conditions, supporting business start-ups, and establishing projects in border areas and across national borders.
Adjustment programmes will inevitably have to be tailored to the particular characteristics of individual rural areas.
This will ensure the ongoing reduction of regional differences.
in writing. - (HU) I would like to congratulate my colleague Christa KlaÃ on her report, which highlights the difficulties that women living in rural areas have to face in the labour market and in other aspects of their lives.
Any discussion of the most disadvantaged people living in the worst circumstances must make special mention of Roma women, a significant proportion of whom live in villages and small settlements.
Numerous studies have shown that Roma women constitute the European Union's most vulnerable group, with a life expectancy that is shockingly low compared to the majority of society and an unemployment rate that is several times the average.
In line with the report's recommendations, therefore, Member States need to draft and implement the kind of policies that will improve the general living conditions of women living in less developed regions and help disadvantaged women and women facing social exclusion to obtain work or engage in self-employment by fostering new businesses.
Roma women in particular could benefit from support from Member States and the European Commission for socially aware business models that involve the poor and disadvantaged groups in society.
I welcome the fact that the report places great emphasis on gathering reliable statistical data, because the gathering and processing of data disaggregated according to gender and ethnic origin are vital, on the one hand, for eliminating indirect and multiple discrimination and, on the other hand, for measuring progress achieved in terms of education, housing, health and employment.
Thank you.
in writing. - (SK) The enterprising report by the rapporteur, Mrs KlaÃ, seeks a new approach to eliminating the obvious inequalities between urban and rural areas.
Women play a crucial role in the socio-political, economic and environmental development of rural areas.
Women's lives in rural areas present a great deal of opportunities as well as considerable difficulties.
Making rural areas more attractive will help to curb the exodus of mainly young and well-trained people.
I am thus calling for the promotion of sustainable integrated growth and the generation of new employment opportunities, particularly for women, as well as the provision of high-quality health care, social services and other general services throughout the EU.
Only educated women will be able to be fully involved in revitalising local communities.
They will be able to set up new companies, which in turn will contribute to the diversification of the rural economy and improvements in the quality of life in rural areas.
We must remove all obstacles to accessing information and communication technologies and ensure that broadband is available to women in rural areas.
Continuous education and language learning as well as opportunities for re-training must be available to all interested women.
Moreover, the successful LEADER programme should continue.
It has successfully allowed many women to set up companies in rural communities in areas such as tourism, crafts and the provision of regional products.
I believe that by identifying best practices and using the new tools for exchanges of experience, a significant contribution can be made to improving the quality of life in rural areas.
in writing. - (RO) The EU is confronted by important social changes which have been brought about by problems related to migration, social security and poverty.
The programmes developed at EU level have made an important contribution to the improvement of the condition of women in rural areas.
Nevertheless, women are not involved in decision making in the communities to which they belong.
A concrete and worrying example, is that most women in the rural areas in Romania have an income below 5 EURO/day, and a third do not use any media.
I would cite as as a priority three action fields in order to obtain equal opportunities and to improve the condition of the women in the rural area:
improvement of social status by supporting the access of women to new income and goods acquisition opportunities;
full involvement of women in the decision-making process and enhanced capacity to change/influence the decisions that affect them directly;
access of the women in rural areas to essential services (health, education) and infrastructure.
The Member States should prepare public policies to encourage the participation of women in the labour market, in the decision-making process, and should control any forms of discrimination.
Sustainable agriculture and biogas: review of EU legislation (debate)
The next item is the report by Csaba SÃ¡ndor Tabajdi, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on sustainable agriculture and biogas: a need for review of EU legislation.
rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, in a world of climate change, increasing energy demand and rising prices, it is an absolute priority and a matter of vital interest to the European Union to reduce energy dependence and energy consumption and to diversify energy sources.
The increasing use of renewable energies is an integral part of this.
We must diversify, and this includes diversification within the area of renewable energies.
In the field of renewable energy sources, different countries have different natural endowments, and we must exploit these to the maximum.
Biogas holds enormous potential as a renewable energy source and is destined for a great future for a whole number of reasons that are set out in the report tabled for debate today.
The first and most important of these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, is that the primary raw material for producing biogas is animal manure, and the fact that we can combine energy production with the treatment of manure for environmental protection purposes.
This is one of the most significant advantages of biogas production, although biogas may of course be produced from other materials such as municipal sludge, slaughterhouse waste and energy crops.
Biogas is a multifunctional energy source: it can be used for electricity generation, for heating, cooling, or drying.
Pressurised biogas is suitable for running cars and public transport vehicles and, once it has been purified, biogas can be fed into the natural gas network.
Biogas production thus represents a serious opportunity for European energy production.
Among other things, if we consider that biogas can be produced from animal manure, we could produce 14 times more than we do at present.
The potential this represents is considerable, since we know from an environmental point of view that animal manure has to be treated before it can be used on the soil; otherwise it can seriously harm the environment.
There was some discussion in our committee on the question of whether biogas production using plant-based material would compete with food production.
The European Commission has shown that such a situation has not yet arisen in Europe, and we hope that it will not arise in future either, since we now have the second generation of energy crops.
It may be that this is a problem in the global context, in Brazil and the United States, but in Europe it is not an issue at present, and we hope that it will not become one.
The other issue discussed in this context was how the biogas sector should be regulated.
Current regulation both at national and European Union level is exceptionally complicated and bureaucratic, and this is why in my report I have suggested adopting an EU biogas directive.
At the same time, however, European Commission representatives have convinced me in the course of consultations with the European People's Party that there is no need for a separate biogas directive, as a directive on renewable energy sources is in preparation and the issue of biogas could be addressed in this context.
In this regard I ask the Commission to devote special attention to biogas in the directive on renewable energy sources and to adopt the suggestions set out in my report.
Ladies and gentlemen, in my response later I would like to thank the Danish institute that helped with this report and everyone who contributed to it.
Thank you for your attention.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, before going into the context I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur, Mr Tabajdi, for this very interesting and important report.
Parliament's report clearly underlines the benefits of biogas production to the agricultural sector, but also to society.
I fully agree with the emphasis placed on the development of biogas production.
It has environmental benefits by reducing the emission of powerful climate-altering gases, such as methane and nitrous oxides.
For this reason, biogas production further enhances the environmental sustainability of agriculture - there has already been a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emission since 1990 - and it also has obvious economic advantages as a useful alternative to natural gas in a situation where we now see that oil prices have exceeded USD 100 per barrel.
The production of biogas from agricultural feedstocks has more than doubled in the period from 2004 to 2006.
Overall biogas production is increasing but I think that we can clearly do more.
There is a large untapped potential in biogas production within the European Union.
On the Commission side we are fully aware of this and we have put in place a number of important instruments to promote the production of biogas.
Our current Green Electricity Directive with implementing legislation in some Member States is an example of an important driving force.
Rural development policy also favours the development of biogas production.
Member States have the possibility to support investments, technical assistance and cooperatives and other activities enhancing biogas production and biogas use.
Implementation of the rural development programmes from the period 2007 to 2013 has only just started but I find that Member States' first programming is very promising and I am confident that biogas-related measures will be among those with the highest uptake in the area when we talk about bio-energy.
Measures included in the Commission's recent energy and climate package will give a further boost to biogas production in the coming years.
Particularly important is the 20% target for renewable energy.
It is expected that biogas will contribute significantly to reaching those targets.
Biogas will also play an important role in delivering the 20% reduction targets for greenhouse gas emission from sectors that are not participating in the emission trading system.
Therefore we are in a very positive situation where we can kill two birds with one stone.
I am convinced that biogas production will be a key element in the European Union strategy to combat climate change and to make it possible for us to meet the Kyoto targets.
I agree with you that a coherent biogas policy is important.
The EU initiatives are in my view coherent and they go in the same direction.
Nevertheless, I believe that this policy could be most effectively fleshed out and implemented at regional or at national level on the basis of local resources, needs and economic realities.
In this respect, I welcome the recommendations concerning the simplification of the current legislative framework.
They are in line with our ongoing discussions on simplification and better regulation, which represent a Commission strategy very high on the agenda.
Finally I have to say that I have doubts on specific targets for biogas, and I heard a remark by the rapporteur.
I think that the 20% target for renewable energy already encompasses biogas.
Biogas can also contribute to the achievement of the 10% biofuel target.
If we introduce a special biogas target we would run the risk of not being focused enough.
Setting a specific target for biogas would introduce further administrative burdens for private operators and public authorities.
In my view it would also lead to excessive political pressure for a particular type of renewable energy, which could be unfortunate if economic circumstances are later not too favourable for biogas production.
The report on biogas that you request from the Commission is certainly useful.
However, it seems to me that the deadline of 2008 that you are setting is a bit too early when we look at all the other initiatives that are taking place.
However, the Commission will report on the implementation of the EU Biomass Action Plan by the end of 2008, so I am quite sure that we will find common ground on this issue.
It is a very important and also very interesting report.
I am quite sure this will provide a very good basis for further discussions.
draftsman of an opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (SV) Madam President, biogas can play an important role in combating climate change, not just biogas to produce heat and electricity but also to drive vehicles.
Biogas can be produced, for example, from manure and household waste.
There is currently great potential for a substantial increase in the production of biogas.
In the Committee on the Environment we want to respond positively to this possibility and in the future see much more biogas.
Increased biogas production must not be an end in itself, however.
When it comes to waste, the main priority must still be to reduce the total quantity of waste.
If we are to reduce waste, we must - saying this is like swearing in church - reduce our consumption.
I should like to take the opportunity to put a couple of questions to Commissioner Fischer Boel, who is with us this evening: does the Commission have a strategy for reducing the ever growing waste mountain in the EU?
Perhaps the Commission also has a strategy to help us reduce the consumption of so many goods that we do not really need?
In the Environment Committee we also want to see certification for sustainable biogas.
Such a certification system must cover the entire chain, i.e. from field to vehicle.
The certification system must be founded on social and environmental considerations.
I welcome the Commission's proposal for a new directive on renewable fuels, but more needs to be done to enhance the role of biogas.
One more question for Mrs Fischer Boel: what is your view of such a certification system?
This and other environment-related questions underscore the importance of public responsibility.
Most of us here agree that we should boost the role of biogas.
More cars and lorries should be able to run on biogas.
Biogas reduces emissions of greenhouse gases from cars by as much as 90%.
In addition, particulate emissions are also reduced and cars run more quietly on gas.
However, if we are really serious about our environmental commitments, the responsibility cannot be left to the market.
For example, to enable more cars to run on biogas, there must be filling stations where they can fill up with gas.
The State must ensure that filling stations face up to their responsibility through legislation and temporary funding.
In my homeland, Sweden, the last filling station on a drive to the north is in Uppsala, which is in the middle of the country. In other words, motorists who like to keep their tanks topped up have to drive for more than 1000 km without any chance of filling up with biogas.
That is of course unacceptable.
Hence we all have a responsibility for promoting biogas: the EU by drawing up guidelines, the Member States by stimulating national production, and not least the local authorities, which should build more biogas installations.
draftsman of the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (DE) Madam President, I am reporting the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which bears responsibility for energy policy.
I have no personal opinion on this, but the committee has accepted my draft opinion by 45 votes to 0, with 0 abstentions.
The Committee on Industry is aware of the positive contribution of biogas not just from manure - as the rapporteur thinks - but from all organic waste.
We have pointed out that competition in foodstuffs is becoming increasingly problematic, that there must be discussion on the fact that the feeding of biogas into the gas network must be free of discrimination and that new processes for second-generation technical biogas should be proposed.
We have discussed the role of green gene technology in connection with biogas and we are of the opinion that the young, innovative biogas sector admittedly needs start-up financing, but not a permanent subsidy.
In addition, we want uniform support instruments across the EU and this is expressly stated in our 13 points: we want a simplified planning permission procedure for biogas installations.
The Committee on Industry has not demanded that four new directives should be put forward, as my fellow Member has done in his draft report.
I share the Commissioner's opinion that we do not need any new directives, but that we should give biogas a fair role in the existing directives on renewable energies.
In this respect the Committee on Industry has formed a somewhat different opinion from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is responsible for the report.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am able largely to endorse this report.
The rapporteur has produced some good work.
I am able to agree with what has already been said: biogas can make a substantial contribution towards achieving our goals for renewable energy sources, using fewer fossil energies and thereby also reducing CO2 emissions.
The prerequisite, of course, is that biogas potentials are used.
In Germany there are many biogas plants, in which only electricity is produced.
Only about 38% of the available energy is being used here; over 60% of energy is unused as lost heat and pumped into the environment.
This cannot be the purpose of biogas production!
I therefore believe it is right for this report to demand that biogas also be fed into the gas network.
We must follow both these directions: either use the heat lost when producing electricity or feed biogas directly into the network.
We can then achieve a high degree of efficiency with both these processes.
I am also of the opinion that even better plants can be cultivated with modern plant production.
I am definitely not of the opinion, however, that genetic engineering is required to do this.
Plant growers tell me that yields for biogas plants can be doubled on good acreage with traditional plant cultivation.
We are able to harvest the equivalent of approximately 5 000 litres of fuel oil per hectare for biogas.
With good plants, which in future will be created by plant cultivation, we shall be able to harvest up to 10 000 litres per hectare.
This is a good way for biogas to contribute towards countering climate change.
Madam President, I was very interested to read the proposals prepared by my colleague Mr Tabajdi.
I would like to congratulate him on a fine report.
In the current world situation, where the price of oil and other energy sources - gas, for example - is rising steeply but is subject to unpredictable swings that make it difficult to plan sensibly and estimate investment costs and when the energy demands of European countries are also rising, a report on the subject of biogas would appear to be an unusually timely document.
This report in fact shows us how much we can still do to develop this sphere of energy generation.
Energy generation from these sources can be increased many times without any accompanying degradation of the natural environment.
A positive offshoot to this development would be to support beneficiaries with funds intended for regional development and the development of rural areas.
The Commission and the governments of individual countries also need to lavish particular care on generators of this type of energy and support this development through the mechanisms of specific financial incentives.
I am therefore entirely at one with the rapporteur's view that the European Commission should intensify its efforts to develop energy from sources of this type and incorporate it into Europe's energy strategy.
It is of particular importance for us Europeans that the European Union should make itself independent of exports in the energy sphere in the shortest possible time by increasing diversification.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Tabajdi on his balanced report.
I think he has succeeded in pointing out the significance of biogas for a sustainable energy future mix.
As an MEP representing Northern Germany, I am aware of the potential of biogas as an important and versatile form of biomass energy produced by agriculture.
Germany - and particularly Lower Saxony, where I come from - is a leader as far as biogas plants are concerned.
We should not miss the opportunity to develop strict, clear criteria for biogas technology when introducing an EU certification system for biomass fuels.
This should apply specifically to imports as well.
There should be no extra administrative burdens for our producers, however.
Only in this way can concerns about the use of cereals and foodstuffs for biogas production be effectively dispelled, because food production must continue to remain agriculture's overriding responsibility.
Only in this way can and will biogas technology make a meaningful contribution to a secure energy supply, to reducing our dependence on foreign imports, to climate protection and to rural development.
European research and development programmes will also then be able to generate greater efficiency.
Madam President, implementation of the ideas listed in my fellow Member Mr Tabajdi's report would certainly enable us to take a giant step forward in increasing biogas production.
At the same time it would be a step towards the realisation of sustainable agriculture through significantly reducing the amount of vegetable and animal waste, manure and sewage sludge and the acquisition of renewable energy.
There are, however, drawbacks to biogas production.
At current production and sale prices it would not cover costs, and there would still be waste at the end of the day, only more concentrated.
We need to assess the pros and cons in the cold light of day.
My political group has done this, and we believe that even with the technologies currently available we should support Mr Tabajdi's report.
Perhaps other technologies will enable the production process to be upgraded, while rising energy prices will increase its economic effectiveness.
There is, however, no doubting the achievements in environmental protection and this is the most important thing.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the rapporteur has submitted a good report and he has submitted it for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is good.
We have just heard from Mr Langen that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is apparently competing with us here.
This is always how it is: whenever something becomes successful, the Committee on Industry tries to walk off with it.
That is not necessarily a good thing.
I recall that the pioneers of biogas production were farmers, who were laughed at 10, 15, 20 years ago when they wanted to produce energy from manure.
The idea here, to put it in graphic terms for once, is to turn shit into gold.
This actually entails producing energy from manure - and not entering into competition with human food.
What is left over from the manure will be an even better fertiliser that is more versatile than aggressive fertilisers.
This means that biogas is counted among the renewable energies alongside wind, water, sun and wood and is in fact a renewable energy if we confine ourselves to producing it from organic waste.
In a situation like the one that arose last year and the year before in the milk sector, where 23.5 cents was being paid for milk, the comparative excellence was much higher when maize was fed directly into the biogas facility, than when it was merely sent through the cow and milk was produced.
This means that food prices and energy prices always correspond and this has something to do with the fact that we do have an Electricity Feed Act - in Germany in any case, but also in some other countries - by which better recycling of plant products can be achieved in the energy sector than in the food sector.
We have to watch out here that we do not get into a competitive situation.
There is competition between tank and table if we get it wrong.
However, if we strike a balance on the issue of biomass fuel, this balance turns out to be negative, whereas we had a positive balance with biogas - even with biogas for cars.
It therefore depends on us clearly favouring smaller plants in policy on subsidies and in remuneration policy, in order to prevent migration into industrial production.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, let us be clear: this biomass thing is driven by the alleged global warming effect of man-derived carbon dioxide emissions.
Forget carbon footprints.
CO2 is a natural constituent of the atmosphere; it is not some kind of devil potion, as is misleadingly made out in portraying the situation as an 'Inconvenient Truth'.
This hyperactive film is not proof at all; it is not even truth.
It is a theory and a very long way from proof.
You see, as a chemistry teacher - and I bet there are few of those in this Assembly - I know what it takes to go from hypothesis to theory to chemical law.
I do not go by the theatrical or didactic rantings of a US politician on the make.
Fortunately, we now have the Manhattan Declaration, released by 500 scientists last week, which says there is no convincing evidence that CO2 from modern industry is causing climate change.
It reminds us that the global climate has always changed and always will.
Does no one here appreciate that the Earth we know is not in a final state but in continuous dynamic development?
To tax us all to achieve the unobtainable and unneeded is political greed.
To turn over farmland to produce biofuels when populations are increasing and there is a world shortage of cereals is madness.
To grow biofuels by cutting down whole areas of rainforest, burning the timber where it falls to get a few years' worth of nitrates and then moving on, gang-raping the precious forests, is criminal.
So what is causing the current minimal degree of global warming?
To paraphrase former President Clinton: it's the sun, stupid!
on behalf of the NI Group. - Madam President, I welcome the recognition of the potential for a considerable increase in biogas production.
It ticks the boxes of helping livestock farmers tap into an alternative income stream and, at the same time, makes a worthwhile contribution to the environment by solving problems allied to the disposal of agricultural waste.
A third distinct advantage for biogas is that, unlike biofuels, it need not hinder food security but, rather, help it.
Therein is a key advantage for biogas: using waste rather than crops, it does not discourage essential feedstuff production or food production itself.
The fledgling biogas sector needs meaningful start-up support with a uniform support instrument across the EU rather than the sporadic patchwork of support which we have at the moment.
Extra research support to exploit second-generation biogas as a biofuel is a forward-looking necessity.
So there is much that can and should be done to promote biogas and, at the same time, make agriculture more sustainable.
I believe in the EU we grossly miscalculated in over-indulging biofuels.
Let us not compound that error by undervaluing biogas.
Madam President, I also welcome this report: it puts us into the picture of what the potential for biogas is, and I know there are different experiences in different Member States.
One would wonder why there is such a gap in biogas production and use in some countries and not in others.
As the Commissioner said, there is huge untapped potential there and we need to do something about it, but not, I say, another directive, as we have plenty of them and it would just confuse rather than assist progress in this area.
Let me draw your attention to paragraph 37 of the report, which calls for a simplified planning permission procedure.
It is perhaps the only mention of a most relevant fact in all of the deliberations about using waste and recycling.
In my country and in my experience every time there is a planning process for a green recycling facility or the use of meat and bone meal for energy production, there are objections, because people are suspicious of these developments and are fearful for their health.
We need to draw together the research and be very firm about what the truth is on this because the public has concerns.
Therefore, we need to educate the public of the need to recycle waste from agriculture and from sludge, but also be aware that there are downsides to this technology and that producing energy leaves a residue that has to be handled and dealt with very carefully.
I would welcome some comments about this side of the debate, because in this House we tend to look at renewables as being wonderful, but we also know that the public objects to wind turbines in their back gardens.
Therefore, we need to bring the public along with us, but also to acknowledge that there are concerns about health that need to be addressed.
Finally, let me say that I fully support Amendment 1 by Mr Mulder, a most sensible and very important amendment, and I suggest that I read it, because it re-emphasises the need to reclassify animal manure so that it is used properly on farms and the Nitrates Directive needs to be looked at in this context.
(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President.
Ladies and gentlemen, the globalised world of today presents us with a number of challenges. These include, for example, climate change, increasing poverty, the problems of energy efficiency and energy security, and the issue of using renewable energy sources.
In the interests of agricultural sustainability, we must therefore not only respond to the challenges affecting the European Union but also institute coordinated policy measures on the basis of a common strategy to try to address the difficulties facing the 27 Member States.
In this light I particularly welcome the initiative of my colleague, Mr Tabajdi, on biogas and sustainable agriculture and take this opportunity to congratulate him on his excellent report.
I think it is important to adopt a European Union directive on renewable energy sources in order to coordinate EU regulation and national policy, to coordinate regulation at EU and Member State level.
Biogas produced in integrated agricultural plants is one of the most important sources of bio-energy.
Setting up biogas plants is costly, however.
To enable us to exploit the potential of biogas it would make sense to coordinate cohesion policy, opportunities provided by agricultural, rural development and framework programmes, and to promote investment in and sustenance of biogas plants.
The allocation of financial support needs to be based first and foremost on efficiency; if efficiency is the primary criterion, then electricity generation is virtually the only thing worth supporting.
There are many other potential uses for biogas, however, and we should therefore concentrate efforts on research and development and innovation in order to expand the range of efficient ways of using this resource.
In addition to European Union funding, we need to create favourable conditions in the Member States to facilitate the construction and operation of biogas plants.
In this context it would be useful for Member States to provide price subsidies or other measures to promote the use of this novel energy source.
Another advantage of biogas as an energy source is its significant capacity for adding value, both on agricultural holdings and in the rural regions, helping those regions to increase their economic viability.
It is therefore also important to ensure that disadvantaged regions are also able to exploit these opportunities.
Thank you.
(PL) Madam President, Mr Tabajdi's report raises an issue that is of great importance to farmers, the economy and the environment.
Biogas limits the cost of importing natural gas, reduces the amount of methane that is released into the atmosphere and is a fuel that can be used directly in agricultural production and for public utility purposes.
Recycling manure, waste and sewage sludge to produce biogas is beneficial to the cause of environmental protection.
The level of biogas production in EU states, however, varies very widely.
In this area the EU institutions should take such actions as upgrading the functioning of legal and economic regulations to promote the development of biofuel production; speeding up research programmes linked to upgrading biofuel production technology, including fuels produced from biomass, organic waste, sewage sludge and manure; and introducing programmes to publicise information and advertise good experience as achieved by German, Belgian and Danish farmers.
(SV) Madam President, the United Nations Panel on Climate Change says that man is emitting greenhouse gases to a degree which is changing the world's climate.
The EU has accepted that mankind should therefore reduce these emissions dramatically over the coming decades and has said that the EU should take a lead in this global effort.
How are we to go about this?
I am horrified to see how political meddling and the ambition to shift political power to the EU institutions are now threatening to run out of control.
We European parliamentarians should not be demanding subsidies for the commitment to biogas.
We have no idea how tax incentives should be applied to favour biogas over other alternatives.
We must allow emission targets to be set in each EU country, which we have done, and then leave it to the countries themselves to devise effective means of attaining their targets.
The classic European solution is institutional competition - not central control.
Madam President, I thank Mr Tabajdi very much for his report.
I, like many other speakers, welcome this report on biogas because it has a very important role to play.
In agriculture in particular a lot of waste is produced that could be made very effectively into biogas.
Waste food and waste vegetables could also be mixed with it to create electricity.
Therefore, it is likely to be very efficient.
In fact, use of biogas is considered to be one of the most efficient ways of making electricity by 'bio-' means.
One thing I would say to Mr Tabajdi is that we do not need a directive specifically for bio-energy: it can be encompassed in a renewable energy directive.
I would urge him not to pursue that.
I would also say that, as far as farmers are concerned, one of the things they are now greatly involved with is the Nitrates Directive.
They also need a lot of storage on their farms for waste.
Slurry could be contained on the farm and could be changed into biogas, and the waste from that could then be spread on the land.
As the Commissioner said, it kills two birds with one stone.
Ms McGuinness said that one of the things we need to tackle - probably not at European but at Member State level - is that biogas plants are always wonderful things as long as they are somewhere else and not next door to you.
This is something that we suffer from greatly in Europe: it always happens somewhere else.
Finally, I should like to reply to Mr Clark - though I think he has left - who asked whether or not there is global warming.
I was talking to an eminent Israeli scientist who said that there could be global warming or there need not be, but can we wait for 20 years to know whether we were right or not?
(RO) Given the current price of oil, biogas is an energy resource that should be taken into account, especially in the context in which the reliance of the European Union on hydrocarbon imports is increasing.
We all are aware of the goal of achieving 20% of renewable energy in the total energy consumption at European level by 2020.
However, in these circumstances, it is obvious that the use of biogas as an energy resource should also be stimulated, especially by using financial tools.
Biogas and other biofuels, along with solar and wind energy, can significantly reduce the reliance on conventional energy sources.
Furthermore, in comparison to other renewable energy types, biogas has the advantage that it can be used in the production of electricity, thermal power, as well as in transportation.
Maybe a new directive on biogas alone is too much to ask, but I welcome the request addressed to the Commission to present a special report on biogas in the European Union, which should also include recommendations concerning the European and the national legislation in this field.
(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Tabajdi, for his excellent report.
He has done a very thorough job.
Biogas is an important renewable energy resource which contributes to sustainable agricultural development and improves the state of the environment.
Biogas can also be used to help make farms and areas more self-sufficient in energy, and just a small part of this resource has actually been tapped.
We still need much in the way of product development, however.
We need innovations, an exchange of good experiences and additional funding.
The important raw materials of biogas, manure and the by-products of food, should not be classified as waste, but as raw materials that can be used to make biogas and fertiliser.
At the same time we have to lay down a common set of rules to promote the use of biogas throughout the European Union and remove the national barriers and restrictions that relate to it.
(SK) The EU is reliant on countries outside the Union for its energy supply.
In addition, Europe is not far from an energy crisis.
It is, therefore, essential for us to intervene and support the use of renewable energy.
In my view, biogas represents a convenient option from both an economic and an environmental viewpoint.
It contributes to sustainable economic and agricultural development, to the development of rural areas and to the protection of the environment.
When produced from animal manure, sludge, communal and animal organic waste it offers new income opportunities to the farming community.
It is, however, also essential to pay close attention to safety measures.
Some active components and bacteria contained in agricultural and communal waste, if spread, could jeopardise both public health and the natural environment.
I would also like to object strongly to the use of corn, cereals and other primary agricultural food products for energy production.
Their combustion leads to overpricing of feedingstuffs and foodstuffs in general.
Madam President, the generation of renewable energy from biogas is a positive development from an energy-supply perspective.
However, the contribution of biogas from manure to the abatement of greenhouse gases requires further research.
The draft report does not actually address the issue of unintended or fugitive emissions, i.e. those emissions of gases which escape during the production process.
Some research suggests that methane losses during production, and emissions of nitrous oxide when digestate is applied to the land, can negate any potential for greenhouse gas abatement.
More research is urgently required.
Any review of legislation to support biogas production should be based on a rigorous life-cycle analysis to definitively assess the process in the context of renewable energy production and as an abatement strategy for greenhouse gases.
Madam President, I wish to begin by adding my congratulations to the rapporteur on a timely report.
Energy security, rising energy costs and climate change are perhaps the greatest challenges facing Europe in the 21st century.
One thing is clear: Europe must become more self-reliant in its energy needs and ensure the security of its energy supply.
To do this will mean more diversification into alternative energy sources and a heavier reliance on new technologies and renewables.
In my own constituency it is estimated that we import a staggering 96% of our energy.
Many of you will agree with me that the emerging market for biomass and biofuels presents many new opportunities for the farmer.
It is an increasingly competitive marketplace: farmers in my constituency of Northern Ireland could find many benefits from looking to alternative uses of their land to create new business opportunities in the production of biofuels.
While I am under no illusions that biofuels and biomass energy are the only answer to Europe's growing energy concerns, I am sure that they have an important role to play in easing them.
(PL) Madam President, the role of gas is an important one, firstly in the diversification of gas supplies, secondly in countering climate change, and thirdly in improving the state of the environment, in other words protecting it.
Let us also bear in mind that biogas is produced from domestic waste, organic waste, slurry and manure.
Biogas is a very important source of renewable energy.
It can be used to produce energy, it is a good source of heat, and it can also be used to power vehicles.
A greater number of vehicles could benefit from biogas, but it needs to be made available and cost-effective to use.
We must, however, apply new second-generation technologies to produce biogas.
What we need to set up, then, are stable conditions for biogas development and suitable financial support instruments.
Madam President, as the rapporteur for the Renewables Directive on which we are about to vote in this Parliament, I really welcome Mr Tabajdi's report.
I also broadly agree that biogas is one of the best ways of processing biomass in Europe.
In my report I will try to highlight the potential of biogas.
It is a storable form of energy, so is complementary to other intermittent sources of renewables.
I will also push to reduce red tape.
I think we have a real problem in Europe concerning authorisation, especially for energy production which is not dangerous, and biogas is not dangerous.
I would just like to mention one other issue.
At the moment we are also discussing the internal market Gas Directive.
We also need to make it easier for biogas to have access to the gas network.
Any of you who are interested in this should look at the amendments which I have tabled on the Gas Directive.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, my thanks to all those who have contributed to this discussion.
As always happens, it is very difficult to concentrate only on biogas - we then start a discussion on all renewable energies.
This whole discussion is based on the energy report published by the Commission last January, because we could suddenly see that we were depending heavily on imports of energy, especially from our eastern neighbours, and secondly: how could we contribute to the reduction of CO2 or greenhouse gas emissions?
Suddenly all the different ideas were put on the table.
When we talk about the transport sector, 10% needs to come from renewable energies by 2020, and here the agricultural sector was the first supplier - and is at this stage the only supplier.
We all know - and we have heard it today as well - about the competition between food, feed and fuel.
This will be a discussion as long as we are in the first generation of those different biofuels.
I therefore completely agree with those who have underlined the necessity of investing heavily in research and development so that we can pass through the first generation and enter into the second generation.
It is crucial for it to be economically viable in the future, which it is not today with the different types of renewable energies.
We need to be able to find the 'golden solution', so that it becomes economically sustainable.
Another issue is sustainability - environmental sustainability.
Here we have a very clear approach.
We will not accept renewable energies that are not produced in a sustainable way, and this is related both to production within the European Union and to renewable energies that will be imported from overseas.
We will need imports.
Do not try to convince anyone that we can rely exclusively on European production.
That is simply not possible; we will need imports.
I think it is a splendid idea to continue working hard on biogas.
Here we use waste - slurry - and all the residue from slaughterhouses, which is a very good component in this production process.
From an agricultural-environmental point of view this can solve some of the problems that some Member States, some regions, are facing with the Nitrates Directive, as mentioned here tonight.
It can help solve these problems as well.
I think there are lots of possibilities in the renewable energy sector, but we need to push for further investments to be able to make it a viable solution for the future.
Once again my thanks to the rapporteur. It has been a very good report.
rapporteur. - (HU) Commissioner, Madam President, thank you for this debate.
It is clear, as today's debate has also demonstrated, that neither biogas, nor bio-energy, nor renewable energy sources are panaceas in themselves, but all are vitally important in terms of energy diversification.
Second: biogas remains expensive, as my fellow Member, Mr Kuc, and many others have said.
Technological development is therefore needed.
Initially, as Commissioner Fischer Boel has mentioned, this will require government support from the rural development fund.
The third point is particularly important.
Evidently I did not make myself clear - I am addressing this to Mr Parish: tomorrow I will present an oral amendment withdrawing my proposal for a directive on biogas and bio-waste and recommending its inclusion in the unified directive on renewable energies.
This was the agreement reached between myself, Mrs Fischer Boel and her colleagues and the European People's Party.
The fourth issue is that of the deadline: of course we will be flexible in this regard.
I would like to say to Mrs McGuinness that the procedure at present is exceedingly bureaucratic; in Denmark, the country that has been most ambitious in this regard - and not because the Commissioner is Danish - it takes five years from inception of the idea to handing over of the plant, and there are countries where it takes ten years.
Lastly, I would like to address the point raised by Avril Doyle.
Here in my hands I have the excellent Danish study - which again has nothing to do with the fact that the Commissioner is Danish - produced by the National Centre of the Danish Agricultural Advisory Service.
Writing this report was easy.
I shall send Mrs Doyle the section that contains very precise calculations relating to 'Potential Environmental Problems', in other words on issues like fugitive gases; I certainly found them reassuring, although I am not an environmental expert.
To conclude, I would like to express my gratitude - and I apologise to the Commissioner in advance for my poor pronunciation of Danish - to Thorkild Birkmose, Henning LyngsÃž Foged and JÃžrgen Hinge of the Danish Agricultural Advisory Service, who produced this excellent study.
I would also like to thank Nicolas Nevez, who worked alongside the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and my colleagues DÃ¡vid KorÃ¡nyi and TamÃ¡s BÃ­rÃ³; I also thank the two draftsmen Werner Langen and Jens Holm for the opinion of the two associated committees, and I thank you all for your constructive criticism.
Let us move forward with biogas, even if it is not a cure-all.
Thank you for your attention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Energy statistics (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Turmes, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy statistics - C6-0035/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - (ES) Madam President, last year was a year of crucial decisions on climate change and energy policy.
The European Union is determined, and committed to tackling climate change and taking up the challenge of guaranteeing secure, sustainable and competitive energy.
The European Council of March 2007, a year ago, established precise and binding objectives, with an ambitious plan to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and increase the use of renewable energy in our energy consumption.
The Commission, as you know, has put forward specific proposals in these areas.
All of these aspirations require high-quality, constant and detailed monitoring of the progress of our energy situation, as energy consumption is responsible for more than 80% of our greenhouse gas emissions.
Member States also need to monitor their energy dependency closely, in particular with regard to natural gas and oil.
The proposal for a regulation on energy statistics is part of the energy package adopted by the Commission last year.
Traditionally, gathering statistics on energy has been based on voluntary agreements with the Member States, and it has been done in this way for years.
Nevertheless, both the Commission and Parliament agree that, now and in the future, this gathering of statistics is too important to depend solely on voluntary agreements.
Moreover, the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets has brought with it an increase in the number of interested parties, with the logical consequence that gathering data in this field is now much more complex, which means that a legal basis is needed for this very important work.
This proposal for a regulation is the result of a request from the European Parliament to the Commission to make a legal commitment to provide European citizens with data on energy at European level periodically and at appropriate times.
In addition, energy statistics are a very dynamic field and the proposal for a regulation picks up the European Parliament's desire for statistics on energy efficiency and renewable energy to continue to evolve.
This is all a reflection of the constructive atmosphere that has dominated the debates between our institutions to arrive at the final version of the proposal for a regulation that we are beginning to debate today in Parliament.
Therefore, allow me to conclude this presentation by thanking the protagonists in this process and especially the European Parliament rapporteur for their support in drawing up this legal basis, which will enable us to have transparent data on energy in the European Union in the future.
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, energy is back on the political agenda.
Commissioner, when you took up your post in Brussels, the price of a barrel of oil was USD 25.
Today it is USD 105, so, in order to cope with the energy challenge - whether in respect of climate change, the oil shortage, our geopolitical dependence at the root of the situation, our economic vulnerability faced with the volatility of oil prices, or gas prices - I believe there is greater urgency than ever to introduce a European energy policy.
However, to draw up a good European energy policy, you need a good database.
I think that what we will be voting on this evening is in fact the creation of a good database, because statistics will be compulsory - that is a very important point - but also because Parliament has really achieved success, I believe, because the statistics, which up to now have been mainly very detailed fossil energy statistics on coal, oil and gas, are going to be adapted to the 21st century, and energy in the 21st century will be oriented towards renewable energy sources.

From 2020, at 20%, renewable energies will be the leading energy source in Europe.
Therefore, these statistics need to be adapted, and we are going to adapt them in line with demand for energy.
It is rather staggering to note how poor the national statistics - and, consequently, the European statistics - are, particularly as regards buildings and consumption by household and office appliances, and also as regards transport.
I believe we have also gained something important, namely transparency regarding the nuclear chain.
The new regulation will force Europe to be much more specific, including with regard to the front end of the nuclear chain, bringing an end to a rather Kafkaesque situation.
We were in a position where we were importing.
Europe imports 98% of its uranium, and in the statistics, in Europe's statistical yearbook, nuclear was shown as a native energy source because the statistics had not been adapted.
Therefore, there has been progress on this point.
Another success lies in the fact that the statistics are going to be published five months earlier.
It was a fierce battle that we won here, particularly against the Council.
There will also be a collateral gain, namely that the Member States - and particularly Germany, which was in practice the most difficult to convince - will be forced to invest more in the statistics.
From this platform, I would therefore like to offer my thanks to all the statisticians in Europe who, over the last 10 years, with very limited resources, have had to produce the statistics - and are continuing to produce them.
Today we are going to put them in a better position, because the Finance Ministers will now be obliged to take statistics on energy much more seriously.
This victory for Parliament is a collective victory.
I would like to thank Mrs Trautmann, Mrs Hall and Mrs Korhola for the work carried out.
I would also like to thank the Parliament staff, Mrs Cordero of the Portuguese Presidency, who is really the person who helped us reach an agreement, and finally the Eurostat officials who had to put up with me, sometimes afternoon after afternoon, with my questions and the provision of answers, so thank you to them, too.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Madam President, energy statistics at Community level always used to be based on a gentlemen's agreement.
It was clear beforehand what the statistics were being compiled on, how accurate they had to be, and when they had to be ready for submission.
It has not been that way for a little while now, however.
EU enlargement, certain statistics practices which came along with it, and other reforms, such as the liberalisation of the energy markets and alternative forms of energy, have together created the need speedily to draft a Community-wide legal framework for compiling statistics.
The compromise package now before us is the result of intensive talks in which gentlemanly behaviour had to be sought to some extent, though in the end it was found, to the benefit of one and all.
The energy statistics process was supposed only to be a mere footnote to Parliament's statistics on labour, but the rapporteur, Mr Turmes, has succeeded in playing an official political game of dry and technical statistics to stir up deep passions.
The calls for detailed statistics on the nuclear fuel cycle, energy end-use and extended statistics on renewable energy, as well as ambitious demands to bring forward the annual Eurostat reports, were all examples of politically oriented moves.
To be fit for purpose, however, statistics need to be a neutral tool, no more.
As the shadow rapporteur for my group, I was given the role of arbiter.
With regard to that, the views held by Eurostat and the Council were a long way off from the aims of our rapporteur.
I would now like to thank all the parties concerned for their prudent desire for a compromise, meaning that the regulation we have been waiting for can now swiftly enter into force.
The reforms pushed for by Mr Turmes will also be taken into account in the regulation, though in a realistic way.
We also found consensus on what the regulation is to cover and what should be left to other areas of legislation.
A splendid example of this is peat: we are not now adopting a position on its classification as a fossil or a renewable fuel, in that it renews itself every year, in this context.
Let us leave that little battle to the forthcoming debate on the directive on future renewable forms of energy, when our paths will surely cross once again.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Europe gradually equips itself with instruments to limit climate change associated with greenhouse gas emissions, as European citizens experience the full force of the energy price rises, it is of course important finally to establish a legal basis for the collection and dissemination of energy statistics.
However, we feel it is just as important to make them consistent with the challenges we are facing: saving energy and redefining our energy mix, with fewer fossil energies and far more renewable energies.
The new elements of this regulation are therefore more a coherent redefinition of the scope of the statistics than a series of sporadic additions.
My approach as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will have been to ensure that these statistics can be even more useful to European citizens, but also to those who govern them.
They become more reliable for analyses and more useful as an aid to decision-making.
For citizens, we have fought for and obtained more transparent statistics that provide information about what affects them most: housing and transport, but also the nuclear industry.
For governments, the most up-to-date statistics possible will be available for the usual Energy Councils held each spring.
We will see how far these objectives are met.
In the meantime, the result of these changes is, in my view, quite restrained, that is they do not unduly increase the workload of the Member States or the various partners involved.
It is on this point that I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Turmes, for his sense of compromise, along with his whole team.
Finally, I would again like to applaud the very valuable and efficient support given throughout by Eurostat to help produce a result that is now recognised as robust.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Turmes for his excellent work as rapporteur and for his close cooperation with colleagues.
Energy statistics are like the steel rods holding up a building: you cannot see them from the outside but without them the whole building collapses.
At the moment we are constructing brand new ways of doing energy.
The EU has agreed new targets on energy efficiency and renewables and CO2 emissions.
But, as we know from past EU efforts in these areas, it is easier to set targets than it is to implement them, and the only way we can tell whether or not we are doing what we set out to do is by measuring actions statistically.
We now need statistics focused on energy demand as much as on energy supply.
We need detailed statistics on renewables as well as on fossil fuels.
We need improved statistics on nuclear energy, collected and collated at European level, and we need these statistics to be processed much more quickly so that we have early feedback.
It is particularly important to make sure that statistics are available well in advance of March energy summits.
