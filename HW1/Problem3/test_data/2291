We must defend them and give them a chance.
They must not be exempted from the thinking about safety, but less harsh duties might in actual fact be imposed upon them in the context of this control.
I would appeal to you all firstly to vote today despite all the problems that exist and, secondly, to fall in with my compromise vote list.
Finally, I wish again to extend my many thanks to the Commission and the Council and, above all, to the Italian and Irish Presidencies.
Thank you very much for your fantastic cooperation.
Â Â  Since you too, MrsÂ Paulson, referred to the hope that the vote will have a positive outcome, I would repeat that, as regards whether or not to decide on the voteÂ âÂ referring to the speech made before by MrsÂ KlassÂ âÂ there will, if necessary, be a vote in plenary to decide whether or not to accept the adjournment of this vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Doyle, who is unable to be here this morning.
We welcome the feed and food controls in order to ensure healthy animals and good meat for people throughout Europe.
However, we must give the industry time to develop a uniform approach across Europe.
I would like Commissioner Byrne to explain in more detail how we are going to enforce the same kind of controls on feed imported into the European Union.
It is very important that the same stringent controls are applied not only to our feed in Europe but also to imported feed.
Animal welfare is also extremely important.
MrsÂ Paulsen mentioned labelling.
We have to ensure that consumers can tell from the labelling which products have met those high animal welfare standards in Europe.
Consumers should also be able to see from the labelling which products have not met those high standards.
The cost of inspection within the EU and fees charged to each feed company have to be looked at, because if one country is charging significantly more for inspections than another, it causes distortions throughout the single market.
In broad terms, we must welcome these controls, but we have to be careful that we do not over-regulate.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am speaking this morning on behalf of my colleague Mr Schnellhardt, who unfortunately cannot be with us.
The regulation on feed and food controls before us is one of the EU measures to improve food safety.
There is a common thread running through all the arrangements in this area, and that thread is the principle of universal controls, from the farm to the shop counter to the table.
The participation of stakeholders in the food sector in food safety has been extended, responsibility has been clearly defined, and official controls have been shaped on a more scientific basis and clearly structured.
This regulation on feed and food controls represents a piece of framework legislation in this context.
It has to be said, unfortunately, that the treatment given to this regulation in this House is not in line with the usual parliamentary procedures.
The text to be voted on today was largely worked out in the European Council and is significantly different from the Commission proposal.
It has not been possible to consider and discuss the text before us in depth.
We in this House have been endeavouring for years to extend our powers in relation to the legislative process.
The procedure adopted for this regulation runs very much counter to those attempts.
Although we welcome the inclusion of animal welfare in this regulation, we are critical of the nature of the provisions relating to it.
The regulation very much opens up the way to transferring certain official control activities to third parties.
I believe, however, that official control activities, if their independence is to be ensured, should be engaged in by state institutions.
The same applies to the proposed financing procedure.
The proposal will of course provide a uniform basis for calculating the fees for inspections in Europe, but it does nothing to eliminate the distortion in competition resulting from enormous differences in the level of fees, something that has been criticised for years.
Just the opposite, in fact: this approach makes it quite possible that companies in the same administrative district will have to pay different fees because of their different geographical distance from the administrative authorities.
Yet official controls are intended to promote health and should therefore be charged at approximately the same level for all companies involved.
The inadequate reference to national control plans and to the financing of ad hoc controls means that this procedural approach exposes companies to financial risk.
Lastly, I would like to specifically emphasise that we support many of the ideas put forward here.
However, the unconventional way of producing the legislative text that has been imposed upon us, with new drafts repeatedly being published at short intervals, and with the final version of the amendments only becoming available in our own languages this morning, has unfortunately made in-depth consideration of the text impossible.
It cannot be ruled out that possible shortcomings and critical points will go unnoticed because of this haste.
For this reason, our unreserved support cannot be taken for granted.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am speaking today on behalf of MrsÂ Corbey, and should like to express five comments.
First of all, transparency in food safety and the controlling of this are of course extremely important.
More rules and greater control are not in themselves a guarantee of improved food safety: we can only put an end to tinkering with food if we also demand transparency.
Information on businesses that have a rather casual attitude to food safety must be made public.
Those who tinker lose customers.
Transparency is an important condition for food safety, and we welcome the compromise reached.
Secondly, the financing of the controls must be fair.
We must combat unfair aid to businesses and unfair competition.
Granting small businesses a discount enables us to accommodate this category of business, which is very important within the food sector, to some degree.
My third comment concerns the proper, fair application of this legislation.
Our group has been advocating equivalent controls and equivalent methods throughout the EU.
It must not be the case that a cargo is rejected in Rotterdam on food safety grounds yet subsequently enters the EU via a different route.
Our question to the Commission is as follows: can the Commission assure us that, in the interests of European citizens and of fair competition, it will monitor the proper implementation of this legislation closely?
Fourthly, our group warmly welcomes the assistance that the EU is planning to give to developing countries to help them build capacity in order that they can comply with European food safety rules.
This kills two birds with one stone: the EU increases the safety of imported food products, and developing countries obtain important assistance in taking measures capable of improving their food safety situation and thus their trading position.
Food safety must not be a cover for protectionism.
We also have to keep current events in mind here.
In view of the outbreak of avian influenza in Asia, it is important that food safety is controlled right from the countries of origin.
Can the Commission confirm that this and other Community legislation offers the EU effective protection against carry-over of contagious diseases such as avian influenza?
Finally, it remains for me to make a comment of a general nature.
On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should again like to thank MrsÂ Paulsen, and also the Council and the Commission, for their constructive work.
We hope that this milestone brings an important piece of work over the past five years to a conclusion, and we look forward to hearing the Commissionâs answers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise that has been reached among four groups ensures that this Regulation on controls can soon be published in the Official Journal and can largely enter into force on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2006.
It was a great pleasure for my group to take part in the discussions on the compromise, not least on account of the reference to criminal law in AmendmentÂ NoÂ 206.
I now hear that the Council is very reluctant in this regard.
I regret that the Council is not currently taking part in the debate or expressing an opinion on the compromise that we have reached among four groups.
Consequently, I support the request by MrsÂ Klass, albeit for reasons other than language, to postpone the vote until tomorrow.
This will give the Council another chance to deliberate and express its opinion on the reference to criminal law in AmendmentÂ NoÂ 206 to the plenary sitting.
I should like to emphasise a number of elements of this Regulation that are important to our group.
The first, of course, as the rapporteur herself has said, is the extension of the scope of the Regulation from feed to animal welfare and animal health.
The second is the explicit statement of the need for controls to be carried out without prior warning.
The third is the need for official checks on self-monitoring and labelling controls.
The fourth is, very practically, the avoidance of conflicts of interest among controllers.
In Belgium, we have learnt that those still exist.
There are still self-employed veterinary surgeons, with their own practice, who are carrying out controls.
The fifth is the imposition of quality conditions on laboratories.
The sixth is the need for cooperation between national and regional authorities, as the MPA case has taught us.
Finally, since international networks are very often active in this field, international cooperation between control and customs services, and also between authorities, is tremendously important, as is the introduction of liaison bodies.
I believe that we are taking a major step forward in the form of this Regulation, and I hope that we can adopt the compromise of the four groups by a large majority.
Â Â  Mr. President, I would like to join with the other speakers in complementing the rapporteur for her work on this very important report.
The food scares experienced in recent years must never again be allowed to reach proportions which threaten European consumers, farmers and the agrifood industry.
I believe that great credit is due to the Commission, in particular Commissioner Byrne, for systematically putting forward a series of legislative proposals which aim to address each of the issues that needed to be tackled to guarantee our consumers a safe and traceable product, from farm to fork.
This particular proposal addresses some clear weaknesses which have been highlighted in the control services.
Tremendous effort has been made to facilitate a first reading conclusion of this dossier before the end of the legislative period.
The Commission initially sought to introduce criminal sanctions, but faced with the Member States' unanimous opposition to this approach, the Commission wisely decided to settle for a statement on the matter.
As regards the issue of scope and whether the proposed regulations should take in all aspects of animal health and welfare, or only those aspects impinging on food safety, I am glad that in the final analysis the Council accepted the wider scope that was urged by Parliament.
The fees issue was also hotly contested.
The latest text allows a situation whereby the collection of fees will continue to apply to those activities that are currently subject to fees â i.e. meat and fishery products inspection, veterinary residue testing, and controls on live animals.
Â Â  â Mr President, following the succession of food scares we have experienced, such as foot-and-mouth disease and BSE, action must be taken, but not at any cost.
It seems to me that, pursuant to Article 175 of the Treaty, it would be illegal to impose penalties of the kind that the Commission is proposing.
Further, together with my colleague MrÂ Blokland, I tabled an amendment for their deletion before the Irish Presidency lifts the penalties for intentional actions or serious negligence.
I do not think it is acceptable for the cost of inspections to be harmonised by means of a European fee.
Firstly, it is already difficult enough to implement such a measure, given the diverse modes and costs of production in the current 15 Member States.
How could this function in an EU of 25 Members, given that this fee may not differ by more than 10% from the average within the Community?
Secondly, in legal terms, it is not for Parliament to decide on the introduction of a European tax. I would remind you that such a measure depends on a unanimous decision by the Council.
In addition, it is necessary to remain firm on import controls.
It would be difficult to justify imposing strict controls on European Union operators if those from third countries were able to avoid them.
In addition, special provision must be made for primary producer installations. The continuity of family businesses producing much-appreciated traditional products that made their areas famous must not be threatened.
To conclude, the Commission does not have the competence to assess the extent to which national measures conform to the regulation under discussion.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Paulsen for all the work she has done to come to this complex compromise.
Whilst welcoming the animal welfare aspect of this proposal, I agree with MrsÂ KlaÃ that maybe we are rushing a little and we need time to look at every aspect of this rather complex deal.
I am also worried that once again we may be coming up against the law of unintended consequences.
You may recall that when the original slaughterhouse regulations came forward, the UK Government got hold of them and goldplated them.
This resulted in very high costs for some small slaughterhouses which, faced with those costs, closed.
That then resulted in animals having to travel very large distances to slaughterhouses.
As regards charges, in the case of this particular proposal, whilst it is true that different charges being levied in different countries is a distortion of the free market, common charges would not reflect the differences in cost of inspections in, for example, Lithuania as opposed to Germany.
We now seem to have a balance where the cost will reflect the actual cost of those inspections, but it is possible that there will be loopholes, particularly in the way that some countries define 'small operators'.
Yes, I support exemptions for small operators, but I can see how some countries that want to subsidise production in certain remote areas would use that definition.
Secondly, on the issue of 'naming and shaming', nobody could be against freedom of information â we are all in favour of transparency and openness â and not to be in favour of it would be to support secrecy.
We need to be careful, for example, to look at the situation in the UK, where if you are prosecuted you appear in the paper, but if minor infringements are discovered, such as a cracked tile in a slaughterhouse or a piece of mouse dirt in a restaurant, this does not appear on the front page of the local newspaper.
In conclusion, whilst I appreciate the good intentions, we need to look at this more carefully to make sure that we do not once again come up against the law of unintended consequences.
Â Â  Mr President, we are in the presence of the old hands today â that group of Members who have tried to deal with the questions of food safety and hygiene in cooperation with the Commissioner throughout this parliamentary term.
I want to pay personal tribute to Mrs Paulsen, who has brought through a number of complex, difficult measures of this kind.
Mr Goodwill said that these measures have unintended consequences.
I would remind him of the principle of 'unright time', according to which people always say that the time is not right for doing something.
Well, it is high time to be doing what we are doing in this area.
The institutions have come together.
There have been significant changes in the proposals for sanctions, financing, transparency and import controls.
That, with the input of the Council, has made this a good proposal, and a very good one for MrsÂ Paulsen to end on, because I know this may be her last report in Parliament.
She deserves all our thanks.
The main issues that have been raised and which I wish to touch on are, first, how the balance of fees is being struck in a way that is fair to small operators, as MrÂ Goodwill said, but nevertheless does not allow exploitation and evasion of the rules by some.
Second, how far we can specifically assist developing countries in meeting EU standards.
How are these standards going to be applied and what assistance are we able to offer?
Most of all, how can we guarantee the system of prior notification for high-risk products at ports that have the necessary facilities to deal with them?
There is a big question mark concerning these ports of entry and recent experience shows that we have to deal with this issue.
Finally, I am particularly glad that we have reached some agreement on the issue of sanctions.
Sanctions as originally proposed were unwise and would not have worked.
I am pleased to say that the route we are now taking, which has been agreed by most of the main players, is likely to lead to success.
Â Â  MrÂ President, although it is consumer protection that interests people most when we talk about Europe, it has to be said that little has been done here, and that this framework directive too will fail to provide any guarantees that the food scandals of recent years will be a thing of the past.
Unfortunately, food controls are still a farce.
This directive is indeed successful in many areas, and we Greens are particularly pleased that animal welfare has finally been incorporated into food controls.
The intensity of controls has also been improved, so that national control reports are now also required.
Nevertheless, an investigation carried out in Germany has just highlighted the fundamental problem, which is that not enough controls are carried out in practice.
We need much more funding for food controls, so that controls can be carried out more frequently, and so that anyone breaching food regulations runs a genuine risk of punitive action.
That remains the weak point in all the Member States.
We would also like to have seen laboratory methods brought in line, with some harmonisation of how controls are implemented in the Member States.
What we also urgently need â and I have not given up hope, Commissioner, and would be pleased if you could say something about this â is for a consumer information directive to be brought in at last, mirroring the environmental information directive.
That would mean that just as consumers, the public, have the right to know what is happening in the environmental world, they would also have the right to know what is happening in the food sector.
My very last point is this: I hope that the Council will stop playing hide-and-seek and tell us today in the clearest possible terms what the position is on fees and fines, so that this is clear when we come to vote, because we cannot demand more food controls and improved animal welfare if the Council is secretive about this point and there is a lack of transparency towards this House.
That is all we want.
Because what we need is food controls âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, I would also like to congratulate MrsÂ Paulsen on her report.
Some very important aspects have been included, as many other people have mentioned.
I am especially pleased with the inclusion of animal welfare.
Some people dismiss this as an issue but I think it is very important.
On the issue of controls, this is something that relates not only to this issue but also to a vast area of legislation in the European Union, where legislation is in place but it is not enforced; there are no controls.
It is important that if you have legislation and rules, they must be enforced. You cannot do that without proper and adequate controls.
I am most concerned about the issue of sanctions; it is regrettable that they are not included.
You will not force Member States and companies into complying with the law if there are no adequate sanctions in place.
We have seen in the past that companies responsible for feed scandals never go to jail; those responsible within those companies are never properly penalised.
There are derisory fines which are no deterrent to any continuation of these kinds of offences.
We are not going to find a way forward without sanctions, because we need both the carrot and stick approaches to ensure that the legislation is complied with.
Â Â  .
Mr President. I am grateful that Parliament has accepted our proposal on official feed and food controls so favourably, and that it has endorsed the need to ensure an improved monitoring system of the food and feed chain at national and Community level.
Allow me to underline once more my appreciation for the intense and productive contribution of the various committees and to stress the importance and sensitivity of the issues under discussion today, which have been raised and explored as a result of Mrs Paulsen's excellent work.
I understand the emphasis put on certain aspects, such as increased transparency and the recognition of the efforts of good businesses to produce safe food and feed.
The Commission regrets that its proposal to introduce penal sanctions is not supported by Council and Parliament.
The Commission considers that the use of penal sanctions would be an important strengthening of controls on food and feed operators.
The Commission disagrees with Parliament's and the Council's view that ArticleÂ 55(2) and (3) relate to the third pillar.
On the other hand, it notes that this issue has already been submitted to the Court of Justice for determination in another case.
In these circumstances and taking into account the overall political context of this procedure, the Commission is prepared to withdraw ArticleÂ 55(2) and (3) of this proposal, awaiting the Court's determination of the issue and reserves the right to propose again measures providing for criminal sanctions in this field.
Mrs Paulsen raised the question of sensitive treatment of small enterprises and I would refer to the provision in the legislation that provides for a special case to be made in respect of small enterprises.
I know from her extensive experience in dealing with food safety issues in this House, that she will be aware that similar sensitive provisions have been included in the hygiene regulation.
She will also be aware from Commissioner Fischler's recent review of the CAP proposals that special provision has also been made there for the funding of small and medium-sized food enterprises, particularly in rural areas, throughout the EU.
Mr Parish raised the question of import controls.
Third countries must give guarantees on compliance with EU law.
If these guarantees are not given, imports will be submitted to special controls, or not be allowed at all.
Imported food and feed will be submitted to import controls upon arrival.
That control system is based on risk: the higher the risk, the more intensive the import controls.
For example, food that may contain certain toxins will be checked intensively.
Mr Whitehead then raised the question of how we can guarantee that the prior notification system works properly.
There is already a system in respect of veterinary controls, where there is a form that deals with this issue of prior notification.
A modest adjustment will be made to the existing provisions in relation to the veterinary controls to take this particular system into account.
Thought has been given to this; my officials have noted this issue as one requiring attention and it will be dealt with at a technical level.
Mr Parish also raised the question of animal welfare.
As he probably knows, animal welfare aspects are not included in the WTO (World Trade Organisation) sanitary and phytosanitary code and there is therefore no international consensus on the organisation of controls in respect of animal welfare rules with our trading partners.
The Commission's proposal is to conclude agreements with third countries on animal welfare.
The Commission has also raised the matter in the OIE in order to bring the matter on to the international agenda.
There was a conference in Paris a couple of weeks ago that I attended, where the OIE has clearly indicated its intention to upgrade the whole question of animal welfare in international trade.
This legislation also provides for national control measures to be put in place so that the FAO can inspect them and be satisfied that they work properly.
Concern was expressed about the deflection of trade from one harbour to another and whether this would arise or not, owing to different levels of inspection and the application of less expensive control measures, thus creating an advantage for food business operators.
For this reason, the proposal provides for a standard level in the veterinary sector.
With regard to control measures, the proposal will contribute to reaching a harmonised level on import controls.
I believe that the essential elements to avoid deflection of trade are included in the proposal.
Mrs KlaÃ raised the question of the system of inspection fees and why they cannot be regulated at a more central level.
There are a number of reasons for this and some have been referred to by a number of speakers earlier today.
The inspection costs, for instance, are different across Europe.
This is due to differences in salaries, energy costs, etc. The fees in several Member States are regulated at local level, which results in different fees within a single, individual Member State.
It is impossible for the Commission to exercise its control powers in view of the complicated methods for auditing national or regional financing systems.
Therefore, the proposal on the table is believed to be the appropriate response to this somewhat complex issue.
To conclude, I confirm that the Commission accepts a substantial number of the amendments that have been tabled.
A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is being provided to Parliament, and I trust this will be included in the record of this session(1).
In the event that there are amendments tabled that are not part of the package, the Commission will not be able to accept them.
Â Â  Thank you Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0468/2003) by MrsÂ Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on measures and procedures to ensure the enforcement of intellectual property rights [COM(2003) 46 â C5-0055/2003 â 2003/0024(COD)].
Â Â  . Mr President, this proposal for a directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights represents one of the main elements of a Commission action plan of November 2000 to combat counterfeiting and piracy, and complements the recent customs regulation.
Counterfeiting and piracy are on the rise.
They harm business, society and governments, as they are detrimental to innovation and creativity and can be very dangerous to public health and safety.
Counterfeiters and pirates undermine legitimate business and culture as they copy end products that have involved considerable investment.
Consumers and rights-holders are not the only ones to suffer.
Member States are deprived of considerable amounts in lost taxation, and employment suffers when the business world is not flourishing.
There is also a genuine threat to public order.
Counterfeiting and piracy carried out on a commercial scale are nowadays believed to be even more attractive than drug trafficking, and its perpetrators are linked more and more to large-scale organised crime.
This proposed directive is the Community's answer to this threat.
It is not an easy proposal since it touches upon issues which involve many interests, sectors and different ministries in Member States, for instance culture, trade and industry, economy and justice.
There has been some very sensitive, sometimes emotional, lobbying both for and against this directive, and I appreciate the sense of responsibility that Parliament has shown in the face of this pressure.
However, the need for action is clear and not in dispute.
The Commission believes that, with the text agreed by Coreper on 16 February, we have reached the right moment for a positive decision.
The compromise text constitutes an appropriate balance among all interests involved, including rights-holders, commercial users, consumers and intermediaries.
This balance has been achieved in a different way from that in the Commission proposal, but it has been achieved.
The proposal constitutes a considerable degree of harmonisation and it will provide us with an effective level playing field on sanctions and remedies.
This will be essential for creating a business environment where legal players are not disturbed by counterfeiters and pirates.
This fulfils the commitments made by both the Commission and the European Parliament in a communication of November 2000, which resulted from consultations carried out in the context of a Green Paper in 1998.
It also contributes to the achievement of the Lisbon agenda.
In view of the safeguarding of the necessary balance and effectiveness of this proposal, the Commission supports the text on the table today, as proposed via the compromise amendments jointly tabled by four political groups.
The compromise text is thus the result of joint and very intensive efforts from all three institutions.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament as a whole for the interest it has shown in this important piece of legislation and its very constructive contributions, many of which can be found in the text before us today.
In particular, I would like to thank the very competent rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, the shadow rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, and the chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Berenguer Fuster, for their very professional and efficient guidance within their institution.
Both the Committee on Industry, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have given the issues at stake great thought, the fruit of which now lies before us in the form of amendments to be voted in this plenary.
Consequently, the Commission endorses the amendments that go along the lines of the agreed compromise text: Amendments Nos 1 to 52 and 56 to 100.
Amendments Nos 53 to 55 and 103 to 113 deviate from the text and must be rejected.
The Commission feels that these amendments would not contribute to the balance and effectiveness that has been achieved in the compromise and, in particular, would not be in conformity with the horizontal approach.
The directive should apply to infringements of all intellectual property rights.
In recognition of the harmful nature of counterfeiting and piracy, time should not be lost.
The Commission would encourage the European Parliament to vote favourably on the Council compromise text so as to avoid any delay that would otherwise arise and would only serve the purpose of those trying to profit from illegal practices.
Time will not improve this text.
Â Â  . â At a time when, as Commissioner Byrne states, counterfeiting and piracy crimes are currently rocketing, it is essential, in the interests of our economy. to put in place appropriate instruments to ensure the protection of intellectual property rights.
I would remind you that the Commission presented its text in January 2003. This initiative had been expected ever since 1998 when the Green Paper was published.
Parliament demonstrated its determination to act against counterfeiting and piracy on a number of occasions, notably by voting unanimously on a resolution on this Green Paper and by signing a written declaration.
Being aware of the need to which I have referred, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted on 27 November 2003 the amended report on the respect of intellectual property rights by 28Â votes with 3 abstentions. Time is of the essence.
On the eve of enlargement, there is also an urgent need to establish harmonised legislation so as to ensure respect for intellectual property rights, innovation and creativity in the 25 Member States. Accordingly, an original procedure was used.
At the behest of the Presidency of the Council, an informal three-way discussion was established to seek a compromise. The discussions took three months.
In addition to the Council and the Commission, your rapporteur, the draftsman of the opinion, the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the shadow rapporteurs also participated in this process. I would like to thank them for their help and for their diligence.
The Irish Presidencyâs extraordinary commitment made it possible for this agreement to be reached in advance of the deadline, and I would like to extend special thanks to them.
I am also grateful to the Commission, which did everything in its power to offer us continual assistance.
The amendments tabled today on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group reflect the text of the Council compromise in every detail.
The text is extremely balanced, equitable and proportionate, reiterating our stance on the importance of intellectual property law, taking account of the concerns expressed by Parliament on behalf of a range of sectors, and now containing many safeguards to protect the interests of both right-holders and consumers.
In accordance with international agreements into which the Community has entered, the scope of the application of the directive is broadened to cover all infringements of intellectual property law.
From now on, however, only acts committed for commercial purposes will be regarded as punishable.
The definition of commercial purposes excludes acts committed by consumers acting in good faith who do not gain direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage.
This extension of the scope of the application does not undermine any of the sectoral directives already adopted on copyright, electronic commerce and computer programs.
The exception made for private copying is actually strengthened.
The other important points of the text relate to the need to take account of the rights of defence.
Notably, ArticleÂ 8 on the provisional measures guarantees the right to defence by imposing a time limit, thus limiting the entitlement to institute legal proceedings, and byproviding for the defendant to be compensated.
The protection of personal data is strengthened. All measures taken must be justified and proportionate.
They must not create barriers to legitimate trade or to competition. The judicial authorities must assess the specific features of each case.
They must also assess whether or not the infringement was intentional.
All measures envisaged are civil and administrative sanctions. Providing as it does for revision of the directive, especially in line with changes to Community legislation, this is a forward-looking compromise.
If you support the proposed compromise amendments, this directive can be adopted at the first reading, within the life of this Parliament. This will show how efficiently the three institutions can work.
It will send out a positive message on integration to the enlarged European Union. It will strengthen confidence in the internal market.
This is what is needed to meet the challenge of the Lisbon objectives. It is what is required to ensure that Europeâs economy, characterised by its innovation, can become the most competitive economy in the world.
Â Â  Thank you, MrsÂ Fourtou; if I am allowed, I will also add my personal congratulations, given that you spoke about an early conciliation.
Myself and the other two Vice-Presidents of the Conciliation Committees will therefore have less to do.
Â Â  . Mr President, please allow me to remind you that this is a codecision procedure and that this Parliament is a co-legislating body.
And perhaps you are not aware of this obvious fact because I am doubtful whether, in this case, the European Parliament has fulfilled its duties properly.
I will explain.
In December, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market voted for a text, which is not going to be approved today, but rather certain amendments are going to be approved which differ radically from what was voted for in that meeting of the committee.
Why was there this disparity?
Because what the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market voted for responds to the honourable Membersâ will, while the ultimate paternity of the text we are going to approve today corresponds to the Council.
Please do not imagine that what I am saying is in any way a criticism of the rapporteur; far from it.
MrsÂ Fourtou has done good work trying to reconcile positions, but in the end she has been faced with an inflexible position on the part of the Council, which has said âif you want the Directive to be approved, you must approve what we sayâ.
And since we are aware of the need to approve the Directive, what we have carried out â and Mrs Fourtou in particular â has been an exercise in responsibility.
But sometimes we should ask ourselves whether we also impose this exercise in responsibility on the Council.
There can be no doubt that this Directive is necessary, but nevertheless, it is doubtful whether the text approved will resolve the problems which have been raised.
I believe it is no mistake to say that the text approved is going to be the laughing stock of commentators and is going to cause many difficulties for the Member States when it comes to incorporating it into their internal law.
The Councilâs desire to prevent the European Commissionâs initiative from containing, for example, criminal law provisions, has created such confusion between civil sanctions, administrative procedures and administrative sanctions, that I cannot imagine what the Member States are going to do when it comes to applying it.
We are clearly going to approve this text, but with great scepticism.
At the same time, the Spanish Socialists at least are going to support certain amendments in order to reflect the fact that the Council, with the enforced cooperation of the European Parliament, has completely undermined what was originally a very good Commission initiative.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to very warmly thank the rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, for her excellent work.
I am sure that it was really not easy to reach agreement on this complex dossier not only between the groups but also with the Council and the Commission.
The text now before us, which is to be voted on tomorrow, is a good compromise that we should all accept.
We are all familiar with fake, cheap Rolex watches, Lacoste shirts, with the cheap imitation Levi Strauss jeans, Louis Vuitton bags, and many other products besides.
Music and films on CD and DVD are being pirated.
When you see everything available on the market, you might well think that product piracy is a trifling offence.
But it is not, ladies and gentlemen, far from it: counterfeiting and product piracy certainly are not minor offences.
They cause losses running to millions in Europe every year and they are consequently a threat to our economy and above all to jobs in Europe.
The object of the directive is to create uniform ground rules for combating product piracy.
On the eve of EU enlargement, it gives the right signal at the right time.
What is the directive intended to achieve?
It is of course intended to have a deterrent effect on product pirates and counterfeiters.
The directive provides a process-based framework here.
It does not actually introduce anything new, but it attempts to provide a new framework in terms of process, so that we can take action against product pirates across Europe in accordance with uniform rules.
What should the directive not be allowed to do?
It should not of course be allowed to criminalise or stigmatise young people who occasionally download some music from the Internet, but the directive has also made provision for this.
The criminal penalties originally included in the draft have been taken out again â also thanks to the pressure exerted by our rapporteur â and the directive stipulates that sanctions should only be applicable in a fair and proportionate manner.
There are provisions that go beyond these mechanisms in order to prevent young people from being criminalised.
The directive makes this clear and it will not come to that.
One point that MrsÂ Fourtou also mentioned, and with which I agree, is that the directive should not of course create any barriers to competition.
It is not acceptable for competitors to be kept out of the market by relying on alleged infringement of copyright.
A recital has been specially included in the directive to the effect that this should not be the aim of the directive.
The directive, including the amendments we are to vote on tomorrow and which I hope will be accepted, provides a good, fair compromise between the interests of all the parties involved, and I urge you to support the line taken by the rapporteur.
Â Â  Mr President, we all know that counterfeiting and product piracy has reached epidemic proportions.
The lack of harmonised enforcement rules means that counterfeiting is a low-risk business where for a low investment counterfeiting pirates are guaranteed enormous profits.
The UK's Anti-Counterfeiting Group has estimated that as many as 4Â 000 people lose their jobs as a result of this trade and that the GBP 1.75 billion lost in VAT alone could build four new hospitals a year.
Clothing and footwear companies suffer the greatest losses and consumers are the victims.
Their health and safety is put at risk with fake medicines, foodstuffs, toys coated in toxic lead, flammable children's clothing and fake alcohol containing high levels of methanol which has led not only to people being hospitalised but also, in one case in Scotland, to the death of a woman.
In my own region, north-west England, trading standards intellectual property groups' seizures of counterfeited pirate goods is on the increase.
Here is one example: this is a Manchester United football shirt, coveted by many youngsters.
It is a fake, but was sold to consumers on the high street at full price.
Far from a bargain.
This is a packet of Viagra, now available over the Internet.
50Â 000 such packets were seized at a house in Oldham.
They are imported from Thailand and distributed by a vast network of counterfeiters across the region.
There is also a more sinister side to this counterfeiting and piracy.
The Organised Crime Task Force in Northern Ireland has reported that nearly half of all organised crime groups are involved in IP crime.
Two thirds of these groups have links to paramilitary organisations, so the draft law we are voting on today should be seen in context.
It is not as ambitious, radical or draconian as many opponents would like to portray.
Nor is it a panacea for rights holders.
It is a first modest and cautious step in an EU-wide commitment to fight counterfeiting and piracy.
I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency for having agreed a text which is balanced and proportionate and whose actions are focused on tackling genuine and serious acts of infringement. consumers engaged in acts on a commercial scale have nothing to fear from this new EU law, as consumers acting in good faith are excluded from its scope.
A further safeguard is that commercial scale is defined as acts resulting in commercial and financial gain.
Moreover, action can only follow, as a result of a justified and proportionate request by the claimant, on the authority of a competent judge or court and only for intentional infringements on a commercial scale.
Contrary to the hysteria and misrepresentation spread by certain sections of the EU press, there is no question of dawn raids on teenagers in their homes.
The law has no criminal provisions.
It is restricted to civil and administrative remedies.
There are no double damages.
The directive reinforces judicial discretion and ensures that remedies are fair, equitable, proportionate and justified.
This is an enforcement directive and one that cannot write IP law.
Nor can it rewrite it or change e-Commerce law, in particular the responsibility of ISPs as defined in Articles 12 to 15 of the e-Commerce directive.
It cannot undermine the right to private copying as provided for in the Copyright directive, and in fact reinforces that right and protects the right of privacy.
The actions taken must guarantee compliance with data protection laws.
Article 23 provides for an assessment of the impact of the directive and Parliament will take that seriously.
The intention is to show that it is applied in a balanced and proportionate way and it should be stressed that the directive must not be used to abuse the right of legitimate competitors to enter the market place, in particular that for generic medicines.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her willingness to compromise, and the Irish presidency for its determination in forcing all parties to come to agreement.
We must today take the bold step of voting this law onto the statute book.
We must send a signal to counterfeiters and pirates that we are serious about closing the enforcement loopholes that they exploit.
We must give judges and courts in the enlarged EU the option of a range of enforcement tools.
It is time for the EU to get tough on counterfeiting and piracy.
It is time we stopped allowing counterfeiters a free ride at the expense of consumers, legitimate businesses, EU jobs and the EU's competitiveness.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank MrsÂ Fourtou, all the shadow rapporteurs, and also the Commission and the Council, for the structured, constructive cooperation that we have enjoyed over the past three months because, to my mind, the way in which a compromise has been achieved on this Directive is exceptional.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market took a rather different view, but, ultimately, I think that this compromise is a start, and indeed I hope that it is adopted.
We finally have recognition of intellectual property rights throughout Europe.
Although there were already various directives and laws in existence, for example regarding copyright, e-commerce, and software, there was no discussion â or at least insufficient â of enforcement, and as a result we in Europe find ourselves with a hotchpotch.
In that regard, it is good that we now have a kind of umbrella legislation for harmonised implementation, throughout the EU, of all the directives already in existence in the field of intellectual property rights.
As many have now said, counterfeiting and piracy within Europe are growing hand over fist.
We are seeing criminal organisations switching from drug trafficking to counterfeit goods because the chance of being caught is minimal and there is just as much money in it, if not more.
I think that we must call a halt to this.
I think that we need a harmonised approach, not only because criminal organisations are earning money illegally from these goods, but also in order to protect our economy, to achieve the Lisbon objectives, and ultimately, in particular, to protect consumers.
Why so?
We are not just talking about pirated CDs, as some people think, but about a broad spectrum of products that are being counterfeited.
I shall take toys as an example.
I have seen toys that contain cadmium.
Under the Directive on cadmium, this substance is prohibited in toys manufactured in Europe, but counterfeit products can still contain it, as they are illegally imported.
Medicinal products are another example.
There are examples of painkillers that contain talcum powder, and I think that this is unacceptable.
Much money is to be made from it but, in my opinion, consumers must be protected.
Even aircraft parts are being counterfeited, because there are large profits to be made from this.
It is a good thing that something is being done to put an end to this.
I was the one who, at the Green Paper stage, suggested including a reference to criminal law.
The reason for this is that we would not buy a stolen bicycle, because it has been stolen â our principles would not allow it â but we would like a counterfeit Breitling watch or other counterfeit product, because it is cheap.
If this is included in criminal law, and possession of a somewhat dearer counterfeit product becomes a punishable offence, there will no longer be a market for this, and there will no longer be an incentive for organisations to produce counterfeit goods.
It is a shame that certain strict rules have not been included, as my colleague MrÂ BerenguerÂ Fuster has already remarked, but I nevertheless welcome the compromise that has been reached.
A large number of ambiguities that lobbyists have been using up to now as arguments for voting against it have been removed from the proposal.
It is my opinion that this proposal is the beginning of the end of counterfeiting, and I hope that this will develop into a fully-fledged directive with fully-fledged means of monitoring compliance with it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to return to the different stakeholders in this directive and to the parties affected by it, to whom the Commissioner referred â consumers, industrialists and artists.
I do not want them all to be put on the same footing.
Firstly, as regards consumers, I regret that the Commission proposal has not been kept as it was. I regret it has been broadened rather too far, in that it holds consumers, as â shall we say â citizens, every bit as responsible for piracy as industrialists.
This is my first point on consumers.
Treating all European citizens as consumers in this way seems simplistic.
The second very important point is this: If this directive seeks to combat something that exists now, how will things turn out in the future?
Over the last few years, discussions concerning intellectual property and industrial property have highlighted the difficulties relating to borders.
Some say that intellectual property is the oil of the twenty-first century.
They may be right.
If intellectual property really is the oil of the twenty-first century, then of course it is important to talk about it. Nonetheless, the fact that this House has discussed such matters as the ability to patent living organisms or free software suggests how important the issue of borders will be in future.
Even if this problem has not yet arisen, it definitely will in future. Not everything can become industrial or intellectual property.
It is essential to raise this issue, but in a sensible manner.
Borders will certainly be an issue in the near future and thereafter even if they are not yet one today.
This leads me to speak on behalf of, or to speak for, those who use acronyms. I am of course talking about artists.
Are artists happy to be equated with industrialists?
As a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I do my best to listen to all those sectors. From what I have read and from what I understand, we would do well to take account of artistsâ views on intellectual property.
If we take account of the views of industrialists and consumers, should we not also consider artists, especially as they are always referred to in connection with the need to combat piracy?
As regards artists, authorsâ rights and intellectual property do not appear to be the only problem, and that â as music and music piracy are talked about so glibly â young artists and creative artists would like a different approach.
It may be necessary to defend these artists appropriately in this regard.
I do not believe that the House should allow all these various parties to be dealt with in the same way.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank MrsÂ Fourtou for her openness, which was exemplary.
Right from the start all the shadow rapporteurs were involved in the discussions and also in the trialogue.
That is something I have rarely experienced in this House.
And she did that long before her family circumstances were seized upon by the press.
I do not wish to comment on that now, I shall leave that to my colleague.
So much for the form.
There are problems, however, as has already been mentioned, particularly by the previous speaker.
That this directive is needed is something on which everyone â including Members of this House â agrees.
So do the players in the market, ranging from the telecommunications industry to consumer protection organisations, from the pharmaceutical industry to generic drug manufacturers, from artists to content producers.
We need a good directive.
I believe, though, that the compromise that we have negotiated has not entirely succeeded in addressing these many and diverse needs and concerns in a single directive.
There are two specific policy areas where reasonable agreement is important.
One is that we wish to limit the scope of the directive somewhat, to use for commercial purposes; the other area is that of patents.
There is certainly scope for debate about patents and also about common practice in Europe.
But it remains a fact that we do not have a European-level patent, and we do not want to use the implementing directive to pave the way for one through the back door.
This needs to be discussed very carefully; it is not such a simple matter.
I therefore urge you to give a large measure of support to these two amendments on patents and the scope of the directive.
I believe that this directive, this compromise, will then have been sufficiently improved for us to jointly adopt it as a compromise before the end of this parliamentary term.
Â Â  MrÂ President, contrary to MrÂ Imbeni, I do not want to praise the procedure followed because an âearly conciliationâ, as MrÂ Imbeni put it, is not a good procedure.
There is a good reason why the conciliation has its rules and its methods of proceeding: in order that a large number of MEPS, and Parliament itself, might be involved in the debate and in clarifying the uncertainties in the text that little by little takes shape.
This also means that it is not, then, four or five representatives from political groups that commandeer the procedure to achieve a compromise text a few days from the vote, with orders for MEPs and individual MEPs in the groups to toe the party line and not to touch what four or five MEPs have decided in this early conciliation.
I, contrary to MrÂ Imbeni, do not consider this to be a good procedure.
We then notice the implications in connection with this report.
It is not true that this compromise clearly limits the scope.
If this were the case, if this were also your intention, then you would, for example, be able to adopt Amendment NoÂ 101Â âÂ which we tabled with some other MembersÂ âÂ which explicitly limits the scope to intentional infringements for commercial gain.
The truth is that, even though criminal sanctions have been removed from the compromise, preventative measures remain that are very dangerous regardless of the outcome of the inquiry and the procedure.
The risk is adopting a system which thus makes it simple, and even partly up to private companies themselves, to search, confiscate goods and take preventive measures that risk putting the market in a situation of uncertainty and instability, where those who are most organised in having lawyers and legal consultationsÂ âÂ large corporationsÂ âÂ will best succeed in scaring and blackmailing small and very small businesses and also the end consumer.
It is not true that private copying is excluded from the scope of this compromise, because it is not excluded from preventive measures.
Why all this?
Why was it necessary to do all this and to devise this type of special emergency legislation?
Perhaps because the laws on intellectual property are laws that have been superseded to a large extent by digital technology.
The risk is that you, the very people who want intellectual property to be respected, in the same way as physical propertyÂ âÂ and this is also our concernÂ âÂ end up adopting laws that cannot be respected.
It is not with policing measures and private policing that the desired objective is achieved.
Such measures achieve the opposite, that is to say they delegitimise the power and value of the laws.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrsÂ Fourtou tackled a very complex issue.
In order to achieve framework legislation, I believe that a lot of work will have to be done in this Parliamentâs next parliamentary term.
I must congratulate my colleague MrsÂ Fourtou because I believe that she has put together the best of the possible compromises.
As with any compromise, however, I did unfortunately find some shortcomings in this report.
For example, even providing for potentially effective instruments to combat activities such as peer to peer or fair sharing, does not allow for the content provider to be fully protected, a situation which risks seriously compromising the reliability of any library.
The report is directed solely at crimes committed on a commercial scale and not more generally at infringements of intellectual property rights regardless of how or by whom they are committed.
A lot of attention clearly needs to be given to this point in order to find a point of balance.
This was a long task that lasted many months.
I do, however, remember that, from the outset, the objective in terms of protecting copyright was to combat and stop the phenomenon which, alongside counterfeiting and piracy, allows material protected by copyright to be used illegally to the detriment of the work of all content providers who are legitimately building up the value chain for the use of audiovisual products.
Particularly in future, we need to reflect further on the issue of the amount of private use that has increased exponentially thanks to the impetus provided by digital technology via broadband or any other advanced technological platform.
This will cause a significant and quantifiable commercial prejudice for all the content providers that base their operating model on the legal distribution of content, subject to contractual agreement with the parties entitled.
In this area, too, we need to consider the consequences of the new legislation on telecommunications.
In fact, not only does the wording of the proposal for a directive lose sight of some important aims, but it does not even constitute an effective deterrent against infringement because, in the long process in which the various proposals were made, the possibility disappeared of compensating for the two-foldprejudice in the form of loss of profit and loss suffered.
I confirm that, in the short term, to obtain an effective instrument, we need to give maximum support to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Fourtou, and that, in future, we must do a lot of work in this area.
I have two final remarks, one relating to Recital 22.
This states that prohibitory measures can be taken against intermediaries whose services are used by third parties only to infringe industrial property rights and not, as provided for in Articles 10 and 15, intellectual property rights.
Such a discrepancy between the text of the regulation and that of the Recital is not without importance, because it signifies an intention to support an interpretation whereby the term intellectual property contained in the text of the articles actually refers only to cases of intellectual property.
I therefore call on MrsÂ Fourtou to table an oral amendment in which âindustrial property rightâ is replaced by âintellectual property rightâ.
In this regard, I am thinking about Italian producers protected by geographical indications, who, in a situation of this type, could not obtain an injunction in other European countries against, for example, traders, carriers or advertisers who sell, transport and publicise counterfeit Italian products.
A final comment on Article 16.
I think that it is really important that the final phrase of Recital 23a is reintroduced as a final paragraph of this article.
In the absence of such regulatory specification, you might think in many countries that ifÂ âÂ after the person in possession of counterfeit goods in good faith has paid compensationÂ âÂ the judge waived the prohibition of the sale, and exclusion from the commercial chain, of these products, they would be authorised for any commercial use.
If we think, for example, about the whole medical field, this becomes totally unacceptable.
Â Â  Mr President, this morningâs debate creates great confusion, because the positions we are hearing are very different.
Some people tell us that Mrs Fourtou has achieved a wonderful compromise and others tell us that the big political groups have behaved like a kind of steamroller.
We have heard speeches from Members of the different political groups, including the big ones, expressing very different opinions.
Mrs Fourtou has tried to speed up the legislative process with what we could call ââ, but I believe we should assure Mr Imbeni that the procedure remains in place.
The problem is that the current procedure for approving legislation in the European Union, before the adoption of the European Constitution, is a truly elaborate, complicated and difficult procedure.
The recently signed Interinstitutional Agreement intends to eliminate these difficulties, but we know that that is going to be very difficult to achieve in practice.
And this is because if there is no clear identification of a legislative body â which I believe must be as unified as possible â we are condemned to continuing to adopt this type of legislation in which there are great contradictions.
Mr Berenguer Fuster said that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market reflected the views of the Members of Parliament.
I disagree with that, because the majority of reports approved â including by a great majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs â are usually then rectified in plenary.
In other words, as a result of its composition, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market does not currently reflect the will of the whole House.
Mrs Fourtou has tried to achieve an agreement which does not reflect the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
I do not know if she will achieve that agreement, because we do not yet know what the result of the vote will be.
We are talking about a report with many amendments, with enormous amendments, and which, theoretically, should not affect substantive law.
We are talking about a right relating to the application or implementation of the substantive content.
Mr Berenguer may be right about the confusion between civil, administrative and criminal enforcement procedures, but it appears that the attention has been to eliminate criminal enforcement or, at least, the possibility of criminal proceedings, and this is due to the European Union's lack of competences in the criminal field.
On the other hand, the scope of the directive has been extended â or it is intended to do so â so that it also includes the field of patents, which is a field in a degree of turmoil.
My impression, Mr President, is that this first reading is going to produce a text typical of these Community institutions: a kind of camel â that is, a horse designed by a committee â and that it will probably only be the beginning, but I believe it is preferable for us to adopt this proposal for a directive as quickly as possible, at least so that we may have a departure point to work from, firstly in the second reading and then, no doubt, when further legislative proposals are needed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her sustained efforts to achieve compromise amendments and, through the necessary contacts, to accomplish a compromise text.
We shall thus escape a second or third reading.
Reference has been made many times already to the adverse consequences of counterfeiting in all kinds of fields, and to the risks to public health and innovation.
The situation has worsened over the past three years, and all kinds of product are now found, even current consumer goods.
The extent of the phenomenon is becoming increasingly alarming, and organised crime is increasingly involved.
An initiative at European level is urgently needed, therefore, particularly as these phenomena are largely based in the new Member States.
The positive points in the report include the fact that the Directive is to apply to all infringements ofintellectual property rights.
Member States must also ensure that any serious infringements of intellectual property rights are classified as criminal offences punishable by criminal penalties.
It is well-known that creativity and innovation are the key trump cards in our European economy, and so they must enjoy sufficient protection.
I should like to appeal for support for the rapporteur in her fight, therefore.
Â Â  Mr President, representing, as I do, a constituency which is associated with such products as Scotch whisky, Highland shortbread and Borders knitwear, I am fully aware of and sensitive to the points many have made about the evils of counterfeiting and piracy, which extend much more widely than just to products of the kind I have mentioned.
I, therefore, strongly support the idea of introducing a directive of this kind.
However, I do not agree entirely with Mr Byrne when he claims that a balance has been struck.
That is not what we hear from the Generic Medicines Association, which is very fearful that extension of this set of remedies to patent law will damage its interests and thus the interests of the health services of Europe and beyond.
A balance has not been struck.
Patents must be excluded, and the point about the commercial scale must be extended to the whole of the directive, not just to some parts of it.
Finally, I say with great personal sympathy for MrsÂ Fourtou that this case shows up a gap in our rules about declaration of interests.
The issue of familial interests needs to be included.
I say that without any personal discourtesy.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to support my colleagues who have taken a very broad-ranging view of this important proposal.
This is not specifically about the digital world.
It is about the future of the European economy and about the ability of any manufacturer who has intellectual property rights, whether protected by patent, copyright or registered design, or indeed by any other form of ownership, over a creative work or design that they have genuinely originated, to be able to protect and sell their products in a legitimate way, reap the profits and create jobs within the European Union.
We are talking about the procedure and timescale because we all know that as from the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May there will be major concerns about the inability of intellectual property owners to enforce their rights across the enlarged European Union.
Many of my colleagues have given graphic examples of the problems associated with the counterfeiting on a large scale of physical goods that are being shipped into the European Union and essentially sold illegally, thereby depriving people of their legitimate livelihoods.
Let us put matters into perspective, since this is the nub of the issue and is why we have supported Mrs Fourtou in her work with the Council aimed at reaching a genuinely balanced compromise that will be in place on 1Â May, thereby ensuring we do not have to wait another six to nine months to deal with this problem.
We are in the real world now, and this is not some theoretical piece of legislation but something that will actually protect jobs in our constituencies.
As we move towards a world in which more and more goods are coming into the European Union from countries, such as China, that are new members of the World Trade Organisation and where intellectual property enforcement is at best very weak, we have to be able to protect ourselves in a legitimate and balanced way.
That is what is at stake, and those of you who are contemplating amending this proposal with the result that it is not in place on 1 May will have to answer to manufacturers in your constituency when a container load of counterfeit goods from China arrives through an accession country on their doorstep in June.
You will have to answer for the impact this will have on local jobs and local manufacturers.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is important that the common position clearly focuses on commercial activity and the work of professional criminals.
Copying on a small-scale for personal use will then be left alone.
We have no need or means to interfere when it is a matter of copying by private citizens.
In the information society the invasion of peopleâs privacy is a most dangerous and mostly ignored problem.
The counterfeiting of food products has risen by 75% and that of CDs by 15 000%, which is almost half of all musical recordings.
Approximately 20 000 jobs are lost each year.
It is important, however, that a distinction is made between conscious and unconscious infringement of copyright.
This is also important because it safeguards product development in small companies by guaranteeing some sort of protection in the sea of patent legislation.
I am happy that there will therefore no longer be interference in criminal law, an area which lies within the competence of the Member States.
The different practices and laws that exist in the Member States would make it an especially awkward task.
After all, the same package deals with patents and copyright.
Piracy, the result of commercial crime, takes away jobs.
Nevertheless, we should not interfere in the private lives of the innocent.
Let us make additional improvements to the next directive.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Directive on enforcement that we are discussing today is completely superfluous.
After all, there is already a directive in force regarding the harmonisation of copyright, and, besides, there is the Directive on e-commerce, which regulates, among other things, the rights and obligations of service providers.
This new Directive threatens to cause disruption on account of the obligation to monitor what users are doing.
The present compromise explicitly stipulates that previous directives remain fully in force, therefore, and that is the way it should be: why else do we make legislation here?
We do not want a US-style situation in which legislation is made according to the misconceptions of the day.
This new Directive on enforcement officially declares people making illegal copies to be thieves, but everyone has known for a long time that pirating of software, CDs and DVDs is a punishable offence.
We certainly do not need a new directive to do this, and especially not one that fails to define the scope of intellectual property rights.
We in Europe have different criminal justice systems with different penalties, and we cannot harmonise legal systems with a single directive, particularly without a proper debate in this Parliament.
I can say that I am pleased that the compromise now restricts the scope of the directive to piracy for commercial purposes, as copying for personal use must continue to be permitted.
Nevertheless, I shall be voting against the Directive.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the House finds itself today face to face with a problem of political ethics.
We are voting on a very important report, one that has a wide-ranging impact on economic affairs and on the citizens of Europe.
How are we going to explain to the citizens of Europe that Parliamentâs rapporteur, the person most directly involved with this dossier, happens to be married to MrÂ Fourtou, the chairman of Vivendi Universal?
Let there be no confusion. I certainly recognise that every man and woman has the fundamental right to hold political office.
MrsÂ Kinnock is a Member of the European Parliament but she does not get involved with subjects relating to the portfolio held by her husband, CommissionerÂ Kinnock. MrÂ Rovsing, a member of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has interests in the media, but he refrains from voting on media issues.
The credibility of the European Parliament is at stake here.
I appeal to the President of Parliament and to the Chairmen of the political groups to find a solution to this problem by noon. Parliamentâs honour is at stake.
Any suspicion of personal interest must be eliminated if the citizens of Europe are to continue to trust the European institutions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank my colleague MrsÂ Fortou for the work she has carried out, work that was carried out with great endurance and great determination, precisely because the fight against counterfeiting and piracy must be one of the European Unionâs priorities.
In fact, creativity, which is one of the main factors of competitiveness in our economic system, is being prevented by counterfeiters because they are affecting the industrial and intellectual property rights.
These rights ensure that creativity is adequately rewarded.
Often, counterfeiting and piracy also end up affecting consumers, who are forced to purchase goods of a quality inferior to the original.
The damage that they cause not only affects the individual holder of the right but the whole of society.
The directive on the application of industrial and intellectual property rights is therefore an important instrument in combating the phenomenon and must be quickly adopted before the accession of the new countries, where counterfeiting and piracy are particularly widespread.
The text negotiated with the Council, which Parliament should widely agree to, is a balanced compromise that should enable the directive to be adopted in just one reading.
The current European and national legal framework on industrial and intellectual property is being respected.
The conditions to effectively protect it and to more actively combat illegal trade are being created.
The compromise rightly provides for the most important provisions of the directive to apply only to commercial practices.
We cannot, indeed, plan to punish those who download music from the Internet just for personal use.
A request for information from the alleged counterfeiter by the person declaring that a product is counterfeit must be justified and proportionate and should only be made by order of the judicial authorities.
Furthermore, the directive does not influence the rules on confidential information and the treatment of personal data or the right not to testify against oneself.
It specifies the administrative and civil sanctions that, directly affecting any illegal economic activity, have direct consequences on prohibiting counterfeiting.
These sanctions should indeed be dissuasive but should also be gradual and proportionate to the crime committed.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly, and like other Members, I would like to congratulate Mrs Fourtou on her excellent work and also express my regret at the speech by Mr Turmes, who should not really worry about intellectual property since he has only come to criticise Mrs Fourtou and her relatives and has not been able to remain in this Chamber for the whole debate.
I believe that the fact that certain Members of this House have family relatives â and I would be grateful if Mr Turmes would remain in the House â does not prevent them from acting in it, particularly since what we are discussing, this Directive in the field of enforcing intellectual property rights, does not exclusively affect right holders, but all consumers.
It is also we consumers who have to ensure that the protection of intellectual property rights is guaranteed, because we want the products we buy to be original and authentic and we do not want to be deceived by people who violate intellectual property rights.
I therefore believe that to try to use Mrs Fourtouâs relatives to discredit her work is not worthy of a Member of this House.
There are two aspects which have been fully debated this morning.
One of them relates to commercial purposes.
It is true that we have modified the Commission's proposal, which was restricted to acts carried out for commercial purposes.
We need to go a little further; I believe that the rapporteurâs proposal and the compromise amendments are balanced, and that we had to ensure that anybody carrying out any act against industrial or intellectual property could be prosecuted, whether that act was for commercial purposes or not.
In reply to Mr Fiori, who spoke before me, the inclusion of industrial property is important, and in the case of Spain in particular, since the Spanish legislation in the field of trademarks and patents is considered industrial property rather than intellectual property.
The definition has therefore been extended to both.
With regard to the procedure, mentioned by Mr Cappato and Mr Berenguer, what we intended is something very important: to obtain a directive which could enter into force before 1 May 2004.
It is therefore true that Mrs Fourtou has had to make certain efforts to reach agreement and that the proposal we are voting on today in this Parliament is not exactly the same as the one voted for in committee.
Nevertheless, many of the aspects which were approved in the committee are included in what we are voting on today, apart from the two points I have referred to: commercial purposes and patents.
There are many other aspects that we have revised from the Commission's initial proposal, such as, for example, the reduction of procedures and costs for the applicant, in order to speed up and guarantee respect for their intellectual property rights; the simplification of the guarantees to be provided by the applicant in the event of defending their industrial or intellectual property rights; the establishment of compensation in the event of an infringement of industrial or intellectual property and, finally, considerations relating to the destruction of objects used for counterfeiting or the counterfeit objects themselves.
These are other aspects of the Commission's proposal that we have modified and which, as the Commission has said, make this directive sufficiently balanced for the times we are living in.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the third report (A5-0118/2004) by Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Commission communication on simplifying and improving the regulatory environment [COM(2001) 726 â C5-0108/2002 â 2002/2052(COS)].
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission's communication of June 2002 on simplifying and improving the regulatory environment sets out the comprehensive action plan on which the Commission work on better regulation has been progressing over the last 18 months.
Improving the regulatory environment to obtain concrete benefits for operators and citizens is a joint responsibility of the European institutions and the Member States.
When launching its action plan 'Simplifying and improving the regulatory environment', the Commission therefore also called on the other institutions and the Member States to contribute to the achievement of the common objectives.
To the great satisfaction of the Commission, the common objectives and joint responsibility for better regulation were fully recognised by the other institutions and in December 2003 the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission signed the interinstitutional agreement on 'Better Lawmaking'.
The interinstitutional agreement regulates and clarifies all the interinstitutional aspects of the work on better regulation.
Before I turn to the specific issues raised by the present draft resolution, allow me to recall just two of the key initiatives of the Commission's action plan, which have also been integrated into the interinstitutional agreement.
First, the Commission is implementing a framework for integrated impact assessment.
2004 will be the second transitional year during which this framework will be further consolidated and improved, while keeping a balanced assessment of economic, social and environmental impacts.
Secondly, the action plan launched an ambitious effort to update and simplify the Community acquis, for which the Commission proposed a rolling programme in February 2003.
This programme will be implemented in respect of the legislative procedures and the interinstitutional agreement.
The Commission welcomes the continued interest of the European Parliament in better regulation.
The report prepared by the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, focuses on the interinstitutional agreement on 'Better Lawmaking' and, in particular, on the use of the alternative instruments of co-regulation and self-regulation.
The interinstitutional agreement establishes a framework for 'soft law' instruments that should facilitate their future use while fully safeguarding the competences of all Community institutions.
In fact, the three institutions have, for the first time, established a common definition of co-regulation and self-regulation.
Moreover, the institutions have agreed on general limits and conditions to the use of such instruments, defining the role of each institution in the process and ensuring that the prerogatives of the legislative authority are respected.
The Commission considers that the resolution is partly incoherent with the interinstitutional agreement and partly goes beyond the agreement.
The Commission could accept some of the orientations, but only within the limits of the provisions already established in the interinstitutional agreement.
Specifically, the Commission considers that paragraphs 5, 7, 8 and 9 of the draft resolution deviate from the word and spirit of the interinstitutional agreement and the limits and conditions laid down therein concerning co-regulation and self-regulation.
The Commission considers that at this stage the real challenge is the full and proper implementation of the broad range of commitments set out in the IIA.
It would not be appropriate now to go beyond what was endorsed by all three institutions only a few months ago.
Rather than reopening the questions that have been settled by the interinstitutional agreement, the Commission invites the other institutions to implement the commitments made.
For example, the interinstitutional agreement on 'Better Lawmaking' acknowledges the importance of simplifying Community legislation and commits Parliament and the Council, within six months of its entry into force, to modify their working methods by introducing, for instance, ad hoc structures with the specific task of simplifying legislation.
These measures should, of course, fully respect existing Treaty provisions.
Â Â  . Mr President, despite its brevity â it only has ten paragraphs of provisions and many recitals â my third report on simplifying and improving the regulatory environment is the result of reading many texts of at least ten years old.
The Commission believes that this third report goes further than what was achieved in the interinstitutional agreement.
My report is not aimed against the interinstitutional agreement, but rather it intends to strengthen it.
However, by means of the long discussion between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on the issue of improving the negotiation of Community legislation, myself and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which approved the report unanimously, wish to express our concern at a tendency which I would describe as technocratic in the legislative field.
The legislative process is a political one, it is a process of political decision-making.
It is true that as far as possible we must prevent the drafting of legislation that is irrational, complicated and which can be improved on.
But the emphasis on exclusively technical considerations or on the economic weight of a certain legislative measure may not correspond to the need to adopt a piece of legislation.
In other words, one of this European Union's faults is âover-technificationâ.
The European institutions have been criticised for being bureaucratic.
I do not like the word âbureaucraticâ.
I would say that what we have in the European institutions is a tendency to technify everything.
And as a result of this technification we distance ourselves from the citizens thereby leading to their rejecting our form of adopting decisions.
On approving the interinstitutional agreement, I and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market stress the danger of creating a decision-making process which is entirely out of line with the will of the citizens.
And the only means â however imperfect â the citizens currently have to express their point of view on the Community's contribution is the European Parliament elections.
If, for example, the European Parliament cannot oppose the technocratic procedures for adopting decisions by means of small groups in the form of self-regulation or co-regulation, I do not know what role it can play.
Mr President, I would like to reassure the Commission by guaranteeing that I, and this Parliament as well I believe, which I imagine will adopt my report without too many difficulties, do not intend to undermine the progress which has been made in terms of simplifying Community legislation, but rather propose strengthening the political elements of the process of adopting legislation, pointing out that legislative delegations must always be subject to the popular will, by means of an institution with full legislative competence.
As we know, the great difficulty is that the current Community legislation is the result of the accumulation of a series of international treaties which have continued to evolve and there will be no solution until a European Constitution clearly defining legislative powers is adopted.
Once clearly defined legislative powers exist, the legislative power will be able to delegate, will be able to transfer duties to technical bodies; but these technical bodies must never replace the popular will expressed by means of direct elections to a legislative institution â the European Parliament, Parliament and the Council, whatever you want to call it â which wishes to adopt those decisions.
I will therefore end by assuring the Commission that our intention is not to undermine the interinstitutional agreement but rather to strengthen it, introducing the necessary political elements into it so that our citizens believe in the European construction we are carrying out.
Â Â  Mr President, I am here today speaking on behalf of all my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in particular my colleague, Mr Doorn, who has been the shadow rapporteur for the three successive reports that our hardworking rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, has produced.
In a way this is the end of the first phase of our cycle of work and, as the Commissioner said, we are now moving on to looking at further details of how to make the interinstitutional agreement work effectively.
It is perhaps in that context we have the opportunity to make one or two remarks, rather than the specific points contained in this relatively short report.
We have not really had enough debate in this Chamber about the whole issue of our role in better lawmaking or improving and simplifying the regulatory climate, as the Commission reminded us.
I would like to reflect on what my colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, said on the way in which we adopt decisions and the way in which regulation is developed and promoted within the European institutions.
I agree with him that our citizens are genuinely concerned by the process.
That is why they want us to do the job better and that is why those who are directly implicated in the process â whether consumers, citizens, or businesses, large and small â want to feel that they have been consulted and they have had their say at the right stage in the process.
One of the crucial elements of doing the job better is improved development of our legislative strategies and early consultation in the process.
One of the most important features of the Commission's action plan is that it is essentially a two-step process.
Before we move into the detail of the extended impact assessment there is also a stage for considering the whole strategy of the legislation, its objectives, a clear definition of those objectives, and the tools by which those objectives would be achieved.
This might possibly be regulation, but there is no reason at that stage why some form of self- or co-regulation should not be considered as a proper option.
I know that my colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, is concerned about the way that self- and co-regulation develops, but I would argue that, if we consider that as a genuine alternative at the beginning of the process and see how it is integrated and that safeguards are built in and check it against the alternative of heavyweight and intrusive legislation, this can only be to the benefit of simplifying and improving the regulatory climate.
After all, we are looking for effective and efficient legislation.
We are looking at outcomes.
That is what we have just been discussing in connection with enforcement because the problem is that, however much we legislate at European level, if we cannot have consistent enforcement, the cost of the legislation falls on people who already have the systems in place and are doing the job.
It does not squeeze out those who are breaking the law.
This works to the disadvantage of consumers â an issue that I know is at the core of your remit, Mr Byrne.
We should support this report, but this is only just the beginning of the process of working together with all the institutions to deliver what our citizens want, which is effective and efficient regulation or alternatives to regulation.
Â Â  Mr President, we know that our honourable friend, Mr Medina Ortega, has tremendous experience in this matter and, with his proposals to date, has helped a great deal with the job of simplifying and modernising the legislative work of the Community.
We have the interinstitutional agreement which the Commissioner talked about.
However, I should like to ask this question: despite what we have today, can we say that we have a simple action plan with a specific hierarchy of objectives, with a specific timetable, with a proposal for specific measures for each objective and with a clearly defined procedure for measuring objectives?
What interests us is to see quantifiable results in the wake of the interinstitutional agreement.
With reference to the question, I ask you: are we in fact satisfied with the improvement so far in the quality of the regulatory environment?
I do not think that we should reply in the affirmative because pioneering measures are missing.
In all events, and here I absolutely agree with MrÂ Medina, improving the regulatory environment means restricting the role of bureaucracy, for which the Commission is responsible.
It also means rejecting the perception that efficiency or improvement go hand in glove with a reduction in democratic control.
On these two issues, unfortunately, the Commission has not so far taken a clear stand.
Having said that, I should like to emphasise that we, the European Parliament, have a huge problem.
Here we have to combine the cultures of 15 â and soon 25 â states and, of course, the freedom of proposal from all sides.
We face the phenomenon of an exponential rise in the number of amendments and how they can be coordinated and how they can result in a homogenous and clear text, no one knows.
We therefore also have an endogenous problem which we need to address, and here I am of the opinion that, to date, we have been lacking clear-cut services to take care of the technical aspects of legislation and help developments.
Nonetheless, the major problem remains the fourth stage in the overall regulatory framework, which is implementation.
Unfortunately, even today, after so many reports on the implementation of law, a huge delay can be seen in control by the Commission of the method of implementation and the judicial and administrative authorities do not have assimilation mechanisms and have not assimilated Community law.
So this problem needs to be addressed if we want proper implementation of Community law.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I will take as a starting point the final words of the rapporteur, MrÂ Medina Ortega, who quite rightly said that the proposal under discussion and the whole of his report is not against the Commission but, if anything, seeks to harmoniseÂ âÂ and I believe that, on this occasion, this term is more apposite than ever beforeÂ âÂ and regulate better law-making.
As the coordinator of the parliamentary committee that reached an agreement on simplification of legislation (this interinstitutional agreement), I must say something about the importance of the debate that went on in my committee, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the report by MrÂ Medina Ortega.
This debate began before we worked on the interinstitutional agreement and continued afterwards.
The report which we are talking about was, therefore, a prerequisite for, and a consequence of, this interinstitutional agreement, which, had it been followedÂ âÂ please confirm this to me, MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemenÂ âÂ by the European Constitution, we would, I believe, have had a parliamentary term characterised by this strong connection and this desire to take into account the three institutions (Commission, Council and Parliament) around which Europe really revolves: the European Community.
I agree that the interinstitutional agreement is of course not everything: an agreement that prepares for a completely different role for Parliament, it is an agreement that must move forward.
This is why, quite rightly, the rapporteur states that, in improving community legislation, it is necessary to go beyond the interinstitutional agreement.
The interinstitutional agreement is, therefore, a condition, above all of the right to be consulted automaticallyÂ âÂ as MrÂ Medina Ortega rightly states in his reportÂ âÂ in the areas of coregulation and self-regulation, that is to say a condition of Parliamentâs right to be immediately informed by the Commission and to once and for all suspend the application of any voluntary agreement that it has not accepted.
I believe that these are the two points that give shape to this report and on which there could be a further agreement in the next parliamentary term, in order to lay the foundations for a balanced relationship between the three institutions that represent Europe.
â The debate is closed.The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following four oral questions to the Commission on achieving the correct implementation of the EC/Israel Association Agreement:
- O-0019/2004 â B5-0067/2004 by MrÂ Lagendijk on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance;
- O-0021/2004 â B5-0068/2004 by MrsÂ Morgantini on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left;
- O-0024/2004 â B5-0069/2004 by MrÂ Watson on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party;
- O-0025/2004 â B5-0070/2004 by MrÂ Sakellariou on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to move that the sitting be suspended until the Commission does us the honour of joining us in the Chamber.
Â Â  MrÂ Sakellariou, I would prefer you not to make such a request.
MrÂ Liikanen cannot help it if his flight has landed late.
He arrived at the airport on time, but his plane was delayed because of weather conditions, so it may be another ten minutes before he arrives.
We must, however, avoid a situation in which instead of starting at 12 noon as scheduled, voting does not start until 12.15 or even 12.20.
You are well aware that it is very irritating for honourable Members if voting starts late.
I would suggest that we should give the floor to the first authors of the questions, as they are familiar with the subject, before the Commissioner joins us, and the Commissioner also knows what they wish to say.
We can then continue once the Commissioner is with us, and he will be in a position to answer immediately.
That is my suggestion.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to support the proposal not to begin the debate until the Commission is present.
Certainly, some of us have written our speeches, but what we talk about will, however, also depend upon the Commission.
Otherwise, we should not of course have needed to ask the Commission to come and report on anything at all.
I would prefer that the first speakers respond to the Commissionâs contribution, which will form the background to my own response too.
I do not think that we can go ahead with the debate.
We must wait for ten minutes.
Anything else would be absurd.
Â Â  We have a request then, an official request.
Do you wish to pursue your request, MrÂ Sakellariou?
We have a speaker in favour of that request.
So what I wish to ask now is whether anyone is opposed to our suspending the sitting, anyone who is in favour of our continuing this debate even if the Commissioner may not arrive for five or ten minutes?
Does anyone wish to speak against the request?
It seems not.
We need to vote on this then: could I please have a show of hands from those supporting MrÂ Sakellariou's request that we should suspend the sitting for ten minutes until the Commissioner arrives?
Those against please?
Are there any abstentions?
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and Parliament have been squabbling for years over products from the territories occupied by Israel, which are wrongly being given the same preferential treatment as products from Israel itself.
Israel does not want to make this distinction, but the European Union does.
Politics lies at the heart of the debate.
The European Union considers the occupation of the territories in question illegal, and that is why we have made such a problem of this matter.
However, the debate, which is in essence political, risks being overrun by scores of practical and legal aspects.
The problem, and the reason I am asking these questions now, is that the Commission and the Council, tired of years of squabbling, are now threatening to go along with current practice.
This would legitimise an illegal practice, and Member States would lose the legal basis for continuing to make a distinction between products from Israel and those from the Occupied Territories.
Hence, I have two questions for the Commission.
The first is: what steps does the Commission intend to take by November of this year, when a new Commission takes office, to put an end to the current practice, and when, precisely?
The second is: can the Commissioner guarantee that every decision he takes that could have an impact on the spirit, the letter or the practice of the Association Agreement will first be submitted to this Parliament for its opinion?
Â Â  â Mr President, yesterday, on International Womenâs Day, a group of Palestinian women were received here, at the initiative of my group.
They spoke to us of their weariness and of their daily struggle to survive in the refugee camps. They spoke of their courage and of their undying and dignified longing for peace.
In particular, they spoke of their expectations of the European Union.
As you will be aware, the last few days have been particularly murderous in the Gaza Strip. Fourteen Palestinians, three of them children, have been killed; dozens have been wounded, including Israeli soldiers, as if the announced withdrawal from the zone had to be preceded by acts of destruction with increasingly irreparable consequences.
Tomorrow, you are invited to meet Israeli pacifists. These so-called refuseniks have also courageously refused to participate in the occupation at the heart of the spiral of murder in which the Palestinian and the Israeli people are caught up.
Clearly, we are today considering in particular Israelâs violation of the rules of origin within the framework of the association agreement.
It is impossible, however, not to consider at the same time all those other blatant violations committed on a daily basis in the Palestinian occupied territories. These violations are also a complete betrayal of the spirit of partnership enshrined in the agreement signed.
Consequently, for those who want to believe in a just peace, the debates on the rights or wrongs of the application of this agreement are indicative of what has unfortunately been seen as a reprehensible excess of caution on the part of the European Union.
One is obliged to recognise that Israel treats with derision Europeâs reprimands relating to violations of ArticleÂ 2 on the respect of fundamental rights, as well as those concerning the rules of origin.
Let us consider the rules of origin.
Since 1976, Israel has determined the origin of the products it exports without distinguishing between products originating within its territory and those originating in the territories occupied since 1967. In other words, there is no distinction between its products and those of its settlements.
In this way, Israel has continually issued certificates of origin to products that are not eligible for preferential treatment according to Community law.
Had it been committed by any other country, such a violation would doubtless have lead to stringent retaliatory measures.
Due to Israelâs customs practices, however, it has thus far been impossible for Member States to prevent these preferential imports or to impose taxes.
Neither did the Commission, at first, propose adequate measures to combat these practices.
Subsequently, the Commission announced that it was going to get down to the task of coordinating the ineffective actions of the Member States.
Then the Commission spelt out its position, a clear and lawful position. On 10Â MayÂ 2001, Commissioner Patten stated in the House that, âpreferential access to the Community market for exports from the Israeli settlements, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip constitutes a violation of the EC-Israel trade agreementsâ.
The measures taken, however, have failed to put an end to this unlawful practice.
Furthermore, the ongoing construction of that shameful wall can only exacerbate the situation. Olive and fruit trees have been uprooted before the villagersâ very eyes.
Agricultural land has been rendered inaccessible to thousands of local inhabitants. Will this new illegal annexation lead to still more exports of products from these areas?
Last November, the European Union stressed before the EU-Israel Association Council the importance of resolving the problem of the rules of origin before any amendment of the protocol on these same rules.
The Commission indicated that it has pursued these discussions with Israel since then. Nevertheless, the question still remains.
I would like to ask you again, Commissioner, whether the Commission will accept a solution that does not require Israel to stop issuing certificates of origin to products from its settlements within the framework of the association agreement. Will the Commission use the legal instruments available to it?
The possibility of amending the agreement is now being put forward.
If we accept this principle, however, and if Israel continues to violate the agreement, the European Union could forfeit all its rights to suspend the application of any part of this agreement in order to stop the violation. This would be unacceptable.
It would amount to deliberately flouting international law. It would mean recognising Israel as the occupying power in the Palestinian Territories and recognising Israelâs practice of annexing and colonising them.
Be that as it may, I would like to make it clear, once again, that it is absolutely essential to consult Parliament before the agreement is amended in any way.
Will the Commission undertake to do so?
My conclusion is a general one. The European Union cannot continue to be complicit in the continuing occupation of the Palestinian Territories by Mr Sharonâs government, in the theft of the produce of the land, in the confiscation of profits and in the denial to the people of the means of their existence and their very survival.
The 1995 agreement followed closely on the heels of the Oslo process. It was designed to be a contribution to the peace process.
The situation today is totally different.
What type of cooperation can we be talking about?
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, what we are discussing here is the 1995 Association Agreement.
I have absolutely no objections to this agreement in itself.
It contains fundamental standards and values that demonstrate respect and, in itself, we can support Israel as a democracy.
That is not where the problem lies.
What I find incomprehensible, however, and the reason I have asked these questions, is that the European Union has been allowing Israel to violate the rules of origin in the agreement for years.
These rules of origin â this is childâs play for you, of course â state that Israel is not permitted to sell products from the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories as though they originated from Israel itself; otherwise, the products from the illegal settlements would wrongfully benefit from favourable import duties in Europe.
As MrÂ Lagendijk said, this is a political matter.
I also know that the European Commission addressed Israel in this matter and, in reply, was told of Israelâs adamantine position that it considers the settlements to be Israeli territory.
European governments are not responding, and are thus acquiescing in the violation of the agreement that they themselves adopted.
This makes us jointly responsible for the continuation of the policy of colonisation, one of the greatest obstacles to peace.
This is the crux of the matter, in my opinion.
We must not share responsibility for this.
Under the EC Treaty, the Community Customs Code and the Association Agreement, Member States are obliged to refuse to give preferential treatment to the import of products from the settlements.
As the Commission and as guardian of the treaties, you must monitor Member Statesâ compliance with these obligations.
These problems must be solved, and without delay, and so I ask the Commissioner whether he now genuinely intends to put an end to these matters and come up with a genuine legislative solution, so that a uniform verification procedure can be followed in the Member States.
The Member Statesâ customs authorities will then be able to collect ordinary import duties for products from settlements without the importers being able to contest this.
This would seem to me an extremely neat solution: not for or against Israel; not for or against the Palestinians.
The issue is merely that we do not want to be jointly responsible for the problem of settlements, and I ask, therefore, that you submit any solutions to Parliament.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, the problem of giving preferential treatment to exports from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has now been with us for nearly 30 years and has been the subject of regular oral and written questions and debates in the European Parliament.
Most recently, in a debate in November 2003 we reaffirmed that a solution finally needed to be found in order to bring Israel's repeated violations of international law to an end.
Because of its practice of labelling products from the occupied territories as âMade in Israelâ, Israel is not only violating the provisions on the territorial scope of the agreement, notably ArticleÂ 83, the rules on origin and the provisions on cooperation and mutual assistance between administrative authorities in customs matters, but in doing so it is continuing to display its total contempt for international agreements and for international law.
The problem is, however, now more pressing than ever before.
The European Union is planning to include Israel in the preferential treatment system of pan-European accumulation, which in this case means making corresponding changes to the EC-Israel Association Agreement.
If that were to happen without the illegal application of the rules on origin for settlement products being corrected, it would imply acceptance of such illegal application.
The European Union would accordingly be permanently depriving itself of the right finally to insist on legal application of the rules for preferential treatment of exports.
The preferential treatment of export products from the occupied territories is, however, not only illegal and in breach of international law, it also means that the Member States continue to be faced with the thorny problem of controls and of achieving some degree of uniform treatment.
Although the Commission has attempted to find a remedy, the problem has so far not been solved at all.
The Commission has quite rightly informed the Israeli authorities that measures must be taken promptly to halt this illegal practice.
Before there can be any further talk about amending the EC-Israel Association Agreement, I would like to call upon the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to resolve this situation before the end of its term of office.
This is a very important issue, Commissioner, because it needs to go hand in hand with the amendment of the Association Agreement.
The Commission should consult Parliament on this and thus prevent a situation arising, through inaction and a lack of political will, in which illegality is legalised.
Â Â  . Mr President, under the terms of the EU-Israel Association Agreement that agreement applies solely to the territory of the State of Israel.
Therefore, products originating from Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem or the Golan Heights are not entitled to preferential tariff treatment upon entry into the EU, and any claims of preferential origin made by Israel for such products cannot be accepted by the Community's customs authorities.
The Commission has explained in detail, for example in replies to various oral questions in May and November 2003, its position on this issue and the actions it has taken.
The EU is taking every opportunity to find a solution to the problem of product imports from the Israeli settlements in question.
Exploratory talks aimed at finding possible solutions have recently been held between the Commission and Israel, but these discussions have yet to lead to a formal proposal by Israel and the Commission therefore has yet to take a position.
However, the Commission will not accept any solution that would mean preferential tariff treatment being granted for products originating from the Israeli settlements and imported under Israeli rules of preferential origin.
As regards the involvement of the European Parliament, I can confirm that the Commission will act in full respect of the framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue that we are discussing in connection with this agreement between the European Community and Israel is more than just a technical one.
It is not just about the legal arguments that have been exchanged with the authors of the four questions during this debate; what is really important is the political issue of whether we wish to promote peace at this point or not.
It goes without saying that the occupation of the occupied territories since 1967 is illegal â that is the position of the United Nations.
Resolution No 242 says that Israel should withdraw to its pre-1967 borders.
This debate has now been going on for over 30 years.
During that time, settlements have been built, and the signing of the Oslo Peace Accord has brought the two sides closer together.
So the question now is this: what will most assist the peace process?
For example, would immediate withdrawal from the occupied territories really serve the cause of peace?
Everyone â including the European Union and the United States â now knows that we need to include steps towards that peace in the road map.
Simple withdrawal tomorrow would not serve the peace process and would lead to fresh conflicts.
Any signal that we as the European Union give at this point is crucial.
We need to remember this: the agreement was concluded in 1975, the Oslo Peace Accord was signed in 1993, and from that moment on the European Union has supported the independence of the Palestinian Autonomy Authority, it has given it over EUR 2 billion and has done very good work.
In Oslo both partners agreed that both areas, the different zones, including the Autonomy Authority, were parties to trade with the European Union.
So regardless of whether the settlement policy is right or wrong, the area in which the settlements are located is an EU partner, either through the agreement with the Palestinian Autonomy Authority or through the EC-Israel Association Agreement.
The comments made by the honourable Member from the political left who spoke first are therefore spurious.
No one on the Palestinian side is exploited through the Association Agreement.
Quite the opposite: if we were to suspend it overnight, the Palestinians who work there would be the first to suffer again.
It is not just settlers who manufacture products there; a good many Palestinian jobs also depend on it.
I think that the Commission's position is very well balanced in making it clear to Israel that this does not imply any recognition of the occupied territories, but that solutions still need to be found, so that an agreement of this kind is made to work and so that we do not pour oil on the fire again.
I welcome the fact that Israel is once again handing over to the Palestinians the tax and customs due to them, and we in the European Union should not give the wrong signal and suspend the agreement as some people have suggested.
That would certainly not help the peace process.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Israeli Government circles are continuing to fuel a political campaign aimed at representing the position of the European Union and the institutions as unbalanced and, therefore, geared to sympathising with, and supporting, the rights of the Palestinian people rather than those of the Israelis.
All this is wrong, and it is a fact that Israel has occupied Palestinian territory since 1967 and that the European institutions, including this Parliament, have repeatedly called on the State of Israel to respect the rules of international law.
The European institutionsâ basic preference was for a constructive partnership, with the hope of attaining the best results by going along this road.
As long as there are forces such as those that created the Geneva agreements, we must continue to foster this hope and invest politically in this future possibility.
In fact, since 1995 the EU-Israel partnership has developed within the framework of an association agreement that provides, amongst other things, for preferential treatment of Israeli products on the European market.
Since 1976 Israel has, however, determined the origin of its products without making any distinction between those from its territory and those from the territories occupied in constant and repeated violation of Community law, international law and the Geneva Convention.
Today we are at a critical point in this affair.
In fact, the protocol on the rules of origin is also being modified to allow for, on the one hand, pan-European enlargement and, on the other hand, for an Israeli-Jordanian trade system.
Is it possible, however, to imagine this enlargement without having resolved the serious dispute with Israel?
In 2000, the Council reaffirmed the need to respect international law under the Fourth Geneva Convention in trade relations with Israel.
In 2001, Commissioner Patten described the continued exports from the settlements on a preferential basis as violations.
In 2003, the Council decided to reach a bilateral agreement with Israel.
At this point, Commissioner, I wanted to ask you three questions, but given your reply, I will ask two.
The first is that it seems to me that you said that the Commission cannot accept any agreement that does not provide for this illegal practice to stop; yet, how does the Commission intend to tackle this debate with the Council, given that it seems that some Member States are not of the same opinion?
Finally, is the Commission prepared to consult Parliament before taking any decisions in this area?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, only a small proportion of Israeli exports come from the settlements. The figure is definitely under 5%.
All the attention paid to this issue reflects the strong anti-Israeli sentiments of certain speakers. It is important to set the debate in context and bear in mind that the Oslo accords provide for unified customs arrangements.
The real question, therefore, is whether certain products are to be identified in a particular way. The Israelis seem ready to accept this.
Negotiations leading to an arrangement of this type will certainly resolve this problem, which is actually a relatively minor one.
Regarding the establishment of a special category, I believe that 60 years after the liberation of Europe, we must still guard against imposing a new yellow Star of David, even if it is only to apply to goods.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in my opinion, the whole of this debate goes against the history, culture and identity of the European left wing.
Why are we talking about such an issue, for what reason?
We are not talking about something in order to contribute to the peace or to bring the sides to the table, but rather we are talking about a legal loophole with no repercussions, not even economic.
What will this lead to?
What should we do tomorrow morning with the new labels?
Do you think, then, that tomorrow morning there will really be a major violation of international law on this matter?
Or, should we then talk about the violation of international law in the form of the claims made by Abu Ali in our institution a few days ago, when he defined Hamas as a normal and general political force, rather than as a factor contributing to international terrorism?
That constitutes a violation of international law and not a debate on subjects of this nature.
Furthermore, the hard-fought-for settlements that have been brought to the table so often in this discussion about associated products are not helping to put an end to peace, that much is certain.
It is certainly terrorism that prevents the parties from coming to the negotiating table.
Now we are talking about something serious.
I say to everyone: let us contribute to peace.
I say to the Commission: let us not make absurd allegations when discussing this, when we still have to clarify the issue of funds allocated for humanitarian aid: where did they really go?
I believe that when we start to discuss legal matters in this House, the dialogue ends; or we hide behind legal pretexts.
So then, let us avoid this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is quite incredible that the Commission has still not found a solution to the issue of the export from Israel of goods with preferential access and that, knowing how Israel has so far insisted upon its own interpretation of its own area, the Commission wants now, into the bargain, to leave it to Israel to propose a solution enabling the Member States to identify which goods have been produced in the illegal settlements, so that duty can be claimed on them.
If we continue not to claim duty on goods from the occupied territories, we have recognised Israelâs occupation of them, and that is something that, as the EU, we cannot do.
Moreover, the EU has a duty to comply with its own trade agreements and, unless Israel very quickly comes up with a proposal that makes this possible, I think that the only solution to this issue is for the Commission to inform the Member States that they must subject all Israeli certificates of origin to a verification procedure.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Liikanen, ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that not just in MrÂ Turchiâs speech, with which we certainly agree, but also in the speeches by MrsÂ Morgantini and MrÂ Laschet, I detect a different mood from what we have seen to date.
The Commissionerâs speech is a speech that I would say, automatically to some extent, confirms the Commissionâs position.
I fear that the Commission would have said the same if we had been discussing the situation in Vietnam, and would have done so on the basis of its usual course of action, that is to say one whereby, instead of monitoring rights and the law, it would have monitored and protected relations with Vietnamese power, murderous as this was.
Today, however, it seems to me that the Commissionâs tone is to some extent justified by the very reasons stated by MrsÂ Morgantini and others.
The desire to narrow the focus within the framework of a complex situation that is slipping from our graspis, I believe, an error of method.
What I detect is not a love of the truth, but passion of the kind exhibited by the French Communist Member, who speaks about the wall of shame.
There are many scandals which your party, which has been silent up until 2004, should denounce.
Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of this parliamentary term, the real problemÂ âÂ and I am winding up hereÂ âÂ is the fact that we continue to forget that the historic reasons that allowed us to make the progress that we have made in Europe to date have their origin in the statementÂ âÂ excellently summarised in the Ventotene Manifesto by Altiero SpinelliÂ âÂ according to which the self-contained nation state cannot produce democracy, freedom, progress or truth.
It is by imagining that it can that we continue, for example, mistakenly to posit the national State of Palestine as the problem we have to resolve on behalf of the Palestinians and the Israelis.
I believe that Israel too is lacking in imagination, strength and rigour in this area.
The Israeli parties too are like yours; they are European.
I would like to conclude by saying: let us hope, at the end of this parliamentary term, that the federalist ideals and the federalist method will very quickly prevail,with the accession to the European Union of Israel and of a Palestinian state of the kind you want to see: one founded on freedom and not on the abuse of power.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as the debate has shown, this is a complicated and sensitive subject.
I agree with the previous speakers in this respect, in particular my colleague MrÂ Laschet.
Clearly, serious questions arise about preferential access to the Community market for products originating from the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
As far as I understand it, the preferential import from these territories constitutes a violation of Community law.
Now I understand that the European Union wants to amend the Association Agreement with Israel with the addition of a pan-European cumulation of origin, and also the implementation of Jordanian-Israeli cumulation of origin.
The question is, however, whether a cumulation system such as this is even possible without a solution to this problem of the preferential import of products from the Occupied Territories.
In my opinion, it is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament be consulted in good time before any part of the existing agreement is amended.
I agree with the previous speakers: it is important that this take place before the end of the present Commissionâs term of office, if possible.
We set great store by a clear explanation of these problems by the Commission.
Does the Commission envisage possibilities for resolving the problems that have arisen with Israel within a reasonable time?
I thank the Commissioner for his initial response and look forward to his second.
As the previous speaker remarked, this is indeed a measure that is neither for nor against Israel.
Â Â  Mr President, we are facing an absurdity, a paradox.
We are discussing the legality and legitimacy of products originating from entities, the settlements, which international law considers to be illegal.
Established by military force in occupied territories, the withdrawal from which the European Union, the United Nations, the United States, and practically the entire international community consider to be essential in order to create a viable Palestinian State able to live in peace alongside the State of Israel.
With regard to the issue on which this debate is based, achieving correct application of the EC-Israel Association Agreement, I do not mind what is done nor how it is done and I do not mind what law is applied nor how.
But it must be made clear that Israel cannot continue to unilaterally apply the Association Agreement to settlements which must disappear in order for peace to be possible.
To allow this to continue in a unilateral fashion would be another absurdity, an insult, a humiliation which this Parliament at least must combat.
This is not the time, and nor do I have the time, to once again condemn the Sharon Governmentâs lack of political will to achieve peace.
It is sufficient at this point to insist on the issue which we are dealing with this morning, and that is that the Israeli Government cannot issue proof of origin to products which, in accordance with Community law, are not eligible for preferential treatment as a result of originating from the colonies established in the occupied Palestinian territories.
We must remember once again the Commissionâs clear statement of 10 May 2001 that exports from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, within the framework of preferential treatment, are violations of the commercial agreements between the Community and Israel.
If only for tactical reasons, it would do no harm to remember that on 10 April 2002 this Parliament approved a resolution on the Middle East, paragraph 8 of which calls on the Commission and the Council to suspend the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between Israel and the European Community.
Â Â  Mr President, it is clear that if EU law is to be credible it should be enforced properly.
Under the Geneva Conventions the Occupied Territories are not part of Israel and, therefore, products from the settlements cannot be considered covered by this agreement.
If the Commission is going to come forward with new plans â as it should â then it should do so before Parliament rises in June to give us time to scrutinise them properly.
However, I agree with those who say that it is time to look at wider measures to do with suspending this EC-Israel association agreement, because that agreement contains an important human rights clause that states that if there are human rights abuses on either side of the agreement, then that agreement should be suspended.
The EU prides itself on inserting these human rights clauses into trade agreements.
However, if they are there we have to act on them â they have to be credible.
Therefore it is time to suspend this agreement, because of not only the human rights abuses associated with the settlements but also those associated with the new apartheid wall, which has nothing to do with security and everything to do with an illegal land grab.
It is destroying lives and livelihoods.
If the EU does not suspend this agreement, it is guilty not only of an injustice to the Palestinian people but also of undermining its own laws and legislation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, quite right, I made a totally ridiculous remark and I would like to correct it immediately.
I had thought and imagined that MrsÂ Morgantini could speak like MrsÂ Napoletano.
I apologise, MrsÂ Napoletano, and let us attribute to MrsÂ Morgantini what she said.
She continues to portray the war, from which we want to pull out, from a point of view that I do not agree with.
Â Â  An example of Italian , elegance and courtesy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I hope to give an example of Dutch common sense.
On 4Â SeptemberÂ 2003, this House was already debating the proper application of the EC-Israel Association Agreement.
On that occasion, I quoted the conclusion of the Dutch Foreign Minister that âin the case of most of the products that carry Israeli proof of origin, the Netherlands can assume that the conclusions by Israeli customs regarding their origin have been reached in a lawful manner.
This means that they meet all the conditions of the rules of origin protocolâ.
Last year, I asked the Commission whether it could subscribe to this conclusion from the Hague for the other EU Member States too.
No answer came at that time.
Perhaps todayâs representative of the Commission will be rather more forthcoming.
I shall not lose heart, however, and shall ask a second question.
Is the demanding of additional customs duties from importers of products presumably originating from Israeli settlements a unilateral policy?
What is the Commissionâs view on this?
Â Â  Mr President, I am surprised that, since Commissioner Liikanen has said that the European Union is going to rigorously apply the rules in force, we should have any doubts about the review of the agreement with Israel which is taking place at the moment.
I have no reason to doubt that the rule will be applied, but I do very much doubt whether this Parliament â or a minority within it â wishes to promote peace between the Palestinian Authority and Israel.
I have always been convinced that, if we want peace, we cannot play at being the bad guys and constantly penalise one of the parties.
If we want to have credibility, we should play positively, and if we want to replace or, at least, compensate for the influence of the United States â which many here talk about â over Israel, and if we want Israel to trust in Europe, what we cannot do is always seek to castigate.
If the occupied territories are soon â and we hope this is the case â going to pass into the hands of the Palestinian Authority, why leave them in ruins?
Why ruin them?
Because there is a lot of falseness here.
The Palestinian area does have a preferential system, just like the Israeli area.
The problem is that there is this contradiction, this illogicality, that this territory is both Palestinian and Israeli, as the Israelis believe.
We must seek points of agreement, we must seek peace.
We must be credible to the Israeli people, and I do not believe we are going to achieve that through a âscorched earth policyâ.
Furthermore, with a policy of this type, subsequent investment by the Palestinians in order to incorporate these territories will be much greater.
So I would repeat, why do we not seek points of agreement?
Why does Europe not stretch out its hand to Israel?
I must repeat that I do not understand why we do not do so.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, products from the Occupied Territories are, according to the Association Agreement, not Israeli products.
That is how we need to view this dossier.
It is symbolic, and symbols are important in issues of war and peace, especially now.
The wall that Israel is now erecting is more than a symbol.
It has nothing to do with preventing terrorism, but everything to do with denying the Palestinians the water and water resources on which they rely for their agriculture and for surviving in their villages.
The right to water is a human right, and because this human right is being violated, together with other human rights, I am asking for this Association Agreement to be suspended.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will make a few general remarks followed by replies to specific questions.
The Commission takes every opportunity to reach a satisfactory solution to ensure correct application of Community law and to protect the Community's own resources.
That is why the Commission works in close cooperation with the customs authorities of Member States and maintains a constructive dialogue with the Israeli authorities.
This approach is generating results; duties are being recovered on goods from the settlements.
Somebody asked where the customs duties go.
They go to the general revenue side of the Community budget.
Israel is willing to cooperate to reach a satisfactory resolution.
Finally, I want to remind you that EU policy towards Israel lies in partnership and cooperation.
A specific question was raised about amendment of accumulation of origin.
I want to reiterate the statement of the Association Council last November, recalling that in July 2003, at the third Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting, ministers endorsed a new protocol on rules of origin which allows the extension of the pan-European accumulation of origin to the Mediterranean countries.
The next stage will be amendment of origin protocols in the current bilateral association agreements in order to insert the changes necessary for the application of diagonal accumulation.
I particularly want to emphasise that the EU notes Israel's support for this project.
The EU stresses the importance of solving the bilateral issue of rules of origin before the original protocol is amended.
The EU's position is clear.
Â Â  Thank you very much, CommissionerÂ Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.(1)
Â Â  . â Mr President, the first amended budget for 2004, which is to be voted on shortly, relates to the accession of the new Member States on 1 May this year.
The Committee on Budgets has already approved this budget unanimously and, in principle, Parliament as a whole rubberstamped everything as long ago as December last year.
For legal reasons, we now have to make this official, which can be done presently.
I should like to point out that the observers in the Committee on Budgets have played a very active and constructive role in drawing up the budget with regard to the new countries, and we as the Committee on Budgets have increased certain payment appropriations.
Some people in the Council always think that Parliament is too generous when it comes to money and has, so to speak, a hole in its pocket.
I should like to draw your attention to the fact that with the enlargement through the accession of ten new countries, the percentage of the gross national income that is spent on the European budget is 0.98%, the lowest percentage since 1990.
This leads me to think that Parliament is good with money.
If you will be voting âyesâ â and I hope that you will do so in large numbers â then nothing will stop us financially from including all new Member States in the European Union on 1 May of this year.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I simply wanted to recall that since 1996, with the Nassuer report, this Parliament has rejected all the Council proposals concerning Europol, because the Council does not agree to communitarise Europol and to finance it with the Community budget.
This has led to Europol not being subject to any control, whether democratic or jurisdictional.
Given that the Council is not here and that the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is calling, as it has already done, for the Council proposal to be rejected in accordance with Rule 68(3) of the Rules of Procedure, I ask that we immediately proceed to vote on the proposal.
Â Â  Mr Turco, I take note of your suggestion.
Â Â  .
Mr President, scarcely less important than passing wise laws is seeing that they are actually implemented and it is, therefore, encouraging to read the Commission's report, which my report addresses.
However, as my report suggests, there is a real problem about the non-compliance with Community law among big states.
The worst example â which is cited in the explanatory statement â concerns the treatment by the Italian State of a group of university lecturers, who, after 14 years, have still not had their rights enforced, despite two resolutions by this House.
I have just received information that, despite the European Commission's decision to ask the European Court of Justice to impose fines of EUR 309Â 750 a day, the Italian Parliament has just passed legislation which enhances the illegal discrimination against these citizens.
I find this outrageous.
I hope the House will support my report.
Â Â  . Mr President, I just wanted to ask you and all of us what good the privacy rules are, if even as the European Union we allow them to be completely disregarded.
My report does not propose amending legislation on privacy, because there is no problem with the legislation, but with its application.
One example that many of you are familiar with: for a year the European Union and the Member States have allowed the United States security services access to booking terminals for transatlantic flights, with no information, authorisation or control.
Therefore, many of us get annoyed with the United States when in reality the problem lies with the rules we have and could and should ensure are respected, but which we do not enforce, and Commissioner Vitorino has disclosed that we will shortly be setting up a European system to do the same thing.
We can therefore see why we do not enforce the rules: because we are already preparing to adopt those mechanisms which infringe privacy.
I therefore hope that we will unanimously vote for a report condemning these situations.
The problem is that when it comes to having recourse to the Court of Justice and enforcing the rules, the European Commission, Member States, privacy protection authorities and, I am afraid, also Parliament, prove to be extremely weak and inadequate.
Â Â  Mr Cappato, the issue to which you refer â the passenger name records system and data exchange with the United States â will be expressly dealt with under the Boogerd-Quaak report on Wednesday of the next part-session.
Â Â  Mr President, I would simply like to tell the House that, in agreement with Mr Turco, there is a correction to the explanatory statement.
Â Â  . Mr President, I just want to reassure the House that this is largely a tidying-up exercise.
However, it will, at the same time, provide us with a new ordering for our Rules of Procedure; it will plug a few gaps and deal with a few technicalities that have been spotted and it will allow the newly enlarged Parliament to have a new set of Rules that has been adapted for enlargement, not least pursuant to Rule 180(8).
Â Â  Mr President, the report's title is misleading.
I would like to say to colleagues that one of the amendments to be voted in relation to the Corbett report proposes a rule that makes it very hard to set up temporary committees.
This applies to the second vote, so be careful what you do, colleagues.
I know it is very late, but please take into account that this will mean that good work such as that carried out in this Parliament on the issue would not be possible if we were to adopt this amendment.
Â Â  There is a separate vote on that amendment.
This is voting time, not a debate!
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are voting on the Paulsen report today.
It was only this morning that the amendments to this report became available in all languages.
I regard this as a very important report and there are a great many amendments.
I am not in a position to adopt a clear position on this report today, and I therefore request that the vote should be postponed until tomorrow.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have been in a position to discuss MrsÂ Paulsen's report since last week.
The Council has not given us any indication that it still thinks there is any room for manoeuvre.
I therefore see no reason for postponing the vote today.
We are well prepared and we also want to vote today.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I think that we are voting now.
We have had an opportunity to debate, and I have had close contact with the shadow rapporteurs and the groups that have been interested in contact.
Â Â  What is the opinion of the chairman of the committee, Mrs Jackson?
Â Â  Mr President, the only observation is that if you postpone this vote today, you will run into the problem that my committee will be producing an avalanche of reports in the future, so it might be as well to deal with it now.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order touched on in the debate this morning.
It concerns declarations of interest in this House where an interest is a familial one rather than a direct personal one. This has been the subject of various newspaper articles, including a leader in the London â which at least to be a serious newspaper.
Mrs Fourtou has behaved with extreme honour and goodwill throughout, but has been put in the invidious position of bringing forward a report and then being accused of not having declared an interest.
We must have clarity as to whether and when familial interests have to be declared.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to comment on what MrÂ MacCormick said.
The European Ombudsman has asked the Commission to carry out an investigation for the purpose of clarifying these financial declarations.
I would ask the Commission to reply to the European Ombudsman, for matters are as MrÂ MacCormick described.
There are things that are extremely unclear, and these must be clarified when the new Parliament meets.
I would ask the Commission to reply to the Ombudsmanâs enquiry about the same issue.
Â Â  Mr MacCormick, you have raised a valid question, which I will bring to the attention of the Bureau, irrespective of what the Commission or other institutions may choose to do.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to point out a linguistic problem with Amendment No 83 before the vote.
The English version says âseizure of the infringing goodsâ.
The Italian version saysâseizure of the contentious goodsâ.
Therefore the English version refers to goods which are illegal, and the Italian version refers to those which could be illegal.
I do not feel we should add, in the hasty way with which we have been forced to act by the procedure followed, a further restriction to measures which already appear restrictive enough.
The same goes for âjudicial authoritiesâ, which in English means judges who pass judgment, whereas in Italian, it can also refer to investigating judges.
We should therefore clarify whether we are also conferring powers of investigating judges, which I hope is not the case, or only powers of adjudicating judges.
All these issues, without the rush, which we would have had to ...
Â Â  We will make sure that all language versions conform to the English text, which is the original.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too would like to say, in relation to Amendment NoÂ 53, that the English version is the valid text.
âParasitic copiesâ is therefore the correct wording.
Â Â  I take note of that.
Once again, we will ensure that all language versions correspond to the original text.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council intends to establish a border protection agency.
This House has developed an alternative model, but we all know that the Council will disregard it.
Above all, I would like to draw the attention of the members of the Committee on Budgets to the fact that this agency, in addition to the 27 staff working there, is also to be controlled by 27 members of the Management Board and also by an Executive Board consisting of five members.
The Commission and the Council really are creating a bureaucratic monster here!
I wish to ask the Committee on Budgets, before it approves the funding for this agency, to enter into a further in-depth discussion with the Council.
No matter how much we support progress in this field, we simply cannot work like this in Europe.
I hope the Committee on Budgets will back us on this.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is an arrangement with the Socialist Party that Recital G should be deleted and that it should be part of a package including Amendment No 7.
Now that Amendment No 7 has been approved, the deletion of Recital G should be approved.
Â Â  Indeed, Amendment No 2 proposes that Recital G be deleted.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report, which proposes, without amendments, the approval of a Commission proposal intended to codify Council Decision 78/774/EEC, concerning the activities of certain third countries in the field of cargo shipping.
This Council decision aims to establish a set of information systems that will enable the various European institutions to be kept informed about activities of the fleets of third countries whose practices could be harmful to the maritime interests of Member States, and, most importantly, about the extent to which these fleets may adversely affect the competitiveness of those of Member States taking part in international maritime trade.
These systems must also facilitate the provision and consultation of information at intra-Community level.
So as not to destroy the substance of the acts to be codified, the Commissionâs proposal is limited to compiling them and putting them together in one document, subject only to the formal amendments required by the actual codification process.
This process should also serve as clarification, given that Council Decision 78/774/EEC has been substantially amended several times.
Â Â  . This report approves the Commissionâs proposal for a Regulation, which aims to prepare the countries of the Western Balkans for future accession, by familiarising them with the policies and working methods of the EU.
More specifically, all natural and legal persons from the Member States covered by Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000 are permitted to take part in tenders organised under the pre-accession Community assistance programmes.
This proposal thus gives added impetus to the stabilisation and association process.
These measures address what was approved at the Thessaloniki European Council.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  . The introduction of the new financial regulation required basic instruments to be adopted for a number of grants that have been financed to date without needing their own legal basis.
The purpose of this proposal for a Council and Parliament decision is to establish a Community action programme for Commission grants in the field of protecting the Communityâs financial interests â the HERCULE Programme.
This programme will ultimately finance specific measures and will cover grants to bodies working in this field.
This report improves the proposal for a decision, and as such deserves our support.
Firstly, the report is in line with the decisions of the budgetary authority agreed at the end of last year, in other words, an action programme for 2004-2006, which will be funded to the tune of some EUR 12 million.
It proposes that the grants should subsequently be staggered in line with the aims (technical support, training, exchanges of specialised staff and seminars and conferences) and that reporting by OLAF, on the execution and aims of the current programme, is to be brought forward.
Â Â  . This proposal for a decision aims to establish a Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Communityâs financial interests (HERCULE Programme), and I am naturally in favour of this.
This programme covers, on the one hand, grants allocated to occasional activities, such as study schemes, conferences or training and, on the other, operated grants allocated to bodies working in this field, such as associations created to promote the protection of the Communityâs financial interests.
Indeed, the current process of reforming the Commission, and in particular the adoption of the new Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, requires basic instruments to be adopted for a number of grants that have been financed to date without being covered by a specific basic instrument.
Of the grants that will in future need to be covered by a basic instrument, there are several that have been made by the Commission to protect the Community's financial interests.
The purpose of this proposal is to establish that basic instrument by setting up a Community action programme for Commission grants in this field.
The purpose of this proposal is to constitute a basic instrument of this kind, establishing a Community action programme for the allocation of grants by the Commission in this field. To be more specific, the measures required in the fields of prevention and combating fraud against the Communityâs financial interests, in accordance with the provisions of Article 280 ...
Â Â  . In December, Parliament approved the budget for 2004 â both the Community budget for the EU of 15, and, in collaboration with the Council, indicative values for enlargement to ten new Member States.
The focus was, therefore, on a Community budget for 25, even though enlargement does not actually take place until May.
