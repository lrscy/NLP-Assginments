At present the Commission has deliberately refrained from identifying individual countries or networks or banks as negative examples in this sector.
The Commission prefers to encourage a generally constructive debate with a view to finding solutions to the problems from among stakeholders and from within the industry itself.
The Commission will keep Parliament informed of the conclusions it draws, following the public consultation, and of any further action it considers appropriate in the light of those conclusions.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for the reply, although I note that you couched it in much more general terms in replying to the European Parliament than in the preliminary conclusion released on 12Â April.
I should like to ask you when the Commission intends to table and present specific measures.
When will the study be finished and can you give us some figures for Greece or are they confidential?
Â Â  . In answer to your last question: no, not at this time.
I have explained that, following the result of the preliminary findings, we shall be contacting those involved during the consultation procedure.
Hopefully, they have already taken into account that there is something rotten in the state in certain circumstances and they will come up with certain decisions or proposals, or whatever, when we have finalised matters after the consultation, which will be before the end of the year.
Then we will review the situation and either put forward proposals or just inform you that a couple of those that did not behave are reacting positively and correcting their behaviour.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, small and medium-sized businesses pay up to 70% more than large companies for the use of credit cards by their customers.
This results in higher costs of the final product to European consumers and the creation of inflation, which may reach as much as 2.5%.
As I have asked the same question as my honourable friend on a previous occasion, I ask you:
Does the Commission believe that the financial services sector should be integrated into the systems of the single market and the single euro payment area?
Â Â  . The honourable Member is correct when he says that, especially in the SME sector, there is something that you could call âpaying too muchâ.
Businesses, including SMEs, and consumers are paying several billion euros too much every year because banks do not compete enough, and that is one of the problems that we are facing and on which we have to act.
Let there be no misunderstanding about that.
Markets are still fragmented and we do not yet have a functioning single market for payments in Europe.
That is the main purpose of our action: there will be change; there must be change, to be frank about it.
All players, in particular in the financial industry, must work for this.
You can be sure that your Commissioner will do her utmost.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should be interested to know what the Commission thinks about the problem with credit card charges still being graduated by reference to turnover, as a result of which small and medium-sized enterprises and especially small tourist businesses are put at a particular disadvantage.
Do you believe that this is justified in terms of competition law?
Â Â  . Every time you use a card for payment you bear a cost of up to 2.5%, which is equivalent to a consumption tax.
If the payment cards business becomes more competitive â and that is what we are pushing for â then every household could save up to several hundred euro per year.
Competitiveness, competitiveness, competitiveness: thatâs it!
Â Â  . The Commissionâs competition enforcement priorities in the pharmaceutical sector have two key objectives: one is to tackle intra-brand competition between the producers of patented prescription products and the parallel importers of those products; the other is to promote competition in innovation for patented medicines between the pharmaceutical producers, which has declined in Europe in the last decade, and to encourage intra-brand competition from generic substitutes after patent expiry.
That should, in time, contribute to ensuring a wider choice of both patented and generic pharmaceutical products to European patients at affordable prices.
Due account is taken of the need for the industry to recover its research and development costs, given the industryâs heavy dependence on innovation for its further competitiveness.
In that context, the honourable Member can be assured that the Commission is not circumspect about rigorously applying the anti-monopoly provisions in the pharmaceutical sector, for generic competition is an area which has suffered from under-enforcement in the past.
However, the importance of the generic segment for the provision of affordable medicines in the enlarged Union cannot be ignored.
That is why the Commission will give greater priority to competition in the generic sector in the immediate future.
On the issue of parallel trade, the Commission has always taken an active approach to combating restrictions on parallel trade in pharmaceuticals.
In the Commissionâs opinion, parallel imports are a legal form of trade between the Member States, constituting an alternative means of supply in the import countries.
The Commission is aware of the supply quota systems put in place by several pharmaceutical companies.
Under those systems, pharmaceutical companies unilaterally allocate a quota of medicines to their wholesalers.
In principle the quota covers domestic demand for the medicines in question in a particular Member State.
The European courts have held that such unilateral supply quota systems are not within the scope of ArticleÂ 81Â of the EC Treaty when there is not enough evidence that they are the result of an agreement with wholesalers.
However, another type of practice aimed at curbing parallel trade such as âdual pricing systemsâ â which, as you know, are systems where prices differ according to whether the product is for local consumption or for export to the other Member States â has been held to infringe ArticleÂ 81 in, for example, the Glaxo-Wellcome decision of May 2001.
The Greek national competition authority has initiated proceedings against restrictions on parallel trade on the basis of ArticleÂ 82, which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position.
There are also parallel civil litigation proceedings pending in Greece, dealing with the same matter.
The Commission is monitoring these developments closely.
Article 152 makes clear that the organisation and the delivery of health services and medical care are the responsibility of the Member States.
The competent national authorities are free to make their own decisions on pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, provided that these decisions are made in a transparent manner and do not create barriers to trade.
The Commission understands that in Poland the price of reimbursable pharmaceuticals is subject to a Ministry of Health decision following representations from the industry.
In discharging that duty, the Polish authorities could and do use prices in other EU Member States â including low-price countries â as a reference point.
It should also be noted that the Commission has recently launched a project under the pharmaceutical forum, which addresses the issue of national pricing and reimbursement practices.
That project will take account of the interests of patients, Member States, wholesalers, manufacturers and other stakeholders.
Â Â  Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the Commissioner for her detailed response.
It is the first time I have ever received such a specific reply to a question.
However, I would still like to explain that the situation in Poland is such that we cannot take full advantage of parallel distribution methods because pharmaceutical manufacturers are forcing pharmaceutical wholesalers to ban imports of cheaper medicines and thereforeÂ ...
Â Â  The Commission certainly knows that it has traditionally taken a proactive approach and has adopted several decisions under ArticleÂ 81 prohibiting restrictive agreements between the pharmaceutical companies and the wholesalers aimed at impeding parallel exports.
Earlier Commission prohibition decisions â for example Johnson [amp] Johnson in 1980 and Sandoz in 1987 â concerned agreed export bans.
The Sandoz prohibition decision was appealed against in the European Court of Justice, but the Court upheld the decision.
So we are aware of your point.
Â Â  I have a question for the Member of the Commission.
The situation in Lithuania is similar to that in Poland.
In our country, pharmaceuticals are often more expensive than in the old European Union Member States.
For example, there is a paradox that on the other side of the Baltic Sea in Sweden, where living standards are significantly higher, pharmaceuticals are cheaper.
Therefore, I would like to ask directly if the national governments are guilty that such a situation has come about, or if it is the influence of the European Union's activities, including the work of the European Commission and imperfections in legislation.
Â Â  . ArticleÂ 152 makes it clear that the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care are the responsibility of Member States, as I mentioned before.
Competent national authorities are free to make their own decisions on the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical articles, provided that these decisions are made in a transparent manner and do not create barriers to trade.
Member States therefore play a key role, as do the national competition authorities.
However, they need to be transparent in the decisions they take in that national context.
Â Â  . As we are all aware, there are quite a number of issues to be dealt with.
But first let me first correct one point in the oral question by the honourable Member.
Contrary to what he is implying in his question, the Commission has not yet formed any opinion on whether the proposed merger between Suez and Gaz de France complies with the EC merger regulation.
The proposed merger was indeed notified on 10Â May 2006 and the Commission will take a decision by 19Â June 2006 as to whether or not a thorough second-phase investigation under the EU merger regulation will be necessary.
This assessment will be based on the wide-ranging market investigation currently under way.
The honourable Member can rest assured that the Commission is investigating this case very carefully â like all other cases, by the way â in order to assess the impact of this operation on the European energy sector, and in particular in Belgium and in France, where those parties have a very important market position.
The Commission cannot prejudge the result of the investigation â you would not blame me for that.
The extent and gravity of any possible competition problems can only be established after the market investigation; but, should this investigation confirm the existence of any competition problems, then the parties would have the opportunity to propose appropriate remedies, and this is in line with the usual practice.
Finally, the Commission would wish to recall its extensive experience in assessing remedies based on earlier cases, especially in this sector.
Â Â  Commissioner, very briefly, I know you want to err on the side of caution and you refer to remedies, but you must realise, of course, that you are the most important guarantor of prices remaining affordable for Belgian consumers and for Belgian enterprises who buy gas and electricity.
Could you at least confirm on this platform that you intend to intervene, and can you enlarge upon the nature of those remedies?
Can you also confirm that you can promise that competition will be guaranteed, that there will not be a monopoly and that the merged company may well be required, depending on the outcome of the inquiry, to divest itself of some of its activities in Belgium?
Â Â  . I will not prejudge what could possibly come to light during those inquiries.
We are in any case acutely aware of the fact that we are talking about an eventual merger that will constitute one of Europeâs largest energy groups.
This means that, with this conclusion â which a child could draw â we are all too aware of the fact that we will need to exercise extreme caution and that we will need to assess in good faith whether everything is in line with European competition rules.
You can rest assured that the consumer plays a key role in competition policy, because in the final analysis, the consumer benefits a very great deal from our approach, which involves fair competition and a good positioning of groups within the market.
Â Â  I am afraid that this is my second interaction today with the honourable Member, Mr Staes, and I have to disappoint him for a second time in one afternoon.
Even though the idea and the proposal are very interesting and would have been worth exploring in the past, we have already reached a very advanced level of cooperation at various levels within and outside the European Union on avian flu, not only as regards a possible pandemic but also on the animal health side.
Therefore, we feel that, at this point, it would not offer any added value to have any more coordinating bodies.
I should like to assure the honourable Member that the tasks this task force would have performed are already at very advanced stages â if not completed â in the European Union.
That also applies to the WHO, WHO Europe, the G8 and other international organisations.
We therefore feel that adding another coordinating group could have the negative effect of confusing responsibilities which have already clearly been defined.
We believe strongly in close collaboration with our different partners and we have already reached an advanced stage there.
We hold joint meetings of the chief health officers, the chief veterinary officers and all the experts on animal and human health.
We are also funding various research projects.
For example, we have launched a major initiative on the development of pandemic influenza vaccines.
On the availability of research data, the European Centre for Disease Control is already active in making such data available and early-warning networks for outbreaks in humans and animals are already in place.
The creation very recently of an EU-wide network of media officers is also a major step.
In the area of seasonal vaccination coverage, I remind health ministers repeatedly of the WHO objectives and the advantage of extending and expanding the coverage of seasonal influenza vaccination in readiness for a possible pandemic.
In terms of global partnership, the European Union is actively engaged in close collaboration with China and the United States â these are the two international initiatives brought together after the Beijing conference.
Only last week we had the follow-up meeting in Vienna, in which we discussed practical ways of taking this forward.
It is true that there was a delay in delivering the funds pledged in Beijing.
Nevertheless, the decision has now been taken to proceed as quickly as possible.
It is very appropriate that the next meeting on this issue will take place in Africa, which is a region that has recently been affected.
Nevertheless, and in conclusion, I should like to say that we are always open to suggestions.
We do not have any prejudices and are not afraid of sharing views, responsibilities and cooperation.
We are always open to ideas and suggestions that would improve both the effectiveness of our preparedness measures and collaboration at both EU and international level.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for your response which is, indeed, somewhat disappointing, especially because it contradicts MrÂ Adamou's report, which we discussed today, and ArticleÂ 23 of which specifically asks for a task force such as this, or an influenza working party.
You claim that this will not add any value, but all scientists I have spoken to during preparations of the Adamou report claim that there is indeed a great deal of expertise, but that it is very widespread and that an influenza working party would certainly add value and would even be more effective than the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which is currently carrying out some of the tasks.
Could you, then, explain once more why this working party would not add any value?
Â Â  .
I noted the paragraph in the report we were discussing earlier today, but the fact remains that at this stage we feel that we already have the structures and mechanisms to take advantage of the knowledge, expertise and experience on both animal and human health, which is why adding one more body at this point would not offer any advantages but might, on the contrary, pose problems.
I assure you that our criterion is purely a practical one and that we evaluate the best way to obtain practical results.
We have no objection to the idea as such; it is just that we feel this point would not offer any practical advantages.
Â Â  . The Commission is aware of the problems experienced by consumers in connection with car hire and we have legislation that could help to a certain extent.
One such piece of legislation is the one on unfair terms of consumer contracts. It provides relevant protection.
The implementation of these provisions lies, of course, with the Member States.
Nevertheless, even these provisions do not offer sufficient protection, especially in relation to difficulties where pressure and unfair business practices generally are involved.
For example, the honourable Member refers to complaints from consumers who have been under pressure to take out expensive insurance.
We have new legislation in place.
As you know, last year we adopted the legislation on unfair commercial practices.
This covers pressure selling.
Its provisions will come into force at the beginning of next year and it regulates aggressive commercial business, both misleading practices and aggressive practices.
One advantage of this directive is that it has a list of criteria helping to determine whether a commercial practice involves harassment, coercion, including physical force, or undue influence, but also of course misleading representations.
At the same time, I would like to inform the honourable Member that we are currently in the process of conducting a review of eight of the consumer directives.
Some of them could be relevant to car hire.
One which is very important is the one on distance selling.
Unfortunately, based on a ruling of the Court of Justice, this does not cover car hire.
Therefore we have included these directives in our review, but will also examine, through consultations, whether it is useful and necessary to amend this directive so as to cover car hire under these provisions, that is, distance selling.
We are gathering evidence in this respect and are discussing it with stakeholders.
The outcome of this debate and consultation will determine whether we should amend this directive.
If this happens, then we will fill one gap in the legal protection of consumers when they rent cars from a distance.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that comprehensive reply.
If should just add that â as you are probably aware â if you pay by credit card for something in a shop or for a room in a hotel, that information cannot be used retrospectively, with more charges being added on.
However, this does seem to happen in the car hire industry.
There are many companies who also charge people for damage that has not occurred or is very minor.
This is an industry that affects Europeans who are travelling around Europe, so I very much welcome your commitment to look again at the consumer directives, distance selling, unfair aggressive practices, and hope very much that my colleagues and I can work with you, introduce amendments and address the current car hire situation
Â Â  . Very briefly, I agree with the honourable Member.
We are in the process of reviewing the and working on the distance selling directive â which has a problem, admittedly.
That does not mean that the other two directives do not offer protection to a certain extent, which is why it is important for Parliament and the Commission to raise the issue with the Member States who are in charge and have responsibility for the implementation of Community legislation.
Â Â  Would the Commissioner agree with me that the car hire sector is one that should be a prime beneficiary of the Services Directive, and that the provisions of that directive, which we approved to encourage sectors to develop good codes of practice and quality standards, would be an ideal application in this case?
Perhaps he could take up the suggestion by my colleague, Robert Evans, with which I associate myself, to call the car hire companies together, present them with some of these disserving consumer reports and suggest that they might set up a Europe-wide set of codes of practice, standards and quality marks that really would benefit the consumer very quickly?
Â Â  I think Mr Harbour is trying to get me into trouble.
Every time we deal with the services directive it is always a risky business!
I shall be very happy to take up this issue with my colleague Mr McCreevy, who is in charge of the services directive.
I see it more from the consumer protection point of view, which is what I referred to earlier.
The reason for the exclusion of car hire from our directives is that it is considered to be a transport issue, therefore it has to be dealt with specifically under that legislation.
But I shall be very happy to take up this suggestion with my colleague and see how we can make sure that both consumers and the industry benefit from European legislation.
Â Â  Since they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
The ban on Polish food imports into Russia has been in place for almost six months now.
Talks on lifting the ban have been in progress practically since the day it was first imposed, but all they have produced to date is additional Russian demands.
Despite having said that it would help to solve the conflict, the Commission seems thus far to have confined itself to the role of passive observer.
In the meantime, Polish exporters are estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of euros.
It should also be noted that this estimate represents only the value of half a year's imports into Russia and takes no account of the heaviest loss, namely that of the relevant segment of the Russian market, which it will be extremely difficult for Polish firms to recover in the future.
Furthermore, there are many signs that this situation was in fact engineered with a view to permanently removing Polish food producers from the Russian market.
During the last round of talks (26 April 2006) the Russian side demanded, among other things, that Poland should specify a border crossing for Polish agricultural products bound for the Russian market.
This demand, which is out of all proportion to the offences allegedly committed by Polish suppliers and is, for obvious reasons, unacceptable to the Polish Government, is further proof that Russia is deliberately setting prohibitive conditions for Poland.
Given this situation, the Commission has an obligation under the accession treaties to intervene in the matter.
I should therefore like to know what practical steps the Commission is going to take in this connection, and when.
What action has the Commission taken on behalf of the Union with a view to putting an end to the absurd embargo Polish meat exports to Ukraine and Russia?
Â Â  . It is true that both questions deal with more or less the same issue, so I will cover them in one reply.
I am aware of the problems raised regarding Polish exports to Russia and more recently Ukraine and the Commission is involved â and my services as well â in trying to sort out the situation.
I had meetings with Russian officials and tried to emphasize that from the technical, the veterinary point of view, the Polish authorities are committed to the necessary measures to make sure that the Russian concerns are addressed.
It is very important â and we insisted on this with the Russian authorities â that solutions are found as quickly as possible.
It is also extremely important that the Polish authorities implement these agreed measures and convince the Russian authorities that they have been implemented and are now in force.
In that respect, my services will visit Poland very soon to work together with the Polish authorities to gather this evidence which can be used in negotiations and discussions with the Russian side.
My colleague Mr Mandelson has been dealing with this issue from the trade point of view, especially since, from a technical point of view, the requirements have been met, and it now becomes a trade issue.
We also raised the matter in our discussions within the context of Russia's WTO accession negotiations.
It is important that Russia's SPS measures comply with the WTO SPS Agreement.
We are following this issue.
We are in constant communication and coordination with the Polish authorities and now it has been agreed that the Commission will formally participate in the discussions with the Polish and Russian sides.
At the beginning, given that it related to exports which fall under the responsibility of the Member States, the Commission was facilitating the discussions but could not be part of them.
Nevertheless, not only has it now been agreed by both sides, but also, given that some of the issues raised by Russia relate to the exports of other Member States through Poland and also to European Community legislation as a whole, it provides legal standing for the Commission also to be involved in these discussions.
As I said, our experts will shortly visit Poland to gather information and evidence to be used during the meetings with the Russian side.
As far as the Ukraine measures are concerned, the Commission met with the Ukrainian Chief Veterinary Officer in April, and asked him to speed up efforts to get the problem solved.
It that Ukraine has agreed to lift the ban, but it has not taken place yet.
Today there was to be a meeting between the European Union and Ukraine â the Sub-Committee on Trade â and this issue would be raised there too.
We will follow this issue very closely and will continue to play an active role, but it is also very important that Poland actively demonstrates to its trade partner that legitimate concerns are taken seriously and are being met.
In that effort also, we will support Poland.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to express my warm thanks to the Commission for its interest in the issue of Polandâs exports to the Russian and Ukrainian markets.
I would, however, also like to point out that this problem has so far remained unresolved for seven months.
Polish exporters have incurred extremely serious financial losses.
If the situation continues, these losses will be even greater.
Moreover, a number of exporters will be pushed out of the Russian and Ukrainian markets for good.
We therefore urge the European Commission to take decisive action on this matter.
Â Â  First of all, this is not the first time â at least during my term â that we have had problems with exports through Russia.
That is why it is extremely important for Member States not to give any excuse for the introduction of bans, because once they are introduced it is very difficult to have them lifted.
Therefore, it is very important that both EU legislation and bilateral agreements are strictly implemented by every Member State so as not to give this initial justification for the introduction of bans.
At the same time, it is true that it has been going on for some time, but there were problems in communications between Russia and Poland and, as I said, from the beginning this was a bilateral issue, so we could only facilitate.
Nevertheless, we intervened, we brought the parties together and, through mediation, we managed to reach an agreement.
Now we are following very closely the developments in this tripartite meeting, in which we will also be involved, and will try to resolve this issue as soon as possible.
Â Â  â Do you believe, Commissioner, that these problems will delay Russia's membership of the WTO?
Â Â  . I do not think so, because it seems that Russia is ready to accept the WTOâs SPS requirements.
Nevertheless, it is not enough for Russia to accept these.
It has to implement them as well.
Therefore, these âcloudsâ over the negotiations, while not blocking them, certainly create an unpleasant atmosphere.
It is for that reason that it is important for Russia to implement these SPS requirements.
Â Â  Commissioner, given that you are going to speak with our Russian counterparts, I should like to ask one more question, which is along the same lines, but which this time concerns Georgia.
You are aware that Russia has imposed an identical embargo on Georgian wine.
Given that Georgia is covered by the ânew neighbourhoodâ initiative and that an action plan has been put in place on its behalf, are you familiar with this matter and, if not, can you look into it with a view to finding out what response Russia intends to give to Georgia?
Â Â  . I am not aware of it.
It does not fall under my sphere of responsibility, but I would be very happy to refer the issue to my colleague who is responsible for that area and see what she can make of the situation.
Â Â  . The undertakings made by the Mauritanian Government as regards respect for democratic principles when the consultations were opened under ArticleÂ 96 were centred on the re-establishment of a properly-functioning democracy and the rule of law.
Â Â  Commissioner, I can tell you that I am altogether dissatisfied with the response given.
I regret that MrÂ Michel is not here because he is very well acquainted with the subject of Mauritania.
I believe that the Commission could have provided more information in view of the in August, given that it proposed to dispatch a European Union delegation for the purposes of monitoring the elections being held there.
I would remind you that a referendum is due to take place in that country at the end of June.
Consequently, are you able to tell us whether this delegation will have a short- or a long-term mission regarding the elections?
Â Â  As I am sure that the honourable Member is aware, the lateral timetable set by the Mauritania transition authorities is as follows: referendum on 25 June, municipal and legislative elections on 19 November, senatorial elections on 21 January 2007 and presidential elections on 11 March 2007 (first round) and 25Â March 2007 (second round).
This 19-month schedule is tighter than the 24-month period initially planned by the Military Council for Justice and Democracy.
Its aim is a return to constitutional and democratic rule by the end of May 2007 at the latest.
When consultations were opened under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, Mauritania gave undertakings in the areas of respect for democratic principles, fundamental rights and freedoms, the rule of law and good governance.
The European Union declared its willingness to provide support for the implementation of these undertakings and decided to support the transition process in Mauritania during the consultation period itself by means of institutional support projects.
In particular, a EURÂ 6 million technical support project for the electoral processes was drawn up by the Commission and approved in April 2006.
The European Communityâs financial contribution of approximately 75% of total donor contributions will be implemented by the UN Development Programme.
The projectâs specific objective is to strengthen the capacities and resources of the national independent electoral commission, the Ministry of Justice and civil society.
It is also aimed at helping to ensure that the elections are free, fair and transparent, are conducted efficiently and lead to results that are nationally and internationally recognised and legitimate.
Regarding observation of the electoral processes, the Commission plans to send a team of electoral experts in early June 2006 around now to help with the constitutional referendum and, in July, a fact-finding mission to assess the advisability, usefulness and feasibility of future observation missions as well as, if necessary, electoral observation missions to observe the general and municipal elections in November 2006 and the presidential elections in March 2007.
As you know, Mauritania is not a member of either ECOWAS, which it left in 2000 or UEMOA, but it is a member of the Arab-Magreb Union.
The country takes part in the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean dialogue as an observer, and formally applied for membership at the end of May 2005.
No response to that request can be given before the country returns to constitutional and democratic rule.
Â Â  . The Commission attaches great importance to the rights of freedom of religion, belief and expression in its dialogues with third countries.
Freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief is one of the fundamental human rights and, as such, is enshrined in a number of international instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.
In addition, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights makes clear that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and that cultural, religious and linguistic diversity should be respected.
Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law underpins the Cotonou Partnership signed by the ACP States and the Community and its Member States.
Article 8 of the agreement indicates the topics on which regular political dialogues should focus, referring specifically to ethnic, religious and racial discrimination.
There is no state religion in Nigeria.
In 1999, the Constitution provided for freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the federal government generally respects those freedoms.
The Constitution also prohibits state and local government from adopting an official religion.
However, state governors have great autonomy and it is alleged that Islam has been adopted de facto as a state religion in several northern states.
The return of Nigeria to democracy in 1999 has seen an improvement in the human rights situation, but it has also seen an increase in tensions and violent conflicts, which currently provide the most threatening challenges to the new democratic Nigeria.
In this complex and unstable situation, the Commission has been trying to identify the most common causes of conflicts with the objective of helping to address and prevent them.
Conflicts and violence have historically marked relationships between Muslims and Christians, particularly in the central states, where communities of different religions are numerically equivalent.
It is generally not possible to cast Muslims or Christians systematically in the role of aggressor or victim, as they have historically been both.
It is apparent, however, that conflicts always involve extremely poor people and that conflicts presented as religiously motivated are often triggered by other causes, including conflicts between traditional rulers, land and resource struggles amongst communities, political in-fighting, and tensions between state and federal governments.
The significance of the tension between indigenes and non-indigenes is crucial to understanding the frequent cause of conflicts in Nigeria.
A recent report by Human Rights Watch, 'They do not own this place', blames the federal government policies that discriminate amongst non-indigenes, defined as people who, no matter how long they have lived in an area, cannot trace their origins to the ethnic and genealogical roots of the original inhabitants of that area.
In a country with more than 250 ethnic groups, these discriminatory practices spreading at state and local government level have relegated millions of Nigerians to the status of second-class citizens, increased poverty and created the conditions for intercommunal violence.
According to Father George Ehusani, secretary-general of the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria, interviewed by Human Rights Watch, 'poverty in Nigeria has assumed the moral character of war and that is what you see reflected in much of the ethnic violence in this country'.
The Commission and the EU Member States are engaged in regular dialogue in Nigeria to promote respect for human rights, basic freedoms and the rule of law among communities, religious and ethnic groups, state and federal authorities.
Since the first Niger Delta crisis in November 2004, regular visits of the EU Heads of Mission have been organised to various areas: the Niger Delta, some northern states and some middle-belt states.
While one of the focal sectors of EU development cooperation with Nigeria is supporting and promoting good governance at federal and state level, the Commission is also engaged in financing Community projects in the Niger Delta and is about to approve a project to support non-state actors.
Moreover, the EC budget lines have for years been financing projects to promote democracy and human rights.
Â Â  â Many thanks for that very good and very exhaustive reply.
While I far prefer CommissionerÂ Kroes to CommissionerÂ Michel, that has less to do with him than with her, but I would nevertheless like to ask why he is not here today.
Secondly, I would like to know what the Commission is doing about bringing up the specific issue of the introduction of sharia law in certain Nigerian states, and the acts of violence that are actually being perpetrated, including the killing of Christians and the burning down of churches in the central states, to which you have already referred.
Â Â  . You can be assured that this is something very important for my colleague.
Mr Michel is most fond of the debates in your House, so I am not aware what the specific reason is, but I am absolutely sure that if he could have made it then he would have done, but I think he is travelling, perhaps to the regions you are interested in.
I want to underline that the Commission is fully engaged in the effort to combat extremism of all types through its overall efforts to address the root causes of discontent and to promote peace, stability and security through its development cooperation and assistance.
In addition, it is engaged in numerous specific initiatives to promote peaceful coexistence between peoples, as well as inter-religious and intercultural understanding.
Political dialogue with the central government and support to institutional development is a main issue.
Â Â  . The European Community's efforts to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa are financed by the European Development Fund and the budget of the European Community.
Within the framework of national and regional programming, the EDF finances projects to fight AIDS and projects aimed at strengthening healthcare systems.
Since 2002, 15 national projects and three regional projects to fight AIDS and/or strengthen healthcare systems have been initiated in 13 countries and in the ACP region, representing a total commitment of EUR 244.6 million.
The EDF also supports the implementation of national poverty reduction plans and therefore, directly or indirectly, the fight against AIDS by providing general budget support.
Since 2002 the Commission has provided general budget support to 24 African countries with commitments representing around EUR 2.4 billion.
Already EUR 1.5 billion of that has been spent.
The European Community's budget has a thematic budget line to help combat poverty-related diseases â not only AIDS, but also malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries.
The budget line is based on Regulation 1568/2003.
Since 2002 the Commission has allocated on that line more than EUR 86.2 million to NGOs as a contribution to 25 projects combating HIV/AIDS being implemented in 16 African countries.
A total of EUR 9.42 million has also been allocated to two research projects: one in central Africa and the other in southern Africa.
A total of EUR 5 million has been allocated to large-scale awareness programmes, as well as to international partnerships, such as the International Partnership for Microbicides and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.
A second budget line relating to health, reproductive and sexual rights in developing countries, based on Regulation 1567/2003, also contributes to the fight against AIDS.
EURÂ 73.95 million is available on this line for 2003-2006.
Since 2003, the Commission has been able to allocate on this line EURÂ 17.5 million for 10 projects for the fight against AIDS implemented in eight African countries.
The Commission's budget also finances projects to combat AIDS and strengthen healthcare systems in South Africa, on the basis of Regulation 1726.
Since 2002, three projects are being undertaken in South Africa for a total amount of EURÂ 55 million.
The EDF and EC budget are the two sources of EC contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
The European Commission has contributed EURÂ 522 million to the Global Fund since the latter's creation in 2001, and this amount has been supplemented by contributions from EU Member States.
We are the leading donor to the GFFATM; 57% of the funds go to the fight against HIV/AIDS and 55% are allocated to African countries.
Moreover, the European Community is devoting increasing funds to research programmes targeting AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
For the period 2002-2006, the financing devoted to these three diseases, most of which funds go to HIV/AIDS, quadrupled, reaching EURÂ 400Â million currently.
Half of those funds are managed by the European Community, DG Research, and the other half, to which is added EURÂ 400 million from EU Member States and the private sector, are funnelled through the European and developing countries' clinical trial partnership.
The Commission does not have any details on aid from the Member States to African countries in the fight against HIV/AIDS because this information has not been made available to us.
Â Â  I should like to thank the Commissioner for her comprehensive answer to my question.
Could the Commissioner tell me whether discussions or negotiations are taking place between the major pharmaceutical companies regarding the supply of antiretroviral drugs to people in Africa?
If so, how extensive are they?
Has any progress been made and have these drugs been made more widely available to people?
Â Â  . I gather from the papers that discussions are being held.
However, I should like you to permit me, Madam President, to ask my colleague to give you a written answer that is to the point and states precisely what stage the discussions have reached.
Â Â  Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0172/2006) by MrÂ Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the consequences of the judgment of the Court of 13 September 2005 (Case C-176/03 Commission v Council) [2006/2007(INI)].
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by apologising for the absence of MrÂ Gargani, who is unable to be present by reason of illness.
Members of my own Group have asked me to stand in for him today as rapporteur and to say something about the content of this report.
I will start by observing that this ruling by the Court of Justice came as no surprise â at any rate, not to me.
There may well have been many who thought that things would not turn out this way, but I actually see this as no more than a logical conclusion, since we have for some time in the past seen the Commission adopt varying â sometimes widely divergent â approaches to legislative proposals relating to criminal law.
Drawing on my practical experience in the field of business law, I just want to point out that many past directives proposed on the basis of legal bases in the first pillar â for example, those on money-laundering and market abuse, or the provisions on insider trading â have included at least elements of criminal law.
It is in fact perfectly right and proper that the Court of Justice should, very often in the past, and even when the facts of the case were different, have worked on the principle that the issue of which legal basis should be decisive should be decided by reference to the objective of the proposal as a whole.
It was therefore perfectly obvious that the Court of Justice should, in this case, decide on the basis of a specific example from environmental law that, here too, it is not possible to take legal acts that in fact belong together and split them up in such a way that certain aspects are taken to refer to a part of the Treaties other than the actual objective that was originally in mind, where this falls under the first pillar.
The result, then, comes as no surprise to me.
What, though, are the consequences now?
In the first place, it does nothing to change the fact that criminal law is treated primarily as a matter for the Member States, for the national level, where Europe has powers only under exceptional circumstances.
This being so, I too take the view that the European legislator â who may be able to make use of this instrument, but is not required to use it in a coercive manner â is well-advised, as a matter of principle, to refrain from legislation in matters of criminal law.
In every specific situation, decisions must be reached on a case-by-case basis, on the basis of whether or not criminal law provisions are needed in order to achieve this objective, or whether it ought to be left to the Member States to decide these matters and regulate them.
Caution, then, needs to be the order of the day for the legislator, whether that be Parliament or the Council, and that above all, I believe â and this is why the Treaties, from the outset, leave criminal law in the hands of the Member States â quite simply because the systems of criminal law in Europe are so very, very different, not only in terms of deciding what is a crime, but also in terms of how that crime should be punished.
There are Member States in which the sentence is enforced in full; there are others in which, as a rule, only 50% is paid; others in which it is two-thirds; still others in which the courts order additional penalties of a punitive nature, which, in turn, do not exist in that form in other Member States.
I do believe, then, that if Europe starts, where it is not necessary to do so, to lay down standard penalties for all manner of things, then the consequence of that will be unsystematic interventions in the criminal law systems of the Member States, and, since the usefulness of that is a matter of doubt, it is for that reason above all others that we should exercise a degree of self-restraint.
I see the report that MrÂ Gargani has produced, and which has been adopted by the Committee, as putting that into effect, and see that as its essential substance.
We are of course in favour of the idea that the Commission should now attempt to analyse, one by one, the proposals that need to be revised on the grounds that their division into two different legal acts no longer corresponds to the law as laid down by the Court of Justice, and should then come up with proposals as to how adjustments can be made.
As for the amendments submitted in response to the Committee on Legal Affairsâ resolution, I am able to say, on behalf of my group, that some of these â particularly those tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe â are acceptable, while others are not.
Please do not expect me to go into details, for I have agreed this with the rapporteur, but I can say in general terms that there were no fundamental differences within the Committee on Legal Affairs when it came to evaluating these issues.
The problems lie more in the nuances, perhaps in the issue of how far one should actually go in individual cases, but otherwise, the committee was in general agreement on this.
I thank the House most warmly for its attention.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Gargani; MrÂ Lehne, who is standing in for him this evening; and MrÂ Cavada, for the joint work that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs have done on this important dossier.
I think that one of the qualities of this decision, which recognises the value added by the Community, is the fundamental role that the European Parliament will be able to play in important issues such as the application of criminal sanctions under the codecision procedure.
As you know, the Commission adopted a communication on this subject last November.
We believe that the scope of this decision goes beyond the single issue of environmental protection.
I believe, in fact, that there is a broader issue and I generally agree with the content of the Gargani report.
I have to say that the Commissionâs outlook is a little more ambitious in certain fields and in certain aspects.
For example, the report specifically says that the legislator must restrict the application of criminal sanctions to cases where the protection of citizensâ rights and freedoms or the protection of financial interests is at stake.
These are certainly extremely important interests that must be protected.
Nevertheless, we believe it would be possible to go a little further, although the Courtâs decision places restrictions on the application of criminal sanctions at a European level, and I do believe such limits are necessary.
For instance, as MrÂ Lehne said just now, we need to think about a European criminal sanction when it is truly indispensable for ensuring that Community law is effective, while respecting the principle of the need for the criminal sanction and the principle of proportionality.
At the same time, I think that an absolute limitation of the fields involved would be dangerous and would restrict what the Court of Justice has stated.
We have put forward a proposal for a directive laying down criminal sanctions in the fight against counterfeiting.
You are aware how dangerous counterfeiting is for industry in European countries and for consumer health, apart from causing the exploitation of child labour to produce fake goods.
In view of that, how can anyone claim that sanctions at a European level are not needed in this area?
This is just one example and, precisely because of that, I support the idea that MrsÂ Roure and MrÂ Cavada have expressed in their amendments regarding a rather more ambitious broadening of the structure adopted by the rapporteur.
To conclude, I should like to express my sincere gratitude because I have found in the report a restatement of the principle of the so-called âbridging clauseâ â which is the possibility of moving from the principle of unanimity under the third pillar towards a codecision and qualified majority procedure, in other words a Community procedure under the first pillar â in the area of cooperation in criminal justice and cooperation in police and security matters.
That is something that the Commission had already said that it was hoping for and I think it is a positive sign that it has been reiterated in the Gargani report as well.
Â Â  â The criminal law of this ambitious Europe is still very much in its infancy.
Loose consensuses and tentative progress show the Member Statesâ resistance to the future and the disgraceful contradiction of a Community policy that is on the one hand based on shared fundamental values but on the other leaves the law underpinning these values to the discretion of individual Member States.
It was this irony that the Constitutional Treaty attempted to remove and that the Court interpreted as favourably as it could.
Europeâs institutions have said that European criminal law is based on the simple principle of mutual recognition.
Unless this view is reversed, Europe will never have criminal law or an area of freedom, security and justice in the truest sense, because Europe is a global justice project rather than a project based on preferential areas of justice.
Yet what is emerging is that Europe lacks a common area with a shared project in the field of criminal law.
It is, rather, a fragmented mosaic of borders; harmonisation has been piecemeal and low-level; there is no political or criminal-law programme to be followed; there has been harmonisation of the minimum level of maximum sentences.
All of which illustrates our lack of courage.
Harmonisation is only apparent in sentencing, and does not cover the causes of crime, alternative sentencing or methodologies.
In a Europe that stands for the dignity of all citizens, for the values that underpin that dignity, for the rule of law, for proportionality and for equality, what is required is a criminal justice programme.
Yet in terms of the way in which powers are distributed, what we have is criminal law that is absurdly removed from the values that it guarantees; it is criminal law that follows a hard line in the Council insofar as it is not shared democratically among the parliaments.
What this shows is mutual recognition of individual criminal justice systems without any essential base of harmonisation.
This is utterly iniquitous.
We do not want this, but it is happening in Europe, because criminal law is the highest expression of values.
We await the broader scope of the Treaty and more importantly, the strong political will that is taking a long time to materialise.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, even in his absence, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report, although I do have to say that we in the committee would very much have preferred it if there had been some sort of negotiation between the groups to spare us the necessity of settling our various differences of opinion here in the plenary.
I would also like to have seen greater account taken of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which has been considering this matter with us.
The consequence of that has been that we have had to table a relatively large number of amendments for the plenary.
I hope that we will achieve a very broad majority when we come to the vote.
This issue is of great importance for the further development of Community law, and I think that calls for a broad majority.
Where, now, are the differences of opinion?
The rapporteur, in his original report, proposed a relatively restrictive approach in handling this ruling from the Court of Justice, but we, on the contrary, favour the Commissionâs interpretation, according to which the Courtâs ruling allows us to impose criminal sanctions in every area of Community law, albeit not subject to limitations, but with the conditions set down by the Court, and with the ultimate purpose of enforcing Community law.
We on the Committee on Legal Affairs find ourselves dealing, time and time again, with issues around the application of European law, and we have to say that there are serious deficiencies in this area.
We should not, at a stroke and once and for all, deny ourselves an option that the European Court of Justice has put in our hands.
We do understand that there are particular concerns about the coherence of criminal law in the Member States, and these are voiced particularly by the Ministers of the Interior and of Justice, who do not want ministers with first-pillar remits, so to speak, ruining their national criminal law systems; we have accommodated these concerns by means of amendments, particularly those adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
As MrÂ Lehne has already said, we are largely agreed among ourselves on the need for a case-by-case examination of all legal acts, which are in need of renovation.
We in this House have submitted one other, on which the deadline had not yet been reached, to the ECJ.
If a new legal basis demands the codecision procedure, then this House will not be able to evade the necessity of using all its legislative prerogatives.
We will not be able to accept a prior interinstitutional agreement in which we sign away our right to play a part in shaping these new legal acts, but that should not be taken to mean that we will not strive for good cooperation with the Commission and the Council if revision measures prove to be necessary.
Â Â  . Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the consequences of the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 13 September 2005 relating to Community powers in the area of criminal law are so momentous that this judgment really marks a break in the development of Community law.
It can even be assumed that under certain circumstances this precedent might have a negative effect on the sovereignty of the Member States.
The condition for its application to Community norm-setting arising from the First Pillar of the EU will therefore be strict adherence to the principle of subsidiarity as established in ArticleÂ 5 of the EC Treaty and in the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
This principle is directly connected to the need for European lawmakers to see that the enactment of criminal sanctions under the First Pillar is an exception, restricted to cases where there is an unavoidable need to protect the rights and freedoms of citizens and the main interests of the EU.
It is also essential that the effects and overall impact of the criminal law norms passed on the basis of the First Pillar are thoroughly and painstakingly monitored and assessed.
Another area where the Commission is proposing criminal sanctions is the protection of intellectual property rights.
This area undoubtedly represents one of the main activities of the Community arising from ArticleÂ 2 of the EC Treaty.
I think, and I will say it again, that this area is so important and so rapidly developing that it requires a specific conceptual and systematic approach.
I consider it essential to develop a well-rounded concept for protecting intellectual property rights, which will include among other things criminal law measures.
Â Â  Mr President, this issue shows up the most basic weakness in the whole EU structure.
All countries agree to be bound by the same body of EU law, which they then undertake to enforce upon themselves.
It must have been obvious from the start that some countries would apply EU law more vigorously than others.
So what we are now seeing is the beginning of attempts to harmonise criminal justice, notwithstanding Mr Garganiâs request for checks and limits.
The ECJ will have a wonderful time deciding whether national sentencing meets its criteria of being proportional and dissuasive.
Mr Gargani acknowledges that it will be hard to achieve uniform enforcement.
Indeed, do we really expect courts to behave in the same way in all 25 EU countries, including our new eastern European Member States and those who are yet to join?
I fear that politicians will agree to progressively harmonise enforcement, but the peoples of our different countries will not.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, on 13Â September 2005, the Court of Justice of the European Communities granted the Community legislator the opportunity to take legal measures so as to guarantee the effectiveness of the rules decreed by the Court.
Everyone understood this to mean â at any rate, those in Vienna understood it to mean â that the Court had turned the principle of subsidiarity inside out like a sock in order to decide that, on the subject of Community law, there was no point in the Member States taking care to ensure that it was complied with since the Commission of Brussels was able to do so all by itself.
The Commission has obviously not failed to step into this breach: while, strictly speaking, this new legal power only concerns the environment, a Commission communication of November 2005 makes more widespread use of this power to incorporate other subjects, including the four freedoms, the CAP and fishing.
MrÂ Cavada, our draftsman, even extends this power to include discriminatory behaviour, which can cover all human activities and even the protection of the Unionâs financial interests.
It is here that one can see the danger of this umpteenth show of strength by the judges of Luxembourg.
On 6Â April 2006, scarcely two months ago, in fact, the European Court of First Instance ordered MrÂ Frattini â the Commission â to pay damages and interest to an official on the grounds of a serious and obvious violation of the requirement for impartiality.
Violation by whom?
By OLAF, that is to say by the anti-fraud office, which is partly controlled by the Commission.
Thus, to grant legal powers to this Commission, on the subject of which the Court of Auditors, in its Special Report No 1 of 2005, notes that respect for the fundamental rights of persons subject to an inquiry is not guaranteed, means running the risk of creating, at the Berlaymont, a little centre in which peopleâs liberties are infringed, a kind of regulatory mini-Guantanamo.
The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, MrÂ Cavada, is, moreover, aware of the problem since he is calling for the judgment to be applied with prudence and he might have added: with jurisprudence, the prudence of the law and, in particular, of the law of the Treaties, which does not permit the powers of the third pillar to be transferred to the first pillar.
However, since 1962 and its Costa versus ENEL judgment, the Court has been imprudently and continuously carrying out a federal .
As the great British legal expert, Dicey, said: judges must be lions, but lions under the throne, being circumspect that they do not check or oppose any points of sovereignty.
Putting someone in prison is a matter for criminal law.
It is not a trivial matter.
Â Â  Mr President, although I am a lawyer I am not here to accuse Commissioner Frattini of anything at all this evening, he will be pleased to hear, other than to say that I think this is such an important ruling that the consequences of it seem to me to be far from clear at this time.
I believe there is a danger here of over-applying the principle of Community competence into national domestic criminal law and indeed, following as it does from the remarks of Chancellor SchÃŒssel at the start of the Austrian Presidency calling for the ECJ to hand powers back to Member States, it does not seem to me to sit too easily in that context.
I welcome, however, the generally cautious approach and the limited interpretation of the ruling which is to apply to a very few isolated cases set out in both the Gargani report and the Commissionerâs response.
I think that the exercise of any form of legal precedent here must be controlled very strongly and effectively.
I think that competence in criminal law is national, not European, in general terms, and I think the presumption must remain in that way.
Whatever the general arguments, I disagree with the Commissioner.
There is absolutely no justification to call for the activation of the passerelle clause in ArticleÂ 42 of the Treaty on the basis of this ruling itself.
Indeed, if we were to do that it would set quite a dangerous and unwelcome precedent.
At the end of the day, my view is that whilst this is an unusual ruling, it has to be looked at on an individual basis and in a limited application.
Any attempt by the Commission or the Court to try to use this in a more extensive way would be unacceptable and would call into question the operations of the ECJ in this field.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank the Commission for its communication on the consequences of the judgment of the Court on criminal sanctions and I agree with the conclusions it makes.
Indeed, I believe that the interpretation of this judgment should not apply solely to the environment, and this so as to strengthen Parliament's democratic control and to thus enable Europeans to be better protected.
The Court judgment has made it possible to clarify the powers in relation to criminal provisions between the first and the third pillar.
It therefore stipulates that the aim and content of the act itself be taken into account in order to establish the need for criminal sanctions to be laid down.
That allows us to conclude that the protection of fundamental rights is an area to which the consequences of this judgment can be extended.
Special attention should be paid to fundamental rights and to the protection of the Union's interests when resorting to criminal sanctions.
I do not believe, however, that we had to limit ourselves to resorting to these two areas alone, and AmendmentÂ 16, which I tabled with my colleague, MrsÂ Berger, is along these lines.
That is why I call on you to support it.
Finally, this judgment is a new signal calling on us to provide for, by means of ArticleÂ 42, and as you have said, the communitisation of all aspects of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
I will say it this evening: this would make it possible to ensure greater legal certainty and, above all, more coherent criminal measures.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I rather think that the September judgment represents a very exciting challenge.
I taught law for many years at various universities, and this report by the committee for which MrÂ Gargani was rapporteur would not be given particularly high marks by the Faculty of Law at the University of Copenhagen.
Firstly, there is a contradiction, which is ignored.
PointÂ 47 of the judgment states that criminal legislation and the rules for dealing with criminal matters â that is to say criminal procedural law â do not fall within the Communityâs competence.
For all that, the judgment then takes a huge political leap forward by stating that this finding cannot, however, prevent the Community legislature from taking measures relating to the criminal law of the Member States under certain conditions in which such action is found to be necessary.
It is my humble conviction that this procedure â whereby, in the absence of an existing legal base, we ourselves create a legal base on political foundations - is absurd.
Moreover, it will most certainly meet with serious resistance in the best developed democracies in the European Union.
In this connection I would be so bold as to refer to the Nordic democracies.
These countries will not join a system that can manipulate the legal base in such a way, quite apart from the fact that it is, of course, perfectly reasonable for criminal legislation and procedure to fall within the competence of the Member States, this being â as was also said at the start â a state of affairs that, to a large degree, reflects a legal tradition that cannot be harmonised and should not be dictated.
There is therefore no legal base, and I would for that reason recommend voting in favour of the amendment tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am somewhat surprised at the Commissionâs explanation of the Courtâs ruling.
In 2002, I backed the Oomen-Ruijten report and also the appeal against the framework decision, but at the time, the Commission repeatedly impressed on us that the directive and appeal against the decision should not be seen as a first step towards harmonisation of criminal law in other areas.
It was on the basis of that guarantee alone that I was able to support the appeal against the framework decision at the time.
It now turns out that the Commission is giving the ruling an interpretation entirely of its own, would like to extend it still further, and is also seeking harmonisation in other areas.
This contradicts what we were told at the time.
Had I known in 2002 what I know now, I would have voted against the Oomen-Ruijten report.
The Gargani report does contain a few positive points, including paragraphs 8 and 13, but as long as paragraphs 4 and 5 are included, I, together with my group, have no choice but to vote against the motion for a resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, the creation of a unified legal system based on common values and the principles of the primacy of Community law and close cooperation between the Member States and the European institutions is imperative in order to facilitate the proper functioning of the single internal market of the European Union.
All activities aimed at ensuring effective Community legislation based on the first pillar deserve our support.
The first pillar is the only one that allows European legislation to be adopted while respecting democratic principles, and that ensures appropriate judicial control.
The European Court of Justice ruling of 13Â September is extremely important for the future development of Community law.
The Court ruled that, in order to define clearly the legal basis of a document, a reference must be made to the aims and the content of the document itself.
As a result, the Framework Decision on environmental protection was annulled due to the legal basis being misquoted as the third rather than the first pillar.
In view of this ruling, current legislative proposals whose legal basis may be considered erroneous have to be withdrawn or modified.
Furthermore, we must consider the possibility of starting a legislative procedure aimed at finding a new legal basis for legislative texts adopted under the third pillar which may now, in line with the ruling, be considered to have an erroneous basis.
However, the Courtâs conclusions should not be automatically extended to include all fields covered by the first pillar.
They should be applied to areas which are covered by the basic principles, aims and competences of the Community and specific cases should be investigated on an individual basis within the framework of close cooperation between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.
The Member States are in principle responsible for the appropriate implementation of Community law.
That is why the premise for including criminal law articles under the first pillar should be clear and defined .
Â Â  MrÂ President, someone is cruelly missing from this Chamber this evening, although he was here this afternoon.
How can we tolerate the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that this crucial debate on the consequences of the judgment of the Court of 13Â September 2005 is taking place in the absence of the main party involved, the Council itself?
Was it the Council that imposed this agenda so as to avoid having to publicly acknowledge the profound meaning of its defeat on 13Â September in Luxembourg?
Allow me to act as its spokesperson this evening.
Yes, the Council was defeated that day by a further judicial show of strength.
Yes, despite the rejection of the ratification of the European Constitution that provided for it, the competence pillars have, in fact, just merged.
There are no longer any intergovernmental powers in Europe.
Yes, the Member States can see that an interpretation of the Treaties that they signed is being arbitrarily imposed on them.
That is what the Chairman of the French Constitutional Council, Pierre Mazot, calls Franceâs vitiated consent.
Yes, this uncontrolled communitisation of criminal law knows no bounds because, while it was at it, the Commission decided to annul nine framework-decisions, a move that, after the environment, will enable it to lay its hands on criminal law in relation to illegal immigration, to marine pollution and even to intellectual property.
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen â and particularly the French Members among us â what purpose do our Interior and our Justice ministers now serve?
On behalf of my group, I tabled AmendmentÂ 1, which is a very sensible amendment and one to which every independent Member could easily be won over.
It is an alternative that simply calls on the Member States to regain control of the treaties that they sign.
Yet, how many independent Members are there in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen?
Continue to get round the nations with your federalisation of the legal system and your other plan B and you will see 2007 replicate 2005.
Â Â  Mr President, by means of the Framework Decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law, the Council aimed to respond to the worrying increase in crimes against the environment, and this objective should be applauded.
However, we cannot applaud the way in which the Council has acted, as it has led to a dispute and a twofold dispute at that.
The first dispute is institutional, as the Treaties in force do not provide a simple and clear answer as to who should do what in the EU.
As a result, there is no clear division of competences between the institutions of the Union and particularly between the Council, the Member States and Parliament.
The second level of the dispute concerns the legal basis cited by the Council when making its controversial decision.
The Council mistakenly cited the third pillar as the legal basis when the subject matter does not fall under the third pillar but under the competences of the EU in the field of environmental protection.
Therefore, the Council did not have the right to make the aforementioned decision.
By doing so, it impinged on the competences granted to the Community on the basis of the Community Treaty and infringed the Treaty on European Union, which grants priority to these competences.
Furthermore, by choosing an inappropriate legal basis, the Council prevented the European Parliament from having any influence on matters relating to the protection of the environment which, without a doubt, are Community issues and fall within its remit.
I am sure that if the European Union had a constitution which set out the competences and defined who does what in the European Union, then this dispute would not be taking place.
We would have clear legal guidelines and the European Court of Justice would not be required to intervene.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0192/2006) by MrsÂ Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council framework decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters [COM(2005)0475 C6-0436/2005 2005/0202(CNS)].
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the European Union is renowned in the world for the high level of protection of fundamental rights and, in particular, of protection of personal data that it guarantees its citizens.
This principle is thus enshrined in ArticleÂ 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
In the Community context, two directives regulate the fair processing of these data in connection with the internal market, and when Europeans make a purchase via the Internet, for example, the company from which they make that purchase is obliged to request their permission to use their data in order to send them offers.
Europeans are therefore informed of the way in which their data is used and, fundamentally, they can request that those data be rectified.
However, this European area of data protection has a serious deficiency right now.
There is no coordination among the 25 Member States when it comes to protecting the personal data used in the context of police or judicial work.
At a time when we are working towards the implementation of a European area of freedom, security and justice, this coordination has become absolutely crucial.
Indeed, the Member States' police forces need to work in close cooperation with each other and exchange information in order to combat organised crime effectively.
We can enhance this cooperation, but we must make sure that data relating to Europeans is protected in the same way throughout Europe.
I would point out that the European Parliament has, for many years now, been calling for an instrument designed to protect data in the context of judicial and police cooperation.
Consequently, we welcome this proposal by the Commission, and the purpose of my report is to enhance this proposal so as to ensure coherence with the existing data protection instruments coming under the first pillar.
We also want this framework-decision not to be limited to the information exchanged among the Member States, but to ensure a minimal level of data protection within the Member States themselves.
Indeed, if that were not the case, we could thus have two different data protection systems being used in the same investigation.
That would not only threaten the protection of Europeans, but would also complicate the work done by the police and the judiciary.
We have enhanced the guarantees relating to the use of personal data by, and the transmission of personal data to, private parties when those parties process them in connection with public administration.
We also want guarantees regarding the use of personal data by, and the transmission of personal data to, third countries.
I would point out that the Court annulled this Council decision on the agreement between the European Community and the United States on the processing and transmission of personal data, together with the Commission adequacy decision regarding the adequate level of protection of these data, and it did so on account of inappropriate legal bases, as you are aware.
Mr FrattiniÂ told us that he wanted to submit a new proposal for an agreement on the basis of the third pillar.
We therefore need data protection legislation for the third pillar, and I welcome the Commissionâs support in this regard.
When the directive on data retention was adopted in December 2005, the Council made a moral commitment before the European Parliament â I am keen to point this out - to swiftly adopt, while abiding by a form of sincere cooperation among the European institutions, the text on data protection.
However, the adoption of this text has been severely delayed and there is now the danger that it will not be adopted in the course of this year.
We therefore want the Council to make clear commitments before us today, especially on the crucial points for the European Parliament, and we are waiting for it to present us with a timeframe for the adoption of this framework-decision.
I am very disappointed by the Council at the moment.
If the Council were not to do this, then the European Parliament would feel betrayed and its confidence would be seriously shaken for the future, and we do not want that.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Roure, the rapporteur on this very important and well-balanced report.
I recall that in the Hague Programme there is the clear obligation to ensure the exchange of law enforcement information under the principle of availability with effect from January 2008.
At the same time, key conditions in the area of data protection shall be strictly observed.
Therefore, the quick adoption of the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar is indispensable.
Security policy, in particular anti-terrorist policy, must respect both the obligation of the State to protect citizens against serious crimes, including terrorism, as well as the fundamental rights of the citizens to their private and family life and to personal data protection.
I believe that we must ensure that there is coherence and uniformity in the principles of data protection in the European Union, , between the first and the third pillar.
The Judgment of the European Court on the PNR agreement, as Mrs Roure rightly said, shows the necessity of a coherent and complete data protection regime at European level, based on clear, substantial data protection principles.
In this context, in my view, the framework decision would constitute an important step forward.
The Commission has already proposed that the framework decision on data protection should be implemented by the end of 2006, before the application of the principle of availability.
So I join the European Parliament and MrsÂ Roure in a plea to the Council to accelerate the agreement on the framework decision, taking into full account the position expressed by this Parliament.
As far as the scope of the framework decision is concerned, as many chapters as possible must apply to domestic situations, as already proposed by the Commission.
In my view Member States must agree on common data protection principles that apply to all processing of personal data by the police and the judicial authorities for the purpose of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, as the common basis for the exchange of personal data in full respect of such principles.
As far as the Europol/Eurojust system is concerned, the Commission agrees that in principle further approximation and facilitation of the European data protection regime should be ensured after the adoption of the framework decision in consultation with all the bodies concerned.
The concrete time schedule might need further examination.
I am open to additional data protection safeguard specifications concerning biometric identifiers and/or DNA data and will look more closely at the European Parliamentâs suggestions in this very important and sensitive field.
Taking into account the position of Parliament, I will reflect on the concrete procedure for assessing the level of data protection in a third country or an international body.
Now in the report you are to adopt a solution which would provide that the Commission, after consulting the Council and Parliament, may establish that a third country or an international body ensures an appropriate level of protection within the meaning of the framework decision.
As you can guess, I am not personally against such a solution.
We will have to work closely with the Council because we need unanimity so that the final solution in any case provides, first, a mechanism ensuring that when the other conditions provided for by the framework decision are met, an adequate level of protection exists; and second, that Parliament is consulted beforehand and that due account is taken of its opinion.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats attaches great importance to common guarantees for the protection of privacy at Union level.
Not only will these nurture mutual trust between Member States with regard to the exchange of data, but will also benefit the prosecution of punishable offences and the willingness to exchange data for such prosecution.
You are completely right when you point at the availability of data, because it is important that we can make real progress in that respect with a view to public safety.
Before we can do this, this step must be taken to protect privacy.
Looking back at previous discussions, I, on behalf of my group, should like to pay the rapporteur a huge compliment, for MrsÂ Roure has compiled a balanced report and the realistic and measured manner in which she handled the discussions with the Commission was a demonstration of her expertise.
She backed us up all the way in a number of areas.
Accordingly, we did not go as far as to want to ban the exchange of information with third countries.
We came to the right decision together.
Secondly, we refused to follow â and will refuse to do so in future â those who want secret services to fall within this remit.
Thirdly, the rapporteur has not brought any pressure to bear on the Council either in order to stop the discussion of the reports on the Financial Information System (FIS) and the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) until this report has been completed.
In doing so, MrsÂ Roure has done a great job.
This is an even-handed report which strikes the right balance between protecting privacy on the one hand, and creating opportunities for the improved exchange of data on the other.
This is something we owe to our citizens, if we really want the Union to do what it can to safeguard our security.
Thank you once again, MrsÂ Roure, for your cooperation.
Â Â  Mr President, it makes eminent common sense in todayâs world to have enhanced exchange of information and cooperation between our police services and, indeed, our judicial authorities.
It is not possible, in my view, to combat transnational crime without such cooperation, whether the crime is driven by anti-democratic forces which use terror as a political weapon, or by straightforward self-enrichment through money laundering, people trafficking or drug smuggling.
The cooperation needs to be both within the European Union and between the European Union and third countries, but it should not be allowed unless there is stringent protection for human rights and citizensâ freedoms.
This is why I wholeheartedly support here tonight the proposal of my colleague, Mrs Roure, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Some of our Member States are resisting elements of the proposed cooperation, not on grounds of protecting human rights but on purely ideological grounds of protecting national sovereignty.
This might at least be understandable if they were consistent.
However, the selfsame states are quite happily prepared to accept at face value assurances from the US about its extraordinary rendition network, which transfers suspects from country to country, in and out of EU territory and even to third countries where we know that torture is used.
This practice is trampling all over our Member Statesâ sovereignty and the US has even admitted that it does not accept our definitions of torture.
Our Member States should cooperate while insisting on proper protection concerning the use of information and for the people about whom information is exchanged, as is proposed be done in this report.
To be consistent, however, our Member States must in practice also insist that the US respect the civil and human rights of the people it has illegally transported, and follow up their call that GuantÃ¡namo should be closed by making it clear to the US that its approach is increasing the threat of terror and is the best recruiting sergeant that fundamentalists of all persuasions have had for many years.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Vice-President, MrsÂ Roure deserves warm thanks for this report, which has already received deservedly appreciative comments from various Members.
As I see it, all the groups have worked together to put together a really outstanding document, not least considering the fact that some of them had been working towards this sort of report and constantly stressing the need for one long before I was elected to this House.
The primary reason why this report is so much more urgently needed now than it was before has to do with the information age in which we are now living.
It is worth bearing in mind that the total data stored by European authorities amounts, not to hundreds of thousands, or even to millions, but to billions of units of data touching upon the personality of every individual, in that the information stored could, with ill intent â which I am not, however, ascribing to any state â be brought together to compile profiles in order to find out what those citizens we disapprove of are getting up to.
This report is made all the more urgently necessary by the prospect of these quantities of data increasing still further.
Systems such as EURODAC and APIS exist already, but are yet to be implemented, and the visa information system is in the course of being developed.
SIS â the second-generation Schengen information system â is in place, and there may well soon also be, in the third pillar, the storage and transfer of information on air passengers, and so these billions of data units will increase still further.
To that one must add the Commission communication on interoperability and synergy and enhancing the efficiency of European databases, the effect of which in practice will be to connect these databases with one another, so that â once the technical problems have been overcome â the exchange of data will be made much simpler.
The problem is, though, that the people who want to protect this data, are often depicted as a bunch of crackpots who are incapable of rationally balancing fundamental rights against the right to security.
Thank heaven this House has not, in this instance, allowed itself to be pushed into this sort of corner and forced to play off fundamental rights against security, for what definitely does endanger public security is a reduction in fundamental rights.
I am very grateful to MrsÂ Roure for saving us Liberals a great deal of work by incorporating an incredible number of amendments and proposals that originated from Peter Hustinx, the European Data Protection Commissioner, so that means that we are in full agreement.
This House has but few swords to hand, and I think MrsÂ Roure has realised that, but the willingness, if need be, to halt the progress of SIS and VIS shows just how important this report is.
Â Â  . Mr President, like others before me, I would like to thank Mrs Roure very much on behalf of my group for the work that she has done on this report and the improvements we think have been brought to the initial proposal.
I also welcome the Commissionerâs comments tonight in terms of his strong commitment to a rapid completion of the timetable for this framework decision.
Parliament, like the Commission, also feels that as we move further down the road of data collection and data exchange, it is absolutely essential that we have safeguards in place.
If more and more data is to be readily available on that principle â online and cross-border â we need those clear rules: not least for the agencies involved â they need to be clear about what it is they have and how it can be used â but equally, because people need to have confidence that this data will be used appropriately.
They want to feel that it will be protected and not easily available to private parties.
So we agree on the need for strict regulation and penal sanctions in that area.
We are also clear â not least because of the recent issues about transfer of passenger data â that when we are handing data to third countries, when they are involved, we need clear safeguards as to where that data may end up and under what circumstances.
We also welcome the fact that their data, too, will be assessed against fundamental rights.
I think it is a tragedy that we have to think in those terms these days, but we do.
Maybe what we are looking at here is a new definition of a âsafeâ third country, at least in terms of its information.
People also want to have confidence that data will be used appropriately and for the purpose for which it was collected, although we think it is totally appropriate that different categories of data, whether on suspects, convicted people, witnesses, victims, etc., are differently treated.
Again, it gives clarity and facilitates communication.
We also welcome the amendment stipulating that data relating to people not under suspicion should be used solely for the purpose collected.
We hope that Member States would operate to that standard domestically, but I know of at least one where DNA data has been retained when it should not have been.
So the additional safeguards concerning DNA and biometrics put into Article 6 are also very welcome to us.
We need data we can trust â maybe that is something we cannot guarantee in a framework directive; but we also need to have confidence that the data collected is used appropriately and that rights are safeguarded while we are able to trace criminal activity more effectively.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in discussing the Roure report, we are debating a further measure in the interests of greater security for our citizens as the Hague Programme is realised, for which cooperation between police and justice authorities is needed.
Such cooperation cannot be put in place unless the relevant information is exchanged and made available, but the whole scheme of things needs to be subject to appropriate control, and this is where the rapporteur deserves congratulation on having succeeded in striking the necessary balance between, on the one hand, the protection of personal data and hence of private life, and, on the other, the improved cooperation between police forces and justice authorities in the interests of public security, which is absolutely vital.
There is no doubt that this report has also created the conditions for reflection on how data protection can be made more uniform throughout all our Member States.
Thirdly, it also creates the conditions under which databases such as the Schengen information system and the visa information system â which will in future exist in a new form â can be used jointly and under which cross-connections can be established to the benefit of security.
This report, then, endorses the principle of the interoperability of databases, and that is something I regard as a quite decisive quantum leap in terms of the European Unionâs future security policy.
This new security package, which we are discussing today in the context of the Hague Programme, will, however, be complete only as and when we have adopted the regulations on the visa information system and on Schengen II.
Â Â  Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Roure.
However I also regret very strongly the absence of the Council tonight, because I am afraid too many of us are preaching to the converted: it is the Council that we have to convert.
I want to add my voice to those who have emphasised how essential this measure is.
That is why Parliament has been asking for it for many years.
Now, however, in the era of all the EU databases such as the Visa Information System, the Schengen Information System, Eurodac and the whole question of access by law enforcement â the policy of interoperability â and, of course, the question of the transfer of data to third countries, including the air passenger data agreement, it is more vital than ever.
It is a great mistake to think that data protection somehow obstructs police and security work: it actually enhances the prospect of cooperation by increasing trust and confidence, including public confidence.
So I believe Parliament will do everything it can to achieve this measure.
As the rapporteur on the Visa Information System, I see a triple package: the first-pillar regulation; the measure on access to the VIS for police and intelligence services; and this data protection framework decision.
We have codecision on the first-pillar measure, so the message I want to send very strongly to the Council is that it needs to take account of that.
I want the VIS to be on the statute book as soon as possible; but we need to have the other elements in place as well.
Â Â  â Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has long been seeking a new legal framework for data protection under the third pillar, comparable with the rules in force in Community law.
We want to deliver the same level of protection, albeit taking account of the specific nature of police and legal work.
We have to acknowledge that there is currently insufficient protection.
The recent adoption of the proposed directive on retention of data was accompanied by a clear call for adequate guarantees to be adopted as part of this framework decision.
As rapporteur on three legislative measures on the creation of the Schengen II information system, I sought to introduce the amendments needed to ensure the adoption of this framework decision.
I also sent a letter to MrÂ Frattini, calling on the Commission to update the rules on data protection in the SIS II decision for the purposes of consistency.
It is, after all, extremely important that the new laws apply both to SIS II and to the VIS.
The resolution created by the judgment of the Court of Justice of 30Â May, which overturned the decisions on the transfer of PNR data to the United States, will entail third pillar decisions, as MrÂ Frattini said last Monday.
All of this reinforces the idea that it is of vital, pressing importance to adopt a legal instrument that ensures personal data protection outside the first pillar.
Consequently, the adoption of this framework decision is both urgently needed and extremely important.
I should like to congratulate MrsÂ Roure on her report.
I support the amendments that she tabled and that were adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Home Affairs.
These proposals clarify the principles and guarantees that we would like to see safeguarded.
I also support the rapporteur's request to postpone the vote on the final resolution until the next plenary session.
Â Â  Mr President, this framework decision is undoubtedly necessary.
It is necessary in order to increase opportunities for cooperation between the judiciary in the Member States.
It is also necessary because it will increase the scope of personal data protection, thus increasing the rights of private persons within the framework of third pillar cooperation.
Following the terrorist attacks which shook our continent, we are aware how important such effective cooperation is.
Unfortunately, there still seems to be a lack of mutual trust concerning cooperation between the judicial systems of Member States.
In many cases this is justified, as the level of data protection often varies.
However, if we want to build a common area of justice, freedom and security and achieve mutual recognition in future in terms of court rulings, decisions such as todayâs framework decision are definitely necessary.
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has tabled amendments to this draft which will certainly improve it and make it more precise, and bring it in line with what we already have in place concerning the protection of personal data under the first pillar.
However, we should not forget two general issues when debating this matter.
I hope, and this is the first problem, that personal data protection regulated by this framework decision will be in line with the data protection measures used when implementing the principle of accessibility within the framework of cooperation governed by the treaty signed in PrÃŒm.
On the other hand, I hope that adopting this instrument will mean that the European Union institutions will no longer have any reason to postpone the work on the VIS and SIS legislative package, as adoption of the latter is very much in the interests of the new Member States.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0187/2006) by MrÂ Varvitsiotis, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council framework decision on the European enforcement order and the transfer of sentenced persons between Member States of the EU [07307/2005 C6-0139/2005 2005/0805(CNS)].
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Varvitsiotis.
I welcome this initiative from Austria, Finland and Sweden, which aims to apply the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving the privation of liberty, for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union.
The initiative will facilitate the social rehabilitation of offenders.
It should in fact allow for rehabilitation measures to be taken in the state of nationality or permanent legal residence.
One of the most controversial issues to arise in the discussion of this proposal in Parliament and the Council is the issue of the consent of the offender.
I generally agree with your view and that of the rapporteur.
More precisely, I consider that consent is not necessary for transfer to a Member State to which the sentenced person is to be deported or transfer to the Member State of residence of the sentenced person.
However, consent should be necessary for the transfer to the Member State of nationality of the sentenced person if that Member State is not the Member State of residence of the sentenced person.
Finally, I fully subscribe to your amendment aimed at adding a provision that the victims of the crime shall also be informed.
The Commission also considers it necessary that victims be informed, but only at their request, of the transfer of a sentenced person, because in this scenario the enforcement of any claims for damages becomes more complicated.
I once again thank the rapporteur and can assure you that I will support most of your amendments during the discussions in the Council.
Â Â  Mr President, the question we are debating tonight is not new.
It was first raised in March 1983 in the Council of Europe Convention, which all the Member States have ratified.
This Convention made provision for sentenced persons to be transferred to serve the remainder of their sentence only to their state of nationality and only with their consent and that of the states involved.
However, due to bureaucratic formalities, this system did not bring about any results, hence the need for the additional protocol of 18Â December 1997, which did not require the sentenced person's consent.
However, this protocol has not been ratified by all the Member States. This resulted in the initiative of Austria, Finland and Sweden, which aims to speed up the procedure in their Member State of origin or permanent residence.
The transfer of sentenced persons to serve their sentence aims mainly to make their life easier in prison and to make their reintegration into society easier once they are released, because it is logical that a sentenced person in a prison in his state of nationality will find it easier to interact with other prisoners, to speak his own language and not just that: he will also be able to attend vocational training courses, which will contribute to his smooth reintegration into society, and it will be much easier for him to have contact with his family and friends.
Support for his family will be an important element in this.
Simplifying procedures, so that the transfer of sentenced persons is as flexible and with as little bureaucracy as possible, is our basic objective.
I believe that what has been achieved is that the transfer criteria have been determined better, the principle of and the principle of specialty have been strengthened and the rights have been supported of victims, who must be informed about the whole procedure, including the order to transfer the sentenced person.
I agree with the Commissioner, who says that victims should only be informed on request; however, in order for victims to know about this, they must first be told that such a procedure is under way.
The proposal by the Member States refers only to 32 serious crimes and is based on a procedure for converting the sanction to another penalty which is compatible with the right of the executing state.
These positions, as unanimously voted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, simplify and make more flexible the proposal by Austria, Finland and Sweden, which made provision for the Member States to permit the transit of a sentenced person on receipt of numerous documents.
We also amended the deadlines set for each stage of the procedure, in order to make them more realistic and, at the same time, to allow a considerable period of time for the sentence to be served in the executing state, so that the reintegration procedure is more complete and more effective.
We also regulated the issues of amnesties and pardons, which are raised following consultations between the issuing state and the executing state.
I think that this proposal is another important step towards the convergence of criminal law in the Member States of the European Union, which is an ambitious objective, but an objective which we must bear in mind, so that we can, at some point, unify criminal law.
Finally, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other political groups and everyone who tabled amendments for their excellent cooperation.
I think that the Committee on Civil Liberties has taken a huge step in the direction of the unification of criminal law with this proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, my home country, Sweden, is one of the countries that has taken the initiative with this proposal.
My party pushed this issue very hard in the election campaign.
We are therefore very pleased and very grateful that it has now got to this stage.
I would like to say a particularly warm thank you to MrÂ Varvitsiotis for his constructive work.
In Sweden, we have a good deal of crime that is committed by people from across the Baltic Sea.
For us, it seems quite reasonable for many of these criminals to be able to serve their sentences in their home countries.
What is more, it is possible to observe that it can perhaps sometimes be more of a deterrent to apply this principle.
In Sweden, we have discovered that our prisons are regarded as having a very strong international âforce of attractionâ.
I think it reasonable for it to be possible for criminals to be transferred to the countries with which they have the strongest connections and for them then to serve their sentences there.
The rapporteur developed this line of argument very well and also discussed the important social side of the issue, namely the family and social attachment, which is a strong and important argument.
Since we are now developing the entire area of penal law and the police, we must, of course, ensure that we can transfer convicted criminals in a simple and less bureaucratic way.
Quite simply, we need a flexible mechanism for carrying this out, something which this framework decision will certainly contribute to.
The framework decision under discussion here also establishes the right of sentenced persons to state their opinion, which is of course important, while at the same time the criteria governing transfers are admirably robust.
I would like to conclude by pointing out how unreasonable I believe it is that the Council is not represented here this evening.
To neglect the debate in Parliament, which represents the interests of the people, when we are discussing such important issues rooted in an initiative from the Council itself I regard as an institutional affront, particularly when we are debating data protection issues, which are such a hot topic all over Europe.
I deeply regret the fact that the Presidency is not present.
Â Â  . Mr President, with a view to fighting all kinds of crime in the European Union, we should promote mutual trust between national judicial authorities and strengthen the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters.
The initiative by certain Member States aims to speed up the process for transferring persons sentenced in one Member State to another Member State of the European Union to which the person is in some way connected.
For example, they may be a citizen of that country, have leave to remain there indefinitely or be closely linked to that country in terms of prison sentences, or other security measures, handed down to them.
Moreover, the decision to transfer a sentenced person to another country to serve their punishment depends on the likelihood of better conditions being provided for their social rehabilitation.
This is something that I would like to stress.
However, we should pay close attention to the differences in the sentences meted out in different Member States.
It is important to ensure that the sentences handed down in one Member State take account of the justice system implementing that sentence.
The victim or the person harmed by the convicted person should be informed about the transfer of the sentenced person to another Member State.
This was the position adopted by the Council in its framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings.
Their equal treatment must be guaranteed, as must their dignity and right to participate in the trial, and account must be taken of their situation in the event of claims for damages.
We should do all we can to ensure that the transfer procedure for sentenced persons is efficient, by getting rid of unnecessary red tape and creating a clearly defined, binding legal framework.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the very cooperative arrangements he established, which enabled our committee to arrive at its conclusions.
Commissioner, I have a little story for you.
Imagine two prisoners, both of whom are citizens of the same Member State and who are both in prison in another Member State.
They have committed the same crime.
They have received identical sentences.
After several years, both are eligible for transfer back to their home Member State.
One has behaved beautifully, has been a model prisoner, has repented, has learned and has changed, while the other has behaved very badly, is unreformed and needs more help.
However, and this is the problem I want to draw your attention to, the information on the two prisoners cannot be transferred back across the borders with the prisoners, because present-day data privacy laws prevent the transfer of data across frontiers.
This means that the receiving Member State has no idea as to which of the prisoners is a continuing threat, and which is safe to release back into society.
Commissioner, could you please take action to ensure that the data can travel with the prisoners when we get to that stage?
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to improve standards in the quality and efficiency of justice.
This is a very sensitive area that varies appreciably across the Member States.
Hence the need to strengthen mutual trust whereby legal decisions are mutually recognised.
Confidence in the quality and efficiency of the legal system of other partners in the Union contributes towards the gradual development of a European legal culture.
This framework-decision is a further step in this direction and will also help strengthen the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty.
Speeding up the transfer of sentenced persons to another Member State of which they are nationals or to a particular State with which that person is linked in some way increases the potential to achieve social rehabilitation.
I wish to commend MrÂ Varvitsiotis on his report and on the excellent proposals that he submitted to us, which I support in full and which are worthy of the unanimous support of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
The sentenced person does need adequate guarantees such as a prior hearing before the sentence is delivered, as MrsÂ CederschiÃ¶ld pointed out.
The principle of speciality, whereby the person is not tried for acts other than those for which he is serving his sentence, must also be upheld.
The victims of sentenced persons must also be kept informed both of the existence of an application for the recognition and transfer of the sentence, and of the result of the trial and the nature of the transfer.
I also agree that under no circumstances should it be possible to convert the sentence into a financial penalty or to increase the punishment imposed by the Member State in question.
Â Â  Mr President, under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which has been ratified by all the Member States, sentenced persons may be transferred, to serve the balance of their sentences, under three conditions: to their state of nationality, with their consent and with that of the states involved.
The current initiative differs in that it provides a fast-track mechanism for the recognition and enforcement by a Member State of sentences involving deprivation of freedom or security measures imposed on that person by a court of another Member State.
According to the text, the person has to be a national of that Member State, be legally resident there, or have close links with it.
There is a need for some form of clarification, and for the criteria to be made more distinct, in the sense that, at least as laid down in the text, there is not always a clear distinction between nationals, legal residence and close links.
There is also a need to further clarify what is meant by âclose linksâ.
To conclude, may I refer briefly to a scenario in which the transfer of a sentenced person is to be recommend for humanitarian reasons relating to that personâs family.
I was recently approached to evaluate the possibility of whether Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi, who is serving a sentence in Scotland for the Lockerbie tragedy, could serve his sentence in Malta.
In this scenario, that would only be possible if the criteria were distinct and the concept of âclose linksâ were interpreted very broadly.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0124/2006) by MrsÂ Brepoels, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction [COM(2005)0399 C6-0256/2005 2005/0166(COD)].
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important this evening that we are having a debate on the Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon.
This is a successful European agency, which has shown itself to be particularly effective at implementing our European strategy for preventing and combating drug addiction.
I should just like to mention a few figures on drug-taking in Europe, which I find quite shocking.
These are data from the Lisbon monitoring centre itself.
Every month, 1.5Â million European citizens use cocaine, 9.5Â million use cannabis, and 3Â million use this drug on a more or less habitual basis, meaning every day.
Moreover, the use of mixtures of drugs, often taken with alcohol, is rising sharply.
Lastly, the use of ecstasy has also increased, and sadly it is being produced more and more often in Europe.
There are over 1Â million Europeans who use ecstasy on a regular basis.
I am pleased to note that this proposal is based on ArticleÂ 152 of the Treaty, which allows Parliament to play a full role in this area.
I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ Brepoels, for her report, which I consider important and well-balanced, and for her efforts to reach an agreement on the Commission proposal at first reading under the codecision procedure.
I believe that the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur will be accepted, thus making it possible to bring this report to a successful conclusion.
I can say in advance that I agree with most of the amendments, with a few exceptions that I should like to mention quickly.
I am worried about Amendments 8, 15, 18 and 32 to 39.
I shall just make a brief comment on AmendmentÂ 15, which provides for the European Parliament to issue an opinion on the centreâs three-year programme of work.
The interinstitutional agreement gives Parliament a legislative role and not an executive role, and so I think that issuing an opinion or approving the programme of work of an executive centre would mean departing from Parliamentâs role of political control.
AmendmentÂ 18 concerns an issue that is subject to the Commissionâs horizontal competence, relating to the regulation of some 18 European agencies.
This amendment cannot be accepted, not on questions of merit, but because political agreement is currently being sought on the horizontal proposal.
Lastly, Amendments 32 to 39 make me hesitate because they seem to have no bearing on the compromise that has been reached among the three institutions, in that they would give the Lisbon centre a practical evaluation role, which I think is frankly alien to the actual role of the Lisbon centre.
The main purpose of this centre is to provide instruments to facilitate evaluation and monitoring by the Member States and the Commission.
Consequently, I think it would be inadvisable to give the centre an autonomous evaluation role.
Apart from these objections, I support both the report and the rapporteurâs amendments.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the proposal we are discussing here today has been around for some time, for the legal discussion goes back to late 2003 when the Commission submitted its initial proposal.
Parliament subsequently issued an opinion in April 2004, whereupon, following discussions in the Council, it was decided to change the legal basis, whereupon the codecision procedure became applicable.
This Commission proposal covers a number of aspects.
In fact, it regulates the codification of three previous amendments, extends the Centreâs role and has made changes in line with the new European reality following the enlargement by the ten new countries.
Accordingly, the Centre will in future focus more on new trends in the area of drug use, including the combination of legal and illegal psychoactive substances.
In addition, the proposal also aims to introduce a few changes with a view to bringing the bodies of the Centre into line with everyday practice and, as I said, the EUâs enlargement.
We are convinced that the proposed amendments are all changes that will benefit the Centreâs efficiency.
Accordingly, it is true that we back the request for more objective and comparable data, for the executive bureau to be anchored in the Centreâs rules, for regular assessments of the Centreâs activities and also for the Reitox network of national focal points.
Finally, we set great store by six-yearly external assessments.
During the discussion in our Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, a number of important points were added.
Since the Centreâs principal role is collating and distributing information on drugs and drug use, Parliament believes that the exchange of information on best practices in tackling the drugs issue could add value to the Member Statesâ policy.
With regard to the composition of the executive committee, it appears appropriate, alongside the chairman and vice chairman, to send another two members of the Management Board who represent the Member States, as well as two Committee representatives.
In that case, of course, decisions need to be taken by consensus.
It also strikes us as desirable that along with the Centreâs Director, the Centreâs Chairperson can also be heard by Parliament.
We also take the view that far-reaching cooperation of national focal points with organisations that are active in this area allow for a prompt and adequate follow-up of the European drugs situation and enable the Member States to respond more adequately to new developments and phenomena involving drugs and drug use.
The main points of discussion with the Council in this dossier concerned the composition of the scientific committee and the procedure to appoint the Director.
Indeed, the scientific committee is tasked to issue advice about scientific issues regarding the Centre's activities.
Parliament takes the view that this committee must be restricted to no more than 15 members who are selected on the basis of their expertise via an open procedure, rather than on the basis of where they come from, namely one representative from each Member State, as had been the case in the past.
Since at the moment, as the Commissioner already stated, a proposal applicable to all agencies is pending in respect of the procedure for the appointment of the Director and the extension of his mandate, it was decided to revisit the provisions of the regulation establishing the Centre and await the outcome of these negotiations.
Since the start of the discussion of this dossier, it has indeed always been our intention to reach agreement between the three institutions, hence also with the Council and the Commission, at first reading.
I am delighted that, after much debating, we succeeded in this.
After all, the proposed compromise contains nearly all Parliamentâs proposals and we are therefore convinced that there is actually nothing that stands in the way of us reaching agreement or approving the same tomorrow.
I would expressly thank the Austrian Presidency, but also the Commission and certainly also my shadow rapporteurs from all groups for the very constructive working relationship.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to congratulate and thank the rapporteur for the report that has been presented.
We must all agree that the topic of drugs and drug dependency, not only in the Member States of the European Union but also across the wider world, is a delicate topic which has an enormous social and economic impact on society.
Precisely for this reason, it is surely essential and highly desirable to have the closest possible cooperation between all interested sectors of society.
Even though this aim is clearly stated and shared by all, it is very often difficult to agree on how to achieve it.
I welcome the positive changes that appear in this report.
First of all, I appreciate the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, specifically those relating to closer cooperation between the Member States of the Union.
One example of this closer cooperation would be the task of the Centre to provide information on proven approaches, as well as assisting in and facilitating the exchange of information between Member States.
It is accepted that drugs know no borders, and this surely applies doubly to the borders of the EU, whether internal or external.
I regret that the proposal for intensive cooperation with non-EU Member States in suppressing the movement of drugs and the trade in drugs has not been included in the final report, despite the fact that it is precisely from these numerous non-Member States that the greatest volume of drugs flows into Europe.
On the other hand, I welcome the inclusion of the proposal for exchanging data between the European Centre, the UN and the World Health Organisation, which will be an effective means for preventing duplication in data collection and ensuring easier processing.
I also welcome the proposal to introduce active cooperation with Europol, which will be extremely helpful in fighting and suppressing the criminality that is linked to drugs.
The proposal for the Centre to have a duty to provide information to Member States in respect of developments and new trends in drug use is certainly of key importance and will enable higher levels of preparedness and ability to respond on the part of the Member States.
The cooperation between the Centre and the European Parliament, and the increased influence of Parliament, for example in developing a work plan for the Centre, filling the post of director and assessing the work of the Centre is in my view one further step towards the democratisation of European institutions and towards closer monitoring of the work of the European Centre in the future.
I consider the report, as presented by the rapporteur, to be extremely well-balanced and I recommend that it be adopted.
Â Â  .
Mr President, MrÂ Vice-President, the first thing this report does is to endorse what is simply a technical necessity, that is to say, the adaptation of this drugs monitoring centre, but what I see as far more important is what the rapporteur does in the other part of the report, which addresses the issue of how the work of the Monitoring Centre on Drugs can be organised in a more efficient way.
I do not think it is enough for a drugs monitoring centre to do no more that collect data and then publicise them every year in an illustrated document.
There are many more possibilities, and this report, and the rapporteurâs proposals, go much further.
What we need is for the data to be, at last, comparable; there needs to be more analysis of them, with the various drugs policies evaluated in order to make it possible for a recommendation to be made to the Member States on the basis of which strategies are successful and which are not.
What is needed is more cooperation with other organisations, such as the World Health Organisation or the UN, in order, quite simply, to avoid overlaps and duplications, as well as cooperation with Europol in order to tie drugs offences in with the crimes with which they are associated.
This report gives us a chance to extend the Drugs Monitoring Centreâs powers, at least to some degree, which is desirable if the monitoring centre is to carry more weight and offer our Member States real help in the fight against drugs.
Â Â  . Mr President, the work of the EMCDDA is, for me, one of the best examples of the EU having a common goal, a joint interest and an added value, because drugs and drug addiction have a damaging effect on society.
They are a source not only of crime but also of social problems, instability and health hazards.
The policies of various Member States vis-Ã -vis these problems vary greatly.
I believe that it is in the interests of our citizens, especially the young ones, that we Europeans should be big enough to want to learn from one another, to want to ask, without any ideological bias, which policies are the most effective.
Questions that we could have debated in this discussion about the EMCDDA are, for instance: what about the option to provide heroin under medical supervision to the group that is most heavily addicted?
Is that something that helps?
Is cannabis really not dangerous to the health of our citizens?
Have we ever really investigated this?
I am from a Member State that has chosen a somewhat peculiar policy on both of those issues.
I would be one of the first to welcome a very thorough inquiry. I would also be one of the first to want to do away with those policies if they are not effective.
We have not discussed any of that, unfortunately.
We have discussed other things, such as how much influence the Member States will have on the Scientific Committee, how we are going to elect the chairperson of the Management Board, who gets to sit on the Management Board, and whether the European Parliament will have a say on the Executive Committee â not to be confused with the Management Board, which is something completely different.
I want to thank the rapporteur, because she has managed to engage in this institutional debate without jeopardising the goal of the Centre, which is the benchmarking of various Member Statesâ policies â still very much in this report.
I praise the EMCDDA for the work it has done so far, and wish it the best of luck in its work in future.
Â Â  . Mr President, I can be very brief, because most of what needed to be said has been said.
I also wish to thank the rapporteur and express my admiration for all the work she has done on a dossier which has not been easy, for the reasons that have just been outlined by my colleague, Mrs Mastenbroek.
This is an area which is very sensitive and very heavily charged with ideology and national traditions as well.
The aim of the rapporteur to come to an agreement with the other institutions has our full support, and it has had the full support of all the groups from the very start.
It has not been easy, because the text before us is a compromise.
Let us accept that.
Many people in my group would have liked to go much further, like many people in Mrs Mastenbroekâs group, but we have all had to swallow a little bit in order to achieve this compromise.
One of the things we have achieved in this compromise that was very important to us was the independence of the monitoring centre and we all know that there were very strong pressures in order to put the Scientific Committee effectively under national control.
However, we have managed to avoid that, and that is really an achievement worth supporting.
I have been hesitating until the very end, but I can tell Mrs Brepoels that she has our support.
However, in order to keep the compromise alive, we need the support of all the groups and, therefore, I am seeking clarification from the Socialist Group as to whether it will support the compromise, because it is essential to know that before we go to the vote.
In any case, you can count on our support.
Â Â  . Mr President, as I have one minute to speak, I would simply like to draw your attention to the conclusions of the report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.
It is regrettable that these conclusions have not been implemented.
The values espoused by individuals and their behaviour are influenced by what the people in question view as the norm in their social environments.
The second conclusion was that a monitoring policy has more influence on social norms than media campaigns and an educational approach.
If young people in particular view experimenting with drugs as normal and socially acceptable, this is a key factor influencing their values and their behaviour concerning drug consumption.
It is regrettable that such conclusions came at the cost of millions of drug addicts and the deaths of thousands of young people as a result of fatal, experimental liberalisation policies which divided drugs into soft drugs, which were supposedly harmless, and hard drugs.
This policy continues to this day.
Speaking of soft drugs as being safe is a very dangerous form of manipulation which facilitates dependency on drugs and the spread of drug addiction.
Â Â  â The problem of drug use, in particular cocaine, is on the increase, and the number of young people experimenting with drugs in Europe is also growing.
This clearly demonstrates that much remains to be done in the fight against drugs.
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has played an important role in compiling and publishing information on drugs and their use and has encouraged organisations in the Member States to communicate and exchange best practices.
As MrÂ Pirker has pointed out, however, there need to be common criteria and standard data-collection methods, since that is the only way of ensuring that data relating to drug issues are objective, reliable and above all comparable.
A solution needs to be found quickly to the problem of data being unavailable or hardly comparable in some Member States, which hampers general monitoring of the European drugs situation.
I should like to commend MrsÂ Brepoels on this report and on the excellent outcome that she has achieved.
We are adopting this proposed review of the regulation at the end of three years of negotiation, which primarily involves amending the originally agreed legal basis, putting Parliament in the position of co-legislator.
I should like to express my satisfaction at the more prominent role given to the Monitoring Centre, which will take account of emerging trends in poly-drug use, including the combined use of licit and illicit psychoactive substances, and the move to adapt the operation of the Centre's bodies in order to take account of enlargement.
Lastly, I should like to draw attention to the global nature of drug use, which means that we have to place European analysis in a broader context.
It is also important to step up cooperation with non-EU countries, especially as many of the drugs that enter the EU do so from non-EU countries.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot fail to welcome your speech, MrÂ Frattini, because it has accurately highlighted how serious the drug problem is in the European Union.
I agree with what MrÂ Coelho and MrÂ Pirker have said, because the fight against drug taking and trafficking has to be an ever increasing priority for the Union.
It is in fact impossible to address this growing emergency, which has worldwide implications, without the involvement of all the supranational institutions and without constant updates on a situation that is changing all the time.
I therefore welcome the rapporteurâs proposal to strengthen the activities of the European Monitoring Centre, in order to make the exchange of information on the measures adopted by the various Member States increasingly effective and to achieve closer cooperation with Europol.
The consumption of drugs and substances that create dependence varies over time.
Whereas heroin used to cause the greatest alarm in the past, cocaine now prompts more concern because of the way it is spreading among young people, together with the lethal mixes with alcohol that are being used in clubs.
Understanding what is changing in order to prevent and fight the drug problem more effectively is a criterion that we should apply when assessing the monitoring centreâs role.
However, we have a duty in our anti-drug measures not to give in to the permissiveness that so far has only caused an increase in dependence.
For example, it was unacceptable for an Italian Government representative to state that he favoured the possibility of controlled drug use through what are known as âinjecting roomsâ.
Decisions of that kind have never given young people back their freedom.
In that regard, I agree wholeheartedly with the words of Don Gelmini, a priest who is a leading international figure in the fight for the rehabilitation of drug addicts, who said that fighting drugs with drugs is an aberration; it is like reopening lunatic asylums to cure the mentally ill.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0189/2006) by MrsÂ Åœdanoka, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on a framework strategy for non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all [2005/2191(INI)].
Â Â  . Mr President, the report on the framework strategy for non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all, which has been adopted by an overwhelming majority of the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is a synthesis of the efforts of all those involved, including the representatives of all the large political groups.
I am very grateful to my shadow rapporteurs, and to other colleagues, for their constructive suggestions.
I hope that the proposals we have drawn up in the framework strategy for providing the equal and effective participation of all persons in the economic, social and political life of Europe will become the key factor to overcoming the recent negative tendencies which are undermining the prospects for the sustainable development of Europe in the 21st century.
Ignorance of the multicultural and multiethnic nature of modern societies leads to dangerous social tensions.
The ethnic, social and linguistic diversity of European society should be perceived not only as a challenge for sustainable development but also as a source of creative potential and for the dynamic stability of modern Europe.
What are the key elements of the framework strategy?
Firstly, there are different ways of understanding the concept of discrimination, depending on whether it is viewed from an individual or collective point of view. At the same time, upholding the rights of citizens as individuals does not require the same action as upholding the interests of groups of individuals.
We therefore stress the need to adopt specific measures intended to prevent or to compensate for the disadvantages linked to one of the grounds for discrimination listed in ArticleÂ 13 of the Treaty. Such measures should be extended to all sectors in which serious inequalities are found, whether in education, healthcare, housing, access to goods and services, or any other area.
Secondly, the detection of indirect forms of discrimination must be based upon reliable statistics relating in particular to certain groups with special characteristics.
There is no conflict between personal data protection and the monitoring of discrimination through statistical means, insofar as the objective of such monitoring is to gain a better understanding of the over- or under-representation of certain groups in particular sectors or at certain levels and to measure progress in order to identify the need to act and to select the most effective course of action.
We also stress the need for supplementary legislation.
We greatly regret the fact that, despite repeated requests from the European Parliament, the Commission does not intend at this stage to come forward with further legislative proposals based on Article 13.
We insist that a new legislative tool, incorporating all the forms of discrimination set out in Article 13, and having the same scope as Directive 2000/43/EC, be submitted before mid-2007.
We also call upon the Commission to take urgent action against Member States that have failed to transpose Community law prohibiting discrimination, considering that new Member States which have not transposed the anti-discrimination directives must be subject to infringement proceedings in the same way as the established Member States.
We also ask Member States to take on obligations, without any reservations or restrictive declarations, under human rights treaties in the field of non-discrimination and the protection of persons belonging to minorities, as well as to honour such obligations in good faith.
We consider that traditional national minorities urgently need to be protected by various forms of self-government or autonomy in order to overcome the double standards arising from the Copenhagen criteria, on the one hand, and the lack of any rules in the Member States, on the other.
I am convinced that the European Union must in fact have one of the most advanced framework policies in the world for combating discrimination.
Â Â  . Mr President, MrsÂ Åœdanoka, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament and especially the rapporteur, MrsÂ Åœdanoka, for an excellent report.
We have an opportunity here to discuss a topic very close to my heart, which is the fight against discrimination and support for equal opportunities and diversity.
The right of individuals to equality before the law and to protection from discrimination constitutes a basic right which is an essential precondition for the proper functioning of any democratic society, and we are all aware of how this right can help to increase economic and social cohesion in our countries and thereby also our prosperity.
The goal of the Community is on the one hand to ensure the uniform application of the law in this area and on the other hand to back effective policies for fighting discrimination and upholding equality in cases where the law is not being applied in a satisfactory manner.
As you yourselves have already emphasised, there are a whole range of structural obstacles preventing the achievement of a more just society.
The aim of our initiative is therefore also to change attitudes and behaviour.
I am pleased that your report to a great extent supports the approach taken by the Commission.
I noticed that you drew attention to areas where progress was needed, and advanced some interesting suggestions as to how such progress might be achieved.
Your report in the first place emphasises the importance of collecting data.
A certain amount of progress is essential if we are to improve our understanding of discrimination, enabling us to propose effective measures and especially to monitor the way they are implemented.
The Commission is pressing for this and at the same time taking steps to ensure that the law is enforced in the area of protecting personal data.
As the Commission stated in its framework strategy, a handbook on the extent of discrimination will be issued at the end of 2006.
A conceptual framework will also be developed soon for measuring progress in the fight against discrimination and evaluating the statistical data that are available both at a Community level and at a domestic level.
There is, generally speaking, nothing in the Communityâs legal basis to prevent the relevant data from being obtained.
Your report also emphasised the need to reinforce positive measures in the fight against discrimination.
The Commission greatly respects your comments and has already requested a group of its legal experts to draw up a paper on the positive measures currently being applied in the Member States.
The report also stressed the importance of multiple discrimination, and with good reason.
This topic deserves greater attention.
We very often underestimate the number of people that are exposed to it.
For this reason I have requested that a study be produced, the aim of which will be to improve understanding of the causes and consequences of multiple discrimination.
There promises to be a major boost for our anti-discrimination policy from the forthcoming European Year of Equal Opportunities.
I hope that by the end of 2007 more European citizens will understand the social and economic benefits that diversity can bring to us, and that they will be more aware of what rights they have.
Finally, your report requested that a new legal instrument be put forward which would cover all of the reasons for discrimination, as mentioned in the framework strategy passed in June last year.
The Commission has begun a far-reaching study into the suitability and operability of the new measures which are intended to supplement the existing legal framework.
Until we have the results of this study the Commission will direct all of its energies towards monitoring the implementation of existing directives by the Member States, in the interests of the highest possible levels of justice.
In this context the Commission will of course take all the necessary legal steps that the situation demands.
Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to your debate with interest.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the subjects discussed in MrsÂ Zdanokaâs report are important and commendable; however, as regards the content of the report, there are a number of questions and objections.
Firstly, I would like to ask why the report selectively highlights only two groups in society, namely migrating Roma and non-citizens, as groups which may be experiencing unfavourable conditions and which should be paid special attention to.
Yet refugees, asylum seekers and citizens of third countries who are arriving in Europe in increasing numbers are not mentioned as experiencing difficult conditions, and there is also no mention of their integration as being a matter of concern.
Secondly, I cannot agree with the proposition in point 11 of the report to the effect that migrating Roma and non-citizens should be initially involved in elections at all levels without first ensuring that these residents have been integrated into society.
This idea runs contrary to the historic experience of Europe and European values.
I would also like to ask another question: were those Moslem youths who burned cars and vandalised shops in Paris last autumn not French citizens?
The majority of them were, but can we put our hands on our hearts and say that they were integrated into that society and shared its values?
As a result, it seems to me that MrsÂ Zdanokaâs report puts the emphasis on the wrong aspects, and therefore is misdirected and biased.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs Åœdanoka has produced a report that has one very important underlying idea, which is that effective action to combat discrimination is not easy, but that it is vital for governments, public authorities and multinational companies to take effective action to combat such discrimination.
It is not an easy option, as we heard from the last speaker, as it causes controversy, but it is absolutely critical.
As the Commissioner said, in order for the year of Equal Opportunities 2007 to mean something â I know he and his staff are working hard on it â we need to make proper advances.
Mrs Åœdanokaâs report does that.
It is another step forward.
She talks about active intervention and positive action.
Positive action is one of the most misunderstood concepts.
What positive action means is not necessarily affirmative action giving unfair advantages, but action to remove the barriers which cause discrimination.
It is sad to see that ethnic monitoring still meets with such controversy and resistance in the European Union.
It is now commonplace in the United Kingdom, and in multinational companies with operations in the United States and across Europe, to ethnically monitor their staff or to monitor them on the basis of disability or age.
Why?
Because this enables one to understand which people are being promoted and retained in employment and whether there is indirect discrimination.
The whole concept of indirect discrimination is being misunderstood and it is important for this concept to be advanced in reports like that by Mrs Åœdanoka, because it works.
If one looks at the institutions present here today â the Commission, Parliament and Council â where there is no ethnic monitoring, one can see what is happening.
There are very few people who are non-white employed in those institutions, including in Parliament.
My presence makes the percentage slightly higher today, but that is because the Chamber is empty.
ArticleÂ 13 contains an important concept.
I know the Commissionerâs heart is in progressing Article 13, but what Mrs Åœdanokaâs report states, very importantly, is that we need comprehensive legislation and we need to implement the Racial Equality Directive and Employment Directive and make them mean something, rather than leave them unimplemented.
It is the same with the Framework Decision on Racist Offences, for which the Council has a responsibility.
Finally, in answer to the last speaker and regarding the concerns over paragraphÂ 11, I should say that the effective participation of minorities in public and political life is a precondition for good integration.
It is important.
Just two categories have been mentioned, but there are many other categories in many other countries where people can enjoy effective participation.
We cannot ignore this issue.
We must pay attention to it and we must take it forward.
Overall, this report advances what I think should be a comprehensive Year of Equal Opportunities.
We back the Commissioner in the strong action that I hope he will take in 2007.
I want to thank Mrs Åœdanoka for an excellent report, to which the Socialist Group will give its full support.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very pleased that we are discussing the excellent report by Mrs Åœdanoka tonight, but I should like to remind you that tomorrow, unfortunately, we will be discussing a resolution on rampant racism and homophobic violence in Europe.
Between the Åœdanoka report and tomorrowâs resolution, we become painfully aware that there is still a lot to be achieved.
Therefore I should like to make a proposal to the Commissioner.
We have been talking a lot about anti-discrimination measures â and there are lots of very concrete proposals in the Åœdanoka report.
When I was preparing my remarks tonight I thought back to March 2000, when the political leaders of Europe launched a very ambitious strategy to make Europe the strongest sustainable knowledge-based economy in the world.
They were very ambitious.
Perhaps they over-reached a little bit, but ambition is a good thing.
Why can we not be equally ambitious in the fight against discrimination and in the promotion of fundamental rights and equality in the European Union?
Those are, after all, our shared values.
What we need here is not just one measure and then another, but a comprehensive and, most of all, very ambitious strategy.
We need a roadmap and we need to put fundamental rights and equality at the heart of European policies.
I would like to remind you that about a year and a half ago this House gave its confidence to President Barroso and his Commission, because he promised us that fundamental rights and the fight against discrimination would be top priority; it would be the cornerstone of the European Commissionâs policies.
I know that the Commissioner is personally very committed to that, but I have to say that, on the whole, the track record of the European Union in the last couple of years has not been very impressive.
I know that the biggest stumbling-block is the Member States.
The speed with which they adopt measures, security measures, for example, on data retention or PNR data, is remarkable.
They manage to take decisions within three or four months.
But when it comes to the framework decision against racism and xenophobia, they have still not reached agreement after five years!
That is an absolute disgrace.
I call on the Commission to form an alliance with the European Parliament and come forward with a roadmap for fundamental rights and equality, based on the proposals in the Åœdanoka report.
We urgently need concrete measures. We need legislation.
It is all very well to have awareness campaigns, but people who are discriminated against need a legal tool so that they can go to court.
We need this framework decision.
We need a mechanism to monitor the fundamental rights situation in the Member State.
All of that we would qualify as better lawmaking.
That is also in Mrs Åœdanokaâs report.
Better lawmaking is not just about repealing legislative proposals in the internal market policies; it is also about proposing things that are good for the citizen â something that Parliament has been calling for consistently.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights needs to become legally binding if it is to have any meaning.
With regard to the European Year of Equal Opportunities, it is wonderful that we pay lip service to equal opportunities but, frankly, the budget allocated for the year is pathetic.
If that is any indication of the importance that the Member States give to equal opportunities, we still have a long way to go.
I am counting on the Commissionâs cooperation with the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report, coming, I would remind other Members, from the committee and not simply from one individual.
So I think the questions that were asked should be addressed to the committee as a whole.
It was their choice as to which groups they particularly wanted to focus on, and they could have added many other amendments had they chosen to.
We have legislation which already covers the vast majority of groups within the European Union.
As others have said so eloquently this evening, we do not use it.
But this inclusive approach coming from the idea of non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all is, I think, extremely important.
As people have said, it is about fundamental rights, the dignity of the individual, the respect with which each individual should be treated, and the right of individuals to participate in society.
There seems to be a huge expectation that individuals should be participating in society.
They need the tools to be able to do that, they need to be included, and that includes, in my groupâs belief, the right to political participation as well.
As others have said, it is socially important: social cohesion is one of the aims of the Lisbon Agenda.
It is part of the European treaties, it is an important thing we are looking at, and that society needs all the talents and all the skills that we can bring.
It is not often that I quote business, but business will tell you it makes good business sense in a diverse society and a globalising world to have a workforce which is diverse and which includes all the talents.
As the report so eloquently says, we need to use and extend the good practice we have.
The European Union has invested heavily â not as heavily as some of us would like â for example in the Equal Programme, which brings many important lessons, not least from the asylum-seeker strand, in terms of preparation for work, language acquisition, a whole list of things we are talking about in terms of integration.
We need to disseminate such results and exchange good practice.
Many NGOs would be willing to share their experience, but they need the necessary network and support to do this.
That could be one of the outcomes of the Year of Equal Opportunities for next year, and maybe Member States would like to invest even more in that.
As we know, there are still far too many people suffering discrimination, and the full implementation of the ArticleÂ 13 directives becomes urgent, as does the setting-up of national anti-discrimination agencies that have proved their worth, not least, for example, the Irish Human Rights Agency.
And we need data.
It is not discriminatory, in order to collect data, to see whether our policies are changing situations, or whether we are simply working on the basis of our personal beliefs and prejudices, rather than sound statistics and information.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Å pidla, in Parliament, we very often talk â and quite rightly so â about non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all.
I welcome both the debate and this report.
I can only hope that the Member States implement practical measures and that the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All is a success, so that we are able to achieve a society that really is for all, irrespective of disability, gender, ethnic background, sexual orientation and so on. In this area, we need to cooperate with voluntary organisations and make use of the knowledge that they have to offer.
The fact that various forms of discrimination are often debated here in Parliament is due, I believe, to the fact that such issues are very important and complicated, but perhaps it shows, above all, the very large amount there is still to do.
However, I have one more observation to make, and that is that it is never the groups that are actually discriminated against who get the opportunity to put forward their views.
I therefore ask myself how many members of this Parliament, or of the national parliaments, are, for example, disabled, members of a minority group or from different ethnic backgrounds.
Most of us belong to that population in the Member States that sets the norm.
As long as this continues to be the case in political assemblies, industry and training, as well as socially and economically, I believe that special measures must be implemented.
It is my view that discrimination has continued, all along, despite all the talk of change.
If we are to change this situation, we must be able to apply positive discrimination.
At present, we actually apply the opposite of such a policy â what might be called ânegative discriminationâ â which means that disabled people, minority groups and women have to be better, more capable and everything else if they are to compete with the groups that set the norm.
It is absolutely not a question of equal conditions applying.
The situation is contrary to democracy, whereby everyone is supposed to have equal opportunities.
I therefore advocate quotas as a means of changing this situation.
Â Â  Commissioner, colleagues, a few observations regarding inaccuracies in the report.
The report calls for favourable measures to be adopted with regard to non-citizens whose rights are supposedly being infringed.
There is a paragraph calling for guaranteeing and expanding voting rights at all election levels for Roma and non-citizens only.
I agree that Roma are experiencing unfavourable conditions in many parts of Europe, but there is no reason to single out non-citizens.
It is also unclear why the rapporteur is concerned about the social and political rights of only these two groups.
It is surprising that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has not recognised the inherent bias in this report.
It has even ignored the reportâs discriminatory nature, as it makes no mention of migrants of any origin, third country citizens or religious minorities.
And now about the true situation of non-citizens.
The annual statistical report of the Secretariat of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, released a few days ago on 9Â June, noted that, compared to other groups, non-citizens in Latvia and Estonia are a privileged category of people who enjoy rights and protection similar to those of citizens.
Furthermore, special reference is made to the effect that the provisions of the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons cannot be applied to Latvian non-citizens.
This is in contrast to the false claim made in Section K of the report that non-citizens are denied rights and that their rights are being infringed.
I would like to ask: which rights are being infringed?
Does this group of residents not enjoy rights to education, housing, and access to goods and services?
Non-citizens in Latvia have all these rights.
This group not only enjoys these rights, but also has the opportunity to obtain Latvian citizenship in Latvia and Estonian citizenship in Estonia, thereby being guaranteed political and social rights.
Therefore, the absence of citizenship is a question of will and attitude among the non-citizens living in these countries.
It would be strange, even absurd, if the European Parliament, when voting on rapporteur Zdanokaâs report, accepted her unjustified exaggerations, which do not reflect the true situation.
I invite Members to assess the above-mentioned circumstances carefully, and to amend the biased and even false sections of the report.
Â Â  Mr President, the framework strategy for non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all applies to various fields of action.
It seems that, in view of social consequences, the strategy mainly applies to young people.
Lack of access to schooling and difficulties encountered by young people with regard to assimilation of the curriculum and finding a career reduce their chances of success in life from the outset.
This is particularly the case in disadvantaged groups, ethnic groups and national minorities.
In these cases, the actions of local governments, social organisations and the state are extremely important.
I can give you an example of how to deal with these problems in the form of action taken in New Zealand.
Maori children were significantly underachieving at school.
As a result, the authorities began to analyse the reasons behind the problem, namely whether the teachers or the school were at fault or whether the children themselves lacked talent.
A research team was set up to find answers to these questions.
It turned out that the children were talented but that their mentality and traditions called for a modified style of teaching.
The necessary changes were made, thus giving them equal opportunities within society
Action must be taken in the European Union to create adequate learning conditions for Roma children.
Special attention must be paid to young people from disadvantaged families whose learning or career opportunities, as well as the likelihood of escaping their environment, are very limited.
Educating and preparing disabled children for a career and for their future life is also problematic, as their situation depends, to a great extent, on the financial status of their parents and the society in which they live as well as on the job market.
The problem is serious and requires specific assistance from the government, local authorities and social organisations, and support for the poorest regions of the EU in particular.
It is especially difficult to create opportunities for children who, as well as having a disability, come from disadvantaged backgrounds or ethnic groups.
Within the framework of measures to support this group, special conditions should be created for these children.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ Åœdanoka, for drawing up a much-needed document.
Â Â  Mr President, the fight against discrimination must be fought daily; this is clear, not only from the report of MrsÂ Åœdanoka, but also from our debate here in this House.
I would like to emphasise one of the issues mentioned in the report: the protection of the rights of national minorities.
The situation of national and ethnic minorities in both old and new Member States is rarely problem-free, and they are often facing direct, as well as indirect discrimination.
It is clear that the prohibition of discrimination is not sufficient to resolve this issue.
The creation of equal opportunities requires positive measures, as well, especially in order to combat indirect discrimination.
I am convinced that the Commission could encourage the Member States whose legislative environment does not allow them to change this situation.
New legal instruments are also required, as MrsÂ Åœdanoka has pointed out, so that we can put an end to the unacceptable policy of double standards, because while the Copenhagen criteria regarding compliance with minority rights are applicable to candidate states, Member States do not have internal laws in this respect.
I think that this situation is truly untenable.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate MrsÂ Åœdanoka, the rapporteur.
This is a particularly important report.
We have to clarify certain important concepts, because there are still many contradictions between the two European Union Directives.
There are further, numerous contradictions regarding the relationship between anti-discrimination and equal treatment, as well, because we do know that they mean different things.
My colleague Claude Moraes has already mentioned the need for positive action today.
But we have not yet clarified the concept of positive discrimination, that is, the relationship and connection between equal treatment and preferential treatment, because if we apply the same standards to unequal groups, this will only create further inequality.
Therefore we need positive actions, positive discrimination and preferential treatment, to enable us to counterbalance unequal opportunities in society.
Another extremely important point is that discrimination never affects individuals.
Those affected are not discriminated against because of their personality, but because they are old, they are women, they live with a disability, they belong to a sexual minority or to a traditional or new national minority.
Therefore efficient protection requires more than just the protection of individuals: we need to protect entire groups.
