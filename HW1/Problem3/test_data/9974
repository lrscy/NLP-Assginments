I am referring to the fact that this agreement allows the Council full powers to decide which documents it will in point of fact actually hand over to this small special committee of the European Parliament.
I might imagine that the background to this is discussions held between the Council and NATO.
In many respects it seems that the wishes and requirements of NATO have dictated the content of this agreement to a considerable degree.
In my opinion, the interests of the European Parliament have not necessarily been taken into account.
In my view, my fellow Members have quite rightly pointed out that the European Parliament cannot reserve for itself exclusive rights to implement democratic and public monitoring of foreign and defence policy on behalf of our citizens either.
Sometimes I feel that when this agreement was negotiated it was thought that these matters were no business of the public, but that Parliament's small, handpicked team would assume full responsibility for them.
That is why I tabled the amendment the rapporteur has already mentioned.
I should like to stress that the exceptions in the Rules of Procedure, which Members of the European Parliament must submit to on the basis of this agreement, must be strictly linked to confidential information as mentioned in the regulation on public access, that is to say 'sensitive' documents, and no others.
Neither can the right of the Members of the European Parliament to obtain information concerning foreign and security policy, a right that is already guaranteed to them by virtue of Article 21 of the Treaty, be weakened by this agreement.
Finally, it is extremely important to stress that, should confidential information contain any reference to some sort of criminal activity, nothing must be allowed to prevent a Member of the European Parliament from contacting the authorities.
I would request that Amendment No 2, which is broader in scope that that proposed by the committee, be supported.
Mr President, the PPE's Congress in Estoril has now advocated complete transparency in the legislative process in the Council.
All the important political forces therefore support the transparency placed on the agenda when the Danes voted against the Treaty of Maastricht on 2 June 1992.
We have seen progress in a number of areas, but we also have a number of things to look forward to.
The Commission now publishes its agendas and the minutes of the meetings at which decisions are taken.
It is important to know who said what and how they voted.
The Commissioners must be accountable to the public.
The Council has issued minutes relating to the working party's discussions on transparency.
We must have similar access to other working parties' working documents and minutes, and we must have access immediately so that we can follow developments before the laws are adopted.
We are currently debating a proposal for a compromise on Parliament's access to confidential information, but the new rules would limit that access to which all MEPs are entitled under the Treaty.
I believe we could make more progress by going to the Court of Justice, as has been done with great success in connection with proper agreements.
I shall not therefore vote in favour of the compromise.
If truth be told, the European Parliament has never negotiated anything in the way of progress.
There have been individual MEPs who have exerted pressure, together with the Ombudsman and active citizens who have won one legal case after another.
It is before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg that we have achieved most progress, not in negotiations between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
That is the sad fact.
The European Parliament is always ready to make demands, but it becomes silent whenever, as now, there is the possibility of a framework agreement's being entered into or a regulation on transparency's being negotiated, entailing the danger of documents at present publicly available in Denmark and Sweden being regarded as secret as soon as they are forwarded to the EU.
Nor am I happy with the new agreement, and I would call upon the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to go to the Court of Justice in connection with those documents we cannot obtain, such as the screening reports on the candidate countries' adjustments to EU legislation.
The screening reports are very good examples of documents it should be possible for everyone here in the Chamber and in the candidate countries' parliaments to read.
I doubt if we should be able to obtain them under the new rules.
I cannot imagine the Court of Justice preventing us from obtaining documents that are a clear part of the legislative process.
I believe we can obtain more progress by putting up a fight than by entering now into a poor compromise.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Brok very much for having taken the initiative, together with the President of the European Parliament, of producing a clearer, more detailed framework regulating Parliament's access to sensitive Council documents.
Although there are gaps in the agreement, as the rapporteur himself points out when he says that Parliament has had to make concessions to the Council, it is, at least, a step towards greater democratic control.
In my capacity as a member of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I find it absolutely inconceivable that Parliament should be blatantly denied access to documents in the field of justice and home affairs, the very area in which rules have a direct impact on the citizens' rights and freedoms.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council of 14 and 15 October discussed the framework decision on drugs, but the most recent document available on the register dates back to June.
A number of documents have been circulated since then but the European Parliament has not seen any of them.
Why is it that the citizens are being prevented from knowing what compromise the Danish Presidency has proposed?
Maybe it is fear that people will find out that the ministers do not respect the mandates of their governments, parliaments and citizens behind the closed doors of the Council and that they are therefore doing at European level what they lack the courage to do at national level.
Even the Danish Minister, Mrs Lene Espersen, lacked the courage to describe the contents of this compromise to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights today.
One last example: at least 20 of the 39 documents discussed at the meeting of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs of 14 and 15 October were not published on the register.
We believe that there must be an end to this way of treating the European Parliament and the citizens who elected it, who continue to be disgracefully humiliated by the Council.
Mr President, despite attempts to make them otherwise, security and defence are matters for the European Council.
This Parliament has no competence in that area, either legislative or budgetary.
Furthermore, it has to be said that, within the context of the Treaties, the function of this Parliament is to scrutinise the Commission.
Its responsibility does not extend to the scrutiny or review of Council activities.
Scrutiny of Council members remains the responsibility of individual national parliaments.
It is to them that their individual ministers are responsible.
Only those parliaments can hold ministers to account.
On that basis, it seems to be a measure of the self-importance of the Members of this Parliament that they are seeking information that is not in the public domain.
I would say that it is none of their business.
Parliament should not be asking for it, and the Council should not give it.
This also has wider implications.
The information is not to be given to all Members but to a select and privileged cartel within this Parliament.
Furthermore, those who receive that information are to be sworn to secrecy and can be disciplined for breaches of confidence.
There cannot be a better way of muzzling representatives of the public.
The central point is that, if the primary role of Parliament is scrutinising the Commission, then that is exactly what it should be doing.
Time allocated for debates on these matters is already ridiculously short, and scrutiny is therefore minimal.
It would be far better if the House concentrated on its statutory duties, rather than poking its nose into areas which are none of its business.
In pursuit of more information, therefore, it would be much better if it devoted its energies to pressing for more transparency and openness from the Commission.
Mr President, I hope you will allow a point of order.
During the debate I became aware that, according to tomorrow's voting list, we are also going to vote on a Bureau proposal concerning the security rules, which are a precondition for adopting the interinstitutional agreement.
I would like to know why there has been no mention of these security rules on our agenda.
Would it not be appropriate for the House to discuss those security rules, which are being put to the vote tomorrow in the context of the interinstitutional agreement and the amendments to the Rules of Procedure?
I consider this procedure to be most insulting to the House.
Thank you for your comment, Mrs Hautala. However, I think you ought to make it again before the start of the votes tomorrow.
In my opinion, it would be a good idea for you to make the comment again so that you can receive a response from those who planned the voting schedule.
Mr President, these security rules were submitted and discussed in the Committee competent to deal with them.
This agreement can also be adopted or rejected regardless of them, but it cannot yet enter into force, as the security rules have not yet been adopted.
The Interinstitutional Agreement can therefore be adopted tomorrow in any case.
Please permit me to address a brief comment to the Members. We are dealing here solely with foreign, security and defence policy, none of which form part of the legislation.
That, Mr Bonde, is why this committee does not deal with any papers that have to do with legislation, in which area Mr Turco is talking about justice and internal affairs.
I have said quite clearly that the Agreement recommends that a separate agreement be negotiated for this area, and I believe that this should go much further in taking Parliament's rights into account.
Mrs Hautala is right to say that, if this does not succeed, one of the options provided is that of an appeal.
I would, by the way, like to tell Mrs Hautala and others that it is only when we know the documents that we can say whether their classifications are justified.
If we see that access is not being given to papers that Parliament as a whole is actually meant to be able to see, we can say that they have been wrongly classified, and in this way bring about a change in practice at Council level.
If, though, we know nothing about the documents, we can have no criticism to make on this score.
Apart from that, we have to say that getting access to such documents represents a new start for the Council and the Commission as well.
Without such a settlement, we will have difficulty in carrying on any sort of European foreign and security policy.
In this instance, therefore, all the institutions have a shared interest in finding a point from which they can all start.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0308/2002) by Mr Hans-Peter Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on amendment of the provisions of Parliament's Rules of Procedure concerning the discharge procedure [2001/2060(REG)].
Mr President, although it is customary to express gratitude, please allow me to unite that with wonderment at the report that is now before us.
The task in hand is clear indeed.
We were asked, especially in view of the experiences of 1999, to find another, less ambiguous way whereby the Commission, and not only the Commission, was in future to be granted discharge.
What was at stake was that there should be the minimum of room for manoeuvre where people are simply stalling, that proposals for decisions that are very clearly set out should also result in appropriate results, and that no areas of uncertainty should remain.
If one is dealing with Parliament, one learns that this place attaches primary importance to compromises, and it is compromises that we have worked towards very intensively.
For that, I would like to thank not only the officials of this House, who, with great commitment, kept on coming up with new formulations and proposals, and not only my own colleagues either, who had a part in this process, which - as we don't work as quickly as Elmar Brok - has in the meantime lasted nearly a year, but also the Members of this House belonging to other groups, who have made the effort to do this.
Compromise means that there is give and take, and that is a small chance to take part in a process, if you are seated up there in the gallery or, through some other fortuity, find yourself listening to what is being said.
I hear that amendments handed in by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control at the very last minute, which go against this great ideal of compromise, are now to be promptly withdrawn.
If they ask how it is that a rapporteur does not know that, it has to do with another of the realities of life in this House, that is, the fact that such last-minute agreements are often reached outside the plenary and are often not completely transparent.
But we will shortly hear whether we have pulled it off.
There is another thing, though - I am looking around to find Mr Bourlanges, with whom I did most of the negotiations - and that is something I can do.
(Interjection by Mr Bourlanges)
Perhaps Mr Bourlanges will hear it as well.
There is another thing; that is, that I have to offer and would like to say that I withdraw the request for a split vote that we made on one point, itself very close to the heart of Mr Bourlanges and of the PPE Group that he represents, in other words that there will be no split vote on the matter that is so dear to them. It goes without saying that this is being done in the hope that we can achieve the precise result that we need, which is broad agreement to this report.
It is the case that, without 314 votes, we will achieve no durable compromise, and we will make no progress without effort.
My concern is not only that unambiguous rules should be created for the Commission, but also - something in Article 93a to which I would gladly return - with working out how this Parliament should at last flex its muscles a bit more at the Council in its executive capacity, and that we should make this our concern.
I believe that to be this report's second pillar, if that is indeed the term to be used.
It is, in this sense, my very great hope that we will now, on the one hand, hear about compromises struck outside the plenary, and, on the other hand - as Mr Bourlanges is also on the list of speakers - that we will hear him say that he agrees to it, and that we may thus bring the whole business to a satisfactory conclusion.
Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Martin.
I have to say that we made a good team.
It is a topic that was extremely complex and difficult to comprehend, but I am pleased that a report is now before us, which we can broadly endorse.
The discharge of the Commission and of other bodies since the fall of the Santer Commission has become a special event in European political life.
Compared to the years preceding that fall, it is now one of the highlights of the political year.
According to the Treaty, it almost seems as if it is a purely administrative procedure, but the Commission, along with every MEP, knows better.
It is currently a political event.
If no discharge is given at the end of the year, this sends a clear political signal to the Commission, and a debate in this Parliament on the Commission's political and other functions strikes me as absolutely inevitable.
What rules should, in general, apply to a discharge?
The procedure should not be too complicated.
Each member should be able to understand it.
Secondly, in the event of a vote, every member must be able to understand the consequences of this vote.
Thirdly, in the year n+2, in other words, two years following the implementation of the budget, a clear political judgment should be given about the functioning of the Commission.
The advice given by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs meets these criteria, in my opinion.
I welcome the results and we will be voting in favour of them.
I also think that the proposed timeframe, namely to grant discharge or postponement in April and to pronounce a final verdict in October, is the correct one.
Commission. (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, although it is for Parliament to debate its own Rules of Procedure, I would like to take the opportunity to say a few words.
The discharge procedure is of course of very great importance to the Commission, and it is enshrined in the Treaty itself.
Now it has a place, and is couched in even clearer terms, in the financial regulation, so that there are two existing legal bases, which of course have to be taken together in reaching decisions.
I must therefore raise the question of whether all the amendments that have been submitted are in accordance with these legal bases.
Over the last two years, Parliament has negotiated with the Council and the Court of Auditors and done very in-depth work on the recast financial regulation.
A good and clear result has finally been achieved.
Article 146 (1) states: 'The European Parliament, acting on a recommendation from the Council, which shall act by a qualified majority, shall give a discharge to the Commission before 30 April of the year n+2 in respect of the implementation of the budget of the financial year n. Where the time period provided for in paragraph 1 cannot be adhered to, the European Parliament or the Council shall notify the Commission of the reasons for the suspension of the discharge resolution.
Where the European Parliament defers the grant of the discharge resolution, the Commission shall act as soon as possible to remove the causes of impediment.'
End of quotation from Article 146.
I believe that the legislative authority had a clear aim in choosing this formulation.
Where, exceptionally, the discharge resolution is deferred, the Commission is to respond very quickly in order to remove the causes of the impediment.
Now these proposals refer to October, all of six months later.
That is, of course, not exactly a quick response within the meaning of Article 146.
This deferment procedure also involves three other difficulties.
The first is that the Commission has to take care that Parliament keeps the reasons for the suspension of the discharge resolution realistic and within the bounds of feasibility.
The second is that, if it is envisaged that action will be taken, six months is again a relatively short period.
If the Commission is meant to come up with responses and commitments, it can - and should - do so more quickly.
Thirdly, if these conditions are to be seen as a normal option in the Rules of Procedure themselves, there is of course the risk of suspension being regarded as a regular course of action.
I would like to point out that Parliament already, of course, has instruments available, by which it can impose further tasks and actions on the Commission, and, indeed, it has done so in recent years.
The resolution on the discharge procedure was combined with quite unambiguous demands, concerning which the Commission is drawing up a follow-up report - not as a matter of choice, but because it is obliged to - and has to set out in clear terms what measures it has submitted in accordance with the motion for a resolution.
Yesterday evening, amendments were tabled on what I would like to call the 'October option' question, and these now raise further issues.
The Commission would therefore welcome it if these could be further clarified.
Mr President, the discharge procedure is something that is particularly important.
It is one of the European Parliament's major powers and this was evident during the most serious dispute between Parliament and the Commission, which occurred on the occasion of a vote on discharge.
In my view, Parliament's objective over the last 15 years has been, first and foremost, to ensure that the scrutiny performed under the discharge procedure is a political scrutiny in the fullest sense of the word, in other words a power of scrutiny which is an expression of the taxpayers' desire to ensure that public money is not wasted, and which is not just a technical formality.
Secondly, we felt that it was not just the Commission but all the bodies that have their own budget which, by extension, should be subject to the scrutiny of the discharge procedure by Parliament's granting of discharge.
Thirdly, we felt that since the Treaty bestowed upon us the power to grant discharge, we should also have the power to refuse to grant it.
So, under the authority of the Committee on Budgetary Control and its chairman, Mrs Theato - whom I would like to congratulate -a genuine power of Parliament has progressively built up, and Parliament, through discharge, is, therefore, well and truly expressing the concerns of taxpayers.
That said, extending the discharge procedure poses a number of problems.
The first of these problems is the danger that this procedure will go on forever without achieving results.
The report before you by Mr Hans-Peter Martin lays down, for all the provisions, relatively short and relatively reasonable deadlines.
In this respect, I shall say to the Commission 'Commissioner, you cannot ask us to grant discharge within a short deadline as well as telling us that, for your part, you need time to take the decisions necessary for you to comply with Parliament's procedures.
You must choose: either you want extra time, and we grant you discharge later, or you want discharge quickly and you make haste yourself'.
The second problem that we have had is a problem relating to coherence between the three votes, namely the vote on discharge, the vote on the approval of accounts and the vote on the resolution.
There are three different votes for a single decision, which may lead to inconsistencies between the three.
The report before you, which we firmly support in the PPE-DE Group, resolves the problem by combining the discharge procedure and the procedure for approval of accounts and by giving the President the possibility of avoiding putting a resolution to the vote which would contradict the provisions relating to the vote on discharge by Parliament.
The third problem, which was the most serious and which we have encountered on several occasions, was the problem of majority.
As soon as we had the possibility of granting, postponing or refusing to grant discharge, we were faced with two risks. The first was that no vote might be accepted, with a majority of both the Commission and then Parliament voting against all three of these options.
We were at an impasse.
The second risk was related to the equality of votes, both in committee and in Parliament, whereas the Treaty obliges us to take a decision.
The report before you does not resolve this problem in an entirely satisfactory manner, although, in my view, it does resolve it in the best possible way.
The report essentially proposes to divide the procedure into two phases: during the first phase, we shall choose between granting and postponement, at the proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control; during the second phase, if discharge has not been granted once the postponement has expired, we shall choose whether to refuse or grant discharge.
If one option were rejected, the opposite option would then be adopted and we would therefore avoid the danger of an impasse that we have constantly flirted with, in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
This is a very good system and we give our very strong support to the compromise that the main groups have reached.
In this respect, I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur for his comments regarding the withdrawal of his request for a separate vote.
A compromise is an achievement, we shall stand by this and we thank you for standing by this too.
Mr Martin, I wish you good luck.
Mr President, as we are political anoraks in the Committee on Budgetary Control and there are a lot more people listening to us tonight, I will try and explain to them what is going on because budgetary control and discharge are really not terms that normal people understand.
One of the primary tasks of the European Parliament is to assess the way the Commission is functioning.
We are here to make sure that the Commission carries out its work properly.
Therefore when people say that the Commission is unelected, we can tell them that we keep the Commission under control and hold them to account.
One of our formal responsibilities is to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget.
We have to be able to account to the people who elect us and explain to them how their money is spent.
The Committee on Budgetary Control is the principal committee responsible for leading this task on behalf of the European Parliament: we scrutinise budget lines, follow up potential scandals, we see how the money is being misspent and we try and find out why processes are so complex and cumbersome.
It was the discharge procedure that ultimately led to the forced resignation of the Commission back in 1999.
That is what started the whole process.
However, there is a danger - we must not be naive about what is going on - that the whole process could be hijacked for more sinister and for more political motives.
It has become almost established practice within the Committee on Budgetary Control to postpone the discharge and to ask for more information.
That means that there are now three options.
In the past there were two options: we could give or refuse discharge.
Now, as Mr Bourlanges has explained, we can give, refuse or postpone discharge.
It is much easier if we have only two options and that is what is being put to us today.
The Commissioner has a point when she says that the Commission could probably comply more quickly.
I do not see this October part-session as the date by which we have to have the answer.
That is the latest point at which Parliament gives its decision.
We do not have to stick to October, but we have to do it by October.
That is a slightly different interpretation.
It is clear that we all want to complete it before the summer.
It is also right that the Commission should have this additional breathing space, because if Members refuse discharge and want to criticise the Commission, then it needs time to try to put things right.
The new process will also ensure that the process does not go on and on.
That is what has happened in the past.
It is what happened in the 1996 discharge - it just carried on.
We are giving you an end date, we are telling Parliament that by this time it has to decide one way or the other.
That is why this system is much better.
The situation is clearer and the process will not be hijacked for political aims.
Mr President, the discharge procedure is one of the most important rights and duties of the European Parliament.
Parliament must acquaint itself with how finances are being managed and establish whether the Commission has been doing its job properly.
Parliament cannot therefore grant discharge without justification.
Granting discharge means that the information received and obtained by Parliament indicates that the Commission has functioned properly.
If there are points that need clarification that emerge later on, we can always return to them, even if discharge has been granted.
The report proposes that a deadline be given for discharge.
This is a good thing.
A situation where discharge is still pending from one year to the next, as has been the case here in recent years, does not show a businesslike or responsible approach to administration.
One problem is refusal to grant discharge.
If discharge is not granted and a decision is taken on this, the reason is either malpractice or political distrust.
Malpractice necessitates bringing charges against the authority or authorities concerned.
If malpractice is not indicated, the accounts must be closed.
If the reason for refusal of discharge is political, I think the Commission in that case should be forced to resign.
The system that has now been outlined, according to which refusal of discharge would be followed by a vote on a motion for censure, is good but unclear.
If there is a motion for censure against the Commission or a Commissioner but discharge is not granted, there is a contradiction in the system.
The contradiction may be due to the fact that discharge can be refused by a simple majority but a motion for censure only by a qualified majority.
For that reason this conflict should not in any sense be made possible.
Mr President, Mr Martin has invested a great deal of time and effort in this report, for which I wish to express my utmost appreciation.
The rapporteur and I also had some good discussions.
The granting of discharge is Parliament's most important prerogative as a monitoring body when it comes to the assessment of how the budget has been managed by the executive - that is, primarily, by the Commission.
This is a political act and not only the closure of the accounts, important as that is.
Using the reports of the Court of Auditors and other information, some, incidentally, from the Commission itself, we look to see if the objectives set have been met with proper and economic use of the funds allocated.
We highlight weak points in order that they may be rectified and also avoided in the forthcoming budget.
Where the three discharge options, which the rapporteur has elucidated - grant, deferment, and refusal - are concerned, I think it right to specify time periods, so that there will not be two discharge procedures running in parallel, as often happened in the past, but so that one procedure is concluded before the beginning of the next, and so that the two stages can function.
Mrs Schreyer, I believe that the timeframe is indeed sufficient - if the time taken up by the summer recess is included - for constructive solutions to be arrived at in due time.
I have to tell the rapporteur that I cannot, however, accept that discharge should be deemed to have been granted if, in April, the plenary rejects a proposal from the Committee on Budgetary Control that it be deferred.
Such a refusal may have contradictory motives behind it and does not express Parliament's unambiguous will.
I might add that the Legal Service's opinion says the same thing.
Granting discharge would be the wrong answer to the question put, and, for those to be given discharge, it would be a second-class discharge, being granted en passant.
I would therefore have liked the proposal, in its three parts, to be sent back to the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Should the discrepancies between the resolution and the result of the vote, as described in paragraph 3 of the new Article 5a, occur, the Committee on Budgetary Control should be given the task of removing them and submitting the resolution to the plenary for a second time.
However, as has already been mentioned, my group's amendments have been withdrawn.
I must therefore rely on my own experience when I say, as I have done before, that, although there is in the report much that I can accept, I do not feel able to vote in favour of it if no other way is found of dealing with the issue of suspension and hence of the grant of discharge.
Mr President, we have already had the opportunity to hear many of our fellow Members emphasise the importance of the discharge device in the context of the budgetary procedure and the powers of this Parliament, and so I shall refrain from repeating these words, but I should also like to say that great power must be matched by serious consideration and great moderation in its use.
This is precisely the concern that brings us here and which led our rapporteur to find a way of setting a time limit for our examination of the Commission's financial management.
I would say that, from this point of view, this is a legitimate concern and that the wording chosen is perfectly reasonable.
In this debate, however, we cannot forget the fact that underlying the discharge procedure are aims that are very clearly expressed in Article 276 and, specifically, that the European Parliament is examining the accounts and the balance-sheet setting out the Community's assets and liabilities.
And, in this context, we must bear in mind that the accounting and financial control systems of the European institutions, on the basis of which these accounts and balance-sheets are drawn up, must be totally exemplary and must strictly, fully and unequivocally comply with the highest international quality standards.
This is one observation that we must take into account for the financial year that we are about to begin.
Another observation to be emphasised is closely connected to the way in which the discharge has been undertaken in previous years, particularly the discharge for 1999, and concerns outsourcing.
Mr Bourlanges is, as a matter of fact, the author of many of our references.
I should also like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of this aspect.
Mr President, at the Laeken Summit, the Heads of State or Government called for greater transparency, simplicity and comprehensibility in the European regulatory system.
The Convention has tried to live up to this task, and has, among other things, set up a working group on the simplification of procedures.
Today's report by Mr Martin again makes it abundantly clear just how urgently necessary it is that this group should exist and that it should produce a result.
In 1999, as one of the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I experienced first-hand the dilemma into which we were all plunged by the Rules of Procedure - or, as one should perhaps say, the Rules of Disorderly Business.
At the time, the conduct of a number of Commissioners was unacceptable, discharge ought really not to have been granted, but, reasonably enough, we neither wanted nor were permitted to make scapegoats of the Commission as a whole.
The problems of those days have been resolved by history - or probably, only by the honourable attitude of our present colleague Jacques Santer.
It is evident, though, that we have not learned much from this.
The system now proposed is no less complex than its predecessor.
The present system is just as opaque as that which went before it, and if there were any need of proof of this, it has been provided by the events surrounding the efforts towards a compromise on this proposal.
Goethe, that prince among poets, has his Faust say that he is driven mad by thoughts that seem to revolve in his head like a millstone: 'Mir wird von alledem so dumm, als ginge ein MÃŒhlstein mir im Kopf herum'.
I do not believe that we should inflict such headaches on our citizens in Europe - at any rate, not in the long term.
All we can do, then, is to take on ourselves the task, here today, tomorrow and the day after, of finding a compromise and, in the Convention on the Future of Europe, to work out a model in accordance with which the public and their representatives understand what the political implications of discharge resolutions are and are meant to be.
Mr President, it is indeed a fine thing to read out allegories and then say that the report is too complicated, moreover referring, as Mr Rack did, to the fact that one has seen the amendments.
Of course, details are deceptive - as you, being an outstanding representative of the legal profession, will be well aware.
It was in precisely such a decisive situation as this in which we found ourselves.
Let us move more towards clarity, or towards what one might term the absence of intellectual doubt.
Absurd though it might sound, I was wholeheartedly on Mrs Theato's side, and said that it really should be worked out with absolute clarity and utterly unambiguously, and that the third variant was to be left open.
But that, Mr Rack, would have meant that the amendments would have been far more extensive, far more complex and much harder to understand.
Hearing what we have heard from the Netherlands, and other positions, makes it possible, however, to live with a fellow-countryman saying that sort of thing.
Please allow me to enlarge on two points, those made by Mrs Theato and by Commissioner Schreyer. Both refer to legal bases and to the Legal Service, both of which are sources of doubt.
Of course we had to give ourselves safeguards on that, in order to have any chance of reaching a compromise, as we eventually did when we negotiated one with Mr Bourlanges and the Liberals' Mr Duff.
One legal opinion is now being pitted against another, and that is something we will have to live with.
I do think though that, as a whole, what we have worked out reflects this House's thinking, and it goes without saying, Mrs Theato, that I respect your attitude.
I only hope there will not be too many who think as you do, as otherwise we will be back to the beginning.
Those who want everything sorted out in the Convention will perhaps be happy with that.
There is no more simple way, though, for us to put this together.
We have to make a political statement - that is our task as MEPs, but the Rules of Procedure are not designed for that purpose.
With that in mind, then, thank you again for your cooperation and support.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0310/2002) by Mr Stephen Hughes, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication: Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006 [COM(2002) 118 - C5-0261/2002 - 2002/2124(COS)].
Mr President, while my report welcomes the Commission's communication, it is also constructively critical in a number of important respects.
The report emphasises three horizontal issues of great importance to the success of the strategy.
First, the lack of an action plan.
The strategy suffers from an unacceptable imbalance and a lack of strategic vision for follow-through.
The initial analysis is basically good but the proposals for action are often little more than a description of an issue.
Where they propose action, they are often vague, and there is virtually no indication of resources or the timing of the strategy's implementation.
For example, the communication presents a good analysis of the changes being brought about by the increasing feminisation of society and the impact of an ageing population, but then proposes virtually nothing by way of action.
The report therefore calls for an action plan with timing commitments against each major proposal, for such a plan to be endorsed by Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in time for the spring 2003 European Council and for it then to be subject to annual monitoring through the Social Agenda scoreboard, as advocated by the Council.
Parliament and the advisory committees would also need to be involved in this monitoring process.
This is a serious point and I know the Commissioner will be listening to it.
I call upon her to give a clear indication tonight that there will be a positive response to this call.
If not, I have a clear mandate to ask for this report to be referred back to committee, where it will be reformulated to reject the Commission's strategy.
The second major horizontal issue is a lack of resources.
In 1992, some 130 officials were working on occupational health and safety within the European Commission.
Today, that number is down to around 24.
We might disagree over the precise numbers but the Commissioner would agree there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of staff working in this area.
This is not a basis for the kind of dynamic and proactive administration that would be required to implement the strategy, capable of responding to a changing policy environment while continuing to monitor and scrutinise the implementation of existing legislation and policy measures.
It is essential that this trend is reversed and that adequate resources are allocated to this policy area within the Commission.
The third major horizontal issue in the report highlights a lack of balance between legislative and non-legislative instruments.
I am concerned that the development of non-legislative instruments should in no way be seen as an alternative to maintaining and improving Community legislation on occupational health and safety.
Specific instances are given where the gaps and deficiencies in the existing legal framework need to be addressed and where comprehensive approaches to legislation, rather than ad hoc tinkering, will be important for both established and new risks.
Turning to the specifics of the report, there is clearly not enough time to deal with them all, so I shall highlight only a few.
First, the report makes the point that, given how much more problematic health and safety are in small and medium-sized enterprises, it is regrettable that the Commission has still not launched a multiannual SME programme based on the two years' preparatory action undertaken by the Bilbao Agency on the initiative of the European Parliament.
Such a programme was supported by the Commission in the European Social Agenda endorsed at Nice.
It would facilitate the testing, analysis and dissemination of successful measures in this critical sector.
I very much hope the Commission will respond positively now.
Second, in terms of emerging risks, I hope the Commission will look at the need for new laws in areas such as harassment at work, recently called for by Parliament.
Equally, in relation to repetitive strain injuries, I hope it will revisit the display screen directive - the directive does not even mention the computer mouse - and the directive on manual handling.
I hope it will go further and accept our call for a comprehensive directive on workplace ergonomics.
The report also highlights a number of existing directives that are in need of revision.
The Commission needs both commitment and resources to tackle that work.
Reflecting the helpful opinion we received from the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, the report advocates the integration of a gender dimension throughout the strategy and highlights a number of specific strands of work to be tackled.
The report also welcomes benchmarking, but it takes the view that a successful benchmarking approach will need not just more comparable and reliable data but also a harmonised system of definitions, recording and reporting of occupational injuries and diseases.
My final point is that the report also welcomes the proposal to codify and simplify existing Community legislation in this field, so long as that is not coded language for deregulation for deregulation's sake.
I am not accusing the Employment and Social Affairs Directorate-General of that, but there are forces elsewhere in the Commission that have that tendency.
In committee I even went as far as to propose a joint amendment with Mr Bushill-Matthews saying that the review of the legislation should be used as an opportunity to promote the simplification of legislation and its repeal when it is redundant.
None of us here should have an interest in maintaining redundant legislation, nor in making legislation complicated rather than as easy as possible to understand and implement.
I hope the Commissioner can give us the assurance we need on this action plan.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Hughes and particularly the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their close cooperation.
The communication entitled 'Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work for 2002-2006' is a strategy on health and safety for the period in question.
It is a new strategy which includes some key new elements.
These elements concern the quality of work and the need to combine a variety of different political instruments such as legislation, social dialogue, progressive measures and best practices, corporate social responsibility and economic incentives.
Of course, the basis of the analysis is that health and safety issues are related to competitiveness and there is always a cost when we neglect social policies.
The main points in this communication are as follows. Firstly, and I think this must be very clear, it is not just a proposal from the Commission, it is also a Community strategy, so there is a need to include all the European partners including, at political level, the European, national and regional authorities.
At operational level, it concerns the social partners and, at the level of services, it concerns all institutions dealing with health, prevention services and insurance organisations.
A very interesting point in this communication is the question how we can develop the prevention culture.
There are, of course, a number of priorities concerning the need to reinforce our capacity for risk surveillance and the need for better legislation.
I totally agree with the need for simplification and codification, which is one of the commitments in the Commission strategy.
There is also a need for cooperation between the Commission and the national authorities as far as the implementation of the strategies is concerned and, at the same time, for cooperation at international level.
I have tried to outline in a few words the main points of the communication, because I believe that responding to Mr Hughes' specific remarks will make for a more interactive debate.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs made some specific proposals, many of which the Commission has worked on and taken into account.
Some of the proposals could perhaps be examined in greater depth.
We could be more precise in terms of the timetables and description of the activities that must be carried out, and could do this in a meeting with the Committee on Employment, when we can discuss the activities and proposals of the strategy individually, particularly the five points referred to by Mr Hughes.
Firstly, there is the issue of SMEs, which was raised in the report.
You are aware of the problems we have with the SAFE programme.
Thanks to Parliament we now have a specific budget in Bilbao for SMEs and we can discuss the details for implementing this project as well as the timetable.
Regarding legislation on stress, an analysis has been undertaken.
We have launched the first stage of consultation.
Again, we can be more definite.
The same applies to the proposal for a directive on workplace ergonomics and issues concerning the manual-handling directive.
The analysis is under way.
We can be specific about the timetables for the study and can make specific commitments on when and how we are going to launch the first stage of consultation.
Next there is the issue of women: on that there is total agreement.
Gender mainstreaming is a general principle in all actions in our strategy paper.
As regards benchmarking, you are right that perhaps we could find a better way to enforce the procedure.
The report specifically refers to the need to encourage Member States to use benchmarking in this area, but maybe we can discuss this together to see how it can be made more concrete.
Perhaps we can discuss this with Member States and ask them to set firm objectives.
Then we could have a report seeing what progress they are making.
It cannot be an obligation - we cannot oblige Member States to do it - but maybe we could present it in a more organised way to see how benchmarking can move forward.
Finally, I shall comment on simplification and codification.
We are working on a total evaluation of health and safety legislation.
This is one of the main commitments in the strategy.
It is not an easy task but our final goal is to simplify the provisions, see whether they are consistent and then codify them.
One commitment is to codify the health and safety directive.
Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I welcome the communication on this strategy for health and safety at work.
I would particularly like to congratulate Mr Hughes on his report.
As he said, I have been very pleased with the way that our committees have worked together on this issue and, in particular, the cooperation with the rapporteur which has ensured that the points made by the Committee on Women's Rights have been fully taken on board.
This is important because, while men are more often the victims of serious accidents at work, women tend to suffer for longer periods of time from work-related illnesses.
Adult women receive less vocational training and education than their male colleagues.
That is why it is so important that we have a gender breakdown of statistics on work-related ill health and accidents for full-time, part-time and temporary employment.
The Commissioner agreed that gender must be mainstreamed throughout this strategy so that issues such as the effect of the double workload of paid employment and personal responsibilities and issues such as harassment in the workplace are properly addressed.
If risk assessment and workplace design fail to take gender into account, women will continue to be prevented from entering certain professions and sectors.
An evaluation of current health and safety law is needed so that we can identify problem areas to make future legislation more effective.
For example, domestic workers and home workers, many of whom are women, must be protected, as well as women in agriculture and spouses in family-run small businesses.
I totally support the rapporteur in his comments on the lack of resources in the Commission to deal with health and safety policy and, in particular, the need for a detailed and costed action plan and a very strict timetable for improving legislation in this very important area.
I support the report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission and also the rapporteur, not only the quality of his work, but also on his attitude towards the amendments presented.
While social dialogue is to be a effective instrument in the fight against the scourge of work accidents, political dialogue, with the intergroups, has led to the improvement of a report which was excellent from the outset.
I have heard it said on occasions that reality is obstinate and we cannot express our opinion on numbers.
But we can express our opinion on the circumstances in which things take place and the circumstances they reflect.
And the reality in the European Union in terms of health in the workplace, without wanting to be alarmist, is that in 1999 there were 5 500 accidents resulting in fatalities, 4.8 million accidents leading to more than 3 days of inability to work, 500 million working days lost as a result of accidents or health problems, compensation payments and, what is more serious, almost 350 000 people had to change job or their place of work - around 300 000 with some degree of disability - and 15 000 will never be able to take on a new job.
Furthermore, there has been a certain worrying rise in the number of accidents in certain Member States of the Union and, in view of enlargement, there is enormous concern about the situation of the States which are candidates for - not future, but imminent - accession with average work accident rates which are above the Community average, although this can be explained, it is true, from different angles, including the importance of higher-risk sectors of activity in those countries.
Commissioner, surely we are dealing with the poorest relation of enlargement.
The European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights states in Article 31(1) that every worker has the right to work in conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity.
The Lisbon Summit - and the Barcelona Summit reiterated this - set as one of its objectives the creation of more and better jobs - and that of better ones must be applied not only to the fight against precariousness, but also to safer jobs and workplaces.
I therefore believe that the triple aspects of the strategy are correct; the global approach ranging from professional qualifications to the working day, from demographic trends, the general development of economic activity to that of the working population, the notion that safe and healthy working environments and organisations are factors which affect the performance of the economy in general and of companies in particular and, above all, the culture of risk prevention.
Given the risk inherent in work by definition, constant and insistent action is required.
It will be necessary to use all the means allowed by the so-called social acquis, from the framework Directive to the rules laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Protection is therefore going to require joint action by the whole of society, as has already been said: employers, workers, public administrations, citizens.
A genuine joint action.
But without increasing awareness, without training of workers and the people responsible for health, without horizontal prevention policies, without a culture of prevention - as the Commissioner said - and without sufficient information, decisions on the content of regulations will be of little use.
Simplification will be welcome when the time comes and when it is possible, but it will be insufficient without increasing awareness.
In the face of this risk, I would go as far to say that action is not sufficient, but that what we need is obstinacy.
The culture of prevention must be insistent, to the point of boredom.
There must be new standards when necessary, more material and human resources, specific actions in sectors and companies with greater than average accident levels, monitoring of the different plans and exchange of best practices and the avoidance of new risks.
The health, safety and dignity of the European citizens is at stake.
Mr President, as is apparent from what the Commissioner said this evening, we rarely disagree with the Commission on the direction we should all take when we talk about the working environment.
We are all of us concerned about the fact that far too many people receive lasting physical injuries in the course of their work.
What perhaps is worse is that, in a long list of areas, there has in actual fact been no improvement in the working environment in the EU.
It is against that background, Commissioner, that we had hoped that the Commission might have been more ambitious in its working environment strategy and, in any case, when it came to following this up.
I had hoped that we might today have been able to obtain a promise of more than just timetables for the various activities.
As the rapporteurs have emphasised, the situation in the area of the working environment is such that, since 1992, there have been swingeing cutbacks in the resources available to the Commission in this field.
I am aware that there are different ways of doing the calculations, but the fact is that the money is not enough.
We are concerned here with cutbacks at a time when problems in the working environment have become more complicated and extensive and when, as a matter of fact, we face new working environment problems.
We must work with different tools, we must look into prevention and we must help the national authorities.
There are many very complicated tasks that have to be carried out, and the challenges we face in terms of directives cannot adequately be described in a three-minute speech.
As Mrs Evans has also pointed out, we know that working environment problems may be in danger of becoming problems for women.
We know that small and medium-sized enterprises require special attention.
There is an urgent need for a directive on the whole range of muscle and bone problems.
Stress and harassment require concerted action, and we are also aware of the possible need for a general recognition of occupational illnesses in a minimum directive.
In the light of all the initiatives we all consider necessary, what is probably our greatest disappointment is that the Commission does not intend to follow up this strategy with a proper action plan.
When the Commission says that it would like to be involved in timetabling, our answer must be that timetables should be made still more binding, and we must propose that a proper action plan in actual fact be prepared.
If the Commission agrees that we must have timetables and that we must make them more binding, it will hopefully - at the end of this debate in which there will presumably be more people demanding an action plan - explain to us why it does not go the whole hog, pursue this strategy further and draw up a proper action plan.
We know, of course, that this would be more binding upon the European Parliament, the Commission and, especially, the Member States.
I hope that we can make progress.
We need an action plan covering the working environment.
Mr President, although I welcome some of the points in Mr Hughes' report, especially the simplification of existing Community legislation and better monitoring, I am very unhappy that my amendments on comprehensive impact assessments did not pass in committee.
My group agreed that I should table the amendments again in plenary but, unfortunately, no other group was prepared to open up the process.
Legislation should only be brought forward when we demonstrate that there is a clear need for it, rather than best practice or the exchange of best practice.
We must first make sure that existing legislation in the same field is being implemented across the European Union.
Secondly, as I have already said regarding comprehensive impact assessments, we must have an impact assessment for each Member State, taking into account the impact on industry, on business and on the workforce.
Unfortunately, quite often the impact assessments coming forward from the Commission look more like explanatory statements to me rather than comprehensive impact assessments.
Above all, in health and safety we need to have up-to-date scientific and medical evidence to demonstrate the need for such legislation.
Take the example of the vibrations directive.
I was given a lot of documents by the Commission.
The ISO standards report, the only one that was really up to date, actually said that there was no quantitative link between whole body vibration and lower back pain, but still we brought legislation forward.
I am pro-European but we bring forward more and more legislation without demonstrating the actual need for it.
This brings the European Union into disrepute.
Although we may need some of the legislation Mr Hughes has proposed in his report and which the Commission has proposed, without a guarantee of a proper comprehensive and independent impact assessment, the ELDR Group will have to abstain on the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, I am highly sympathetic to the content of Mr Hughes' report.
The text is very clear.
He is extremely worried that so little is happening, and he puts forward a long list of proposals of a legislative and non-legislative nature which could improve the situation.
I am sure that he will gain the support of the whole Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left for all this.
At the same time, he also addresses implementation and the difficulties of getting it all to work in reality.
I believe we should speak more plainly in this context.
This is in fact a dispute.
We talk about dialogue and cooperation, but it is actually a dispute.
Companies are required to put pressure on costs and profit margins in competition with other companies.
The cutbacks have to be made somewhere.
Health and safety cost money.
We cannot achieve proper health and safety at work if the unions are not strong enough to put pressure on companies.
These are the circumstances of the dispute, which are inherent in our system.
We should recognise this in some way if we want better health and safety at work.
Legislative and non-legislative methods work where there are employee organisations able to use the laws, recommendations and guidelines which we draw up.
That is the reality of the situation.
Perhaps we should discuss whether we need to strengthen employee organisations, for example by strengthening union rights.
It may be that the opportunities for legal assistance in disputes should be increased.
Increased expert assistance might be considered.
In the nineteenth century, when there were no strong unions, factory inspectors helped workers.
In Eastern Europe we might need work and factory inspectors of the type found in the UK in the nineteenth century.
We should perhaps make it clearer to the candidate countries that the right to strike is part of the body of law, or acquis communautaire, which they are expected to introduce.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Hughes, the fact that sound reports are being produced is excellent, in my view.
I particularly endorse Mr Hughes' report.
I have heard him say once that in his opinion the analysis in the Commission communication was solid, but the actual detailing of it left something to be desired.
I think I saw this in the EU reports today.
In my view, the analysis is satisfactory, but certainly not solid, for the simple reason that there are far better practices in Europe than those described in this document.
I am particularly concerned with the element of well-being at work.
After all, legislation on health and safety at work is solid legislation.
It is about vibrations, noise, and so on. Extensive research has been done in the Netherlands, for example, as to how well-being at work should be interpreted.
This covers aspects that involve organisations, and aspects that can also have repercussions at a later date in the form of repetitive strain injury, stress or numerous other forms of non-well-being.
A number of these elements have been mentioned in the Commission's document in connection with investing in quality, but this aspect came to an abrupt end with the indicators that were developed afterwards by the Belgians.
It is regrettable that this area is not further elaborated upon, as the proposals are actually a kind of odd collection of various points.
The clinical pictures and problems concerning well-being have been known for a long time, and yet no date has yet been set for these proposals.
So once again, I endorse Mr Hughes' description of the problems, and I also hope that he may have the moral fibre to withdraw his report if the Commission is not committed to solving the problems surrounding the reduction in staffing levels, the balance between legislative and non-legislative measures - which, in my view, is still wanting - and, above all, the lack of an action plan with a timeframe to back it up.
Mr President, the Commission document on health and safety at work is a good document.
It talks of the importance of health and safety at work, of the need to strengthen the prevention culture and to secure a better application of existing law.
I very much agree with all of that.
It portrays the problem as follows: the preventive culture of EU directives has not yet been fully understood, nor has it been applied effectively on the ground.
I agree.
It admits that people tend to see the Community legal framework as being excessively complex and unclear and proposes that it be simplified and rationalised.
I agree with that too.
I would have hoped that Parliament might have seen fit to endorse these Commission proposals, but the rapporteur has gone off in the opposite direction.
He claims that, because Commission staffing has been reduced to some 40% of its 1992 levels, this indicates much lower priority within the Commission.
This is nonsense.
However, for some people all roads always lead to the standard socialist solution of more money, more people and more regulation.
I note the rapporteur graciously referred to the joint amendment we tabled, which was the great highlight in committee - perhaps it could be the highlight of his report.
Colleagues may well hope this is the start of a great new partnership, but I suspect they may have to wait a little longer for it to blossom.
We will hope together for progress.
Meanwhile, the rapporteur wants to extend the scope of the framework directive to propose new legislation on workplace bullying and a new directive on workplace ergonomics, strengthen the display screen equipment directive and amend the manual handling directive.
All that appears on just the first page of his recommendations.
We do not need more directives.
I suggest his conclusions are wrong because his analysis is wrong.
The UK Conservative delegation will be voting against it and we will not be alone.
I would add that Ireland has just voted to allow the entry of applicant countries into the EU.
If the applicant countries read the Hughes report, they may not want to join.
Mr President, I want to thank the Commission for a sound report.
I also want to thank Mr Hughes for emphasising the importance of focusing upon implementation of the legislation.
Danish employers often maintain that, unlike their opposite numbers in many other countries, they have to comply with the regulations governing the working environment.
To be frank, I am tired of having to listen to this remark without being able in all honesty to contradict it.
I should like to be able to repudiate such assertions in the future.
That is why it is important for us to obtain more focus on the practical implementation of working environment legislation so that a good and safe working environment really is created at all workplaces in the EU.
That being said, we must also give careful consideration to the type of regulation with which we can best make the working environment safe.
Legislation is not always the correct route to go down.
Sometimes, improvements are better achieved through training, the sharing of experiences and the development of the social dialogue.
A good example is the combating of stress and harassment as problems that can only be solved through better cooperation in the individual workplace.
That is why I also think that the combating of stress and harassment is a matter for the two sides of industry.
Mr President, Commissioner, although the European Union has helped to improve health and safety legislation, it must be acknowledged that the situation is declining in some Member States and in some industries.
The report by Stephen Hughes quite rightly emphasises three important points: the lack of resources, the absence of an action plan, the lack of balance between the legislative and non-legislative instruments.
The report therefore calls for Community legislation to be simplified, for improvements in its implementation in the Member States and for issues relating to gender and corporate responsibility to be taken into account and for new instruments and specific measures addressing the situation in the candidate countries to be implemented.
The report highlights the need for a detailed plan to be drawn up that has financial commitments and clear deadlines for each proposal and methods of monitoring its implementation.
It also stresses and does so very firmly - this is something that I welcome - the need to integrate the gender dimension in the measures to be taken.
Generally speaking, women receive the lowest salaries, have the least job security, and are at greatest risk of psychological or sexual harassment.
Lastly, we must significantly improve the health and safety of women who are pregnant or breast-feeding or who have young children.
I would also like to congratulate Stephen Hughes on this report, which I fully support.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no disputing the fact that, along with the rules on free movement, health and safety at work is one of the European Union's spheres of activity that does not lack an unambiguous legal basis.
The enactment of minimum requirements in this area is necessary in order to prevent, in this European internal market, competitive advantages from being won as it were on the backs of the workforce.
In this sense, it is also laudable that the Commission is thinking about the future and setting out its primary areas of concern.
As well stated in this report, women and people with disabilities should be the main areas of concern.
I am, though, rather wary of efforts to interpret the law broadly and make every conceivable aspect of working life subject to European regulation.
In this area, too, there must still be room for national peculiarities and independence.
We are indeed facing great changes in working life in Europe.
There are fewer and fewer employees in the traditional sense of the word.
What are termed atypical working patterns are on the increase, and I also cannot rid myself of the suspicion that, in the absence of solutions to the real problems, we are increasingly churning out papers and declarations of intent that do workers at their actual workplaces precious little good.
It seems to me to be a fact that - be it on the grounds of the oft-cited globalisation or of general developments in society - there is less protection for workers, the value of work as a factor of production is decreasing and the worker's need for protection is falling behind, whether despite European integration or because of it.
Greater attention therefore needs to be given to the maintenance of the status quo as regards safety in actual workplaces.
We have to maintain the level of protection that we have achieved and made into one of Europe's common assets; it must also be introduced in the candidate countries, not only on paper, but also in reality.
Paper can hang around a long time, even, and indeed especially in Europe - we all know that.
But the industrial safety that we have achieved is at the heart of the social dimension of a Europe that is becoming more integrated, something that I believe workers see as a far more positive development than papers on employment and other aspects of strategy.
Mr President, the rapporteur himself points out that, despite all the wonderful statements to the effect that workers must be protected at all costs, the resources made available for this purpose are not only remaining stagnant. In actual fact, they are in decline.
Even if the Commission were to increase its resources, what action could it take in response to the quest for profit of large employers, which leads to staff reductions, and therefore, an increase in the work of those who remain, to cuts in safety spending, and widespread job insecurity, sub-contracting and temporary work, which force badly paid workers to contend with situations for which they are unprepared?
Even in a country such as France, almost 800 people die each year in work-related accidents, and several thousands are crippled for life.
Almost all of these accidents could be avoided, if only the resources were made available, in other words, if cuts were made in the dividends given to the all-important shareholder.
Unless employers are forced to respect the safety and lives of their workers instead of making profit their number one priority, even the best resolutions will remain hesitant speeches.
Mr President, of course we all want health and safety at work, employers, workers and shareholders.
What good is it if we have health and safety but no work?
There is the problem and there is the challenge.
There is an honourable tradition in the long campaign and struggle to achieve acceptable standards of health and safety in the workplace.
This started way back with the industrial revolution.
It freed children from hard manual labour in the mines and the mills, and to this day it protects workers against avoidable accidents and illnesses.
And it is not over yet.
Still there are unacceptable accidents on the farm and on the factory floor.
Only last month on a farm next door to mine in Scotland, the young husband and father of a family died after being caught in a potato-harvesting machine.
We must do all we can and continue to strive to eliminate all such tragedies.
Our work and business culture must be a safety culture, but life and work can never be devoid of risk.
There is no way we could achieve that utopia and still have a working economy, where men and women leave home each day for their workplace and thereby support their families and our economy.
Be in no doubt that absurdly exaggerated restrictions and red tape will only kill off enterprise and the enterprises to which our constituents resort each day to make their living and provide the prosperity on which we all depend.
The Commission has it very nearly right. Apply effectively the legislation we already have and encourage health and safety actions as good for business as well as for workers.
Mr Hughes' report goes far too far.
Its litany of exaggerated good intentions and its demand for yet more legislation risk the future of Europe's businesses, of our prosperity and our jobs.
Mr President, although there are different opinions on this communication, I believe we can strike a balance.
As I have said, this health and safety at work strategy is an action plan for the European Community as whole.
So we have to take account of the differences between the Member States, their different laws and definitions, the Treaty, the legal basis and the constraints on the Commission's human resources budget.
Attention has been drawn to the human resources cutbacks.
But we have the Bilbao Agency.
The Commission services and the Bilbao Agency have different terms of reference, but the Bilbao Agency provides support in the form of information, campaigns, analyses and studies.
So there is very close cooperation.
In any case, I cannot commit myself to more human resources, since you all know how difficult an issue that is.
What we have proposed in this strategy is realistic and the Commission is able to carry it out with the existing resources.
Now some specific comments.
It is always assumed that the solution for any political issue is legislation.
We do not automatically accept or rule out the need for legislation, we are just saying that, in many cases, the situation needs to be assessed to see whether such legislation is necessary.
Mrs Lynne questioned whether this procedure was always right and whether the existing data or studies were necessarily sufficient to demonstrate the need for legislation.
On the specific issue of vibration, there have been many different studies.
We have received data from all the Member States proving there was a real problem.
We shall be analysing it and then presenting proposals for any follow-up action.
It is not just legislation.
There are so many different issues in the Commission's text.
Reference was made to quality.
We have already started working with Eurostat on the harmonisation of at least the definitions in the various Member States.
At the moment they define accidents differently, which sometimes causes confusion.
We are therefore working towards harmonisation of the existing definitions.
Then we have to work on concrete indicators.
These are very specific and should be submitted according to a timetable.
Benchmarking has been referred to.
I spoke about that earlier.
Partnership is one of the cornerstones of the whole concept.
Under the strategy, each of the partners involved is required to present its own action plan.
We have already received action plans from the social partners.
Each Member State and each partner has to submit its own specific programme.
We have already worked through the issues with the applicant countries, and there are concrete references and commitments concerning those countries as well.
In conclusion, we can in future work together in cooperation with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to assess the potential for more precise commitments.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, point 4 of the Community health and safety strategy 2002-2006 which we have just debated calls for an extension to the scope of framework Directive 89/391/EEC - groups of workers excluded - and amongst other types of work it names that carried out by the self-employed.
The recommendation I am presenting and which we are debating in the European Parliament asks that the health and safety at work protection offered to salaried workers be extended to self-employed or independent workers.
Our thinking is based on the fact that workers who carry out their professional activity outside a working relationship with an employer or company are not generally protected by the Community directives relating to health and safety at work.
In fact only three directives refer to them, sometimes, tangentially - specifically Council Directive 92/57/EEC on the implementation of minimum safety and health requirements at temporary or mobile construction sites - and take account of self-employed workers carrying out their activities insofar as they may constitute a potential source of risk for salaried workers at those sites as a result of their activities. In other words, risks caused by the self-employed worker which they are not protected from.
Council Directive 92/29/EEC on the minimum safety and health requirements for improved medical treatment on board vessels does not fall specifically under Directive 89/391 and what I have said about Directive 92/57 also applies to it.
And the most recent Directive, Directive 2001/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 amending Council Directive 89/655/EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work, refers in one of its recitals to self-employed workers, pointing out that when they personally use work equipment they may put the health and safety of employed workers at risk, as if the self-employed worker were considered a risk factor not deserving of protection from the same risks, as if they were not considered truly a worker.
A large majority of Member States do not provide legal health and safety protection for self-employed workers, and there is great diversity and heterogeneity between levels of protection.
Measures and decisions to combat the conversion of risk into accidents have traditionally appeared linked to the concept of the employed worker, perhaps because the independent self-employed worker should take responsibility for their own health and safety, a reasoning which is insufficient and unjustified.
It therefore seems that action at Community level is required, in order to ensure a minimum degree of protection for self-employed workers against professional risks, because, as well as the self-employed worker isolated in a workplace with one or more self-employed workers, the development of the employment structure, when companies are subcontracting work to micro-companies or self-employed workers, gives rise to new work safety problems: the safety of self-employed workers and that of employed or self-employed workers who work alongside them.
All workers deserve protection.
Self-employed workers seem to be subject to the same risks as dependent workers, but their deficient training and information may also be the cause of accidents and injuries for them and for other employed workers.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with a broader problem, that of the organisation of work characterised by the use of workers provided by temporary work agencies, the dividing up of the productive process, allocating it to contractors, subcontractors and self-employed workers and externalised and decentralised production methods in general.
In my opinion, and I believe this is shared by everybody, the work safety protection of workers cannot depend on the legal status of each worker exposed to risks, whether they be independent, dependent or salaried.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights does not make this distinction.
Every worker has the right to work in conditions that respect their health, safety and dignity, according to the Charter.
Where the law makes no distinction, neither must we.
The procedure for application is a recommendation which must facilitate the process, the objective of which is clear; the obligatory application to independent or self-employed workers of the same rules which are applicable to salaried workers.
It is clear that the culture of prevention takes on more significance here.
In many cases, the self-employed workers themselves, who are the main beneficiaries, will have to invest in protection measures, and in others they will have to acquire their own information and training.
Without getting into issues such as those relating to liabilities in certain types of accident, I believe that the constant and determined fight against accidents now has a new factor within the collective landscape: that offered by a culture of prevention in which the protagonists are the workers and the authorities themselves.
Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez, and the Members of Parliament for their report and their support.
This is an important proposal, designed as it is to ensure that all workers are protected in the workplace because, as Mr Ãlvarez has explained so well, and there is no need for me to repeat what he has said, workers cannot be treated differently depending on how their work is defined.
The purpose of this initiative is to guarantee the same level of protection for self-employed workers and employed workers and it calls on the Member States to distinguish between three types of action.
The first is to include self-employed workers within the scope of health and safety at work regulations, assuming, of course, that their national legal systems so allow.
Secondly, it calls on the Member States to take the necessary measures so that self-employed workers can access information, training and technical support on risk prevention.
The third element is that the Member States are called on to provide access to suitable health monitoring systems.
It would appear that most of your amendments address situations where employed workers and self-employed workers work alongside each other and I agree that this sort of situation needs to be defined more clearly in the recommendation.
The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 11 and will make every effort to ensure that the Council does likewise.
The Commission does not agree with Amendments Nos 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 15 because they are either included in other amendments or call for certain binding legal arrangements which prejudge the efficacy of the recommendation during its first four-year pilot application.
The Commission feels that this proposal is an important step towards ensuring that legislation benefits all Europeans, irrespective of their type of work, a step towards the final objective of reducing accidents at work and occupational illnesses.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez for an incisive and thoughtful report.
The application of health and safety legislation to self-employed workers is an important subject, not least because of the ever-growing number of self-employed, subordinated, sub-contracted or atypical workers.
The creation of false forms of independence and self-employment can put workers who are in an employment situation beyond the framework of protection.
That is something we need to address.
This is something that the Commission recognises and, working together, as Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez has said, we have tried to do something about it over the years.
The extension of working time protection to road transport personnel in the directive, agreed at the end of last year, will cover owner-drivers, but only because parallel legal bases covering occupational health and safety on the one hand, and operational safety on the other have been used.
As Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez has pointed out this evening, the issue was also tackled in the framework of the directive on temporary and mobile work sites, but in a fairly limited way.
We therefore needed a more comprehensive approach and this recommendation may prove to be a useful contribution.
But other actions are possible, such as the more general extension of health and safety legislation to the self-employed suggested in Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez's Amendment No 4.
I know the Commission has difficulty with that.
The Commissioner will say that the legal base in Article 137 will not permit this.
But, if the recommendation does not have a positive impact, then we will all collectively need to come back together to reconsider the legal bases that are available to us and maybe take the route suggested in Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez 's Amendments Nos 7 and 22.
If not, imagine the sort of problems we face in relation to, for example, the proposed directive we are currently considering on protection of workers from risks related to exposure to asbestos at work.
We have massive amounts of asbestos hidden in our workplaces, homes, schools and hospitals.
Many people with employment contracts will handle it and, if they work for a demolition, removal or transportation company, they will be covered.
But a whole army of self-employed workers are also exposed to asbestos, in particular the electricians, plumbers and carpenters who come across it while doing maintenance work.
They will be predominantly self-employed.
It is also true that, even if we had a tenfold increase in the number of inspectors, they could not inspect this whole army of self-employed people at work.
They need to be able to take responsibility for themselves.
They need the information, the support and training to understand the risks they run if they take short cuts.
The recommendation is a very useful contribution in that respect.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez.
Thank you for this sound report.
I should above all like to focus on one element in this report in which reference is made to the Commission's approach, which has been relatively cautious so far.
The topic is labour relations. Everyone knows that they change at an incredible rate, and when I say an incredible rate, I mean an incredible rate.
As has been mentioned by different people, these encompass non-typical work of different kinds, and include temporary staff, the self-employed, the self-employed without staff, the spurious self-employed etc., a large number of whom attend the workplace to work.
This is not only important for the workers' own health, safety and well-being, but also for that of those indirectly involved.
In other words, changes do need to be made, particularly if you consider current legislation in the different countries and realise that some countries include the self-employed in their occupational health and safety legislation to some extent, while other countries do not at all.
The Commission has opted for a recommendation.
I would have preferred a stronger instrument, with immediate effect.
The reason is simple: we can accept the fact that a kind of evaluation is planned in four years' time and better measures will follow if need be, but on the other hand - and I should like to come back to this in connection with the previous topic - at what stage is the enforcement of this legislation monitored?
In the workplace and, if you are lucky, by labour inspectorates.
This inspection is often inadequate, however.
The most forceful impact is exercised by employers' organisations, trade unions in the workplace, works councils or other consulting organisations.
They carry out this work, and without legislation they have no leg to stand on.
Relations between employers and employees at the workplace are being completely overlooked here.
This is of crucial importance, and this is why tougher legislation will be needed in this area in due course.
Mr President, perhaps the most surprising thing about this is that in the committee vote it was only passed by 36 to 1.
I would have thought that anything like this would automatically have got unanimity in committee.
It is quite revealing also that it is only a recommendation.
As the Commissioner will know from the 'falls from heights' directive, it was pretty clear that we needed a very strong political message to cover the self-employed.
It is not only the construction industry that suffers from accidents every day of the week.
For instance, the interpreters in the booths around us, who are often self-employed and have to work under very stressful conditions, are the very people we would expect to receive Community protection under Community law.
You know very well that the European institutions abstain from introducing any of those laws to cover many of their staff, so we will not go down that path.
There is no doubt that by recommending Community health and safety legislation for the self-employed we have taken a giant step forward.
We should no longer rely on national statistics which tell us that accidents only happen to full-time employees.
That is clearly ridiculous.
You might - if you are a Christian - call a it sin that so many people involved in industries, just because they are considered self-employed, do not enjoy the protection they deserve.
Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez has spent a long time discussing health and safety in this Parliament.
I am very pleased that he has taken on this report, because I know the commitment we need from all sides of the House.
It is vital for the self-employed to be included in any health and safety and employment legislation that emanates from the Commission and this House.
Everyone in Europe must enjoy the same level of protection.
Mr President, a survey carried out by the Bilbao Institute shows in actual fact that the self-employed suffer occupational accidents, including fatal ones, more frequently than are those who are employed.
We also know that there is very considerable under-reporting of accidents involving the self-employed.
A survey in Britain reveals, for example, that only 5% of accidents involving the self-employed are reported, compared with half of those involving wage earners.
It is also the case that the self-employed are more vulnerable to occupational accidents than wage earners because of their limited resources and perhaps because they do not have to comply with the health and safety provisions.
The Commission must therefore be commended for raising the issue.
Clearly, such non-compliance must be brought to an end.
The self-employed must not be able to freewheel when it comes to the EU rules on the working environment.
We should, however, have liked the Commission to have looked at some of the amendments that try to make the recommendations more binding.
I am aware that there is no basis in the Treaty for doing this.
If we are now all agreed that there is a problem in its not being possible for the self-employed to be covered by the legislation governing the working environment, is it not then time we tried to change the Treaties?
Perhaps the Commission should be called upon to table a proposal on the subject to the Convention that is currently at work.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr President, Mr van Hulten, honourable Members, I would like to start by again thanking Parliament for its intensive and efficient cooperation on the recast financial regulation for the European Budget.
It was only the degree to which all the institutions were committed to working together that made it possible for the new financial regulation to be adopted unanimously by the Council on 25 June 2002.
The new financial regulation forms a fundamental part of the reform of the Commission, and I am proud of our having achieved this feat of strength in 2002.
I would like to re-emphasise my most especial thanks to Mr van Hulten and Mr Dell'Alba, the latter of whom is not here, but I would like to take this opportunity to mention him again.
One of our main concerns in the recasting of the financial regulation was that it should be simplified by incorporating the very detailed provisions in the rules for implementation, which are to be adopted even before the end of the year in order that they may enter into force on 1 January 2003, that is, at the same time as the new financial regulation.
Together with the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr van Hulten has done very thorough work, for which I thank you most warmly.
Speaking on behalf of the Commission, I have the following to say concerning the individual amendments. Firstly, many of the report's amendments are aimed at incorporating all the reports and items of information to be transmitted to the budgetary authority in an annex summarising the annual activity reports of the authorising officers whose offices administer resources.
The Commission favours such a tightening-up of the procedures.
It is proposed in the report, with reference to the summary of the annual activity reports of the authorising authorities, that the requirement that such a summary should be submitted to the discharge authority should apply not only to the Commission, but also to the other institutions.
The aim underlying this is one that I share, but the wording of the financial regulation does not permit us to impose such an obligation on other institutions, which in our view would have to agree to it.
Secondly, amendments are proposed in the report relating to the financial actors named in the financial regulation, and these amendments have two aims in view: a) that the budgetary authority be informed when the authorising authorities - at A1 level - and the accounting officer change, and b) that the posts of accounting officer and internal auditor be advertised externally.
It therefore follows that the budgetary authority will be informed of new appointments.
We are unable, however, to go along with the report's proposal, and, moreover, immediate external advertising would be contrary to the Statute, which expressly provides for posts to be, in the first instance, trawled within the institutions, before they can be advertised externally.
This means that immediate external advertising would not be compatible with the Statute.
Thirdly, as regards the amendments on the panel on financial irregularities, we can agree to the proposal that one of the panel's members should be an independent expert.
However, we see the mandatory investigation of irregularities even in unimportant cases as going too far.
Fourthly, as regards the directive on late payment, I note Parliament's reminder that the deadline for implementation has expired and that the institutions must, or at any rate should, abide by the rules on interest rates and deadlines applicable to late payment.
Fifthly, I am, in addition, able to agree to several amendments on accounting practice.
In particular, the Commission agrees to the clarification regarding the introduction of an integrated data processing system, which is entirely in line with its own earlier proposals.
As regards the demand for the drawing up of a list of all persons with the right of access to the electronic accounting system and the creation of an audit trail clearly showing what changes have been made to the system and by whom, I am able to inform you that the Commission is already in possession of both of these.
We welcome the incorporation of this provision into the rules for implementation, although I am at the moment unable to give you any information as to whether these conditions are already being complied with by the accounting systems of institutions other than the Commission.
My sixth point is that, in Amendment No 17, you demand that the budgetary authority should be informed of all waivers of recovery of debt in excess of EUR 100 000.
The Commission will take this on board as well.
Let me conclude with another clarification relating to the final amendment in the report.
This reads: 'The accounts for the 2002 financial year shall be drawn up and presented in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation of 1977, except for the obligation to submit these to the Financial Controller.'
I will point out now that it was made clear in the new financial regulation that there will be a transitional period up to the 2005 financial year for the clearance of accounts, meaning that, until 2005, the clearance of accounts shall follow the procedure laid down in the financial regulation as at present valid.
In view of the fact that the only Member States so far to have largely gone over to accrual accounting - a system of accounting of a rather more Anglo-American stamp - is Great Britain, where it took over seven years to introduce it, the timetable for the Commission continues to be ambitious in the extreme.
I repeat my offer to inform the Committee on Budgetary Control as soon as possible concerning the proposals that the Commission has made here.
Mr President, if this debate was scheduled at this time because of the Conference of Presidents' suspected interest in the subject matter, they were probably right.
It is not a very exciting topic to be discussing but, as we all know, it is very important or we would not be here.
I have to say it is a shame that two of the three committee members who voted against the report in committee and, therefore, triggered a debate in plenary, are not here today to explain their objections to the report.
I would like to thank the committee members who supported me in drawing up this report and giving it near unanimous backing in committee.
Thanks are due also to the Commission for the excellent cooperation we have again had on this report.
Many of the amendments contained in the committee's report are technical in nature.
I am not going to go into that.
I just want to mention a few substantive issues the Commissioner also raised.
The report deals with a number of points where we feel the implementing rules could be strengthened.
The first concerns weaknesses regarding the appointment and functioning of senior financial actors, something which has been an issue for the last few months.
There have been several instances of transfers or terminations of duties involving directors-general and there has been the case of the accounting officer, Mrs Andreasson.
The issues raised are being dealt with by the committee and assessed on their own merits.
However, issues of form have also arisen concerning how such appointments, transfers and terminations are dealt with within the Commission.
We would like to see certain safeguards built into the Financial Regulation.
Safeguards, not in the sense that you can be sure mistakes will never be made or problems will never occur, but safeguards that introduce more transparency to ensure that the process is visible and that we are not faced with surprises and faits accomplis.
This involves the appointment of senior officers, something to which you referred, Commissioner.
I will request that a report be submitted to the budgetary authority and that the accounting officer and internal auditor be appointed on the basis of a vacancy notice in the Official Journal.
They should be external candidates, where necessary on limited-term contracts.
I realise that we cannot change the Financial Regulation but we must take the matter up in the Staff Regulations, because it is an important point.
Secondly, there is the question of the financial irregularities panel, which is designed to fill a gap in the existing set-up and introduce new expertise.
What we want to avoid is a system where peers are assessing peers.
The introduction of an independent external element is, therefore, important, and I welcome the fact that you have accepted that proposal.
Thirdly, there is the matter of improving the quality and integrity of the computerised accounting system, something you also mentioned.
We want a single integrated computer system, with access restricted to a list of authorised persons to be kept by the institution.
I realise that the Commission is already doing this, and it is important the other institutions should be required to follow.
Finally, we want to see an easy-to-read audit trail maintained, to ensure adequate control of expenditure.
The final point I want to mention is late payments and the need to bring commercial payments in line with the relevant directive.
I am sure my colleague, Mr Casaca, who has worked hard on this, will have something more to say.
Three amendments have been tabled in plenary in addition to the ones from the committee.
One by the PPE-DE Group and two by the GUE/NGL Group, none of which I support.
The PPE-DE is retabling an amendment that was rejected in committee, proposing to create a fully independent accounting officer with no lines of accountability and responsibility within the Commission.
I cannot support that because it contradicts the Financial Regulation itself, in relation to which these are implementing rules.
Nor is there any point in creating an isolated island within the institution, which would go against the whole principle of accountability.
Great formal power does not necessarily mean better decision-making, as we know.
With regard to the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group, I can agree in spirit with Amendment No 34 on the need for the accounting officer to have full information, but in practice it would lead to a huge bureaucracy, with 600 000 payments going through one single person.
Although not the aim of the amendment, it would certainly lead to unnecessary bureaucracy.
The second amendment concerns the proposal on the criteria to be taken into account in the event of a waiver of recovery of an established debt.
There are two criteria: one on competition and one on economic and social damage caused by a debt if it is recovered.
The GUE/NGL Group wants to scrap this possibility for authorising officers.
The amendment we have introduced and which you have just accepted, introducing a reporting requirement to Parliament, offers sufficient safeguards.
To conclude, I think these amendments strengthen the proposal and I call on the Commission to incorporate them all into the final text.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what would a regulation such as the EU's Financial Regulation be without rules for its implementation?
Obviously, it would be worthless or impracticable and incapable of being implemented, for, in the aftermath of our sustained work, in committee and in plenary, on a recasting of the Financial Regulation, here, hot on its heels, comes the regulation on the rules for implementation.
Why do I lay such emphasis on this?
I do so because I think we are giving another example of how legislation is evidently insufficient, but needs further elaboration.
That does not help European law to be clear, simple or comprehensible.
Perhaps, though, this wide-ranging creativity in legal matters does indeed contribute towards legal veracity, by which I mean the application of laws currently in force.
It is with reference to this that I ask the Commissioner responsible for these matters to act in accordance with the law and not follow the example of the President of the present Commission, who simply describes current laws - such as the Stability Pact - as stupid and fails to apply them.
The fact that the degree to which public has confidence in this Europe of ours is largely dependent on the Financial Regulation and on the rules for its implementation means that these are not in any way suited to being played about with in this way.
Such confidence is damaged by the Commission's thoughtless and arrogant way of acting or failing to act; among other things, it has obviously neglected to ensure that its accounting system is reliable and proof against manipulation. This is a dereliction of duty dating back to the day it took office, despite repeated admonitions from, inter alia, the European Court of Auditors, and one for which it must be held accountable.
That is also precisely why it is so important that the so-called accounting officer should be in a clearly defined and independent position.
The Commission having, unfortunately, been so irresponsible as to abolish the independent financial controller, the accounting officer will acquire even greater importance.
He must be able to get his hands on additional information with absolute independence, suspend payments, and criticise people in prominent positions, without being removed from office and subjected to disciplinary proceedings or something of that sort.
I therefore ask you to support my group's Amendment No 33, and also the other two amendments tabled by Mr Blak, which are also intended to enhance the clarity and transparency of the law.
We must not allow large margins of appreciation in budgetary law.
Mr van Hulten, I am not surprised at your lack of support for Amendment No 33.
The arguments you adduce here are the same as in committee, but their constant repetition does not render them any more effective.
We must, in these matters, avoid the least suspicion of decisions being arbitrary or partisan, for only in this way can the Commission disabuse people of their impression that a more lenient standard is applied to the handling of European funds than applies to the handling of national funds.
Incidentally, I greatly regret the fact that Parliament has needlessly allowed itself to be put under pressure of time in dealing with these rules.
I do not know why we have not waited for the European Court of Auditors to give its opinion, but perhaps the rapporteur, in his great wisdom, will be able to give me an answer on that.
Mr President, I should like to place this debate in a political context: ultimately, we are in the European Parliament, which is supposed to be the most representative political body, and the one in closest contact with the citizens.
The use of the financial resources available to the European Union is probably the most complex but equally the most attractive duty that falls to the Community institutions.
The structure of the budgetary authority as defined in the Treaties, and the still inadequate role in budgetary policy allotted to Parliament require and justify particular attention to the control and monitoring of budgetary implementation.
The truth is that the monitoring of budgetary implementation can only be effective and useful if it is underpinned by principles of transparency and clarity and is supported by rules that are at once ambitious and simple.
This is clearly the aim of the new financial regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, which will enter into force on 1 January 2003, and, specifically, the aim of the new implementing rules proposed by the Commission.
The wording used by Mr van Hulten for these rules, without undermining the essence of the Commission proposal, enriches the control and monitoring procedure to an extraordinary degree, making it more comprehensible and straightforward, in other words, it significantly steps up control of the efficiency of Community expenditure.
The current budgetary framework is acknowledged to be a precarious one, which does not respond fully to the Union's political priorities.
Consequently, and in the absence of a revision of the financial perspective that could increase the volume of resources available to the European Union, it is becoming mandatory for the European Parliament to make full use of all its competences and prerogatives.
The European Parliament will only make full use of these prerogatives and competences if it is able to intervene politically within an administrative framework that is sufficiently dynamic and stabilising but, above all, comprehensible and effective.
The principles of unity and universality enshrined in the rules contained in the new regulation - albeit in embryonic form - and which the rapporteur strengthens, as well as the status conferred on internal hearings at the initiative of the rapporteur for each institution are, in my opinion, extremely important and significant steps forward.
The report by Mr van Hulten whom I welcome and congratulate personally, therefore deserves the support of the European Parliament.
Mr President, Mr van Hulten has done some excellent work in reforming the Financial Regulation and this report is also an excellent example of that.
My sincerest thanks go to him accordingly.
The reform of the Financial Regulation began with the report in 1999 by the external committee of experts commonly known as the Five Wise Men.
The report mentioned the importance of both simplifying financial administration and clarifying personal accountability.
Parliament and the Council approved the new Financial Regulation last spring and it comes into force from the beginning of next year.
The reform is partly linked to the Commission's administrative reform.
The rules for implementation now being discussed are connected with this new Financial Regulation.
The reform would mean an end to the old ex ante control with responsibility moving away from financial administration to be borne entirely by the authorising officer.
This change will mean an increase in their power and responsibility.
Because authorising officers are the officials with the most important executive role they must be fully accountable for their actions, and cannot take refuge behind the backs of others.
With accountability hopefully becoming clearer, we can also increase efficiency, as at present, for example, delays in making payments in the Commission are too long and do not in any way match the sort of efficiency we see in the world of business.
The system now to be decided on must not be spoilt by new amendments.
For that reason, Amendments Nos 33 and 34, for example, are not acceptable, as they would allow for responsibility for execution to be shared once again by two people, the authorising officer and the accounting officer.
The system has to be clear and transparent.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Financial Regulation currently under discussion is likely to apply for many years to come.
It is therefore crucial that its provisions for implementation are as clear as possible. The new Financial Regulation should not only lead to efficient handling but also better supervision than was previously the case.
When supervision and operation are handed over to the various directorates-general, they must be monitored effectively.
It is therefore vital that the accounting officer has a strong and independent position.
We have proposed an amendment in this vein.
The accounting officer must be able to demand and receive more information, stop payments in cases of doubt and report directly to the highest level.
With this in mind, we would also like to express our regret that Parliament has not taken this opportunity to investigate the confusion in this area which has existed for years.
This should have been carried out by summoning Mrs Andreasen to appear before the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The fact is that we have still not received full answers on the approval of the Commission's accounts for 2001.
My political group has also proposed an amendment limiting the Commission's ability to write off and write down liabilities.
There must be clear grounds for writing off liabilities so that we do not see more cases like the Flechard case, where the person responsible for a serious error is not forced to accept the full consequences of their action.
This explains our second amendment.
Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Schreyer, if we are to take the Commission at its word when it makes these statements, then the new Financial Regulation is leading us into a new era of financial management, in which we will be able to resolve the problems of the past.
We will simply have to wait and see.
What we can, unfortunately, see at the present time is that the new era is being ushered in by the weakening of Parliament's rights.
The new Financial Regulation's rules of implementation, should, according to previous rules, have been decided on in agreement with Parliament.
In law, the Commission is no longer obliged even to listen to Parliament.
Of course, Mrs Schreyer, we welcome the way that you are doing that any way, as these rules of implementation do not apply to the Commission alone, but are in future to be applicable to all the EU institutions.
Let me pick out a number of points on which we should be asking the Commission to think again, if not to make improvements.
Take the accounting officer: according to this proposal, the institutions have to select their accounting officers from the ranks of the civil service.
Applications from outside will not be possible.
This means that we are in fact spoiling our opportunities for even considering external candidates.
You have told us, Mrs Schreyer, that the Statute prevents this.
Let me turn to the accounting officer's functional independence, on which depends the reliability and credibility of the figures we have to present to the public in their capacity as contributors to the European Union.
The draft has nothing to say about this.
Why do you not give the accounting officer a right of appeal against attempts at interference in his work, as you have to the internal auditor?
There are other aspects that cause me concern; one example is the so-called panel on financial irregularities.
I hope that is not meant to compete with OLAF or even interfere with its work.
Conflicts of interest are given a comprehensive and appropriate definition in the Financial Regulation, but the rules of implementation make it look as if this can be simply evaded.
Finally, Article 84's provisions on the waiver or claims open the door to waiving the recovery of debts.
It will be the European taxpayer who will have to cough up for these decisions, by paying additional contributions.
Thanks are due to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, for the speed with which he has worked under enormous pressure of time.
Mr President, the rapporteur on the rules for implementing the Financial Regulation has presented many good proposals, but I would like to say right at the outset that we should avoid giving the impression that the last Commission's downfall was due to a bad financial regulation and the rules for its implementation.
It is my belief, Commissioner, that such would be a false assessment and would lead us into renewed disaster.
It was far more a matter of culture.
If, on the one hand, you are saying that the amendment of the Financial Regulation and the rules associated with it is one of the most ambitious tasks involved in the reform of the Commission, then I have to say that you cannot be aiming very high!
You tell us that the reason we cannot have external candidates for the post of accounting officer is that there is a Statute that says so.
I ask you!
If the Commission cannot even alter a Statute, how does it think it is going to govern the EU?
Surely one of the first things that the executive should be able to do is to change the rules governing its own staff!
That, Commissioner, is just not acceptable!
Perhaps you are putting the cart before the horse.
In my judgment, this is about changing the culture.
That was possible under the old rules, and will also be possible under the new ones.
When, for example, I study reports, as I have done in connection with the whole Eurostat business, in which you looked on and you continued to spend European taxpayers' money on employing firms that, to your own knowledge have demonstrably deceived and cheated you, I do not know, Commissioner, whether this renewed culture, under the banner of zero tolerance, the idea with which we started out in 1999, has actually gained a foothold yet!
Mr President, I wish to use this minute to congratulate the rapporteur on the magnificent work he has produced to date, which leaves us an extremely positive legacy, but which also commits him to the future and requires him, in the implementation of this regulation and specifically in all aspects concerning the accounting system that will be implemented, to respond as effectively as he has done in the case of the Financial Regulation.
I wish to say to Commissioner Schreyer that I have listened closely to everything she said, especially her approach to one of the points that I believe to be crucial: the issue of the directive on payments, which is included in this implementing regulation.
I believe this to be an extremely positive point and I wish, therefore, to congratulate the Commission, but there is no doubting that the great challenge is to see how this regulation will be implemented, both in the accounting system and in the financial management system.
With regard to this challenge, we will be here to assess the Commission's action.
Commission. (DE) Mr President, I would like to return to some of the points that have been made.
Let me first put something straight. The Court of Auditors may have had many criticisms to make of various accounting rules and of the system itself, but it always used to confirm that the completed accounts were a true and faithful record of income and expenditure.
Turning, secondly, to the question of the accounting officer's role, I am also grateful for the clarifications that have been given today.
The accounting officer carries out the orders of the authorising authority, and the accuracy of the accounting system is his responsibility, but he is not the financial controller.
On the contrary, it is important that financial management and accounting should be kept as separate tasks, and that the bookkeeper should not be involved in the management of funds' resources.
That is not his job, nor should it be; on the contrary, it is for him to keep the books properly.
This separation of the functions is important.
As far as the external advertisement of posts is concerned, the Statute - which, as you will be aware, is laid down by the Council - governs the sequence of events involved in recruitment.
It does not prevent posts being externally advertised.
It is the stages that we are dealing with here.
I must, though, reiterate that the Financial Regulation stipulates that the accounting officer shall be an official of the Commission.
Why is that the case?
It is of course because this person opens accounts for the European institutions, which means that he or she is in a position of trust.
That being so, one cannot but wonder whether the concealment of important facts in a job application could justify this position of trust.
It has been urged that the rules on accounting procedures should be clear.
In the past, of course, we had very clear and simple rules, in that the entire public accounting system was based on what, in Germany, we term cameralistic accounting, in which the cash spent and the cash books - the actual outgoings and the actual receipts - are compared with what is in the budget.
That is, of course, also the way in which the Commission and other offices administering public expenditure are accountable to the body which legislates on the budget.
They want us to tell them how much of any given budget line they have voted has actually been spent on it.
This accounting system will of course continue to play a part in the future, but this information is now no longer adequate for the purposes of management.
For that, we need more information in the accounting system.
The Commission has therefore proposed, and the legislature has so decided, that we should go further along this Anglo-American road towards a system of accrual accounting, containing more rules and information specific to management functions.
We will, however, have another opportunity to discuss these issues.
Let me repeat that I would be more than happy to talk about these issues in the Committee on Budgetary Control, but, at this late hour, I will just thank Mr van Hulten again for the report and congratulate him on it.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Preparatory work for the European Council in Brussels on 24-25 October
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparatory work for the European Council in Brussels on 24 and 25 October 2002.
- (DA) Mr President, I have been asked to make a statement entitled 'Preparation for the European Council meeting in Brussels on 24-25 October 2002'.
This meeting will play a central role in further work during the Danish Presidency.
As we know, the agenda will be dominated by the important topic of enlargement and also, in this connection, the subject of Kaliningrad, in which the European Parliament has of course taken a great interest.
The outcome of the meeting will be of great importance as regards the possibility of realising the common goal of concluding enlargement negotiations with up to 10 countries.
Therefore, the important thing is for the European Council to reach as many decisions as possible, so that as little as possible remains to be done in Copenhagen. It is true that what remains could be really tough going.
At the European Council meeting, the Chairman of the Convention will inform the European Council of the status of the Convention's work, and the President of the European Parliament will also speak to the European Council.
Let me start with the latter.
The meeting with the President of Parliament has become an established tradition which I know is valued highly by Heads of State and Government in the European Council.
Bearing in mind the agenda before us, it will of course be particularly interesting to hear the views of the President of Parliament on the issues the Council will be discussing, that is, enlargement, and also the related subject of Kaliningrad, which I shall come back to.
It is very convenient that the discussion with the President of Parliament is taking place immediately before the working meetings on enlargement and Kaliningrad.
In addition to the contribution of the President of Parliament, it is of course our hope that the meeting, including the opportunity to exchange information and ideas for use in further work, will prove beneficial to the President of Parliament and Parliament as a whole.
I now wish to say a little about enlargement.
It is strongly to be hoped that decisions will be taken in Brussels on a number of very important subjects that could pave the way for enlargement.
It must be decided which of the candidate countries will be able to conclude accession negotiations this year.
The starting point will be the Commission's progress reports on the individual candidate countries and the Commission's strategy paper on enlargement as a whole, which was presented on 9 October by Commissioner Verheugen, who is also present here.
On the basis of a comprehensive evaluation of the progress of each individual candidate country, the Commission concludes that 10 countries will be able to meet all the criteria by the start of 2004, and on that basis it is recommended that accession negotiations be concluded as planned here this year.
At its meeting in Copenhagen, the European Council will also discuss those candidate countries which are not expected to be able to conclude negotiations this year (Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey), with a view to making decisions on the further course of the accession process for these countries.
Decisions are also to be taken in Brussels on the outstanding issues in the accession negotiations in connection with the financial package.
There was agreement on the institutional issues at the General Affairs Council yesterday, and the European Council will amongst other things lay down, as part of the financial package, the total amount to be allocated to enlargement, candidate countries' participation in the common agricultural policy, including their share of direct income support, and the total aid from the cohesion and structural funds to the candidate countries.
The European Council should also take a decision on the matter of the net position of the candidate countries in relation to the EU budget, and agreement has been reached as to the basis for these calculations.
The debate on these subjects to date has shown that it will not be easy to reach agreement.
The European Council in Seville concluded that the EU's positions concerning the outstanding, financially onerous, chapters will be presented to the candidate countries at the beginning of November.
That means that the Brussels European Council must take decisions on these matters if the timetable laid down in Seville is to be met.
The Danish Presidency will insist on this, and so the meeting must go on until a solution has been found.
As I have said, we can expect it to be very difficult.
It will require a willingness to compromise on the part of everyone concerned, but a solution must be found.
In addition, Kaliningrad will be discussed, and on this point, too, significant progress was made at yesterday's meeting in Luxembourg, from which both Mr Verheugen and myself have just returned.
The matter was discussed in Seville: the Commission was asked to study the possibilities for an effective and flexible solution to the question of transit; a solution which would be in conformity with the acquis and would have the agreement of the candidate countries concerned.
The Commission submitted its communication on 18 September.
This has been discussed twice in the Council, and it was also discussed here in Parliament only last week, on 15 October.
Together with the Commission, the Presidency has held a series of talks with Russia and consulted Lithuania, in particular, which is the candidate country most affected.
Over and above the principles on which the Seville mandate was based, the EU has emphasised Lithuania's sovereign right to control its borders and to reserve the right to refuse entry.
Furthermore, it has been laid down that a solution must not hinder or delay Lithuania's full membership of Schengen.
The Council has agreed to give Lithuania a guarantee in that respect, and ultimately the Council agrees that Lithuania must be compensated for any additional expense arising from a solution to the transit question.
Russia has pressed home its desire to obtain the right to visa-free transit by train through Lithuania.
This is a solution which entails many problems of a technical, economic, legal and political nature.
The EU has not, however, ruled out examining the possibility, and the Presidency will continue to work towards a solution which satisfies all parties to the greatest possible extent and can win the support of the European Council.
The guidelines I mentioned here were followed at yesterday's General Affairs Council in Luxembourg.
Agreement was reached yesterday on making the provision I referred to: that Lithuania must be able to become a member of Schengen at the same time as the other candidate countries if it wishes; and it does.
This is the EU's position, and it seems to me, therefore, that the 15 governments have prepared themselves as well as possible for the discussions which are to take place at the European Council meeting in Brussels, and also for the subsequent talks with Russia which are to be conducted by the Presidency, and which will culminate in the EU-Russia Summit in Copenhagen in November.
On the subject of the Convention, the European Council, in conformity with the Laeken Declaration, will hear a report at the Brussels meeting from the Chairman of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, on the progress which has been made with the Convention's work.
Helping the work of the Convention along is an important ambition of the Presidency's.
The Convention has got off to a good start, and has now moved on to the important analysis stage.
The number of proposals is rising, the mounds of paper are growing, and it seems to me that we have been witness to an extremely exciting debate on the future of Europe, both in and around the Convention.
It has been a pleasure to see the firm commitment on the part of the members of the Convention, not least those members hailing from Parliament, who had been armed to the teeth, and who have made a particularly deep mark on the debate.
In the shape of the Convention, we see for the first time - and in the full glare of publicity - something as extraordinary as a genuine debate across European borders.
This is not something we are accustomed to.
As a rule, European politicians aim their contributions to the European debate at the public in their own, rather than other, countries.
That is not, however, the case where this debate on the future of Europe is concerned; and this, I believe, bodes well for our ambition to create European cooperation which is more democratic and has grass-roots support.
As will have been clear from my statement, we have an extensive and ambitious agenda for the Brussels Summit.
It is my hope and belief that all the countries will now show the necessary willingness to compromise and help to take the important decisions which I have spoken of here; and I shall not, of course, conceal the fact that the questions that remain are particularly tough nuts to crack, and here I am of course speaking of the economy.
I would like to repeat and underline that the European Council is looking forward to hearing what the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, has to say and to exchanging views with him.
The importance of Parliament to the enlargement process is undisputed.
Speaking almost with one voice, Parliament said very early on, first in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and then in plenary, what was to be done.
This has contributed to the momentum, the driving force, which means that the enlargement process cannot, we hope, be halted at the last minute.
This is something for which, on behalf of the Presidency, I wish, moreover, to thank Parliament most warmly.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the Irish have voted in favour of the Treaty of Nice, the last political barriers to ratification of the Treaty have been overcome and the way to enlargement is open.
I congratulate the Irish people on their decision.
It demonstrates their openness and sense of responsibility.
What is true for Ireland is true for us all.
It is in all our interests that enlargement should proceed without delay.
The forthcoming European Council in Brussels is therefore crucial.
The debate will focus on our proposals regarding the ten candidate countries with which we recommend winding up negotiations by the end of the year.
The date for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania and the next stage of Turkey's candidacy will also be discussed.
The agenda will include the issue of Kaliningrad too.
We may have the opportunity to review the international situation, focusing particularly on how best to continue combating terrorism in the light of the recent tragic events in Bali and the Philippines.
We will also hear what the President of the European Convention has to report and we will hold our customary exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament.
The first item on the Council's agenda will therefore be enlargement.
I would like to spell out once again the compelling reasons behind our recommendation to the Member States to conclude the negotiations with the ten countries.
We have a historic and moral duty to share with our European neighbours the stability and prosperity we have built up over half a century of integration.
Peace, stability, democracy and the rule of law are the essential ingredients for political stability.
All this has worked very well for us in the past. It will work for the future Member States too.
Enlargement will extend European governance and standards to the entire continent.
We expect to see a positive impact in very many areas: more efficient public administrations, more robust judicial systems, greater protection of minorities, more effective crime prevention, especially where cross-border crime is concerned, more stringent controls on illegal migration, enhanced monitoring of products on the market and, in particular, of food safety, and, lastly, stricter environmental standards.
The European Union's greater size will increase its political potential on the world stage.
This will bolster our policies in the fields of trade, financial markets, the environment and security.
Europe will be in a better position to defend human rights and to help reduce the North-South divide.
If we succeed in uniting faithfully and speaking with a single voice, we will be able to make a difference in issues such as climate change and managing the impact of globalisation.
On top of that, however, the first wave of ten new Member countries will bring enormous economic benefits for the Union as a whole - for both current and future Member States.
The increase in the Union's population will strengthen the single market: the population will be increased by approximately 75 - 77 million, bringing the total number of citizens in the Union to 453 million.
By way of comparison, consider that NAFTA - comprising the United States, Mexico and Canada - has a population of around 400 million.
Some say that, after the ten candidate countries join the European Union, the Union's GDP will grow by only 4 or 5% while the population will increase by 20%. There is nothing negative in that.
These statistics highlight the fact that we alone are achieving a process of democratic globalisation, even if only at regional level. They are by no means negative, for they are evidence of huge potential for growth, considering the trends displayed by these countries.
Indeed, we must not forget that the ten candidate countries are already growing at a consistently higher rate than the present 15 Member States.
Year on year, this was 2.4% in 2001 compared with 1.5% for the current European Union and a remarkable 4.1% in 2000 compared with our 3.4%.
Most importantly, the ten candidate countries will bring highly qualified human resources to the Union.
It is true that the enlargement countries will increase the Union's population by 20% and its income by only 5%, but the percentage of science and engineering students graduating in these countries each year corresponds to 25% of our total.
This is a resource which will contribute greatly to the increase in development.
Interpreting all these factors intelligently, we see that the candidate countries are our new frontier.
European industry will have new scope for development and expansion because there will be a great need for new technologies and because the new Member States will provide a market for our goods and services.
Ladies and gentlemen, those are the benefits enlargement will bring. It is now time to address the remaining problems.
First, however, I would like to make one minor general point: we must take great care not to jeopardise the success of enlargement by wrangling over details, as often happens in political decision-making.
The unification of Europe must always take precedence over narrow sectoral and national interests.
We need to concentrate on the larger picture and never lose sight of the opportunities I have just described.
The ten countries have made enormous progress in recent years.
The Commission's Regular Reports presented recently make this abundantly clear, and I want to emphasise that these analyses were neither overindulgent nor overoptimistic.
The Commission's confidence in the candidate countries is based on facts and thorough analysis.
The progress already made is the guarantee that all ten countries will be ready for membership in early 2004, including in those areas where the work undertaken still - of course - needs to be completed.
Nonetheless, despite our total confidence in the candidate countries, the Commission has undertaken to monitor their final preparations and progress even after accession.
To this end, we have prepared safeguard clauses for the internal market and justice and home affairs, which are the areas with regard to which our citizens have the most fears and the least confidence.
The safeguard clauses will take effect should pledges given not be respected - an extremely unlikely scenario but one which is still possible, and we must make provision for it.
As you are aware, the key points that will be on the table in the debate between the Heads of State and Government relate to the financing of enlargement. These last remaining issues are nonetheless highly significant.
The issue that meets with the broadest agreement is net transfers.
There is clear unanimity on two principles: firstly, on accession, the ten candidate countries must not find themselves in the position of net contributors; and secondly, all expenditure commitments must fall within the strict limits set at Berlin.
We have adhered to these two principles, and I therefore believe that it will not be difficult to reach agreement on the exact figure at Copenhagen.
As regards the Structural Funds, too, there appears to be growing consensus on an annual figure of around EUR 25.5 billion for 2004, 2005 and 2006.
Frankly, we can hardly offer our new fellow citizens less.
It will mean that the per capita amount received by the cohesion countries - the existing countries - will be EUR 231 in 2006 while the citizens of the new Member States will be entitled to EUR 137 per capita.
I do not think we can make the discrepancy any wider than this.
Lastly, there is the issue of agricultural expenditure, with which we are all familiar.
I know that some of the present Member States have reservations regarding the budgetary sustainability of these proposals and that they have asked for further guarantees.
It is right to reflect on the Union's future financial system - indeed, it is our duty.
The Commission stands by its position: all our proposals are in line with the financial ceilings laid down at Berlin and are without prejudice to any future decisions.
On all the financial issues outstanding, I expect the Brussels European Council to give the Danish Presidency and the Commission a mandate to conclude the negotiations with a view to a final decision being taken at Copenhagen.
On this I ask for your support.
Nevertheless - and this is a final addendum - the biggest effort we need to make in this last phase of the enlargement process is in the area of information.
The latest Eurobarometer survey, published two days ago, tells us that half the current Union citizens are in favour of enlargement while one third are against.
The remainder is neither for nor against. These figures are fairly reassuring in one sense but, in another, they give cause for concern: 65% of those surveyed think that enlargement will bring an increase in drugs trafficking, international organised crime and unemployment, which is exactly the opposite of what, on the basis of analyses, I genuinely believe will happen in the future.
Why, then, you may ask, should enlargement give rise to those fears?
The answer lies in the last Eurobarometer figure: those who feel that they have been properly informed about enlargement make up only 21% of the population, whereas 79% feel that they have not received sufficient information.
We clearly, therefore, need to make an effort to provide practical, sound, detailed information.
Those who the statistics tell us do not feel well informed are not necessarily against enlargement - they tend to be indifferent.
That, for me, however, is perhaps the most disturbing factor.
We must convince our fellow citizens that enlargement will bring solutions, not problems.
That is why the Commission has launched an information campaign targeting both the present Member States and the candidate countries.
The success of enlargement will depend on our ability to keep the public properly informed. We must not disappoint millions of Europeans in this respect.
Indeed, the future of our Union depends on the enthusiasm, the vigour and the astuteness of our final endeavours to complete the process.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the signal we got from Luxembourg yesterday was a strong and positive one.
The Council has accepted the Commission's recommendations that the negotiations with ten countries should be concluded.
The Council did this because the Commission had been able to make a convincing case that our recommendations were not based on a political wish list.
Our desire was not to take a politically desirable scenario and pronounce it realistic, but to declare what actually is realistic.
The Commission's statement that these ten countries will have completed their preparations by the scheduled date of accession is not a rough estimate, but rather a firm prognosis, founded on knowledge, experience and the actual stage that preparations have reached, and one that we will defend fair and square.
I think it important to note that the Commission came to this decision unanimously and that all my fellow-Commissioners, who bear responsibility for the extent to which policies work, said unequivocally that there remain within their fields of responsibility no problems that cannot be rectified by the scheduled date of accession.
If one considers what has to be done in the remaining 12 to 15 or 18 months, as against what has already taken place over the past five years - for it is only then that the complete picture becomes apparent - it is very clear to see that we are not being over-optimistic when we say that the nature of the preparations will be such that we can tell the citizens back home that the enlargement is as well prepared as it possibly could be.
The Council also took on board the Commission's proposals relating to monitoring and safeguard clauses.
This is a very important point.
This is not about any failure to trust the new members.
This is where we need a new instrument, because we find ourselves in a completely new situation.
The internal market and the single currency have, in the meantime made rapid progress and are almost fully developed.
We are dealing with countries that are undergoing a process of transformation.
Never before have we been in a situation in which we wanted to integrate ten countries at once, with a large number of them still in a process of transformation.
This can give rise to problems that nobody can foresee.
The Commission therefore considers it right and proper to have a very broadly framed safeguard clause, permitting us to intervene wherever unforeseen or unforeseeable problems crop up.
There is still a difficult stretch of the road ahead of us - that much is absolutely clear.
As again became clear yesterday, however, political momentum is strong enough to carry us onwards to Copenhagen and make Copenhagen, too, a success.
Not one Member State couples the threat of a veto to the demands and desires that are still present in this process.
It is important that we hold fast to the fact that, yesterday, all fifteen again committed themselves to the goal of completing the negotiations.
I would therefore like, briefly, to set out two expectations for the Council in Brussels to consider.
The very least that we need from the Heads of State and Government is an agreement permitting us, in the time between Brussels and Copenhagen, to get together with the candidate countries and properly sort out those financial and agricultural policy issues that are as yet unresolved.
The Commission does not believe it to be possible to reach compromises as late as the Copenhagen stage, as we would then be putting the candidate countries in a position where they would have to 'do or die', and we have to take the democratic rights of our future Member States seriously.
The enlargement process cannot be forced, but must be the outcome of mutual agreement and founded on mutual trust.
Discussion of the financial problems connected with enlargement no longer focuses, essentially, on the financial issues of 2004, 2005 and 2006; we are indeed already doing the groundwork for discussion of the next financial perspective for the post-2006 period.
Whilst this must be understood, it must also be said that the enlargement process must not be allowed to be taken hostage for positions that should be discussed only in the context of the next Financial Perspective.
I also think we can agree that we of course have to carry on down the path on which we set off in 1999 in Berlin, which involves the requirement that the European Budget be consolidated rather than simply allowed to burst.
I am glad that France and Germany in particular are currently making special efforts, including bilateral contacts, at coming to an understanding on this fundamental issue.
I do not believe that Germany and France have a responsibility in this area markedly different from the responsibility shared by others, but it is certainly true that it was always good for Europe when these two countries took a common line on a great, important, and forward-looking European project.
I would be very glad indeed if it proved possible for them to give this common line its final shape by the time the Brussels Council begins.
I believe that everyone must take on their share of responsibility and do their share of the work involved in this.
The Commission's work is, in essence, already done, but that does not mean that we can now sit idly twiddling our thumbs - I am not going to be out of a job for a long time yet.
What matters now is that everyone should understand that the enlargement project is political in nature.
Over the last few weeks, I have been in touch with a number of national parliaments and can say with all due caution that certain problems I have encountered there have something to do with a noticeable information deficit in those places.
What President Prodi said on the subject of information is crucial.
I draw for my concluding remarks on my experience of the Irish referendum; in Ireland, it became quite apparent that, if we are to be able to advance our European cause and gain public support for it, we have to really fight for this Europe of ours and for our European cause; we really have to be prepared to meet people halfway and tell them, in plain language, why it is right and necessary.
