However, I want to follow this up.
Under the current provisions, although permission should be sought, there are no guarantees that it will be.
If somebody can be tracked without their knowing it, that has very serious implications.
For the person being tracked, their personal security is violated; they may be, for instance, under the threat of violence.
There is a whole range of very serious civil liberties issues here.
I urge you to take this very seriously.
I will take it up in the UK and hope that you will pursue it here.
Â Â  . I would say to the honourable Member that if there were a problem of that sort, or if information were not made available to the consumers, then making a complaint to the national responsible body would be the right thing to do.
Â Â  . Madam President, the European Commission is of course extremely concerned at the many human rights violations, including mass rapes, taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo in consequence of a long period of conflict.
The Commission has in fact made support to the health sector and institutional support for democratic transition part of its 2003-2007 strategy for cooperation with the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This support is a differentiated and complementary response to the problem of mass rapes in that country.
Community cooperation experience in the health sector goes back a long way, with EUR 70 million having been spent on support programmes since 1992.
These programmes encourage access to basic health care and the supply of medicines at prices appropriate to the situation on the ground.
A new health support programme amounting to around EUR 70 million will be put in place to consolidate what has been achieved by the earlier programmes, and to extend their activities to other areas relating to health.
In its global plan for 2005, ECHO confirms its support for areas with a high incidence of sexual violence, in particular in the Kivus and Maniema.
Projects designed to restore the rule of law and promote womenâs rights are also being funded by the European initiative for democracy and human rights.
The Commission is also very active in the field of institutional support.
Since the beginning of this year it has in fact been assisting the Bunia court of first instance in Ituri, which deals with cases of rape.
The purpose of this support is to combat impunity and to pacify the region.
On a more structural level, the Commission is putting in place a mechanism for partnership and support for the Congolese Government with a view to reforming the justice system.
This will ultimately enable the national courts to deal effectively with cases involving actions for rape.
Finally, envelope B, to which the honourable Member refers in his question, is providing around EUR 27 million for urgent rehabilitation work in Congoâs eastern provinces, which are the most seriously affected by the conflict and hence by human rights violations.
Â Â  Madam President, grateful though I am to the Commissioner for his detailed reply, I still have the feeling that we are fighting a running battle in some ways.
Only a few weeks ago, the Presidents of Rwanda and of the Democratic Republic of Congo concluded a new peace agreement, only to be at each otherâs throats again a few days later.
My own sources in that country â a number of Catholic priests â have reported to me that there have been many gang rapes.
Once again, thousands to tens of thousands of women have been raped.
The Commission is indeed funding a programme in the region, but should we not look into the real roots of the conflict?
We all know that there are massive gains to be made from the mineral resources â diamonds, coltan and gold.
Together with the Council and its presidency, should the Commission not be taking action about this?
This has been going on for years.
I do indeed believe, Commissioner, that everyone expects you, with your personal dedication and your personal knowledge of the region, together with your colleague, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, to have a stronger and more effective presence in that region, and I should like to hear your view on this.
Â Â  . Madam President, I very much agree with the honourable Member.
As you well know, I am very sensitive to and very concerned at the situation in the Great Lakes countries and, more especially, by what is happening in eastern Congo.
That is why, when I leave you tomorrow morning, I shall be flying out there to make a repeat visit to all those countries and to review the situation with their leaders.
I am also aware of the renewed abuses and renewed and extremely serious acts of violence that the region is again witnessing.
The problem is not only the ex-FAR/Interahamwe, there are also groups of what are really organised criminals and others who are really living off the backs of the population and are behind what can only be described as atrocities.
I shall therefore be touring the capitals between 15 and 20 December.
I shall be meeting with those countriesâ presidents and various people in positions of responsibility, including United Nations officials, to see what the international community can really do and, in particular, what the international community is in the end prepared to do.
We are well aware that the problem will not be solved by the Congolese army and police.
They are not, at this present time, in a position to do so and it would be better to give the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) another mandate: it needs more resources in terms of ability to act on the ground.
As you are also aware, its present mandate does not allow it to disarm people by force, for example, but only to collect weapons from those who are willing to hand them over.
There is therefore a principle of voluntarism involved and I shall be trying to convince the people with whom I have talks.
First of all, I am going to try and persuade the Rwandans and the Congolese to keep calm and not to act in haste and risk reopening a conflict when the transition process is in full swing.
I am therefore first going to try to convince them of the necessity of preserving the transition process.
Then I shall be doing my utmost to persuade the international community, which is represented in the country by bodies like the United Nations, of the need to take the necessary decisions to settle this matter once and for all, because, as you so rightly said, the rule of law is no longer truly a reality in that part of the world.
Having said that, the proof that I am in total agreement with you is that I am leaving to tour the area again tomorrow, and to take stock of the situation on the ground.
There is the question of elections in Congo, of the timetable for those elections, and the legislation that still has to be passed by the parliament for those elections to be held.
You are aware, since I have already said so publicly, that I believe the election timetable should be left unchanged so as to keep up the pressure on the authorities.
I am also going to argue in Kigali that there should be no incursions of Kigali troops into foreign territory.
As you see, I am therefore planning to make another complete review of the situation.
Unfortunately, Mr Staes, it is beyond my power to resolve the problem myself, and I can only hope that my powers of persuasion will have an effect this time.
At any rate, believe me, I shall be voicing your concerns because they are my own.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few decades, humanitarian aid workers have operated in insecure and unpredictable conditions.
I am sure we are all aware that the risks they run in order to provide aid in unstable situations have increased considerably.
Take the examples of Iraq, CÃŽte d'Ivoire and Darfur in particular.
Relief workers have very often, too often in fact, come under attack from the armed forces and militias.
Given the difficult conditions in which the Commission, through ECHO, the Humanitarian Aid Office, and its partners, is working, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get material aid and assistance to those who are suffering.
It also has to be said that the growing involvement in humanitarian activities of players who are not strictly humanitarian, such as the military, has sometimes resulted in roles becoming confused, with the consequent risks for the safety of relief workers.
In order to preserve the existence of a humanitarian space and, consequently, to ensure that aid and equipment reaches the victims, the Commissionâs decisions are based on humanitarian values and principles and on a desire to provide quality assistance through its partnership with humanitarian organisations.
In accordance with the Councilâs rules on humanitarian aid, the Commissionâs decisions are therefore dictated solely by basic humanitarian needs and principles, namely neutrality, impartiality and independence.
Observance of these principles should help to protect relief workers and give them access to victims in cases of conflict.
In order to maintain the distinction between the roles of the military and of relief workers, the Commission supports the key role of civilian organisations when implementing humanitarian measures in situations where military capacity and resources are used.
To do so, it maintains that such recourse must comply with the guidelines for the use of army and civil defence resources in complex emergency humanitarian aid operations conducted by the United Nations.
ECHO is not an operational organisation.
Its task is to finance the coordinated provision of humanitarian aid through partner organisations, for example international NGOs, other international organisations or the United Nations.
The quality and effectiveness of ECHOâs aid depend very much on its partnersâ professional abilities.
All organisations signing the partnership agreement by virtue of which they work with ECHO therefore commit themselves to upholding the fundamental humanitarian values and principles I have just mentioned.
The basic objective of humanitarian aid is neither to prevent nor to resolve conflicts, but to alleviate the human suffering they cause.
In consultation with other sponsors and partners, ECHO is actively looking for ways of tackling the growing problems of access to victims and the safety of relief workers, with the aim of improving the situation in that regard.
Governments, armed forces and non-state players need to be made more aware of their obligations under international humanitarian law.
That law states that the parties to a conflict must facilitate the passage of aid convoys and the provision of neutral assistance to civilians affected by a conflict.
To give a real-life example of this principle, when I went to Sudan, to Darfur to be more precise, I reminded the government authorities and the rebels that it was absolutely essential that they allow international humanitarian organisations free access to the victims and the people in need of help.
That is a fundamental principle and, in quoting that example, I am also stressing the importance of the political dialogue between the Commission and those countriesâ authorities.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to thank Commissioner Louis Michel for being so very analytical on this entire, highly important issue, especially when, very recently in the Ivory Coast, there have also been forces belonging to a country of the European Union.
However, my question is a supplementary question: has your Commission thought of cutting humanitarian aid when it is not clear or certain that it will be used by those in need and there is a possibility of its ending up in the hands of the rebels?
I raise this in the light of the civil wars which go on for years and make it impossible to get this financial and material aid to civilians, especially medical and pharmaceutical aid for young children and the elderly.
Â Â  . If it is absolutely certain that the aid will not get through, it goes without saying that we ask for it to be cut off.
Having said that, I admit that it is extremely difficult because we need real-time information.
We generally get that information from the operators on the ground, either NGOs or international organisations, etc. That all happens in extremely tricky and extremely sensitive circumstances.
We therefore have to carry out a proper analysis before cutting off humanitarian aid or stopping sending or trying to send it.
You mention CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
We also have to avoid throwing the population into disarray and total destitution if humanitarian aid is cut off.
Obviously, each case is assessed individually on the basis of information from our own delegations.
I have to say that the high level of decentralisation we have today helps a lot.
Information reaches us more reliably and more quickly, and on the basis of that information we can either continue our work, negotiate to try and get the aid where it is needed, or quite simply break it off.
But I could not give my backing to any action that did not take all these things into account.
I nevertheless repeat that all this is extremely difficult, extremely delicate and extremely fragile and, we therefore have to look at each case individually every time.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in all fields of activity the Commission is constantly stepping up protection for the European Unionâs financial interests, especially the prevention of fraud.
Development aid is no exception, and it should be noted that the Court of Auditors has given a positive statement of assurance concerning the management of the European Development Fund for 2003.
As the Court of Auditors and OLAF have confirmed, the risks relate not to the regularity of the transactions managed by the delegationâs services but very often to the transactions managed by the implementing agencies, be they local associations in the developing countries, non-governmental organisations or project management structures.
That is why, in 2003, the Commission adopted a much more rigorous approach involving procedural simplification and external audit, so that such transactions can be monitored better.
So far as the part played by national interests in development aid is concerned, tendering procedures are the best guarantee of transparency and competition, and therefore also of reasonable prices.
Moreover, the European Unionâs development policy is defined by the Council and Commission joint declaration of November 2000 and by partnership agreements with different regions and countries, such as the Cotonou Agreement, and, finally, by international commitments like the Millennium Declaration or the Monterrey Consensus, for example.
That is the framework for the European Unionâs development policy, and there is no question of any Member Stateâs specific national interests.
On the contrary, that is the comparative advantage of a development policy conducted by the Community: it represents European values, principles and objectives, it is perceived by our partners to be neutral with respect to national policies and it is based on a genuine concept of partnership with those countries which is genuinely implemented.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to have practical proposals for measures.
Recently, OLAF revealed that economic aid for Lesotho did not get through and that the resources were thus not used for the purpose intended.
I want to hear more practical proposals from the Commissioner.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, forgive me, but it seems to me that the mechanisms being used at the moment are sufficient.
The proof is that you refer to a case that was in fact brought to our notice by our delegation.
I think, therefore, that all the necessary procedures were set in motion immediately; complaints were lodged, etc. The whole mechanism responded as it should.
Of course, everything possible should be done to prevent fraud.
But everything must also be done to prevent our entire system grinding to a halt in the process.
I think the controls we have today are adequate and the financial rules are sufficiently precise and restrictive.
I do not question them.
Obviously we are in favour, I am in favour, of zero tolerance, but, if you will forgive me, there is, on the other hand, no such thing as zero risk.
Neither can we keep on increasing the number of controls, evaluations and audits over and over again, only to find in the end that no more projects are being implemented.
Both humanitarian and development emergencies arise.
You ask me for concrete measures, but you know what measures are deployed and, on the basis of the information I have, I am not in favour of creating additional measures.
The OLAF mechanism is completely independent and works well.
Our delegations on the ground send back extremely important information, and even if we only have mere rumours, a rapid alert mechanism is put in place immediately.
I think it would be difficult to do more.
What we could still do, if you want a concrete measure, would be to keep our delegations well informed and to train them well, so that they are able to respond very quickly, be on constant alert and make the most of any information they may receive.
There you are; I am of course willing to discuss the matter and to revise my opinion, but I think there are already enough controls, especially so far as my portfolio is concerned.
All these controls, evaluations, audits and obstacle courses seem to me to be amply sufficient and I am therefore rather reluctant to invent anything else.
Â Â  .
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in political terms the year 2003 in Mauritania was marked by two major events. The first was an attempted on 8 and 9Â June, and the second was the presidential election of 7Â November, which saw the re-election of the incumbent President Maaouya Ould SidâAhmed Taya, who has been in power since 1984.
This latest presidential election was preceded and followed by arrests, most probably somewhat arbitrary, of leading political figures.
Given the restrictions on the exercise of civil liberties in the context of the war on terrorism, and the measures taken in the aftermath of the attempted , 2003 may be regarded as a year of regression on the democracy front.
The deterioration does not seem to have gathered pace in 2004.
Nevertheless, Mauritania remains a country where dialogue is possible among the various components of the power structure, even if that dialogue is invariably fraught with tension.
The Commission is aware of the fragility of this situation.
This is why, in the ninth European Development Fund, an amount of EURÂ ten million, or in other words 10% of the total appropriation, was allocated to the tasks of strengthening capacities and establishing the rule of law.
The Commission considers it essential, of course, to remain vigilant.
It seems to me, however, that the setback in the democratisation process does not yet warrant a vigorous initiative to secure a negotiated solution to the Mauritanian crisis.
Let me add that the Mauritanian Government was informed that its allocation under the ninth EDF was to be reduced by EURÂ ten million, chiefly to take account of inadequate sectoral performance in those very areas of strengthening capacities and establishing the rule of law, as identified in 2004âs mid-term review.
Although the reduction in funding has more to do with absorption capacity than with the political situation, it should signal to the Mauritanian authorities how imperative it is to bolster the rule of law.
In any case, the European Union is conducting an intensified political dialogue with the Mauritanian authorities, and is keeping a very close eye on developments.
Moreover, I shall be making personal contact with the Presidentâs office and with a number of our connections in Mauritania to discuss the situation.
The primary purpose of this dialogue is to promote good political and economic governance.
To this end, it seeks to support the pursuit of the democratisation process that began with the elections in 2001 by highlighting the need to respect the rule of law and its instruments.
To sum up my reply to your question, I do not think there are sufficient grounds for embarking in the immediate future on a vigorous initiative designed to secure a negotiated solution to the crisis in Mauritania.
This does not appear to be justified at the present time.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply, which shows that you recognise how the situation deteriorated in 2003 and acknowledge that Mauritania has indeed been in crisis.
It is true that few people know much about Mauritania.
Indeed, it is virtually a forgotten country.
We are not too sure whether it will be part of the Cotonou Agreements with the ACP countries, or whether it will enter into the Euro-Mediterranean framework.
Ultimately, now that the European Union is one of Mauritaniaâs main donors, we should like to know whether the country will depend on ACP funding or on the new delegation that has been created.
On the same subject, may I ask you to provide for closer monitoring.
In fact, in the light of current events, and if we focus only on what has been allocated to Mauritania in the fisheries sector, we must conclude that proper monitoring and control are desirable and that we ought to be able to ensure that this control is exercised.
Â Â  . I naturally share your concern.
The problem that existed in 2003 has certainly not become any more acute in 2004.
I can only promise to ensure that the political dialogue with the authorities will be quickly relaunched, and that it will focus on the concerns which you have clearly expressed and which I share.
In the coming weeks, at the beginning of the new year, I shall establish more regular contact with the authorities â whom I know well, incidentally.
Indeed, in my previous life as a Foreign Minister, I visited Mauritania and was struck by the fact that, although the majority of its population are Muslims, Mauritania is one of the only Muslim countries that maintains relations with Israel and therefore tries to be even-handed.
I admired Mauritania for that, because the ability of a Muslim country to adopt an even-handed approach to a conflict such as that in the Middle East seemed to me to indicate intelligence and a desire to avoid exposing the countryâs political life to fundamentalism or excesses of any kind.
For this reason, I do not think I shall have any difficulty in relaunching this political dialogue.
You can certainly count on me to relaunch it at the start of the new year.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Questions 48 to 87 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  The debate will now resume, with a continuation of the discussion on the preparation of the next Financial Perspective.
MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda has the floor for two minutes.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs GrybauskaitÄ, a seven-year period is a long time in the world in which we live.
Since the last Financial Perspectives, the EU has undertaken the biggest enlargement in its history and has become even more integrated with the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice and the signing of the Constitutional Treaty.
In the last seven years, the world has become more globalised and societies have become more complex and diversified.
Attitudes, customs, behaviour and even values have changed.
The Financial Perspectives must therefore be adaptable to the current political context and to the new realities of the world in which we live.
With the decision on the Financial Perspectives, we have a unique opportunity to show that we have a more ambitious vision for Europe, a winning vision, which I think is shared by the Commission.
We must therefore prevent, at all costs, any lowering of the objectives of the Financial Perspectives or any simple act of budgetary consolidation, which some people would appear to want.
In this context, I should like to ask Mrs GrybauskaitÄ kindly to comment on the three essential prerequisites on which, to my mind, the Financial Perspectives ought to be based.
The first of these is credibility.
The political priorities of stepping up the competitiveness of both the economy and European cohesion must go hand in hand.
Secondly, there must be a clear break from previous practices, by which I mean we need to set about reforming the EUâs own resources.
Thirdly, imaginative solutions must be created, such as ensuring that funds earmarked in the EUâs budgets also act as a tool for mobilising other financial sector resources, be they from the public or private sector.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the new financial framework will be the first following EU enlargement.
It must be possible for it to be adopted by everyone, both new and old Member States.
This also applies to states that are quite well off.
In northern Europe, onerous special conditions apply that have not disappeared.
It cannot be fair to allow permanently disadvantaged areas, for example those with cold climates and long distances, to pay, as it were, for the fact that, statistically, they appear to be rich.
There is also an expectation that certain projects not directly linked to the EU budget are to be turned into a reality.
In the Baltic region, for example, there is universal support for improving water quality in the Baltic.
This means, among other things, that it needs to be possible for all waste water, including that from Saint Petersburg, to be cleaned.
The research priorities must support development of whole regions that have lived apart for historical reasons, such as the Baltic region and Central Europe.
Finally, I would state that there are high expectations of greater clarity in the EUâs foreign policy.
We face challenges in Ukraine, Caucasus, Belarus and perhaps also Russia.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to return to this afternoonâs debate.
It is a great pity that the Council is not present now to listen to our debate on the problems we face with the Financial Perspective, for, speaking as a regional politician â and as one who works in this Houseâs Committee on Regional Development â it is clear to me that we need the security to plan ahead.
That means that we need agreement, and need it very soon, as 2005 is the final deadline if the planning stage is not to prove insufficient for the local authorities.
What that also means is that the loss is borne by the local stakeholders who want to get involved in planning, because the planning rules will be implemented at this level far too late.
I also endorse what the Commissioner said about it making sense, in this first year with ten new Member States, to extend the period to seven years, in order to have a long planning stage where the Structural Funds are concerned.
That makes sense in practical terms.
I also want to stress that the Structural Funds must not be turned into a piggy bank, for cohesion is at the heart of the European Union.
In the country I know best, this throws up contradictions when politicians appeal to the masses with speeches about the 1% issue, only then to go to Brussels and ask for money to sort out the structural problems in their region.
We want a truly European policy, and that is not it!
Â Â  Mr President, on the future of European Parliament funding and financing, I accept that it is very important that the Commission and the Council of Ministers, and indeed Parliament, try after the first seven years to think about rationalising during the five years of Parliament's term.
We have the advantage of a fixed term, we ought to use that for future financial perspective periods.
I very much agreed this afternoon with Mr van den Berg when he said that we must do something in the nation-states to tighten up on accountability. That leads me on to our philosophy in the British Conservative group, which is that we should try to do what we can in Europe and do it effectively and efficiently.
If that means doing less, then let us do it better.
Too often we try to increase the powers in Europe and increase our coverage of all sorts of items.
That does not just cost money, it leads to further dilution of concentration, of accountability, and that is extremely important.
The other point I wish to raise is about own resources.
We need to consider the method of own resources.
We have a perfectly acceptable method that works quite well and we should not make fundamental changes to it.
I would not ever like to see the imposition of a European Union tax, which has been thought about for the period from 2013 onwards.
That would be a retrograde step.
We need to have a Council of Ministers that is all-powerful in my book, even speaking as an MEP.
Basically it pays the bills, and that is fine by me, provided we can control what we are doing and provide proper accountability in future.
Â Â  Mr President, this question of the European Unionâs financial framework is crucial.
It is crucial because the European Union must rise to formidable challenges: bringing the enlargement process to a successful conclusion, achieving the aim of cohesion, the symbol of our policy of solidarity, without forgetting the less favoured regions of the old Union of 15, meeting commitments under the common agricultural policy and NaturaÂ 2000 and, above all, achieving the Lisbon objectives in the realms of competitiveness, research, employment, training, environmental policy and public health while giving due consideration to the ageing of our population.
This last point has not been addressed this afternoon, even though an ageing population clearly has economic and social implications for our future.
Faced by these challenges and by the explosive growth in Chinese competition, how does the Commission intend to position itself?
At a time when the Commission and the Council are preparing to open the gates of Europe once again, can we continue to operate with a budget that has not developed since the 1990s, even though the European Union has subsequently taken on many new Member States and been accorded wider powers under a series of new treaties?
Mrs GrybauskaitÄ, we are not reassured.
Questions need to be asked about the Commissionâs desire to make tangible proposals.
Arm yourself with the support of Parliament and do what you can to influence the one-per-centers, to bring home to them, as MrÂ Barroso said, that more Europe cannot be achieved without more money.
Even allowing for the agreement on the CAP, we already know that it will be impossible to fund the Unionâs regional policy between now and 2013 if we adhere to the one-per-cent ceiling.
Europe is on the move; it has been enlarged, it is ambitious, but are you sure, Mrs GrybauskaitÄ, that you have the means to fulfil its ambition?
What we are asking you to do is tell us what resources are needed to finance our objectives.
And you know that they will have to be increased.
Be prepared, Commissioner, to defend the key positions vigorously.
You must be aware that this would be a bad time to disappoint not only Parliament, but all the people of Europe too.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start what I have to say by pleading for greater seriousness and a more objective approach.
In our debate this morning on the 2005 Budget, a very large number of speakers appealed to the Council to take the Budget more seriously.
If, though, we aim to achieve an agreement with the Council at a time when we are already talking in terms of a motion on Budget shortfall, then the figures we have agreed are not credible, and many already suspect that we may well not be able to manage on them.
Reading the media over the past few days on the subject of the Financial Perspective, I begin to fear the same thing.
I also fear a similar lack of seriousness when it comes to the debate on Turkey and other current issues, and I ask you, Commissioner, not to be a spectator, but to be more politically pro-active.
The Budget and the Financial Perspective are work programmes in the form of figures, and today we have started to discuss the policy programme for the next five years.
What we demand is greater competitiveness; Lisbon and Barcelona are the top priorities and must be implemented just as much as an enhanced role in the world for young people, the fight against terrorism, enlargement through the addition of Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania, a new neighbourhood policy and improved information and communications policies.
What I would like you to tell us is whether all the things we have been debating today with regard to additional responsibilities and measures are actually contained in the old Commissionâs proposal, or whether the new Commission has to put its stamp upon it and demand political projects?
Up to now, it has only been whispered behind the scenes that there are constant discussions about the upper limit.
Let us put a stop to playing games with numbers and talk about what we have to do and how much it will cost, and then we will be able to talk about own resources and the allocation of tasks and about who has to do what.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to make three comments on the issue which we are debating.
First, I welcome the fact that nearly all the honourable Members who have spoken considered that the European Union budget should be commensurate with the ambitions tabled from time to time by both the Commission and Parliament, because it is a fact that policy without money is not possible.
What I find particularly negative is the fact that the size of the budget is being discussed and there are tendencies to make cutbacks at a time when, even if the Commission proposal were accepted, this would be the equivalent of the European Union's spending a total of 2.5% of all annual public expenditure in Europe, because that is what we are talking about at a time when we have ambitions, as I said, for important and serious things.
Secondly, I should like a clarification on the part of the Commissioner as to what is going to happen in connection with the future of the Structural Funds if no decision is taken by the end of this year, because there is a multiannual aspect to Structural Fund policies, there is the problem of creating what may be a legal lacuna, which will prevent the programmes from starting on 1 January 2007.
How could this be addressed, Commissioner?
The third issue on which I wish to comment concerns the cost of enlargement, given that enlargement comes at a price which we have to pay, because it is a major historic choice of the European Union; on the other hand, however, this price needs to be distributed fairly.
I know that, from a technical point of view, this issue does not come under the issue we are discussing now, but it is tangential to the general issue and I should like the Commissioner to tell me if the Commission has at its disposal studies which show how the cost of enlargement will ultimately be distributed.
I refer to the question of own resources, Commissioner, but I think that these issues are directly connected.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, work on the new Financial Perspective is being undertaken in very difficult circumstances, and has therefore given rise to much controversy.
Not all the issues under consideration are being discussed.
This may have been the case in the past, but it has come as a surprise to some of the new entrants to the Union.
The first point I would like to make is that the proposal to limit the budget to 1% is not inspired by the wish to economise, nor does it stem from a desire to rationalise expenditure.
It is the consequence of the plan to change the allocation of financial resources and the view that the latter can be utilised more effectively in national policies.
What we are therefore witnessing is a reduction of the scope of Community policies.
This does not come as a surprise to advocates of a coordinating Union, but it is cause for alarm amongst advocates of a strong Union.
Restricting income and expenditure impacts directly on all countries, because it requires changes to the structure of financing cohesion policy and restricting its scope.
Naturally, the weakest countries are the most affected, when they ought to be the main beneficiaries of this policy.
My second point is that cohesion policy is being reinterpreted before our very eyes.
This policy is becoming increasingly detached from its base, namely the principle of sharing the problems of under-development in the spirit of solidarity, and responding jointly also to the pronounced inequalities which are the inevitable consequence of economic integration.
It is therefore essential to support the efforts made in the Council of the European Union by those governments radically opposed to amendment of the relevant provisions and deletion of the principle of supporting the less-developed countries.
An example from the sporting world comes to mind.
Ladies and gentlemen, imagine a situation in which a number of players are recruited to join a football team.
They are eager to play, prepared to undergo a demanding training period, and full of fighting spirit and the desire to win.
Now imagine that when they make it onto the football pitch they are informed that the rules have changed and that they will be required to play rugby instead.
I am sure you will understand that in such a case the players would be unpleasantly surprised and taken aback.
It is to be hoped that the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole will act consistently to ensure that the rules remain unchanged.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is in my capacity as a representative of the largest new Member State, Poland, that I take the floor in todayâs Question Time to the Commission on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.
I am emphasising this as most of the honourable Members who have taken the floor in this debate hail from the old Fifteen, and their views on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 are very much at variance with those held by the new Member States.
The first problem I would like to highlight is the size of the budget for the period in question.
The six so-called net contributors argue for 1% of GDP, whereas the Prodi Commission proposed 1.14% of GDP.
According to estimates, in absolute terms this amounts to a difference of about EURÂ 180Â billion, which means around EURÂ 25Â billion less for each year of this Financial Perspective.
This is an enormous sum from the point of view of the new Member States. It is a sum that is absolutely essential to reduce the differences in development between old and new Member States, and to ensure that the division into a first and second class Europe does not become permanently entrenched.
The second problem I should like to refer to concerns the resources for Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.
I refer in particular to their allocation to regions in the old Union affected by the âstatistical effectâ.
The Commission is showing remarkable generosity towards these regions.
There are plans to allocate no less than EURÂ 194Â billion to them over these next seven years, but only EURÂ 181Â billion to regions in the new Union.
It should be borne in mind that this period will see the accession of at least two new Member States, and that the whole of the territory of the 12 new countries is eligible for support.
The third problem I wish to mention concerns limiting resources from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to 4% of the GDP of the Member State in question.
For the ten new Member States this means an annual total of less than EURÂ 20Â billion.
I believe it would be appropriate to raise the threshold to at least 5% of the GDP of the Member State.
I very much hope the Commissioner will take the three concerns I mentioned into account.
Â Â  Mr President, let me raise a few issues from the perspective of a new Member State.
First, the new financial framework should be driven by the political priorities of the enlarged Union and the principle of solidarity among the Member States.
Second, the own-resources ceiling should be established at a level that would assure the successful integration of the new Member States in the Union and take account of commitments entered into during the accession negotiations.
Third, it is my firm belief that we, the European Parliament, have to support high allocations for the Lisbon strategy measures from the Commission's budget.
A clear mechanism securing a certain share of funds for each Member State should be designed for funding this priority.
I should also like to point out that the funding of the implementation of the Lisbon strategy objectives should not be at the expense of EU cohesion policy.
The assistance planned for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy objectives should add to, rather than replace, the assistance under the cohesion policy, as competitiveness and cohesion are mutually reinforcing.
Fourth, from the point of view of less-developed economies in the EU, the level of financial assistance should be proportional to countries' current economic level of development.
In any case the assistance rate per capita should not be higher in the more prosperous Member States than in the less-developed ones.
Fifth, we should also consider that the limitation of structural assistance through the capping rule, if it is applied in the next programming period, could, in some cases, slow down the social and economic convergence of the least-developed Member States, by directing cohesion policy resources to more developed Member States and regions.
Last but not least, the Commission rightly pointed out that an enlarged EU requires more money.
It is impossible to overcome the challenges of an enlarged and ever-enlarging Europe with less money.
Â Â  Mr President, it is important that we be given the opportunity of discussing the financial framework in good time and of voting on it in the parliamentary committees at regular intervals.
That is particularly true in the case of cohesion policy and regional policy.
In the past, in fact, regional policy has been extremely effective.
The disparities in Europe have levelled out to a large extent, and, in the light of new key initiatives, especially the Lisbon agenda, this policy should certainly be continued.
This can only be done, however, if this Parliament, in consultation with the Commission and the Council, lays down the new regulations in good time.
In concrete terms, this means that by the middle of next year, mid-2005, we should be able to take a decision on this, failing which we will have a repeat of what happened in 1999 when the debates were too lengthy and implementation had to be cut short.
The Lisbon agenda requires perseverance on the part of the national governments and of those involved in the regions.
This means that we must be ready in time, and, from that point of view, carrying the whole thing over to the second half of 2006, under the British Presidency, would be detrimental to the policy.
In short, I should like to emphasise the importance of regional policy in the context of the Lisbon objectives, innovation, promotion of competition and the new second budget objective, partly because this can promote cooperation in regions and cooperation between partners.
Let me say, turning to the financial perspectives, that the 1% does, of course, make them impossible.
Another factor that plays a role in this is that we have learned that implementation was closer to the people in a decentralised setting in conjunction with provinces, regions, cities, social partners in the regions inÂ Europe, and greater involvement was the result.
If 1% were to culminate in a renationalisation of policy, we would miss the European added value, and I would find that very regrettable.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
That brings us to the end of the list of speakers.
I understand the Commissioner does not intend to take the floor.
The debate is therefore closed.
Â Â  We feel that the Commissionâs proposal for the next Financial Perspectives is clearly not sufficient to address the current social, economic and environmental challenges, the need for economic and social cohesion â which has increased with enlargement â and the high levels of unemployment and poverty in the EU.
Quantitatively, what is being proposed is actually an average of 1.09% of Community GNI, which is less than Agenda 2000 (1.10%) and previous benchmarks; qualitatively, the priorities are âcompetitivenessâ, âentrepreneurial spiritâ and âsecurity and defenceâ at the expense of development, cooperation and cohesion.
One might ask in this debate whether Barroso reinforces and exacerbates Prodi, given that statements from Commissioners pave the way towards negotiating, or renegotiating, below the already inadequate package, in line with the signatories of the âLetter of the sixâ, who intend to impose a ceiling of 1% of Community GNI on the budget, something to which we have always been opposed.
We therefore wish to make it clear that we reject the Financial Perspectives, of which the average annual spending falls between the Commissionâs proposal and the ceiling of the âLetter of the sixâ, which I mentioned earlier, and is moving ever closer to that ceiling.
Lastly, we support the idea of retaining the seven-year financial framework, given that, even in this area, the tendency is to ânegotiateâ downwards.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0051/2004) by MrsÂ Lambert on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin [2004/2121(INI)].
The debate is open.
MrsÂ Lambert has the floor.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their interest and their commitment with regard to this report.
I am sure that we would all have liked more committee time, not least to have debated the amendments presented in committee and the overall content more thoroughly, as I am aware that certain difficulties still remain.
But there is a great deal on which the majority of us from the committee agree and I trust the Council and the Commission will remember that.
We welcome the Commission's two communications as an important step in the development of a common asylum policy.
We support the stress on measures such as the resettlement programmes, protected entry procedures and support in the region as being additional and complementary to the existing rights to seek asylum within the European Union, and agree that those internal asylum systems should be of high quality.
We agree that we do not view the outsourcing of internal EU responsibilities to camps in countries such as Libya as offering any sustainable solution, or even a short-term solution, to those seeking asylum.
As regards the single procedure, we recognise that it is better both for the asylum applicant and the authorities if all relevant information is examined at one time, and we welcome the fact that the Commission has laid out a common order of decision-making.
However, we also recognise the possible protection gap in those Member States that only employ full refugee status and have no practice of subsidiary protection, compared with Member States using both categories.
I recognise that this is a difficult issue for some Members and that paragraphs 37 and 38 of the report may seem to pre-empt the reconsultation process on the procedures directive in which we hope Parliament will be involved very shortly.
I would welcome the views of Members on the possible loss of those paragraphs.
Parliament, however, fully agrees with the need to frontload the decision-making process.
We support the need for the better use of in-country information by better-trained staff.
It is appalling that someone's life should depend on an opinion that was never tested for its veracity.
This is the situation facing Ramzi Isalam, a homosexual Algerian man who may be deported from the UK to Algeria as he is deemed not to be in need of subsidiary protection.
This is due to a line in a Canadian diplomat's report some years ago, which is still included in the country information the UK uses.
All the other opinions of that diplomat have been deleted over time.
The EU has to do better than that in terms of the quality of the information we use to decide on people's lives.
More controversially, the majority view in committee was that we need to have in place some form of monitoring or report-back system on what happens to those who are returned having made unsuccessful claims for protection.
Then we might know if it is really safe to return others.
The committee fully supports the need for a better coordinated approach to support in the region for the vast majority of the world's refugees who never even try to come to the European Union, contrary to many newspaper reports and some politicians' views.
We recognise that such coordination is a challenge, but a piecemeal approach creates confusion.
We want to know how the Commission proposes to improve such coordination in future.
We also agree that we need new money, not a reallocation of existing aid budgets, to offer any long-term support to help improve capacity and the quality of response in the regions of origin in full cooperation with the countries concerned.
What else do we agree on?
We agree that resettlement programmes can be of great value, especially when they cater for those most at risk in an already precarious situation; that these programmes can be used within the European Union to help develop a public understanding as to why refugees seek protection; and that this understanding can help to combat all forms of discrimination, not least racism and xenophobia.
We also agree that we need a common foreign and security policy that commits the EU as a matter of priority to conflict prevention and the resolution of long-term conflicts.
In that context we welcome the proposed EU regional protection programmes and wish to be involved in their development and assessment.
As you can see, there is much that we agree on and that is not in dispute in this debate.
Whatever the final vote tomorrow, that is the message I would wish us to convey to both the Council and the Commission.
We agree that the Commission's dual approach â to aim for a universally high standard of application of the current directives within the EU and to improve the conditions for the vast majority of refugees within the region they are fleeing â is a reasonable and indeed ambitious programme.
Parliament will wish to be fully involved in the development of such initiatives.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mrs Lambert's report sets the two communications in the framework of achieving a common European asylum system.
In the asylum chapter of the Hague Programme the objective of a common European asylum system is fully confirmed and an ambitious deadline of 2010 is set for the realisation of that goal.
The Commission will ensure that the deadline is met and that the European Parliament will play a key role in that task.
As of spring 2005 the European Parliament will be a co-legislator in the process necessary to bring this about.
The Hague Programme also reflects the fact that the external dimension of asylum is being recognised as increasingly important in the EU.
The improvement of the global protection system is something that can benefit refugees the world over and can help to better share out the responsibilities for refugees with those countries that accommodate the greater part of the refugee population.
That is also in the EU's interest.
I am grateful to the rapporteur for recognising the importance of this work and the financial implications involved.
The full support of the European Parliament is required.
The durable solutions communication explores how the EU can enhance protection capacities in regions of origin and also help ensure more orderly and managed entry into the EU of persons in need of international protection through the setting-up of an EU-wide resettlement scheme.
Refugees should be able to access protection as quickly as possible and as closely as possible to their needs.
The emphasis here is on burden sharing rather than burden shifting, on exploring with third countries how we can work together to address a common challenge.
These plans must be entirely complementary to, and not a substitute for, Member States' obligations under international human rights law, and in particular the 1951 Refugee Convention and the right to asylum in the European Union.
The Hague Programme is clear that the implementation of the second phase of the common European asylum system must be based on a robust evaluation of the impact of the measures taken in Member States.
Our communication indicates a methodology for taking that evaluation forward and for how practical cooperation should be developed.
That collaborative and consensus-driven methodology can also be applied to other areas under the asylum and migration .
For the longer term we should encourage and promote further cooperation among Member States in this field.
That is what the Commission intends to do.
Â Â  . Mr President, the key to this integrated and comprehensive approach to asylum and migration is the cooperation of third countries, which will be invited to work in partnership and share responsibility with us to ensure that this well thought-out policy succeeds.
This cooperation should be sought through existing instruments, including, in particular, the European Neighbourhood Policy.
The EU must not be seen by third countries as â and here you were right, Commissioner â trying to shift its own responsibilities from our shoulders to theirs.
To this end we must demonstrate, in a visible manner, our readiness to assist these countries in enhancing their protection capacity, to be better prepared to provide urgent assistance to countries in crisis, and to ensure the necessary budgetary means other than those already envisaged as development aid.
Parallel to third countries, we must be seen to be ready to assume our own responsibilities: the creation of a common European asylum system as called for at Tampere, a fully-fledged regional protection programme by December 2005, and a resettlement scheme based on the absorption capacity of individual Member States.
Finally, enhancing protection capacity in creating protected entry procedures does not mean abandoning the existing right of application for asylum on spontaneous arrival in an EU Member State.
I am firmly of the belief that the more the EU succeeds in enhancing protection capacity in the regions of origin and the more it assists third countries in bringing protection capacity up to standard, the more the protected entry procedures from outside the EU will be enhanced; the fewer spontaneous asylum claims will be presented directly to Member States; and the less lucrative the trade of trafficking in human beings will become.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the Tampere European Council included amongst its objectives the creation of a common asylum system, Parliament â including the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â has been fully committed to that objective and to the European Unionâs intention to respond to those people who come to our countries legitimately in search of better lives and a better future.
Today, and with our sights set on 2010, the date established in the Hague programme for completing the second phase of the common asylum system, we are faced with the fortunate fact that the European Union has already adopted important rules, but there is still a long way to go and we are committed to doing so.
Our actions should be characterised by responsibility and rigour.
When we are talking about human beings who need our help we cannot act in any other way.
We are dealing with an important report which I believe has the fundamental merit of offering a clear and decisive view of certain issues: firstly, Parliament is saying a firm ânoâ to the proposal to create reception camps in countries outside the Union.
The responsibility I spoke about a moment ago cannot be evaded; we cannot deal with those people looking to us to respond to their despair by looking the other way.
Keeping asylum seekers outside of our borders is not the best way to demonstrate the validity of the values on which the European Union is based.
Secondly, we ask that assistance for refugees be based on the principle of solidarity and a fair distribution of responsibility.
Once again, we can see that only solidarity and joint action by the Union can provide viable and lasting solutions.
Once again, the Union has the opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to a genuinely common asylum system.
Finally, we express our support for a system of resettlement at Community level, but one which always reconciles the will of the State and that of the individual in question.
For all of these reasons â although right now we have just one difficulty with the rapporteur â whose ability to reconcile positions we very much appreciate and who we thank â only if the problem separating us, with regard to so-called safe third countries, is resolved, will we be able to vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  Mr President, my Group supports this report wholeheartedly because we believe that a common asylum procedure is something that many across this House talk about, but the reality of actually making it happen requires support of the Lambert report.
It is difficult to go from the position of saying that we want burden sharing, a common asylum policy and to support the Tampere agenda, to the practical application of that in a report which moves forward some of the things that we want to see.
As someone who dealt with asylum cases for many years, I see the Lambert report as a progressive report, but one which can be supported across this House.
We talk about good asylum decisions.
It is a problem in every Member State that asylum decision-making is so poor that we are not served well in terms of allowing genuine asylum seekers to make a case and actually enter a country.
That is bad for all of us.
Poor asylum decision-making is addressed in this report.
We want to step up protection capacity in regions of origin and we are defining in this report the difference between transit camps and outsourcing our responsibilities to third countries, and regional protection.
I want to register our support for this report.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mrs Lambert for her report.
I agree with Mr Moraes.
My Group fully supports the report.
Most of what I would like to say has already been mentioned by Mrs Lambert in an excellent way.
However, I should like to point out that there are tensions between the two directives.
The Qualifications Directive sets standards for refugee status and subsidiary protection.
There is a need for the directive on minimum standards on procedures to be adopted to come into line with the other directive.
That is not the case at the moment.
Second, the issue of resettlement should be supported because it is aimed at the most vulnerable.
It is not another path of economic migration.
It gives hope.
At the moment only six Member States take advantage of the possibility to take refugees under resettlement schemes, but voluntary deals with the refugees will help both them and the UNHCR, which warmly supports resettlement.
Finally, we should be clear that resettlement and protected entry procedures are not an excuse for cutting back on the rights of asylum-seekers arriving spontaneously in the European Union Member States.
Â Â  . Mr President, over these past few years, thousands of people â men, women and children â have passed through my home town of Calais, or through the notorious Sangatte camp, having been persuaded that they will find their ElÂ Dorado in the United Kingdom: Kosovars, Afghans, Iraqis, Sudanese, Kurds â people in search of freedom and security, simple citizens of the world, driven by misery to take to the road, wishing only, like every one of us, for a bit of happiness.
Allow me to assure them of our solidarity.
While I endorse most of the content of the Lambert report, I am duty-bound to state to this House the objective fact that, while improving, simplifying and standardising application procedures for asylum seekers is a definite step forward, as long as we spare ourselves the trouble of conducting a real comprehensive debate on the type of immigration Europe needs and on the economic development policy it must pursue towards poor countries, we shall achieve nothing, and this forum of ours will be the scene of regular debates on the plight of these latter-day nomads.
Europeans must know that there is a better standard of living here than in Africa and, in particular, that it is possible for people to work here illegally if they are prepared to earn less and keep quiet.
In Europe, there are those who attract, exploit and get rich by engaging in this slave trade.
Yes, we need to restore the honour of Europe, which is all too often sullied, just as we must urge the Union to stop burying its head in the sand on the pretext that talking about immigration fuels nationalist sentiments.
Europe, however, must not be the sole focus of our attention in this respect.
The IMF, whose recommendations are often responsible for mass emigrations, the United Nations and the office of its High Commissioner for Refugees also have a part to play.
Yes, the European Union should have an asylum policy that accords with the principles of the European Human Rights Convention.
Yes, the European Union should examine the emigration issue in depth.
Yes, the European Union should remember that some of the children within its own territory are stricken by hunger too.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report expresses in apodictic terms a rejection in advance of any question of setting up the so-called reception centres in countries of final transit proposed by several parties.
It is said that setting up such centres would lead to difficulties in complying with international human rights obligations, but I do not know on what assumptions this statement is based.
I wonder whether the rapporteur has already ascertained that the leaders of such countries or the NGOs, including the European ones, operating in the countries of origin and transit of immigrants are not willing to cooperate.
I think that this preconception is based solely on ideological grounds, since reception centres could certainly play an important role in meeting both the need to carry out the necessary controls and that of humane treatment of migrants.
In fact, the refusal to create such centres leaves the situation unchanged, and hinders the welcome involvement of countries of transit in the management of the migration process.
The centre that was recently set up in Africa, thanks to important intervention by my country through the Tripoli agreements, has already managed to prevent, at least so far, the Mediterranean crossings by desperate people in the traffickersâ old tubs and the resulting tragic shipwrecks.
Its creation has thus made it possible to achieve a positive outcome in the fight against the despicable trafficking in human beings.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, asylum is not a technical issue.
It needs to be recognised for what it is, namely a political and social issue.
For the past few decades, the Member States of the European Union have given little thought to asylum policy, particularly regarding individuals from other continents.
The disastrous consequences of this approach are now evident.
Racist and political extremism has become rife, affecting both newcomers and local people.
In addition, this inappropriate asylum policy has weakened the confidence of many societies in European integration.
Rightly or wrongly, this integration is linked to an excessively liberal policy on asylum.
Clearly, such a state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue.
The right balance must be maintained between human rights, democracy and the safety of citizen.
I am pleased to note that in the second point of its resolution, the European Parliament emphasises the need for âmeasures to step up protection capacity in the regions of origin [of potential asylum seekers]â.
This is entirely appropriate.
In conclusion, MrÂ President, I should like to emphasise that the problem of asylum is bound to increase, given the relative wealth of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Members of the European Parliament we sit in this Chamber representing the citizens of the 25 nations that make up the European Union.
In the Union this Parliament is the only institution elected by universal suffrage.
In so far as we are the vehicles for direct consensus and have a mandate from the people, for certain issues we must succeed in casting off the political ideologies to which we subscribe.
Immigration ought to be one of these issues.
History teaches us that the greatest misfortune for human beings is to be uprooted from their place of origin, and that immigration arises for countless reasons, not all of them voluntary.
A developed social system â and the European Union is a collection of developed states â cannot rule out some aspects of this phenomenon and focus solely on the emotive part.
The Union must safeguard the fundamental principles on which its existence is based, but it must do so in a way that benefits everyone, both its own citizens and those of third countries.
It must do so through a common policy, with choices that are mutually agreed upon and maintained, and not by means of ineffective initiatives which isolate certain Member States.
If there must be a single immigration policy, then all its consequences must be accepted, above all at times like these when there are deep concerns regarding internal security.
Among other things, it is important not to rule out the organisation of an immigration information and preparation system in countries of origin and transit.
Such a system should be organised and mutually agreed on and, if added to economic aid and incentives in the areas of origin, could provide positive results for all.
This proposal does not take this approach to the issue, not even in practical terms, and that is why we cannot support it unless appropriate amendments are adopted.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I must begin by thanking our rapporteur, MrsÂ Lambert, for this excellent report, which has our support.
We have, in fact, reached a critical juncture in the formulation of a European asylum policy.
It is observable that the first phase of European harmonisation of national asylum policies has resulted in a levelling-down of standards.
In November of this year, the Council adopted a new set of priorities for a European asylum policy in the Hague Programme.
Among the provisions of this programme for the second phase of harmonisation is the development of a common asylum procedure, and our main message here is that Europe is a place of refuge and that we must preserve that humanitarian tradition.
In this context, the foremost aim of the report before us is to remind the Member States that the Geneva Convention and the role of the High Commissioner for Refugees must remain at the heart of our asylum policy.
In order to preserve Europeâs humanitarian tradition, we formally reaffirm our opposition to any moves to outsource the application process and to create transit camps beyond the frontiers of the European Union.
European asylum policy must be based on the principle of solidarity, of shared burdens and responsibilities, not only inside the European Union but also with non-EU countries.
A European asylum policy must also reinforce the fundamental rights of asylum seekers.
The primary aim of the single asylum procedure must be to guarantee a high level of protection for refugees.
It must also provide scope for improved decision-making.
The European Parliament, democratically elected and accountable to the peoples of Europe, must affirm the right of asylum seekers to a dignified reception.
We want more accessible, fairer and better organised asylum systems, and we must rectify the defects in the present systems.
We must protect refugees, and we must also work on our own populations, explaining to them the distress that drives people to seek refuge in Europe and, by this means, fostering a better understanding of the situation.
It is, of course, desirable that refugees return to their own countries.
To that end, it will be necessary to deal with the underlying causes of their plight.
In the meantime, however, it is our duty to focus on the local integration of refugees and on their accommodation in host countries while upgrading protection capabilities and developing a programme for the development and adoption of sustainable solutions.
Lastly, there seems to be a problem with the interpretation of Amendment NoÂ 1 in several languages.
Let me therefore make it clear that the word âbasedâ refers to the premature repatriation of refugees, not to the safeguards designed to strengthen the protection programmes.
I felt it was important to clarify that point.
Â Â  Mr President, I concur with the many warm words that have been spoken by a number of Members, and I too would ask for your support for this excellent report.
We are faced with a very harrowing problem for which a solution is required as a matter of urgency.
That solution should, however, be a real and permanent one rather than a makeshift attempt.
What is really required in the long term is, of course, legal immigration in the European Union; from that point of view, the Council has missed an opportunity by deliberately excluding legal immigration from qualified majority voting.
It would appear that the Member States find it easier to reach agreement on how to keep people outside of the EU than on how we can properly allow them in.
Over the past few weeks and months, the EU and Parliament have discussed European values and human rights at great length, particularly in the debate on the Commission, but also again today in connection with Turkey.
Our civilisationâs standards are measured against the manner in which we deal with our fellow human beings and translate our values into practice.
Asylum seekers are not criminals; they are fellow human beings and should, accordingly, be received under humane conditions.
They deserve our support, and I, therefore, endorse this report.
The world assesses the European Union's commitment to equality, justice and fair-play by the way it treats those fleeing war and persecution.
Mrs Lambert is to be strongly commended for her report and for the focus that it gives to the humanitarian and the civil rights issues which lie at the heart of the asylum debate.
I echo her call for the highest possible international standards and human rights to guide EU policy.
Her rejection of the so-called 'holding centres', even as a short-term solution to the issue of dealing with asylum applicants, is to be welcomed and strongly endorsed.
The emphasis in the report on speeding up asylum requests and ensuring efficiency and transparency in the decision-making process is also welcome.
Conflict, poverty and socio-political instability affect millions of people across the world.
We therefore need to shift the emphasis towards promoting conflict resolution and prevention under the auspices of the United Nations.
The long-term solution to issues of asylum is to reduce conflict and poverty globally.
The EU has a major role to play in this regard.
We must get the policy right.
We must demonstrate to the world that when it comes to human rights, justice and equality, the policy implementation of the EU is as good as its rhetoric.
I also strongly support the amendments.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I recognise myself in the Lambert report, because, if there is an enemy preventing Europe from growing, that enemy is fear.
One of the ways of combating it is certainly by knowing how to recognise those who deserve help among those who turn to us for assistance.
Not long ago, 75 Eritreans were arrested by the Libyan authorities; they had to undergo a long period of detention and were subjected to inhumane treatment.
They were then put on an aeroplane to be taken back to their country of origin.
Seized by despair, they hijacked the aeroplane and forced it to land in Sudan.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was able to interview 60 of the 75 Eritreans, since the others were in prison for the hijacking.
All those interviewed were entitled to asylum, but Libya does not have a law recognising such a right, is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention and does not guarantee respect of human rights in prison.
On the other hand, even countries such as mine â Italy â do not have a law on the right to asylum, and therefore reject migrants indiscriminately, without examining applications and without fair, just and individual assessments.
Even legal immigrants are humiliated and forced to wait for years for the rightful renewal of their residence permits.
It is clear that these persons are considered an enemy within, to be treated badly and thrown out.
Europe itself, though, should examine asylum applications, at the same time helping the Maghreb countries to progress along the path of respecting rights.
We should ensure that Europe, by using the highest criteria for assessing and protecting refugees, transforms these waves of people into legal immigrants, and this plan is both beneficial and possible.
For this reason it is necessary to set up a single European agency for refugees and European reception centres to examine individual requests, providing legal and linguistic assistance.
The refugees will be our foremost allies in promoting economic, civil and democratic growth in their countries of origin, since the world will be more secure only when it stops being so unfair.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
That concludes the list of speakers.
I understand the Commissioner does not wish to take the floor.
The debate is therefore closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0067/2004) by MrÂ Catania on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, containing a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the European Union drugs strategy (2005-2012) [2004/2221(INI)].
I should like to give the floor to Mr Catania, the rapporteur.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Unionâs anti-drugs strategy, which is on the agenda for debate, ought to operate exclusively through a scientific approach, through an analysis of the actual situation and of the experience on this issue built up over recent years.
In contrast, unfortunately, the argument is all too often permeated with ideologies and dogmatic or emotive approaches.
The data available to us allow us to take a practical approach.
I refer, in particular, to the data supplied to us by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, based in Lisbon.
As is well-known, these data are not only of high scientific value but also of proven reliability.
The 2004 report by the Lisbon Centre indicates that the situation regarding deaths from heroin and heroin users in Europe is, all in all, stable but that no decrease has been seen in the transmission of HIV, which is even spreading in some new Member States; that the consumption of cocaine is increasing in the majority of Member States; that cannabis is the most widely-used substance, with over 20% of European citizens having used it or currently using it; and that the use of ecstasy is as high as, if not even higher than, amphetamine use.
All this unequivocally demonstrates that the strategies adopted up to now have not had positive results.
With regard to drug use in prisons, the Centre indicates that drug users are over-represented in prison; that the use of drugs among detainees ranges from 22 to 86%, depending on the prison population, the prison and the country; and that prisons are a high-risk environment for the spread of infectious diseases.
With regard to the criminalisation of drug use, the Centre explains that in many Member States the process of criminalising the use of narcotics has led to an increase in the use of these substances.
I should point out to my Swedish fellow Members that the Centreâs report contains a specific reference to the situation in Sweden, where a study is cited which shows that with the repressive strategies in force in that country the drug market has intensified; it concludes that there is no specific proof for the argument that the criminalisation of drug use has a deterrent effect on young people.
Finally, with regard to drug trafficking, Europol indicates that narcotics trafficking accounts for approximately 2 to 5% of world GDP, which goes directly into the hands of drug traffickers and large criminal organisations worldwide.
The US drugs agency estimates that in 2005 Afghanistan will export over five thousand tons of opium, of which 95% will end up in Europe.
This demonstrates that the action plan adopted by the UN in 1998 has not had positive results, and this is also true in terms of the importance of drugs in funding organised crime and terrorism.
A prominent prosecutor, Gerardo D'Ambrosio, has explained to us that to finance the Madrid attack the Al-Quaida terrorists bartered 250 kilograms of hashish for the TNT.
Our report, which has been adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is therefore based on the need to fight drug trafficking, organised crime and terrorism and to give priority to saving lives and protecting health.
The issue must not be treated as a question of public order or a matter for repression, but exclusively as a social and economic issue.
For these reasons we have focused the report on the issue of the strategy for harm reduction and substitution treatment in prisons, as well as on the need to apply scientific knowledge to the effects produced by drugs, to launch scientific studies on the costs and benefits of the current policies to curb narcotics, to help producer countries to convert their agriculture, to study the effects that cannabis, opium and coca leaves can have in the medical sphere and, lastly, to take action on the confiscation of criminal and terrorist assets derived from money laundering and drug trafficking.
I therefore call on the European Parliament to adopt this report, on the Commission to back it and on the Council â which is unfortunately absent, having clearly already made up its mind â to consider including this recommendation on the agenda for the meeting to be held in three daysâ time.
I would also like to mention that this recommendation was put together with the support of many organisations.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Catania, as you know, the new drugs strategy for the period from 2005 to 2012 that is to be endorsed by the European Council is the first anti-drugs strategy for the enlarged Union.
It is based on an assessment of the previous strategy, which the Commission carried out back in October.
The European approach, which favours a balance between demand-reduction and supply-reduction measures, therefore covers 25 countries.
This strategy clearly addresses the need to enhance coordination within the Union as well as to raise the profile of EU efforts in other countries.
The principal aims laid down in the strategy will be translated into specific actions in the two successive four-year action plans, which, as you are aware, will be proposed by the Commission at the start of 2005 and the start of 2009 respectively.
The Commission intends to adopt its proposal for an action plan in FebruaryÂ 2005.
It believes that Parliamentâs contribution in an area such as the drugs issue is essential as a means of bringing European policy closer to the people.
What we need, in other words, is a shared European political strategy.
Rest assured that the Commission will not falter in its commitment to this approach.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can inform you that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats cannot lend its support to the draft recommendation we are discussing today, because it does not provide answers to the major challenges on which the EU should focus its future drugs strategy.
Recent figures about drug use among young people are alarming.
An increasing number of young people start experimenting, and at an ever-younger age, with soft drugs, in particular, which are made ever more accessible by the falling prices for them.
I believe that the rapporteur, in his report, is minimising the problem, and I see this as clearly inappropriate in this situation.
On the contrary, the situation requires a bold and comprehensive approach with only one goal in mind: that of reducing the use of drugs and all their adverse consequences.
The Commissionâs assessment report and the annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction prove that a great deal is yet to be done, including at European level.
The European policy should, as the Commissioner stated, add value to the differentiated approach in the different Member States in terms of coordination, information, scientific research and the tackling of the cross-border drugs trade and crime that goes hand in hand with that.
We believe that, if such a policy is to be adopted, a separate budget line should be created for supporting new initiatives and promoting the exchange of useful experience between the various Member States.
Nothing of the sort is to be found in this report.
Far from it; it is incoherent and riddled with contradictions.
For example, it calls for an approach based on facts and scientific research â something that we can, of course, support â while, in the same breath, drawing conclusions most of which are incorrect.
It claims that repression has no benefits, and that past action has failed to bear any fruit.
Moreover, it jumps to conclusions as to what should be done.
Finally, the European Council will be determining the strategy this week, and Parliament âŠ
Â Â  . Mr President, this is an excellent report which we on this side of the House support.
We support it for many of the reasons which the previous speaker mentioned, including in terms of the science and pragmatic facts of this debate.
We do not take an overtly ideological stance, but there is some ideology in the debate and the ideology says that, unless we deal with harm reduction, unless we understand addiction and unless we understand the explosion in crime which leads from drugs to the domestic crime that we suffer in all of our European Union Member States, we cannot tackle the problem efficiently and effectively.
This report â which was a much amended report with approximately 106 amendments in committee â shows two things.
One is that there is an active interest in this House in an EU drugs strategy.
Secondly we all know as MEPs that there is a very strong public appetite for there to be an EU strategy.
So what is that strategy to be?
The answer to that question is very much contained in this report.
For example, in this report we talk not about being hard on drugs or soft on drugs, but about actually looking at intelligent harm-reduction strategies.
We know the connections between drug use and HIV.
If we ignore those in this House, then there will be further harm, further crime and further suffering.
We want to lay much greater stress on harm reduction, but also on rehabilitation.
We want to provide appropriate funding for information measures and not to pretend that the public has sufficient information about this problem.
We also want to take appropriate steps to prevent the profits of illegal drug-trafficking from being used to fund everything from international terrorism to other forms of crime.
This report is thus not 'hard' or 'soft'.
It is effective.
It tackles crime, as well as the harm being done to individuals.
In this report we also urge governments and national parliaments to take effective measures to prevent drugs entering prisons.
Mr Catania continually stressed this point, because it is too often ignored in Member States.
It is for us in the European Union to tackle some of the difficult issues across Member States which sometimes individual Member States are not emphasising enough.
Prisons are now multiplying the effects of drug harm.
People are coming out of prisons and committing more crime.
This is a serious issue for the European Union.
There is a strong public appetite for us as MEPs and for the Commission to tackle drugs with an effective drugs strategy.
The old style of clichÃ©s and information about drugs has long gone.
We now need a more effective strategy.
This report places the right emphasis on harm reduction, tackling addiction and dealing with the source of drug problems, rather than expounding clichÃ©s about the effects.
It is a good report which we will support.
It has been much amended and I think that, in the light of those amendments, it is a report that the whole House should support.
We on this side will do so.
Â Â  . Mr President, if I could cut down the use of drugs by voting against this report, I would do so immediately, but that, unfortunately, is not an option.
I therefore call on this House to support this report, for it is an excellent and courageous one.
What is its objective?
I think we all share it.
I have also listened to Mrs Brepoels, and we have supported a large proportion of her amendments.
The objective is harm reduction, limiting the damage for the user and for the environment.
We must look into the best way of achieving this.
We must look to see which policy can produce results, because they are what matter.
This is not about ideology, but about results.
We must adopt policy that is based on fact, research and exchange of knowledge and experience, rather than on ideology.
It is therefore unfortunate that the assessment of the previous strategy was not available on time.
Moreover, it was stated a moment ago that the Council would, in the next few days, be deciding to adopt this strategy after all.
It would be very regrettable if the Council were to do so without Parliament having had a say in it.
The report takes a pragmatic, realistic approach, and I have to say, in all honesty, that I have interpreted it in a completely different way from Mrs Brepoels.
I do not think at all that it rules out repression as an option.
It is, of course, the case â and that also applies to Dutch policy, which is widely misunderstood â that such repression must be specific and effective.
Looking at the tough war on drugs waged by the USA, I would say that this has done nothing to reduce the use of drugs, but has only lined the pockets of the drugs barons.
Crucial to our approach must be prevention and pragmatism.
I will give you a few examples that are controversial, even in the Netherlands. Everyone has difficulty accepting them, and they are not decisions to be taken lightly.
Should we, for example, provide needles to drug users who live on the streets?
Are we, by doing this, condoning their use of drugs?
No, of course not, but if we provide needles, then we know for certain that there are no dirty needles in circulation or in use.
At major house parties, where young people take all kinds of tablets, including ecstasy and that sort of thing, should we test the quality of those tablets?
Should we provide information?
Should we ensure that those young people do not mix alcohol with drugs?
By doing this, do you give them the message that it is okay to use drugs?
That is a risk.
On the other hand, I can see that, if this is not done, then young people die at these parties.
As long as they still use drugs, which they do, I think that prevention and information are important.
Finally, we have tabled two amendments about the exchanging of information and consideration of alternative methods.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, across the world prohibitionism has always produced two results: on the one hand, a large increase in the number of deaths and imprisonments among those who use narcotics, who constitute the section of the prison population with the highest re-offending rate, and on the other hand unlimited big business for all sorts of drug traffickers.
This plan, however, focuses mainly on protecting everyoneâs health.
This is why the harm reduction strategies are absolutely fundamental.
Only by keeping alive persons who currently cannot or do not want to stop using narcotic substances can we hope that in the future they will succeed in escaping from all forms of dependence.
We must not forget that most deaths are due to AIDS and heart failures, that is, pathological situations connected with drug-taking methods.
For this reason, harm reduction involves taking action on the street and at low-threshold centres.
In addition, we must firmly distinguish between drug dealers and drug users, although repressive policies tend to place them in the same category.
Finally, it is essential to integrate social measures and pharmacological substitution measures.
We must avoid any kind of moralistic attitude that sets these in opposition.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are today discussing Mr Cataniaâs controversial report on the European anti-drug strategy, central to which is the fight against drugs rather than the promotion of them.
Judging by the title of the report, we seem to be in agreement on this.
There is no place for drugs in a healthy society.
If we in the European Union are serious about tackling the drug trade, we will need to impose sanctions.
We can no longer tolerate the people who ruin lives by making money from addicts.
However, we might well have a running battle on our hands if, contrariwise, we did not do everything in our power to fight drug use.
In addition to taking preventive measures, it must still be possible to penalise the use of drugs.
On behalf of my group, I have therefore tabled two amendments enabling the continued application of sanctions in respect of drug offences, alongside preventive measures.
I urge you to support those amendments.
This, of course, does not make it a good report.
I have to get it off my chest: the report is full of ideology, despite the fact that it claims the opposite.
I will leave it here.
Thank you for the opportunity of speaking my mind.
Â Â  . Mr President, even though I will not be supporting the report I should like to thank the rapporteur for his work.
Despite what he may say about the need to move away from ideology, there is an awful lot of ideology within the report.
If we have differing opinions, it will be hard for us to find the common ground that we should all strive for.
I must say at the outset that on reading the report one would believe that the criminalisation of drugs and drug use has led to an increase in the use of drugs.
One would therefore have to tacitly agree that decriminalisation would lead to a reduction in and the safer use of drugs.
The references to 'harm reduction' methods and so on are an abuse of the English language.
It is merely facilitation.
Despite what people may say and despite the good intentions that they may have, it is incorrect to say that the death rate from AIDS could be reduced through needle exchange.
A user will always use more needles and pass them on to other users.
We have to be realistic when we look at this problem.
The fact is, first and foremost, that we are dealing with people's lives â and the lives of people who are invariably some of the most vulnerable in our society.
There are claims that we would make their drug use safer by supplying shooting-up kitchens, by giving them clean needles, or by the medical use of heroin â as stated in the report â and that this would make these people's lives better.
The reality is that addiction is hell, addiction destroys.
The only way to stop people from being addicts is by stopping them from using drugs.
The only way to prevent people from relapsing into addiction is to take away their need for the drug.
If you disbelieve what I say, do not bother looking at any of the so-called 'illegal drugs'.
Look at the legal drugs that are available in Europe â alcohol and cigarettes â and see the damage that they cause.
Mr Moraes spoke earlier about the devastation that is caused on the streets because of drug-related crime.
Look at the devastation that is caused by alcohol â a legal drug â on the streets of every city in western Europe.
If we go down the road of legalisation and harm reduction, as proposed in this report, then we would see the problem exacerbated a hundredfold across all our cities.
The issue here is not about a mix-and-match of best policies.
The issue is about information to show people the damage and dangers that they face if they get involved in drugs.
The issue is about strong criminal penalties to ensure that those who traffic in drugs are hit where it hurts: in their pockets.
That requires asset seizures and asset freezing; a strong policy to ensure that those who are addicts and those who fall into drug problems are given proper resources to overcome their addictions.
As somebody who has worked with young adults who are drug addicts and alcoholics, I have seen that the only way that people get off drugs is when they stop.
That should be the ultimate aim, not facilitating drug use.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there are two genuinely opposing views in this case: one in which drugs have been accepted as a natural part of our everyday life and another in which there is a desire to do everything to stop the sale and consumption of all drugs.
Most Swedes, especially parents, are in favour of the latter approach.
It means that prevention and the fight against drugs under criminal law have the highest priority.
To maintain, like MrÂ Catania, that current drugs policy could be a crime against human rights is quite alien to us.
We do not see the taking of illegal drugs as a human right.
Penalties that enable drug addicts to choose care instead of prison are not a crime against human rights.
They are a way of helping people escape drug dependency.
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon also points this out at the end of the introductory summary in its report, which I think MrÂ Catania should read.
We do not wish to decriminalise drug abuse.
Instead, we wish to give clear and unambiguous signals that reject drugs.
Proposals to have doctors offer people help in taking drugs or, even worse, proposals to distribute heroin are just as alien to us.
What is central as far as we are concerned is that the rehabilitation of drug addicts and the content of the care given to them should be, and remain, a national competence.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in common with we Swedish Moderates, will vote against MrÂ Cataniaâs report precisely because we take a stand in the fight against this epidemic.
Our approach is directed towards releasing people from drug dependency, not seeing them hooked on drugs.
Â Â  Mr President, in the sixties, rebellious and critical young people discovered the drugs that had previously been used only behind closed doors by the well-heeled in society .
They saw the use of soft drugs as part of their fight for freedom.
Since then, policy in a number of states has been aimed at isolating, criminalising, penalising and eliminating drug users.
This repressive approach has not prevented the use of drugs from spreading.
The alternative to this approach is not to become indifferent and consequently to resign oneself to the damage which drugs do to the health of the users and the nuisance they cause for others, as also do alcohol and nicotine.
We should not shy away from the conflict with the dealers, who make a good living from other peopleâs problems.
In his report, my colleague, Mr Giusto Catania, has shown the right way to reduce the problems as much as possible.
He endorses the practice, developed in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and parts of Germany, of tolerance, prevention and provision of aid to users and of distinguishing between the addictive tendencies of different types of drugs.
I am aware that this approach meets with emotional objections among those who laboured under the illusion of being able to stamp out drugs by penalising the users, but that has only resulted in resistance to the lack of freedom.
That is why broad support is needed for the alternative.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Swedish June List is strongly critical of the report we are debating today.
According to the proposal, a genuine EU policy to combat drugs must be introduced.
A common drugs policy within the EU means a compromise policy that is liberal regarding drugs.
In Sweden, any use of drugs, except for medical reasons, is banned.
For us, it is important for Swedenâs restrictive drugs policy to continue in the future too.
We recommend preventive work, treatment, social education and rehabilitation.
The report emphasises a drugs policy designed to reduce harm.
We want to work towards a drugs-free society instead of accepting the use of drugs.
We object to drugs being classified as soft or hard, as well as to the assertion that so-called soft drugs are not addictive.
The lack of internal border controls able to prevent the drugs trade between the Member States is a problem in this connection.
An individual EU Member State must be able to monitor its national borders in order to prevent drugs from coming into the country.
As matters now stand, internal border controls in the EU are practically non-existent.
In conclusion, I would note that drug problems in the EU are in large measure a consequence of the prevailing poverty in many countries in the world.
Not being informed by a sense of solidarity, EU trade policy involving duties, licences and quotas contributes to the problems of global poverty.
It is important for the UN, rather than the EU, to work towards making it profitable to cultivate alternative crops in the poor countries of the world.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, the report presented to us today by Mr Catania calls into question the policy of zero tolerance and prohibition implemented by the Member States.
The rapporteurâs aim is to amend the current strategy and it will be to no oneâs surprise that we have voted against this report
Mr Catania mentioned the report by the European drugs and drug addiction monitoring centre.
Mr Estievenart was with us last month and pointed out that, and I quote, âthere are positive signs that progress has been made in reducing some of the worst consequences of drug useâ.
He said that the number of drug-related deaths has begun to fall, that heroin use has levelled off in a number of countries, that the HIV epidemic among users is slowing and, I quote, âmeasures to reduce drug-related harm are intensifying and, across much of Europe, drug users have better access to treatment and careâ.
This clearly demonstrates that not everything has been negative.
Much remains to be done and, despite all the policies that we have been pursuing, enormous problems still exist in terms of the production and trafficking of drugs, and in terms of drug use, which continues to hit extremely high levels in all Member States.
In light of the accession of ten new Member States, it is essential that we step up cooperation with the countries that now border the EU.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is room for a European anti-drugs policy that fights back against drug-related crime, and that, as per the programme, meets the four main objectives of preventing drug use and dependency, reducing the supply and demand of illegal drugs, limiting social and health damage and reducing crime.
This is the path that we must follow â the path of combat, not the path of slackness.
Â Â  MrÂ President, certain facts are straightforward, such as the fact that Europe is the worldâs largest market for cannabis.
Is it possible to get rid of drugs?
Shall we give up and just limit the damage?
Emphatically not.
We know that it is specifically with cannabis that most people who end up mis-using heroin, cocaine and amphetamines begin.
That is why it is crucial for us to ensure that fewer new cannabis users are recruited.
According to MrÂ Cataniaâs report, the restrictive policy has failed.
The figures from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon, which was published a couple of weeks ago, is unambiguous.
In countries such as Sweden, with a restrictive view of drugs, 7% of 15 year-olds have used cannabis.
In Great Britain, 42.5% of all 15 year-old boys have used cannabis.
The restrictive policy has led to dramatic reductions specifically in the number of drug users recruited.
According to MrÂ Catania, âsoftâ drugs are not dangerous.
According to the Monitoring Centreâs new data, there is an increased risk of a range of physical and mental problems such as depression, psychoses and schizophrenia.
A review of European drugs policy is under way right now.
In countries such as the Netherlands, too, the attitude has changed over the last ten years.
Now, only a third of the countryâs so-called coffee shops remain.
The Dutch Justice Minister has said that the Netherlands will probably be forced to alter its policy.
There are high hopes of reversing the trend.
Anyone who wants to see fewer drugs in Europe should vote against MrÂ Cataniaâs report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would warn against the terms âsoftâ and âhardâ drugs.
Talk of soft drugs gives out completely the wrong signals.
It makes these drugs out to be harmless, but there are no soft drugs.
Instead, these drugs â for example, cannabis â are often the gateway to other drugs.
I have visited many different treatment centres for drug addicts where just about all addicts have agreed that what are mistakenly called soft drugs started them off on the drug misuse that destroyed their lives and robbed them of their future.
These addicts feel angry and frustrated that society has not made the dangers of cannabis, hashish and similar drugs sufficiently clear.
In my own country, Sweden, we have combined a restrictive drugs policy and the criminalisation of drugs with care and treatment for addicts.
This combination has proved to be the best way of stopping drug abuse.
The small increase we have seen in Sweden in recent years has been due partly to the open borders and partly to the influence of the legalisation debate taking place elsewhere in the EU.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
That concludes the list of speakers.
I understand the Commissioner does not wish to take the floor, so the debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0049/2004), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC [9262/1/2004 â C6-0110/2004 â 2003/0052(COD)] (Rapporteur: Robert Sturdy).
I should like to give the floor to MrÂ Sturdy, the rapporteur.
Â Â  . Mr President, may I begin by saying what a pleasure it is to be here, and I hope that tomorrow when the vote is taken we will have an agreement.
I see Mr JÃžrgensen is here, and I want to pass some comments about the way this Parliament has worked.
Mr JÃžrgensen came in very late on, because he is a new Member.
My Liberal, Socialist and Green colleagues have worked very closely together on this report.
I thank them, because it left me in a position of great strength when it came to negotiating with the Council, and that is a position all of us in this august House aim for in order to be able to put our points forward.
What is this report about?
The idea was to put in place a central harmonised system for the control of certain types of chemicals and fix levels of MRLs â maximum residue levels â of chemicals in foodstuffs.
The one thing that has not escaped me, but may well have escaped other Members, is that this is a forerunner of the REACH Directive, which will be one of the biggest reports to come through Parliament.
If they can handle it in the way that we handled it â I say 'we' because all our colleagues, as I said earlier, worked together â then we shall be in an extremely strong position.
What does it mean to consumers, the people who will be affected by this legislation?
It means safer food across Europe; it means that if you buy a tomato in Ireland that has come from Spain you can guarantee the quality and safety of that product.
It provides a guarantee that British lamb sold â dare I say â to the French is safe.
That is extremely important for the consumer.
We have included a number of recommendations where, for instance, food is tested at the point of sale, which we have all agreed on.
However, we also agreed that imports need to be of the same level of quality. This is important for people who import into the European Union.
The levels of pesticides have to be of the same standard â not that they necessarily were or were not; but it is important that we get that message across for people who come into the European Union.
I shall mention briefly some things we fought over and had great debates about.
Good agricultural practices â GAP â was a difficult issue, but we got a definition with the help of the Commission, which I am delighted to see here today.
Our colleagues worked closely with the Commission and, as I said, the Council.
This is very important in setting a precedent for the future, so that we know exactly what good agricultural practices are.
It was somewhat difficult to get a position on synergistic effects, but we now have a situation where we know exactly where we are going to be with those effects.
For those who do not know, synergistic effects are a mixture of chemicals possibly used on a crop, and there is no particular definition of how they are traceable.
We have put in place legislation which will work in the future.
It has left a position open for future Member States to be able to define exactly what the situation is on synergistic effects.
I am concerned about how governments will implement this â because it is a regulation and therefore has to be implemented.
I read recently in a paper that governments tend to gold-plate things.
It is important, when we are pushing this through, that governments do not gold-plate it: we want an equal footing.
It is interesting that the British Minister of Agriculture, Mrs Beckett, has said that she will decide when farmers can go into the field, or when it is too wet or has been raining.
I wonder exactly how she is going to do that.
Nevertheless, it is important that we do not place governments or countries at a disadvantage compared to other Member States.
That is why this legislation has been put in place.
It is workable, it is a good regulation.
Just in case the joint resolutions we have agreed do not go through, the PPE-DE Group has covered itself; but I expect all the joint amendments to be adopted tomorrow.
I look forward to seeing Member States implementing and working well with it.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I am pleased that it appears that the draft regulation on pesticide residues in food and feed can be adopted at second reading.
The negotiations between Council presidency, the European Parliament rapporteurs and the Commission have recently gained momentum and last week the final obstacles were cleared.
Allow me to underline the significance of these regulations for food safety.
It will enable us to set harmonised maximum residue levels in the EU for all pesticides and all agricultural products in one piece of legislation directly applicable to all EU citizens.
All situations will be covered, including a list of pesticides for which no maximum residue levels are required and the low level that will apply systematically to all pesticides for which we have no information.
There will be clarity about how and to whom an MRL application should be made, and on the procedure to be followed.
The European Food Safety Authority will carry out the risk assessment for consumers with the best available methodology.
Control and enforcement by the Member States will be reinforced and improved.
Coordination of monitoring by the Commission will have a more obligatory nature.
This legislation will benefit all parties.
Consumers will profit from better protection and more transparency about which pesticides could be present in food and their potential effects.
Food producers will benefit because there will be more clarity as to what specifications the products have to comply with.
Control and enforcement bodies will be able to refer to one single Community list of maximum residue levels.
Member State legislators will no longer need to transpose the provisions into national legislation.
Before I finish, I would like to make a few comments on the finer points resolved in the negotiations.
The European Parliament's insistence on taking cumulative and synergistic effects into account may lead to a breakthrough in the development and application of the necessary methodology.
I am pleased that this is now explicitly mentioned in the draft legislation.
I welcome Parliament's determination to make an explicit link between the setting of maximum residue levels and good agricultural practice, integrated pest management and the use of the lowest amounts of pesticides necessary.
The clear requirement to take into account vulnerable groups of the population, including children and unborn children, is also a useful step forward.
These issues make a positive contribution to this regulation.
The final phase of the negotiations saw an increasing mutual trust among the parties.
I am happy to confirm that the Commission can agree to and accept the compromise package worked out between the three institutions.
I trust that you will confirm Parliament's acceptance at the vote tomorrow.
We are now approaching the conclusion of this project.
It is time to acknowledge the efforts of all parties and in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sturdy, for his handling of this dossier and for the time and effort he has put into his report.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are aiming at includes less bureaucracy and greater simplicity; this single Regulation is meant to replace four basic directives on pesticide residues.
This is not just about food safety and health, but also about equal opportunities in competing in the internal market and â let us not forget â on the global market.
Producers and processors must operate under identical conditions, and all consumers are entitled to safe food.
The European Food Safety Authority has great responsibility where risk management is concerned.
It is no use whatever to consumers to get, week in and week out, one new warning after another, sometimes petering out into such generalisations as the statement that, for example, apples from a particular Member State are exceeding the maximum permitted levels, when such announcements are helpful only if they include the name of the company whose products contain excessive residues of pesticides.
We are setting very high standards right across the EU, particularly where health is concerned, and quite rightly too.
Equally, though, we have to look more closely at imports into the European Union.
There is no room for double standards here, and what that means â as I see it â is tighter controls on imported goods.
We cannot intervene in their production processes in the way we can with the food produced here, and that makes it all the more important that the end market be checked and monitored.
I am glad that the committee was able to come up with a compromise on the definition of âgood agricultural practiceâ.
Europeâs farmers produce in accordance with the most stringent legal requirements, as is best known in the case of the rules on cross-compliance.
Those who farm in accordance with the law must also be certain that their products pose no health hazard.
I am grateful to Mr Sturdy for the work he has done over many months, and for the good compromise that we have been able to reach.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by thanking MrÂ Sturdy.
I think that our cooperation has been constructive and has proceeded in a pleasant and open atmosphere.
I should like to thank the other âshadow rapporteursâ, and I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council for the sound guidance and advice we have received.
I am pleased that I have been allowed to deliver my first speech here in plenary on a matter as important as this.
In actual fact, I see this draft Act or legislation as an example of the EU at its best.
We shall secure a number of things with this draft Act if it is adopted in the form in which we should like to have it adopted.
Firstly, cross-border trade is of course ensured.
A variety of foods is guaranteed, as is their presence on the shelves at lower prices.
Other, still more important, things are, however, also ensured, namely consumersâ health, safety and security in connection with the foods they buy.
I come from a very cold country up in the north, so I am pleased to be able to buy fruit and vegetables in the winter too.
I am only pleased, however, if I can be sure that the apple I eat is also healthy, and this is something that this legislation can help ensure.
I shall mention a couple of the areas it has been especially important for us Social Democrats to see successfully dealt with and in which I think we have achieved compromises with which everyone can be satisfied.
Firstly, I want to mention the consideration given to especially vulnerable groups.
It is one thing to devise legislation with a view to robust, healthy and vigorous men such as MrÂ Sturdy and myself.
That is fine, of course.
There also needs, however, to be legislation with a view to more vulnerable groups such as children, born and as yet unborn.
That too is something, I am pleased to say, that we have obtained.
Another thing I would emphasise â and I would now apologise to the interpreters for they are about to be confronted by difficult expressions again â is that we have incorporated cumulative effects that are the result of synergy.
That is extremely important.
It sounds a little technical, but in reality it is quite simple.
The fact is, it is not enough only to take account of how poisonous or non-poisonous a pesticide is.
We must also take account of how poisonous or non-poisonous two or three or four pesticides are when they interact, that is to say when they react to each other in a particular food.
That is something it is incredibly important to take account of.
It is an area about which we do not know much at present, but one about which we need to know more in the future and of which we must take more account.
Otherwise, there may be major consequences in terms of health.
I fear that that is already now the case.
My third point is that it is all well and good to have controls and legislation, but we also need to ensure that there are sanctions.
I think that naming and shaming is a sensible idea.
I think it is sensible of us now to oblige the Member States to publish their control results on the Internet.
It also brings about openness, which in turn produces security.
The consumer must have peace of mind, and that is something we are in this way guaranteeing.
Fourthly and finally, I think it encouraging that we have obtained some clear and constructive definitions, including definitions of good agricultural practice and an actual definition of maximum limit values.
These were not easy things to negotiate successfully but, especially through sound guidance from the Council and the Commission, we obtained a compromise with which everyone can be pleased and which will help secure our objectives.
I would say that, all in all, this is a proposal that may make a positive difference to the everyday life of Europeans, and that is something I am pleased about and proud to be associated with.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the draft law we are debating in this House today will be of great significance for public health in Europe and for Europeansâ confidence in food safety.
It is incredibly important for all our voters in our various constituencies, but it is particularly important perhaps for parents with allergic children.
Our amendments are in line with what I and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe think is reasonable for bringing about a proposal that is effective from the points of view both of competition and of consumer protection.
I should like to emphasise a few things.
The internal market is incredibly important.
In this internal market, we wish to protect our citizens and, at the same time, set standards for testing and treating food at those links in the chain where the food concerned first comes into contact with the consumer and first enters the distribution chain.
In this respect, this proposal is sound.
It is also sound inasmuch as it protects important and vulnerable high-risk groups such as women, infants and unborn children.
We are also adopting a position on a standard for good agricultural practice.
In this, we have taken account both of integrated pest control and of climate variations in order to bring about a fairer proposal.
It is incredibly important that these options for taking account of local or regional variations should not reduce the proposalâs level of ambition.
This is something that has to be considered in connection with the practical application of the proposal, once it has properly entered into force.
It is good that there have been improvements to the Food Safety Authority in terms of both time and resources.
I also think that the rapporteur has done a very good job.
I am pleased that we have been able to make it easier for civil society and the non-governmental organisations to participate in the discussion and handling of these issues.
Â Â  Mr President, it is very late now and very few of us are left but nevertheless we are dealing with a very important issue.
It is a pity that once again in this Parliament legislation is left until the end of the day.
In a recent opinion poll 77Â per cent of British people said that they are concerned about pesticides in food so, as everyone has said, what we are doing here resonates with public opinion.
I am very pleased that we have a compromise and that we agree on the main things.
There are two issues which particularly concern me and I am very pleased that we have secured a deal on them.
The first is cumulative and synergistic effects: cocktail effects.
We were told that there is no methodology at present to measure this effect but this is an effect which research suggests is at the root of our problems.
I am very pleased to hear the Commissioner say that he is going to take this research forward and support Parliament in making sure that we get more research into the cumulative effects.
That is why I tabled the amendment to recital 5.
One problem is that a lot of experts say that these cumulative effects are unfounded, but we have nothing to prove or disprove this.
We must get this research, it is very important.
The second issue mentioned by Mr JÃžrgensen is about the effects on children and the unborn.
A lot of research suggests that children and the unborn have in some way been affected by either pesticides or chemicals in our environment.
In a recent radio programme about chemicals they did a series of tests on a grandmother, a mother, and a granddaughter.
These tests showed that the highest level of chemicals was found not in the grandmother â who had lived through the highest levels of pollution in our streets in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s â but in the granddaughter who was 15 years old.
They found in her blood chemicals that had been taken off our shelves many years beforehand.
We know that some of these substances come in through pesticides.
It is extremely important that we start looking not just at testing on adults but at testing on children and looking at the effects on babies in the womb.
Public confidence in food safety and food standards is very low.
In the survey that I referred to earlier, over 50Â % of British people said they did not believe that government reassurances about pesticides were accurate.
Consequently we need to get it right.
Scientific research shows that imported products have more pesticides than products grown within the EU.
This is extremely important legislation.
I am very grateful to Mr Sturdy, Mr JÃžrgensen and all those within the Commission and the Council who worked very hard to achieve a compromise that we can all support tomorrow.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
That concludes the list of speakers.
I understand the Commissioner does not wish to take the floor, so the debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission and Council statements on the preparation of the European Council (17 December 2004).
Â Â  . Mr President, the forthcoming European Council in Brussels will be the first for the new Commission.
It will be an important meeting, marking the next steps in the process of building a larger, more prosperous and safer European Union.
It will be a sign of our ambition for a Union which is dynamic and on the move; a Union ready to share its destiny with the European family; a Union which is concerned about the security of its citizens.
I would hope that the spirit coming out of the European Council later this week is one of cooperation.
How else can we generate the trust in Europeâs institutions and politicians that is needed for a smooth ratification of the Constitution?
We have heard from the presidency about its expectations and the issues that the summit will address.
Let me comment briefly on three issues: enlargement, the fight against terrorism and the financial perspectives.
Firstly, our policy of enlargement of the Union has been the key in freeing us from our cold war past.
The gravitational pull of the prospect of EU membership has transformed and modernised several post-communist societies. It has thus reshaped the European order.
This was and remains an achievement of historic proportions that we should not underestimate.
Your House has been instrumental in supporting this process, but our enlargement is still incomplete.
This European Council will take the next steps for four countries, offering them the potential â through enlargement â to join the European mainstream.
Last October the Commission made it clear that it should be possible to conclude the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania in 2004.
Indeed, this negotiating process was closed yesterday, thanks to the increased efforts by the European Union and by these two countries.
I congratulate the Netherlands presidency for its excellent work and close cooperation with the Commission on that particular subject.
The Accession Treaty for both countries now needs to be finalised and we hope that it can be signed after receiving the assent of this House during the spring of next year.
In the remaining period up to accession, the Commission will be watching closely to see that both countries deliver on the commitments made during the negotiations, and in some cases this will mean a further acceleration in their efforts.
At the request of the European Council, on 6 October the Commission adopted its report on Turkey and a clear recommendation.
The main message in the Commissionâs assessment is that Turkey has sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria and that accession negotiations should now be opened.
We consider this recommendation, which was very carefully prepared, to be well balanced and a good basis for a decision by the Council.
I am looking forward to taking comfort from the position your House will take on this question later today.
Turkey has made further progress in the last weeks.
It has adopted five of the six pieces of legislation signalled by the Commission in its report; the sixth law, on the execution of sentences, is pending before the Turkish Parliament.
It is now time for the European Council to honour its commitment to Turkey and announce the opening of accession negotiations.
A clear date should be indicated.
We consider that, apart from the matters I have just mentioned, no other conditions ought to be added.
The European Council will no doubt wish to recall that political reforms will have to continue in the course of the negotiations and ask the Commission to monitor further progress closely.
We should also ask our Turkish friends in all honesty: if you want to become a member of a club, is it not normal that you recognise the other members of the club?
I am convinced that this will come at the right moment in the course of this difficult process, and preferably sooner than later.
The objective of starting negotiations cannot be other than accession but we accept that the accession process is open-ended and its outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand.
As in the past, transitional arrangements and certain specific safeguards may need to be considered.
But let me state what our ultimate challenge will be: in the end, we need not only to overcome diplomatic obstacles, but also to conquer the hearts and minds of European citizens on this issue.
Croatia represents the first of the Western Balkan nations preparing to start the process for accession to the Union.
The Commission is ready to support the launch of such negotiations, but believes that any progress should be conditional on increased cooperation between the Croatian Government and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
If such cooperation is confirmed, then negotiations can be started in 2005.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission I should like to turn to one of the twenty-first centuryâs key challenges, and one which we will also discuss at this weekâs Council summit, namely the threat of international terrorism.
What we are dealing with here is the ugly face of globalisation.
International terrorism exploits the advantages of pluralist societies to attack the very foundations of those societies â our freedoms.
I hope that at the end of the week we will reach further agreements on how terrorism can be fought.
We must show our unwavering determination, but we must never lose sight of the democratic and legal principles which are at the very basis of our society and our prosperity.
The European Commission has played an active role in promoting and preparing an updated EU action plan on the fight against international terrorism, and I should like to make absolutely clear what we hope the outcome of the decisions to be taken at the end of the week will be.
These decisions must help us to ensure that the EU will be better prepared to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks, as well as allowing us to block the sources of funding for terrorists to a greater extent than previously, improving our ability to manage the aftermath of an attack and, finally, ensuring better protection for our key infrastructures.
We should not limit ourselves to fighting terrorism by force.
We should also oppose its perverse logic, by tackling the ideological and social factors which lead individuals to commit such acts.
Long-term commitment and a clear political determination will be necessary to overcome this scourge.
The discussions at the summit will also take stock of the situation regarding the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013.
I still believe that the Commissionâs proposals are sound, based as they are on a broad political consensus on what the EU must do.
The truth is that the political project on which the Commissionâs proposals are based was not actually at risk.
The Commissionâs proposals therefore constitute a valid working basis.
The current ceiling for own resources remains in place despite new requests to the EU due to the enlargement and to the development of new policies.
They are therefore reasonable proposals.
What we want to offer, however, is actual added European value, on top of what is offered at national level.
Of course, we must ensure discipline in the budgetary process, but this cannot be achieved by setting arbitrary limits, without reference to what the budget aims to achieve.
I am aware that some Member States remain convinced that the EU budget should be limited to 1% of gross national revenue.
I do not believe that the EUâs policy objectives are compatible with such a figure.
Are we prepared to abandon the challenges of social and economic cohesion, which are all the more pressing after enlargement?
Are we really being serious as regards the policy of investing in the major trans-European transport networks?
Are we really being serious as regards the need to foster the European research policy?
How can we ensure a European contribution towards combating terrorism and towards safeguarding our citizensâ security?
Let me state this to you clearly: we cannot have more Europe with less money and a union ceases to be a union if the objective of cohesion is forgotten.
A 1% limit would force us to cut back on our political objectives and would force us to re-assess commitments already made.
The Commissionâs position is therefore clear: our starting point is the package submitted in February of last year.
In spite of the Dutch Presidencyâs very hard work, the negotiations have, thus far, yet to really begin.
I sincerely hope that the Luxembourg Presidency will be able to drive this process forward and ensure that effective negotiations go ahead, because it is important that we respect the timetable established in the Councilâs multiannual strategic programme.
We must ensure that the programmes are fully up and running by 1Â January 2007.
This means that we must reach a political agreement in June of next year.
There is one thing I can promise: as always, the Commission will not be the stumbling block to the outcome of negotiations.
We shall help the Member States to reach agreements, but not at any price.
In the short time between the confirmation of the new Commission and the forthcoming European Council, we will have seen important developments both internationally â in particular in Ukraine â and for the Union.
With the decisions on enlargement and security that the European Council will take this week, we are showing in practical ways our confidence in the future of our continent.
We are showing how we can succeed in projecting the values that we hold dear into the international arena and extending the ring of prosperity, solidarity and security further across our continent and the world.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as with all European Councils, the next one has some very interesting topics to discuss.
I would go further and say that they are not just interesting; they are perhaps crucial to our Unionâs collective future.
Consequently, not only will the Heads of State or Government be taking part, but also the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission.
At this time, we must ask for three indispensable qualities: ambition, adequate resources and practical ideas.
Let us look at what this means with regard to each of those topics.
Whilst the process of admitting Bulgaria and Romania appears to be going well and the result of genuine efforts on the part of the two countries, we are strongly aware, however, that Romania needs to sprint down the home straight.
Whilst we too have no doubts about Croatia â you only need to have been to Zagreb or Dubrovnik to appreciate how embedded it is in European culture â Turkey is a special case, not only due to its geography, but also due to its peculiar cultural and economic characteristics.
The case of Cyprus must not be swept under the carpet while we discuss negotiations.
Nevertheless, the opening of negotiations will undoubtedly help to clarify for both sides many areas that are currently in doubt and it will eventually be possible to gauge more clearly what kind of Union would be preferable to both sides.
After all, there are other types of union apart from marriage that could potentially be considered.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, terrorism is certainly one of the Councilâs most important portfolios and we must combat it globally and unstintingly.
Rogue states that harbour international terrorism, with varying degrees of legality, must be sanctioned by the EU without delay.
International cooperation at various levels â political, financial or operational â must also take place without delay.
In this area, there must be no delay and no lack of resources.
This brings me to the Financial Perspectives, a portfolio that, as far as we are concerned, will set the tone for Europeâs desire to deepen our Union.
The resources must match the ambition.
This is something that Jacques Delors said, and with good reason.
It is not possible, moreover, to cheat the countries that recently joined our European Union, nor those looking hopefully to the EU as an engine to propel democracy and development forward in their countries.
Let us be clear.
To think that Europe, the new Europe, our Europe, can be built with the resources of the past is a fallacy and it is worth saying that if ambition and solidarity do not go hand in hand at this summit and in the orientations and guidelines that are adopted, we should be ashamed of our current leaders.
Mr President, this brings me to external affairs.
The Council services tell us that the Council is to discuss the Middle East, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Mediterranean Partnership and, I should add, probably the situation in Ukraine, Darfur, relations with China and Russia and even Transatlantic relations.
What I am wondering is that with an agenda of which I have only mentioned a few topics, with the desire for a joint, EU-level external service, what resources will we use to seek to influence the international scene?
Will we continue to be a soft power, striving for multilateralism without being in any way active on the international scene?
Or will we have at our disposal the resources â the appropriate resources â to finally stop being the political dwarf of the international scene?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude by saying what I said at the beginning.
It is crucial that we speak about the Lisbon Strategy, about combating drugs or AIDS, about the new neighbourhood policy and about sustainable development.
If, however, we do not have the three elements of ambition, adequate resources and practical ideas, we will be speaking as though we were autistic.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should very much like to have been present at a meeting of the Portuguese Social Democrats.
The President of the Commission, MrÂ Barroso, has frequently told us of his âblind datesâ, which have attracted the particular interest of this House.
This morning I have now heard from MrÂ Pinheiro that he prefers forms of cohabitation other than marriage.
Interesting things are going on in Portugal.
In this instance, MrÂ Pinheiro, we are no advocates of the common law marriage the EU is to enter into with Turkey.
We wish relations between the EU and Turkey to be strong, resilient, and stable â in good Christian Democrat style.
I would also warn you against speaking of cultural differences, MrÂ Pinheiro.
Zagreb may well look European, and so does Istanbul, but this is not the issue at stake; what is at stake, and this is a point I should like to repeat, is whether we are in a position to define what MrÂ Eurlings gave a precise description of in his report, namely that the European Union is a community of values â a political community of values â and that it is based on the Constitution with which we have endowed ourselves and on the Charter of Fundamental Rights we have enshrined in the Constitution.
This community of values is open to everyone who shares these values, without any kind of cultural relativity, and this is a point I should like to reiterate once again.
This is self-evident to our group, and, yesterday, we decided with what I think was almost 99% of votes within our group ...
in an open ballot, not a secret ballot, to give MrÂ Eurlings our support for his belief that, if this order of values can be enshrined in a Muslim society, it will be proof that this order of values is open to every person, of whatever religion, skin colour and cultural or ethnic background they may be.
The reason why this is such an important issue, MrÂ Pinheiro, is that the fight against terrorism is also a subject for discussion at the European Council summit and during the preliminary debates.
I believe that there is a direct connection between this issue and the question of whether we will manage to disprove the theory that the Islam of the most dangerous terrorists currently active, the Islamic fundamentalists, which they describe as the only Islam, and the order of values I referred to a moment ago are mutually exclusive.
I believe that the mere opening of negotiations with Turkey, a step which also means that Turkey is prepared to submit to the Constitution and its rules, is evidence that the implementation of a secular social reality is not linked in any way to religion, but instead to the political will of a people.
This is the crucial point, and this is an important contribution to the fight against terrorism.
I therefore believe that the debate on Turkey and the debate on the fight against terrorism are two sides of the same coin.
During yesterdayâs preparations for todayâs debate, we too discussed Romania and Bulgaria, and developments in both these countries.
I will not deny that we regret that our friend, MrÂ Nastase, lost the presidential elections.
It was a fair decision, and we should like to congratulate MrÂ Basescu.
We only hope that MrÂ Basescu has a sufficient sense of responsibility, something which he did not demonstrate during the election campaign, not to enter into coalitions with parties in his country which are opposed to the European Union and which ride roughshod over our fundamental values.
You may be sure, MrÂ Watson, that we will continue to observe Romania as closely as you have done to date, particularly with regard to the issue of whether the future Romanian President forms a coalition with the extreme right.
This is something you can depend on, and something we will observe particularly closely.
We believe that the debate that is on the Councilâs agenda ...
should consolidate what the European Union has achieved in its role as mediator in Ukraine under the Dutch Presidency of the Council.
On behalf of our group, I should like to say â and I also address these words to the Dutch Presidency â that the European Union has provided an enormous amount of support throughout what has been going on in Ukraine over recent weeks, which represents a fundamental shift in the internal political situation towards democracy, freedom and human rights.
