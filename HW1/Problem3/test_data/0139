We believe that this is necessary because we should now get the whole European Union on the move.
That is why we want the second stage as set out in Article 13(5) to be distinct and a commensurate advance.
Why do we want that?
There are some here - certainly some from Member States that have very effective traceability and labelling possibilities already - who would like to do the whole thing at once.
They would be able to say to others: look - you cannot do it, you are at fault.
Our job is to bring all 15 Member States together so that the process of traceability throughout the whole of the food chain, from the birth of the animal to its slaughter and disposal, would be universally applied throughout the European Union.
We say to those who are resistant to this: please remember that it is necessary to bring everybody on board.
What everybody wants - whether they are farmers, citizens or consumers in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the Union - is to feel that they have equal confidence, wherever they are, in the safety of the product that they are consuming.
We have struck out the second subparagraph of Article 13(5) and all other amendments which follow the same line of allowing imprecise mixed origins or an indication such as "EU origin".
One day "EU origin" may be assurance enough but it is not at this moment.
We need to know from which state a product has arrived.
I know that there are people in the Netherlands who disagree with that and I would be interested to know why.
I cannot see that "EU origin" is currently sufficient in the way of labelling and we are opposed to that proposal.
We are also opposed to the derogation for minced beef, which might apply to something like 30% of the beef output, which ought to be open to labelling.
Minced beef is as much, if not more, at risk as any other form of beef since it frequently comes from a variety of sources.
It is the case in my country that we have seen minced beef and lamb and other meats mixed up together.
We need traceability and labelling there as much as anywhere else.
We agree with the rapporteur' s intention to stiffen and speed up the compliance provisions in Amendments Nos 42 and 43.
We also agree that supplementary information should and can be provided for those Member States that need it and for those special regions which have important information to communicate.
My last point is to end where I began.
My country, Mr President, and yours - if I can call Scotland my country too, as I certainly would - have suffered the horrors of BSE.
We know we bore a large part of the responsibility for it.
It was incumbent upon us to make special provisions by way of food safety as a result.
After our years of effort to that end, we can now justifiably say to the Community as a whole that what we want for ourselves we want for everyone else as well.
Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to reinstate market confidence.
It is, however, still more important to restore citizens' confidence in the food they buy and eat - in actual fact, it is perhaps in that way that the market will be strengthened.
The crucial factor is that it should be possible to trace with certainty the origins of what we eat.
Amendment No 29 is very important for producers, above all perhaps for small producers in vulnerable areas.
This Amendment would entitle producers to provide information on the label in addition to the name of the nation where the goods concerned originate.
There would be the option to state, for example, the particular area from which the meat comes or the fact that a particular breed of cattle or special breeding methods have been used.
However, there should be no legislation on this matter, other than a ban on lying.
I am very pleased about Mr Whitehead' s remark about minced meat.
I fully and wholeheartedly support Amendment No 30 from the rapporteur.
For me, the most important aspect of this whole issue is that no exceptions should be made for cheap food.
We who sit in this Chamber, for the most part middle-aged and well-to-do, know perfectly well that it is young people and families with children who buy and eat the cheapest food - sausages, hamburgers etc. In all social systems and at all periods in history, the most vulnerable groups have had the least purchasing power.
It is our absolute moral duty first and foremost to make cheap food safe before we do the same for fillet of beef.
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament has proven its far-sightedness on this matter and I should like to thank the two rapporteurs from the Committee on the Environment and the Committee on Agriculture for their work.
They have approached the issue with the same consistency demonstrated by the European Parliament.
Allow me to refresh your memory: compulsory registration has applied for a long time, because Regulation No 820/97 entered into force on 1 January 2000.
The postponement adopted is not lawful.
The European Parliament has filed charges against the Council because the postponement was not within the Council' s discretion.
Nor did the Commission come up smelling of roses here.
It was the Commission which proposed this seemingly elegant but legally dubious procedure.
If nothing is done, compulsory labelling will enter into force on 1 September 2000.
The Commission is therefore urged to accept the European Parliament' s proposals in this codecision process by 1 September.
We have tried in our suit to ensure that no equally elegant attempt will be made to implement an extension on 1 September - and I hope that we shall succeed in putting a stop to this.
If we cannot agree on Parliament' s proposals by 1 September, then the old regulation with the compulsory system will enter into force.
I therefore hope that you will implement Parliament' s reasonable proposals and that you will give up your plan to postpone this once again until the year 2003.
It will confuse our citizens and will certainly meet with decisive resistance here in Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, consumers can be given a guaranteed indication of origin for the majority, I repeat the majority of foodstuffs and for beef in its many and varied forms, if they so wish.
The basis for this was and still is the passport for each individual animal which provides information on place, origin and birth.
Thanks to comprehensive controls of and the wealth of data on the animal trade, the place of origin and rearing can be proven.
What I mean is that we are not starting from square one and, as a producer of several tonnes of beef a year, I know what I am talking about.
The latest crisis in the foodstuffs sector may justify the introduction of stricter standards, as contained in the report; however, where possible, red tape should be reduced.
I agree with all the proposed amendments which are predicated upon greater promotion of regional marketing and processing of agricultural products and which help to build up regional markets and create greater transparency, irrespective of the date on which they are introduced.
Mr President, the people who will be most shocked to learn of this evening' s debate must surely be European consumers.
They will be astounded to learn that, so many years after the start of the BSE crisis, the European Union still does not have a reliable traceability system for beef.
Quite clearly, though, consumer confidence must be restored, as a matter of urgency, by guaranteeing the consumer perfect traceability from the stable to the table, so that any potential risk to human health can be efficiently eliminated at an early stage.
Fortunately, the appropriate initiatives by the most enterprising Member States have compensated for the extraordinarily slow reactions of the Community apparatus.
It is therefore all the more deplorable that they should have been deprived of this possibility by the Treaty of Amsterdam.
I am thinking in particular of the compulsory labelling system which was drawn up in France together with livestock farmers and distributors, which has been in force since 1996.
This system has proved very effective.
It has made it possible to restore consumer confidence.
France' s legitimate wish not to lift the embargo on British beef prematurely, since Britain did not offer the same guarantees of traceability, was in order to maintain this restored level of confidence.
France had simply forgotten that it no longer had the right to do this.
What a decidedly strange Europe it is that penalises Member States which take the necessary initiatives and action to restore consumer confidence and protect citizens' health!
If legal action can now only be taken at Community level, then let us at least act quickly and stop indefinitely postponing the implementation of the commitments made in 1997 with a view to providing the consumer with transparent and comprehensible information.
Compulsory labelling indicating the origin of goods must therefore be introduced as soon as possible, and it must certainly not be postponed until 1 January 2003, as the Commission proposes.
We must not agree to any exemptions, again as the Commission proposes, for minced and cut meat, which would be tantamount to excluding 30% to 50% of beef, according to the country, from the need for mandatory labelling.
Nor must we agree, as the Commission is once again proposing, to adopt an over-general EC-type generic designation of origin.
Consumers want to be certain of the operators' ability to monitor the origin of meat accurately.
The Member State of origin must therefore be indicated.
Furthermore, beef imported from third countries must be subject to the same labelling regulations as Community beef, and if it does not comply with European Union regulations on traceability, this must also be clearly indicated.
This, Mr President, is the intention of the amendments which Mrs Thomas-Moreau and I tabled on behalf of the UEN Group, which we are proposing to all our fellow Members who are keen to contribute to bringing about genuine traceability of beef.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fourteen years after BSE first appeared, we have finally got around to doing something about labelling meat in order to protect consumers and ensure traceability.
This protection is undoubtedly belated in principle but, above all, illusory in practice.
Firstly, in the draft regulation, 50% of European meat is effectively exempt from compulsory labelling if it is minced or cut.
For the remaining 50%, labelling is not compulsory until 2003, which means that we have three years to dispose of British surplus stocks.
And after 2003, the designation of origin may be limited to a simple indication of 'EC origin' with no mention of the country.
What is more, to bury the prion under even more details, the label is laden down with indications of: the place where the animal was born, fattened, slaughtered and boned, with the Member State of origin, the region of origin, the farm of origin, a total of twelve items, plus the price and the weight, making a total of fourteen items, which is simply too much to read and take in.
So, Mr Papayannakis is improving the system, the deadline for compulsory labelling has been brought forward from 2003 to 2001, since 2000 is out of the question; labelling is to be simplified, the national labelling systems mandatory in France, Belgium and Finland are to be retained.
This is a good move.
The amendments will be adopted.
The unwillingness of the Commission is, however, with apologies to the Commissioner, apparent to everyone.
As a solution, labelling is a good idea only at first sight.
Labelling is no safeguard against GMOs, chocolate containing vegetable fats or, tomorrow, GMO fats, or, at a later date, American hormone-treated beef, or prion-infected meat.
The only effective protection would be checks, and this requires States and frontiers.
We have, however, eliminated frontiers, and this is the price we have to pay for Europe: freedom of movement at the expense of safety.
I just hope, ladies and gentlemen, that no one will have to be punished in future.
Previously one could be punished at the stake, now punishment would mean a steak, a British beefsteak.
Mr President, this debate on the labelling of beef is closely akin to our previous concerns on the subject of food safety.
By means of this report and its conclusions, if they are adopted, we will be raising a number of concerns among consumers, in a very sensitive area where the mad cow syndrome is still predominant.
As far as the EDD Group is concerned, product traceability provides a guarantee both for the protection of consumer health and for the promotion of quality products which all producers, large or small, are capable of producing if they favour quality over base commercial and financial interests which have little regard for human health.
In our view the important and essential thing in this report is that all meat industry products should be covered by compulsory labelling, from basic butchered meat to derivatives, minced meat, cut meat, etc.
In the same way, the consumer must absolutely be provided with a complete set of information, with labelling which gives full details on the way the animal was reared and slaughtered: its place of birth, farming and slaughter, as well as feeding and farming techniques, not forgetting any antibiotics or growth promoters which may have been administered.
Finally, it is essential that these measures should be implemented as quickly as possible, since it is a matter of consumer rights.
Let us not delay, especially as this is no recent matter.
It is high time we took action.
Consumer confidence cannot be decreed, it must be earned.
To that end, as I already stated in our discussions on 5 October 1999, the CPNT party members within the EDD Group will therefore support any measure in support of complete traceability, which can only be of benefit to everyone concerned: the consumer, who will be informed, and the good producer, who will be protected.
Mr President, I wish to put firmly on the record tonight that the farmers in Northern Ireland are exceedingly angry at the UK Government for not seeking European funding to help promote beef labelling.
Other states have taken up this money to the tune of some Â£4m. the Irish Republic to the tune of Â£100 000 - yet the disgraceful attitude of the London Government is to keep this from the UK farmers.
I want also to say that the place of origin mentioned in any labelling system should be the real place of origin, because any idea of stating where meat is processed as the place of origin is not acceptable.
That is a very fundamental question that must be made perfectly clear in any law that we pass.
Any food labelling policy must be accurate and dependable for both the producers and the consumers.
Whatever may be the policy of this Union in regard to an open market economy, those people who want to buy home-produced meat should be given the right to know it is home-produced.
Farmers deserve to have a guarantee of that, and so should the consumers.
Mr President, the discussion on labelling beef has reached a point at which it is crucial to restore confidence among producers and consumers.
The report focuses on the traceability of beef, i.e. knowing its exact origins, but at the same time, this cannot be detached from consumer confidence, as consumers want information.
It strikes me that this Parliament insists on also making national labelling possible and obligatory, while the Commission places the emphasis on labelling which states "originates from the EU" .
I am convinced that one day, we will be proud again of a label which states: produced in the EU, and that we will have a food safety bureau in the European Union with a forceful, supranational mandate which can act promptly as and when problems arise. This must be our ultimate goal.
We will then be where we need to be.
Until such time, we need to be able to find out exactly what is happening, we need to be able to give the consumer sound information and until such time, we will need to use stop-gap measures to do this.
One of these measures is most definitely the use of a label indicating the Member State.
This is good, because in this way we can start restoring confidence in the producer, especially at a time when food safety is so much in the public eye.
We simply need this.
Another positive step is if it could also be pointed out that there can be a time when confidence will be restored.
In this sense, I have to say that my delegation and some in my group support Amendment No 61 tabled by Mr Maaten and Mr de Roo, in which the times are indicated when assurances can be given with regard to BSE inspections and other matters and which states that there can also be a time when the EU label will be applicable.
I consider this to be an interim step, and ultimately I can see one key goal: to restore confidence, to produce a forceful EU label and ultimately a forceful food safety bureau, because these discussions are interconnected.
Mr President, Commissioner, food safety gets people talking perhaps more than any other issue, and, for that reason, it is good that it also gets us talking here in Parliament.
But the most important consideration is that it does not just get us talking, but that we should also do something about it.
The work of Mr Papayannakis has already been praised here.
I would like to express my thanks too: it is a good basis for better standards of consumer safety throughout the European Union.
We have plenty of examples of consumers not having always been given priority when it comes to food production.
The Single Market and the free movement of goods provide more freedom of choice for the public and better markets for producers.
As the issue here is about food, it is even more important than ever to ensure that this freedom is also responsibly restricted, that consumers are protected, and that they have a right to know what they are eating.
In this case, it is especially important that meat and processed meat products are among those products whose origin the consumer knows.
Many have mentioned here that the EC label is not enough and that more precise information is needed.
I agree with this.
It is absolutely essential to know what country the products are from.
In addition, the origin, not only of meat products, but of the ingredients used in processed meat, must be shown as clearly as possible.
Labels must also be made compulsory as quickly as possible.
The timetable that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is proposing is not too pressing.
The Member States should have already prepared themselves for it.
Mr President, this regulation cannot be postponed any longer, and I fully support the stricter timetable that the European Parliament is proposing in the amendments to the Commission' s proposal.
Consumers require information about where the animal was born, bred and slaughtered, and cattle should be identified and registered so that their traceability can be guaranteed.
The Commission must be far more vigorous than it has been so far in putting the screws on those countries which have not established databases, so ensuring that the countries concerned become fully operational in this respect.
The issue is also one of credibility when it comes to implementing joint resolutions in all Member States.
It is also about citizens' confidence and belief that food quality is everything it should be.
A bit of drive needs to be shown, and no exceptions should be made in the case of cattle which graze in the mountains.
Where registration is required, what, in any case, is the difference between cattle which graze in the mountains and those which graze in valleys or in fields?
I am in favour of beef being labelled with the name of the country or countries it comes from and I am strongly against introducing a common EU label from which consumers cannot see which countries are involved.
The purpose of the regulation in question must be to achieve a situation in which consumers have confidence in meat from all EU countries.
Until this is a reality, consumers need to know precisely which country their meat comes from.
I have tabled an amendment to the effect that the slaughterhouse' s authorisation number should not be shown on the label.
In this way, I wished to ensure that small and medium-sized slaughterhouses could continue to supply meat to butchers.
The authorisation number does not provide the consumer with any useful information and has no bearing upon traceability.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking everyone who has worked so constructively on this report.
The compulsory registration system for bovine animals due to enter into force is the sine qua non for a reasonable beef labelling system.
As a farmer, I am concerned that every consumer should be able to trace where his schnitzel has come from.
All farmers are proud of the quality of their products and it is therefore in the farmers' interests for everyone to know whom they have to thank for their extremely safe and healthy food.
Such a system must be practicable if it is to achieve its objective.
We must take account of how the procedures will be applied in practice.
Because of the varying topography of Europe, its farmers must apply different working and production methods.
Take the example of summer pasturing in the Alps.
As you know, every spring a total of 400 000 cattle are driven on to the Alps in Italy, Austria and Germany, where they remain for the summer, i.e. for about three months.
Consideration must be given to the pasturing lists which are already in use and which take account of this situation in order to avoid forcing additional unnecessary administrative costs on farmers.
As we have said, traceability must be guaranteed in all cases.
But the regulation must be adapted to actual and local circumstances if it is to be seen as anything other than EU harassment, which merely triggers abuse and if it is to gain acceptance among the people.
I therefore hope that proposed Amendment No 19 to Article 7(1) second indent will be adopted by the entire House.
It has already been adopted by the Committee on the Environment and in the Committee on Agriculture.
Mr President, the discussion on labelling beef is quite loaded.
An important question is whether the "Origin: EU" label should be permitted as an added option.
The Commission thinks it should.
Many in Parliament believe that it is the country of origin that should be on the label.
The background to this is the food crises.
I could not agree more that beef should be completely traceable and that this should be the case as soon as possible.
I also understand that consumers increasingly want information on the country of origin or region of origin concerning their food.
This is often a matter of taste. Furthermore, I agree with the analysis that the "Origin: EU" label could be abused by countries where food safety is not regulated.
But I do not advocate scrapping the option of including "Origin: EU" on the label either.
In my opinion, we should choose another approach.
We need to prescribe conditions for the use of the "Origin: EU" label. One condition, for example, could be that the identification and registration system must be fully implemented and observed.
There are, of course, other means of enforcing compliance, but this method is far more direct.
Parliament has to keep an eye on compliance with the directives it produces.
This approach has the added advantage that the "Origin: EU" label has a positive ring to it.
Rather than being a cover-up for countries where food quality needs to be regulated, the "Origin: EU" label is thus a quality guarantee.
If the producer prefers to indicate the country of origin nonetheless, this is possible too.
There are a number of additional arguments as to why "Origin: EU" labelling should be possible.
For example, the meat industry and retail trade have raised all kinds of practical objections and pointed at the red tape which too detailed information would entail.
I will not spend any time on this argument, as it is not of key importance, in my opinion.
However, I would like to ask your attention for a question of principle.
The internal market is a large entity.
The principle of mutual recognition is fundamental.
Mutual recognition requires trust, and trust requires common standards, especially in the case of food safety.
If we prohibit the use of the "Origin: EU" label, we would be resigning ourselves to a kind of re-nationalisation of the internal market.
We would then be accepting that we have more confidence in certain countries than others and this is a sign of little faith in our own food safety policy.
This is unacceptable in my view.
All EU Member States need to guarantee safe meat.
"Origin: EU" is then a symbol for quality and I therefore advocate backing Amendments Nos 60 and 61.
Mr President, Commissioner, in my view, at present this is not a matter of confidence in the safety of food alone: it is very important that we also look to the near future.
We must put our own house, our own part of the world, in order.
The EU is expanding eastward, and we all know the capacity and volume of meat and beef production there, for example.
This should also alert them to the fact that they must now start to put their own affairs in order, so that they can adapt to the model that exists here.
If we are not ready, how can we expect others to be?
For this reason, labelling must be kept very simple: the labels must show the country of origin, and, if one wishes, the region of production.
But a label showing the country of origin of a product is very important to us, particularly if we want consumers to have confidence in food safety in the future.
Mr President, Commissioner, the beef industry has signed a contract with public opinion, based on the transparency claimed and, I might even say, demanded by the citizen.
Today, this transparency is applicable, within the beef industry, to two different but indissociable areas: BSE and labelling.
France is stepping up its precautionary measures for specified at-risk materials and is implementing an extensive protocol to evaluate ESB tests on bovine animals.
Tomorrow, the European Union is preparing to outline a test programme for all Member States.
In this context, consumers would not understand the delays in the matter of labelling.
I am therefore particularly concerned to ensure that the operators in this industry are not confronted with a legal vacuum which would lead public opinion, quite legitimately, to wonder whether there is a real desire for greater transparency.
How else is it possible to explain the fact that at European level we have managed to obtain an agreement on chocolate but that we are unable to meet the deadlines we set ourselves in an area as sensitive and important as beef.
Let us make no mistake as to what is at issue here.
I am convinced that the subject of beef labelling is no mere technical issue.
I should like to point out that if labelling is of such great importance to consumers it is because it is their guarantee that product traceability has been tightened up, that the operators in the industry and also the European and national public authorities have become more accountable, and that control systems have been improved.
Finally, what our fellow citizens are demanding is the right to information.
This right to be informed is the natural counterpart to the development of trade and the proper exercise of competition.
By virtue of the transparency it conveys, labelling makes it possible to improve the freedom of movement of beef, providing assurances to consumers and guaranteeing their freedom to make an informed choice.
In the beef sector, improving consumer information through labelling represents a strong message from Europe to its trading partners: it demonstrates its intention, over and above product health safety, to safeguard the consumer' s freedom of choice.
Mr President, I agree with the many speakers before me that what we need more than anything at the moment is a system which enables traceability at all stages of production.
Fortunately, integral chain control (ICC) is already well-known in many countries.
In my opinion, this is not related to national borders.
If certain conditions are met - and I would like to refer to Amendments Nos 60 and 61 concerning the inspection of BSE, as others have done so before me - then the designation "Origin: EU" is sufficient as far as I am concerned.
This does not preclude all the other information being added to the label on a voluntary basis.
Mentioning the relevant country, region, town, village, and so on and so forth, is fine but let the consumer decide where he wants to buy the product.
But it should not be an EU stipulation.
If this were to be the case, then this would be a re-nationalisation of Europe' s common market in a sense, and that would be a retrograde step.
Mr President, I am very disappointed at the delay, though I am delighted now that we are going to have clear compulsory labelling.
I hope this will restore consumer confidence in beef, especially after the BSE crisis.
I would like to see not only the country but also the region of origin on the label.
I represent the West Midlands which has some of the best beef in the world - Herefordshire beef and Shropshire beef.
I should like to see that go on the label.
I would oppose very strongly the idea that "EU" should be on the label and not the country and region of origin.
I am also concerned about some of the words that might go on the label.
One of those words is "slaughtered".
That will not help with consumer confidence and might put some of the consumers off if they actually see where the animal was "slaughtered".
I wish we could find a new word for it.
Generally speaking, I am delighted that at last we are going to have clear labelling and, as I said, I want it to be the country and region of origin.
Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I welcome the report.
A European Union-wide identification system for cattle is long overdue.
The system is certainly very necessary, if nothing else than to achieve a level playing field within the European Union and to ensure that all countries reach the same standards.
I want to sound a note of caution.
I come from an area in Northern Ireland that has a standard of identification and traceability which is as good as any ever will be.
No system is a hundred per cent perfect, so do not think you can bring that about.
There will always be people out to abuse the system.
That has been the case for centuries - and will continue.
You can only try to develop the best possible system of traceability.
I have a number of concerns.
The first is: who pays?
The problem to date has been, in my experience in Northern Ireland, that the consumer has borne the brunt of the cost of the extra traceability, and this has been substantial.
It has not been borne by the retailer.
The consumer will perhaps ultimately pay - but he or she may not.
From that point of view it is expensive for those people.
I have one further question of the Commission.
Is it wise to renationalise the beef market? Or even to regionalise it within countries.
I seriously question that point.
We have fought for years within the European Union to achieve a single market and now we are renationalising that market.
I challenge the Commission tonight to answer that question.
Is this a wise move?
Let us not look to the short term, let us look to the long term, because the long term is the challenge - not five years but ten, fifteen years from now.
What is going to be the situation on the beef market?
As I said, in Northern Ireland we have full traceability and our measures go beyond the regulations.
I have to say to the Commission, and to producers in other Member States, that my producers have to date not seen any financial benefit from that which they have suffered.
The proposal, as Mr Goodwill has said, has two important aims.
First to ensure the traceability of beef, second to allow consumers to make a fully informed choice.
Unfortunately, although the two aims are compatible, there is some tension between them where the details of the regulation are concerned.
This is particularly the case in relation to Article 13 and Article 13(2) primarily serving the first and Article 13(5) the second aim.
Amendments Nos 26 and 28 to 13(5) therefore seemed rather confused - one seeking less and one seeking more detailed information for consumers.
For this reason, whatever the final form of Article 13, I regard Amendments Nos 15 and 29 as being of the first importance.
Amendment 29 in particular will allow areas of the EU that are justifiably proud of the quality of their product to identify it as such.
For my own constituency of course, Aberdeen Angus beef is already justly renowned throughout the world but I am sure the same is true for other regions in the rest of the UK and other Member States.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Papayannakis, and Mr Kindermann, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture, for their constructive contributions to the debate on the draft regulation under discussion.
A whole series of amendments to the Commission proposal have been tabled, 44 of which were accepted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on 22 March.
A further 18 proposed amendments were subsequently submitted for this plenary sitting.
I should like to start with the Commission' s views on the first 44 proposals.
The Commission is able to accept 18 of them.
This includes proposed amendments which are accepted in full or in part and amendments which require minor editorial changes.
In another 12 proposed amendments I can see what your concerns are but the Commission is unable to accept these amendments.
However, I shall ensure that the Council is informed of your point of view.
This applies, for example, to proposed Amendment No 20.
A number of the proposed amendments which the Commission is able to accept, such as Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 18 and 19 first part, and 21, 33, 35 and 42 tighten up the wording.
I also accept proposed Amendment No 19, second part, which makes provision for a simplification for cattle pastured on the Alps in the summer. The improvements to the definition of labelling are also acceptable.
The same applies to the information to be included on the label and to the interpretation of the concept of origin.
I am therefore prepared to accept proposed Amendments Nos 22 and 23, insofar as they concern labelling, and the parts of proposed Amendments Nos 25, 26 and 28 calling for information on individual regions to be scrapped.
As we are all concerned that the labelling system should be introduced as quickly as possible, I welcome proposed Amendment No 39 reducing the deadline set for the Member States to appoint the competent authorities.
Finally, proposed Amendment No 44, under which the regulation would enter into force on 1 September 2000 heads in exactly the same direction.
I think the new recital suggested in proposed Amendment No 6, whereby Member States must ensure that their databases are operational as quickly as possible, is also a good idea.
I am also able to accept the parts of proposed Amendments Nos 25, 26 and 28 making information on the region optional, whereby I assume, if no decision is made to the contrary, that this information will come under the voluntary system.
As I too take the view that the possibility of confusion with protected geographical indications governed by Regulation 2081/92 must be excluded, I agree unreservedly with the new recital in proposed Amendment No 15.
Nonetheless, we must still investigate how the stated objective is to be reached, whereby I envisage a more comprehensive solution than that suggested in proposed Amendment No 29.
The question of when compulsory indications of origin need to be introduced is an important point.
As the obligation to enter the place of birth and all stopovers in the animal passport and database has only been introduced for animals born on or after 1 January 1998, it will be difficult to trace the complete origin of bovine animals over the next five years.
According to our calculations, this problem will apply to just under half the beef produced from 2003 onwards, which is why I have reservations about introducing compulsory indications of origin earlier or even, as suggested in proposed Amendment No 26, as early as 1 September 2001.
I would point out in this respect that the Committee on Agriculture has recommended that they be introduced on 1 January 2002.
I also note that you insist that indications of origin must state the country, even if this means listing several countries on the label.
I am sorry that you find the simplified indication "Produced in the European Union" unacceptable, despite the fact that it is in keeping with the principles of the internal market.
As far as labelling of minced meat is concerned, we must bear in mind that the production of minced meat, for example of hamburgers, is a continuous process.
The obligation to provide a complete indication of origin for this meat would therefore give rise to technical problems and may well bring the entire intra-Community trade in processed meat to a virtual standstill.
I would therefore suggest that you reconsider the simplified labelling system.
The proposed labelling regulation makes provision for the possibility of combining animals in groups rather than entering each individual animal with producers who take the trouble to guarantee the traceability of each individual animal given an incentive in the form of a special logo.
I must admit that I do not fully understand why you demand in proposed Amendments Nos 14 and 31 that we should let go of the only instrument which guarantees real and complete traceability.
As far as the Commission' s powers to react to unusual and unforeseen circumstances are concerned, I am, unfortunately, unable to accept proposed Amendments Nos 16 and 38 because they prevent a practicable solution.
Finally, I think it is premature to commit ourselves to extending the labelling system to processed products containing beef, as suggested in proposed Amendment No 40.
Let us gain some experience with the system being proposed now and then we can consider this idea at a later date.
As far as the proposed amendments tabled subsequently at the end of last week are concerned, I have already explained in connection with proposed Amendments Nos 45 and 46 that the Commission agrees with you that the first stage of the compulsory system should start on 1 September this year.
If proposed Amendment No 44 is accepted, the regulation automatically enters into force on this date.
Proposed Amendments Nos 45 and 46 are therefore superfluous for technical reasons.
As far as proposed Amendment No 47 is concerned, I should like to advise against continuing the national compulsory beef identification system as soon as the full EU system has been introduced.
In the end we would have 15 different national systems, which runs completely counter to the internal market.
Proposed Amendment No 48 refers to information on the use of antibiotics or stimulants and to fattening methods.
This idea may look simple on paper, but it is in fact extremely complicated to administer and, more importantly, to control.
In addition, there is no definition of the various rearing methods and every animal will certainly be fed using various methods, rather than one and the same method, during its lifetime.
As far as medication is concerned, it would be much better to maintain our high veterinary standards, thereby guaranteeing that only safe beef reaches the market.
The Commission would therefore prefer not to adopt this proposal.
As far as the voluntary system is concerned, which is to be set up alongside the new compulsory system in order to include all the information which is not being made compulsory, the Commission can accept two of the four amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, namely proposals 33 and 35.
It is obvious from the vote in committee that Parliament is not in favour of amending the Commission' s basic attempt to simplify the approval procedure.
However, I see that a total of nine new proposed amendments have been tabled for this plenary sitting which were not adopted by the Committee on the Environment.
These amendments seek to re-introduce a formal approval procedure for voluntary information on labels.
Let me assure you that such amendments do not cause any particular problem because their purpose is to reinforce the administrative procedure.
For the rest, recent discussions in the Council have gone in the same direction.
I am therefore convinced that these proposed amendments will be taken on board by the Council.
From now on, the Commission will be acting as go-between between the two decision-making institutions on this matter.
With just over three months, we do not have much time left for a final decision.
Given the speed with which you have worked here in Parliament, hopefully the Council will decide on its common position as quickly as possible.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mrs Ludford, are you sure your point of order is related to the Minutes?
Madam President, I signalled I wanted to raise a point of order, although it is not actually on the Minutes.
I do not want to delay the House unduly, but I think that as we prepare to debate the construction of Europe, it is important to take note of a landmark court judgement in the UK.
The so-called historian, David Irving, has lost his libel case against the American academic, Deborah Lipstadt, who accused him of manipulating evidence to deny the Nazi genocide of the Jews.
The judge has ruled, in a devastating judgement, that he was "an active Holocaust denier, anti-Semitic and racist and that he associates with right-wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism" .
This judgement is important, not just for Europe' s past, but also for its present.
With the rise in racism and anti-Semitism and the electoral success of extremist parties, this judgement boosts the fight to make Europe a society free of racism and at ease with diversity.
Thank you, Mrs Ludford.
I am happy to take note of your point of order.
But for the time being I would like comments to relate to the Minutes, so that we can adopt them.
After that Members are free to move any other points of order.
Madam President, item 2 of the Minutes on page 5, which is in fact the first substantive page, refers to the points I raised about certain political groups apparently not respecting the Rules of Procedure in that they appear to allow individual members of their group to table amendments in plenary, supposedly in the name of the group, although this cannot possibly be the case because contradictory amendments are tabled in the name of the same group.
I would like to underline that although the Minutes mentioned specifically the EPP Group, it is in fact not the only group to have acted in this way.
For instance, the Technical Group, the TDI Group, which did not table any amendments at committee stage whatsoever, has now arrived in plenary with between 20 and 30 amendments, many of which are contradictory.
They are tabled by different members within that group taking different positions and therefore cannot possibly be a group position.
That does not respect our own Rules of Procedure, which allow only 32 members or a group to table amendments in plenary.
Madam President, my point concerns the section of the Minutes on Question Time yesterday evening, when I raised a point of order.
First of all, Question Time was put back to 6:30 p.m., then it was announced on the screen that it would begin at 6:50 p.m.
In the end it was after 7:00 p.m. before Question Time started.
The first part was supposed to last 30 minutes, according to the Agenda; but it lasted much longer.
Basically, my problem is that I had questions down - as some other people did - to Commissioner Byrne.
We had group meetings at the time and saw on the screen "Question 41" .
But by the time I reached the plenary, you had moved on automatically within a few minutes to Question 49.
So five or six people had questions down to Commissioner Byrne, but none of us were here to ask the questions.
Commissioner Byrne seems to have taken offence at this and seen it as some kind of snub.
But it is very difficult for Members to sit right through every single question during Question Time just in case we jump from No 1 to No 99 in a matter of seconds.
So, could we please stick to the Agenda: thirty minutes for the first part of Question Time, twenty for the second part and so on. We should not keep changing the Agenda because then it is extremely difficult for us to operate.
Thank you, Mrs McKenna.
I take note of your comment and will ensure this does not happen again.
Madam President, in recent days, immense natural catastrophes in which quite a number of people have died have again occurred on the banks of the River Tisza.
I would therefore ask the President to send our condolences to both the Romanian and Hungarian parliaments.
At the same time, we must be alert to the kind of environmental risks these natural catastrophes may entail for our common European environment.
The Tisza flows into the Danube delta, which is one of the world' s most significant protected areas of environmental interest.
Thank you, Mrs Thors, I am quite prepared to do so.
Madam President, with rather more levity.
Last night in the Committee on Budgets when the refreshments were being distributed, Mr Colom pointed out that the small cartons of milk were marked "for distribution in schools only" .
Had it said "for schoolchildren only" one could understand why it was being distributed in the European Parliament, but it was marked "for schools only" .
Could we find out why this has happened?
It is so embarrassing.
I know we campaigned for more school milk but, on this occasion, we did not want it here.
Thank you, Mr Wynn, I cannot answer you right now, but I will have the matter investigated.
Madam President, I wish to inform you and the Members who come into daily contact, although sometimes without noticing them, with the Parliament staff who ensure the running of the House as a whole, that certain sections (security guards, receptionists, firemen) were on strike yesterday afternoon.
They were protesting at having to work 12 hours at a stretch, day and night, for an average net salary of FRF 6 000, without even receiving extra pay for night or weekend work.
I want to express my solidarity with them. Moreover, we have written you a letter, Madam President, on behalf of the LO and LCR Members, and hope you will follow the matter up.
Thank you, Mrs Laguiller.
I will give the letter my utmost attention.
Madam President, I have been listening to the translations of the speeches on my headphones for a long time now, and the sound disappears sometimes, even if I change places, and I also get a rasping noise, not only here but also in our Group' s room.
There is some technical fault here, and I wish the relevant people would check whether there is too much interference here, owing to mobile phones, for example.
Even the position of my head affects audibility, and I cannot really sit here listening with my head tilted to one side.
The other request I have is for a technician to adjust the sound volume here.
Some Members shout into the microphone, even though the microphone is, in fact, there to make shouting unnecessary, thereby making it impossible to hear anything over the headphones.
So whenever someone shouts into the microphone - even though they should not - I would ask that the sound volume in the Chamber be lowered immediately, so that we can also hear what is being said over the headphones.
Thank you, Mr Paasilinna, we will look into all that and check the sound system in general.
(The Minutes were approved)
IGC
The next item is the report (A5-0086/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the European Parliament' s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference (14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)).
First of all I must inform the House that the Union for Europe of the Nations Group has moved the report' s inadmissibility, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure.
Let me point out that the Council consulted Parliament on convening the Intergovernmental Conference and that the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen was entered on the agenda in accordance with the appropriate Rules.
Mr Ribeiro e Castro will present the motion.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report should not have been admitted.
It is generally anti what Europe really represents and anti most of what Europe has achieved.
Paragraph 15 of the motion for a resolution is a symptom of this aggressiveness towards Europe.
We are all attached to fundamental rights and the rule of law, starting here in this House.
So how can we agree when the fundamental right of recourse to the courts is being threatened?
This is not a question of internal affairs, but external affairs of great importance.
We are Members of this House and we represent our electors.
Anything which discriminates in our legal and political conditions, between our political parties and groups in terms of freedom and equality affects our right of representation and ultimately the rights and very freedom of our electors.
These are the elements particularly under threat in this report which wants to interfere with and discriminate between the statutes of the political parties.
The very essence of Europe is under threat.
The fundamental right of recourse to the courts cannot be altered by anyone and nor can the rule of law.
Paragraph 15 ruins the whole text by defiling a very serious issue.
The temptation for those in power to act arbitrarily which this paragraph encourages is a clear illustration of the position taken in the rest of the report, and a terrible omen.
We therefore move the inadmissibility of this report which, in addition to having a dubious legal basis, was not properly prepared and does not enjoy the broad consensus which Europe must have.
This is evident in both the injudiciousness of this regrettable paragraph and the fact that 222, I repeat 222, amendments were tabled on this report.
Is there any better proof that this report is totally inappropriate?
We therefore propose, in order to defend Europe and the rule of law, the immediate rejection of this report.
Thank you, Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
Does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request for referral back to committee?
Madam President, I think Mr Ribeiro e Castro is quite right to consider the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report inadmissible because it conflicts with and even infringes a number of rights enshrined in our institutions.
First of all, Mr Ribeiro e Castro is right to single out paragraph 15, which states that 'no actions may be brought in connection with the interna corporis affairs of the European Parliament.'
That statement clearly infringes the fundamental right of every citizen, and thus also of Members, to bring an action.
But more generally I believe this report infringes a whole range of different rights, beginning with the rights of the small and medium-sized states which have formed an integral part of our institutions and been highly respected by them since the early days of the Treaty of Rome.
Thank you, Mr Berthu.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, the two rapporteurs, wish to speak against this motion.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, however much I respect the opinion of the Members who have just spoken, I find it harsh and unjust to regard our report as inadmissible because of paragraph 15.
Other colleagues have tabled amendments with a view to voting against that paragraph, and Members may agree with those amendments.
To agree or not agree with a paragraph in a report is justified and democratic, and that is what we are here for.
But I do not think it is right to move that a report is inadmissible because of one paragraph.
I call on Members to vote against this motion.
We must examine and vote on the report during this part-session, because it is not a matter of voting for the two rapporteurs but of voting for the European Parliament' s opinion.
Madam President, I am delighted that of all the groups, it is the UEN Group that is standing up for more fundamental rights and more democracy at European Union level.
I am pleased about that; it is a major step forward.
However, I also believe that the strong language my fellow delegates are using is completely uncalled for.
The EU countries have completely different cultures.
In some countries Parliament can draw up its own rules of procedure and one does not have the option of going to the court of justice.
Some countries have a different system.
We have recital 15.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has already mentioned that there are amendments.
The UEN Group are welcome to vote against them and then we will see if it is left in or taken out.
All in all, I believe that there is no call for excessively strong language, and I am also in favour of us rejecting this amendment.
Madam President, I do not think this amendment is something we can vote on, as the Treaty of Amsterdam makes express provision for the relationship between the institutions and the procedures to be framed differently.
In this respect, this report forms part of the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and one cannot vote on erroneous, legal proposed amendments, one can only reject them!
(Laughter and applause)
If you feel duty-bound to reject it, you will have an opportunity to do so.
I shall now put the motion presented by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group to the vote by roll call.
(Parliament rejected the procedural motion)
Madam President, Minister, Deputy Minister, Commissioner, we are at a really very important juncture so far as the vocation of the European Union is concerned.
Today, through the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference, the European Union is being called upon to address the great challenges involved in the transition from the 20th to the 21st century, challenges we all recognise, which are important, which influence the course of the European Union every day, and challenges which, above all, raise a fundamental issue: how ready are we, as an institution, as the European Union, to face them?
The Intergovernmental Conference attempts to answer just that question.
It is common ground that in the face of all those challenges, the way the European Union functions at present is certainly in need of some changes, changes whose important aim will be the future progress of the European Union on the basis of what we have all accepted until now.
The report you have before you today is significant in that it covers the following points.
The first point is once again to consolidate the institutional nature of the European Union.
We repeat and insist that the European Union is both a union of states and a union of peoples.
It is precisely our acceptance of that principle which has guided the European Union towards the many successes we can mention, and which, of course, we all like to refer to from time to time.
The second point is to reconfirm and consolidate another important principle, the principle of a balance of powers, a principle that relates precisely to the role and relationship of those who participate in the European Union, a principle expressed by the way all the Member States express themselves in all - I repeat, all - the European Union' s institutional bodies.
And as you know, the European Union has got to where it is today, achieved what it has achieved, precisely because it has been and is functioning on the basis of a balance of powers as agreed and commonly accepted.
The third basic principle safeguarded in the report is the proposal for a general - and I stress the word general - review of all the institutional bodies that make up the European Union.
For some, perhaps, that may be a risky proposal.
However, I must stress that it is necessary and essential, particularly since we all agree that over and above all, the current reconsideration of how the European Union works is directly linked to the great challenge presented by the European Union' s enlargement.
It is only natural, when already in a Europe with 15 Member States we find and all agree that some things do not work quite so well and must be put right, that this will be all the more necessary when we it concerns a European Union with 18, 20, 25 and 27 Member States.
The fourth point concerns a number of new proposals, despite the fact that the issues to which they relate had always been debated.
I refer very specifically to closer cooperation.
Closer cooperation, at least as we view it, must comprise two main elements.
Firstly, it must be an incentive and not an obstacle - I stress: not an obstacle - it must be an incentive for all the Member States to participate more and in greater depth in the European procedures.
Secondly, it must contain a very highly developed element of democratic awareness, which means that if any country or countries for some reason do not wish to participate, at least during a first phase, this should not be regarded as an exclusion or as a factor that restricts the presence of those countries in the European Union.
We have taken a great many steps and we certainly can point to two examples of closer cooperation. The Schengen Agreement, and Economic and Monetary Union itself.
I would also like to see closer cooperation in foreign policy issues and others as well.
To put it clearly, closer cooperation is a Community process and both foreign policy and common defence policy issues should be dealt with as a Community process, because it provides control mechanisms.
I would like to close by expressing my thanks to the Portuguese Presidency and in particular to Mr da Costa for his cooperation, to Commissioner Barnier, to you and all our colleagues, and of course, to my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen, with whom we worked hard but very well. I would also like to thank the members of Parliament' s Secretariat who assisted us and the interpreters, who on very many occasions worked long hours to enable the difficult negotiations you all know about to take place.
Madam President, I am sure it will come as no surprise to you if I talk about citizens' freedoms and rights and justice in relation to this fascinating report, whose two rapporteurs I congratulate.
It is the view of this Committee that the construction of this area of justice is important and, to this end, a reform of the Court of Justice is necessary.
In order to reform the Court it will be necessary to amend the Treaty, so that the Statute and the Regulations of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance become operative.
None of them is currently operative.
Our first demand is therefore that qualified majority be established with the assent of the European Parliament.
With regard to the Court, Parliament also asks to be able to participate in the process of selecting judges as already happens with the posts in the constitutional courts in our states.
On the other hand, with regard to freedoms and rights, we want citizens to be provided with full rights to appeal so that they can be assured that Community legislation will be enforced in the event of violations of fundamental rights. This is not currently the case.
We want to see a reform of Articles 230 and 300 of the Treaty so that Parliament is on an equal footing with the Commission and the Council as far as appeals are concerned.
Lastly, Madam President, we want to see a reform of the Treaty so that Parliament, in relation to the third pillar, also has full access to justice by means of repeal in the event of regulations and acts which do not conform.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Court of Justice needs to be properly armed in order to be able to cope with the growing number of disputes, as well as its ever expanding authority.
The Court must be able to focus on the real legal issues and legal protection of EU subjects.
The Court of First Instance must be better accommodated in this framework, and both jurisdictions must be able to take more autonomous decisions regarding their own structures and procedures.
Sound and timely administration of justice is a vital component of the constitutional state.
In the light of this, the role of the European Parliament should be upgraded to that of a fully-fledged legislative body and that of a fully-fledged European institution.
These are, in a nutshell, the motives underlying the opinion issued by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
As rapporteur, I am also delighted to note that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is on the same wavelength for the greater part of its principal report.
Unfortunately, time constraints prevent me from going into any detail.
But in order to bring the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs as far as possible into line with the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I tabled four more amendments in the plenary meeting.
As some of these amendments are also to be found in the opinions of other committees, I believe that these amendments deserve - and will probably receive - the support of the entire Parliament.
This is where I would like to conclude my brief report on a not unimportant contribution to what will probably be the last IGC before the largest, most historic and most risky enlargement since the inception of the present European integration process.
This is why we need to seize this opportunity with both hands to prepare the European Union, with all its institutions and in all fields, to face the challenges of the 21st century successfully.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
(ES) Madam President, the conditions of my intervention in this plenary session are illustrative of the budgetary problem.
I have just hurried from a meeting which, according to the Treaty, does not exist.
I am participating, on behalf of Parliament, in the tripartite dialogue on the budget to set the budgetary guidelines.
This is precisely the point we have raised on behalf of the Committee on Budgets.
It is the adaptation of the Treaty, Article 272 in particular, to the real situation.
We have spent twelve years practising with a timetable set by the interinstitutional agreements.
We have renewed them three times, and we believe that the time has come to include the fundamental principles in the Treaty so that we will not find ourselves in legally dubious situations, such as the case of the meeting which I have just mentioned.
Specifically, we must simplify the procedure in order to prevent the blocking of the budgetary procedure.
When there are 25 members, the current procedure will not work.
We should simplify it while respecting the existing balances of power.
Lastly, Madam President, we also believe that Parliament, as an institution embodying democratic legitimacy, must fully participate in the decisions on own resources.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs on their report and I would also like to thank them for the pleasant cooperation.
I would like to raise two points.
Firstly, my Committee is of the opinion that in the field of trade policy, the European Community' s authority and also, therefore, the European Commission' s negotiating mandate must be reinforced.
So too, however, must be the role of Parliament.
This can be done a) by introducing codecision for the common trade policy, b) by introducing an assent procedure for all external agreements and c) by according Parliament a greater role in approving and monitoring trade negotiations.
My second point concerns energy.
The Commission has concluded that a coherent European energy policy has been lacking in the past.
There are no clear guidelines on institutional mechanisms for defining a common energy policy, let alone cooperation to guarantee the supply of energy or in terms of the environmental aspects of energy policy.
With a view to sustainable development, a new chapter on energy policy must be included in the Treaty, as well as the relevant sections of the ECSC and EURATOM Treaties.
In addition, the European Parliament powers must be adequately enhanced.
This means that the codecision procedure needs to apply to the EURATOM Treaty too.
It will specifically need to apply to the drafting of minimum safety standards for the design, construction and operation of nuclear reactors within the Union.
So far, the Member States have had their own technical standards and regulations.
In the light of Central and Eastern countries joining the EU, it is vital that uniform, European safety standards for nuclear reactors be drafted.
Unfortunately, my proposal to this effect has not been included in the current report.
I would therefore urge you most emphatically to vote for Amendment No 60 which I have tabled on behalf of my group, so that uniform safety standards can be drawn up for nuclear reactors.
We owe this to our citizens.

Madam President I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs warmly on their report, both in general terms and in specific terms because I believe that they have managed to address the points which we have raised in our opinion, albeit not always literally, within the confines of this reasonably concise report, which I hope will be adopted in this meeting by a large majority.
It is very important to mention the social market economy, as already indicated by Mr von Wogau.
It provides a kind of framework for internal policy which we need and renders a whole raft of discussions redundant.
I believe that this results in satisfaction all round.
The second major point is the Union' s legal personality.
It has been formulated here as if it were only related to foreign policy but it also has enormous significance for internal policy.
Indeed, it then becomes possible to ratify a number of Treaties, such as ILO Treaties and some UN Treaties in the social field, which will add legal clarity to this type of issue.
There are nonetheless two points that are lacking.
One of them is the issue of Article 137(6) which, in my opinion, should be repealed.
There are also a number of amendments on the table which I hope will yet be added.
I would like to finish off with a remark on the issue of the tax policy.
The report, in fact, mentions very little about this.
The tax policy, which also includes social security policy, is nonetheless of great importance, and not only to the Member States. The Commission too has given the matter rather a lot of attention and has devoted a great deal of thought to it.
It is rather a pity, in my opinion, that we talk about it so little.
Maybe we will do so in future.
The policy is implicitly included in the report but I still think that, in a sense, not dealing with it now is a missed opportunity.
That does not, however, detract from the deep appreciation which we have for this report.
Madam President, the proposals by the Committee on Women' s Rights for the Intergovernmental Conference aim to enhance democracy and effectiveness.
It is a fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam was a major step forward for women' s rights, since it provides a firm base for an effective policy on equality, but unfortunately it does not go further than the professional sector.
For that reason we are proposing that the Treaty should include a uniform and cohesive legal base for equality between the sexes, which will include all policy sectors.
We declare that balanced participation of women and men in decision-making at every level is a prerequisite for democracy and social justice, and we are therefore asking for the related articles of the Treaties to be amended to take account of that principle in the composition of the Commission, the European Parliament, the Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
We also stress the need for a close link between the Intergovernmental Conference and the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, so that within the scope of the constitutionalisation of the Union, the fundamental right of equality between women and men will be enshrined in Community law.
So besides the essential equilibrium and cohesion that must be secured between the Union' s large and small countries and between the more and less developed areas and population groups, it is also necessary to take into account the balance between the sexes in planning the future of the EU and in decision making.
- (PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the work in the Intergovernmental Conference has been intensive.
This time the European Parliament' s participation has been reinforced through your President and two other representatives and also through full dialogue between the Council presidency and your Committee on Constitutional Affairs. This reinforcement also stems from the direct information of this House and its debate in plenary, which have no precedents.
This is very encouraging for the future results of the IGC.
So far five main in-depth meetings of the preparatory group have been held, together with three meetings of the IGC itself.
Also planned are all the events in the calendar up to the end of Portugal' s presidency, involving both the IGC and the preparatory group. A report is also to be prepared which will be submitted to the Feira European Council.
The Council presidency considers that this report should not be purely theoretical but should also make practical proposals. It must enable the next holder of the Council presidency, which will be France, to continue developing this work and to reach a decision by the end of the year.
The issue tackled at the last IGC meeting was the question of extending qualified majority voting.
The Member States demonstrated a certain openness towards this but many have still not made a definitive decision.
Certain areas can already be identified on which the attitude of the large majority of Member States is that these should remain subject to the unanimity rule.
Debates on these issues reveal that there is actually significant reticence, although this may be overcome during the IGC.
The preparatory work carried out to date has also involved questions connected with the European Parliament, the courts, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee.
As regards the decision-making procedure in the European Parliament, there is broad consensus that no revision of the Treaty should be effected which involves changing the existing institutional balance.
As for the scope of codecision, there is some openness towards extending this procedure to all legislative acts adopted by qualified majority without, however, establishing any kind of systematic correlation.
With regard to the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, a group of friends of the Council presidency has been brought together to examine possible amendments to the Treaty relating to these two courts.
The study of possible amendments to the Treaty in respect of the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions has also been started.
Many consider that changes should only be made where strictly necessary to ensure the effective functioning of the European Union after enlargement.
Consideration has also been given to matters which may be included on the agenda of the IGC, on the Council presidency' s proposal.
It should be recalled that the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council specify that the Council presidency will submit a report to the European Council and may propose in this report the insertion of new items on the IGC' s agenda.
In the area of security and defence and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Council presidency considers that, depending on the progress of the work, the right should be reserved to propose to the Feira European Council next June the inclusion in the IGC of any adjustments or additions to the Treaties which may prove necessary in these areas.
With regard to other issues likely to be added to the IGC' s work, an initial debate has been held based on a list drawn up by the Council presidency.
The argument put forward in favour of a prudent approach to the inclusion of new items on the agenda concerned the risk, inherent in the technical complexity of this debate, of causing the deadline of this December for the completion of the IGC' s work to be missed.
On the issue of the size and composition of the Commission, there is a consensus that the Commission to emerge from this IGC must be strong, independent and legitimate. Its collegiate nature must be preserved.
However, there is clear disagreement between, on one hand, the small and medium-sized Member States which want a Commission composed of one national from each Member State, all with equal status, and, on the other, the large Member States which favour a fixed number of Commissioners regardless of the number of Member States.
The size of the Commission is the main point of disagreement between the delegations. The rest of the debate on the Commission is dependent on this issue as some directly link this question with their positions on the composition, internal organisation and structure of this Community institution.
With regard to the individual responsibility of Commissioners, there is general support for keeping the undertaking currently made by each Commissioner to stand down when asked to do so by the Commission President.
The delegations are divided into those which want to keep the informality of this undertaking and those which want the process to be enshrined in the Treaty.
As for the Commission' s collective responsibility as a college, there is some reluctance to accept alterations to the current institutional framework, with the current supervision exercised by the European Parliament being regarded as sufficient.
The idea submitted by this House of the Commission being able to request a vote of confidence in it was positively welcomed.
On the issue of the weighting of votes in Council, there is consensus that the criterion which should be used as the basis for qualified majority voting in Council must stem from the combination of the two elements which form the foundations of the European Union.
These are the population and the existence of sovereign states.
The EU is just as much a union of peoples as it is of states.
As for specific mechanisms to be established for the future system, there is also a split between those who defend a double-majority system and those who prefer simple reweighting.
One recurring argument is that the reform should be acceptable to public opinion and likely to be ratified by the national parliaments. This is a common concern of all the Member States, whether large or small, not only due to the need, in ratifying the new Treaty, to enable enlargement and respect for its timetables, but also due to the feeling that a European crisis should not be allowed to occur on this type of reform.
There is also the idea that these reforms must be submitted to public opinion in the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe so that the impression is not given that these are reforms which must be rushed through, not to improve the European Union but to prevent the new Member States from having access to the EU' s decision-making system.
With regard to closer cooperation, the need or the usefulness for the IGC to tackle this issue was also discussed in an informal debate.
Again there was a division of opinion both about the possibility of this issue being discussed and about the scope and nature of any alterations.
The next informal meeting of the Representatives Group on 14 and 15 April in Sintra, Portugal, will deal specifically with this issue which is problematic as there are no examples to follow.
There are no specific examples as the Treaty of Amsterdam already allows closer cooperation and so far no Member State has used this instrument and there are no theoretical examples as these are never put forward by the debaters. Although this issue comes up time and again, it is very abstract.
In terms of the substance of the issue and the introduction of closer cooperation into the Second Pillar, an informal debate has revealed that the majority regard this as unnecessary in external or common security policy, although the possibility of its use in the area of security and defence may be considered.
This means that if closer cooperation were included within the Second Pillar, it would then be necessary to find a specific way of implementing this concept in this area. This could not copy the First Pillar given the dissimilarity between the operation of these two pillars.
With regard to making the existing model more flexible, as supported in particular by the Commission, a certain openness has been detected towards eliminating the recourse to the European Council when launching closer cooperation. However, the limit of eight Member States has been questioned even by those who support altering the requirement for the participation of the majority of Member States.
As you can see, the Portuguese Presidency is continuing to make every effort to take the work forward in order to achieve a comprehensive and balanced agreement which is acceptable to everyone by the specified deadline.
Close contact has been maintained with the Commission and the European Parliament.
In the latter case, this has been through both the participation of your President and two selected Members and the regular information provided to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and this House. This is ensuring that this institutional reform work is carried out with a much higher degree of participation by the European Parliament than the previous revision of the Treaty.
This augurs well for the success of our work.
Mr President, with the Dimitrakopoulos - Leinen report under discussion, the European Parliament is declaring its great vision for the European Union of the future.
This is a truly historic moment, as has been stressed.
Our fellow-citizens are waiting to be told what we are going to demand from the Intergovernmental Conference for that future.
Institutional proposals on particular issues without prior clarification of the basic philosophy of tomorrow' s Union of 27 are not convincing.
The draft resolution is therefore quite right to define that basic view in the form of three principles.
According to the draft, the European Union is, first and foremost, a Union of peoples and a Union of states.
Its citizens therefore have both a European and a national identity.
Secondly, it is based on an institutional equilibrium between large and small states.
That must not be just on paper.
Thirdly, the way the Union functions must be made more effective, so that it can cope with the major enlargement.
The above philosophical principles, to which the draft resolution remains faithful, are not metaphysical inventions of the European Parliament but arise from the history and from the political reality which we call the area of Europe.
Anyone who ignores that is building a Europe founded on sand.
The Intergovernmental Conference of 2000 is taking place to make the Union as effective as is required in view of the major enlargement that has been decided.
In this process Parliament' s responsibility is very great indeed.
For that reason, Parliament' s approval of enlargement cannot but depend on the adequacy of the institutional changes that will be decided.
That is not a threat, it is a declaration of responsible attitude.
In good faith, all sides are trying, by means of amendments, to make the way in which European Union functions more effective.
But is it enough for procedures to be simplified and speeded up for them to be described as effective?
The effectiveness of a police service, which indeed demands both simplicity and speed, is quite different from the effectiveness of the fundamental institutions of a democratic public regime.
The effectiveness of democratic institutions is not measured either with a stopwatch, or according to the number of decisions taken.
It is measured by the degree of legitimacy.
The dual legitimacy of the European Union by its European but also its national citizens, by its peoples but also its states, makes the European Union institutionally complex by its very nature.
For that reason the extent to which these procedures can be simplified and speeded up is restricted by the whole complex system of dual legitimacy.
We must bear that in mind tomorrow, when we come to vote on the amendments and the text.
Mr President, within our groups in Parliament and within the IGC itself we are still struggling with the problems that proved fairly intractable at Amsterdam.
These issues are tricky because they expose both the exaggerated self-importance of small states and the folie de grandeur of the big states.
These issues can only be resolved by a greater sense of trust between partners - such trust that is the essential glue of successful federal pacts.
This trust is precisely the quality that is needed so that we are able to ensure the successful accession of the new Member States.
The fact is - and somebody should say this - that if the IGC fails to resolve the Amsterdam questions, enlargement must be postponed.
The Liberal Group supports the efforts of the presidency and of the Commission to build up the extra trust required.
We support the main thrust of this report.
We support especially those elements which expand the European Union' s capacity for action in global affairs: those that strengthen the status and the profile of the citizen, including the Charter; and those that will postulate further political reform in the interests of a strong executive and a mature parliamentary democracy.
In this respect the splitting of the Treaties is vital. So is retention of unanimity within the Council exclusively for the most serious questions.
Liberals everywhere support ministers that will subscribe to the development of European parliamentary democracy.
But we will be savage critics of those who prefer narrow self-interest and threaten the accession of new Member States.
Mr President, the European Parliament does not take part in Intergovernmental Conference negotiations.
It plays a secondary role, as do all those who are not part of a national government.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has always maintained that the intergovernmental method, which excludes elected Members and does not allow public debate, is a very significant weakness of the reform of the Treaties and a substantial barrier to its success.
Therefore, our assessment of this report is based on the fact that it is being presented in an unsatisfactory context, in which our priorities - an open, working democracy capable of rendering economic development environmentally sustainable, which ensures the respect and consolidation of the rights of the citizens and residents, and, most importantly, which is able to enlarge to include new Member countries in a short period of time - are not the same as those of the negotiating governments.
The governments have one sole objective: to reach a unanimous agreement in Nice, whatever the outcome, so that they do not have to move on to some other city as obscure as Maastricht.
Although Parliament cannot take part in negotiations, it has a duty to indicate the way, to define clear options for the future, without pretending to take part in the actual negotiations and without being conditioned by governmental pressure or pressure from artificial comparisons, such as the comparison between large and small countries.
This report only partly achieves this objective, and this is why our Group was not able to be unanimous in its final assessment.
But although the final decision was not unanimous, the Group was united in its view of the positive and negative points of this resolution.
We fully support certain central points, but, unfortunately, our view is not shared by many national governments. The issues on which we agree are as follows: systematic extension, not extension on a case by case basis, of the majority vote to the Council; codecision; the urgent need to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding and to extend the possibility of recourse to the Court beyond the economic sphere; the provisions on closer cooperation and so forth.
We are, however, very critical of the reduction of the constitution issue to a mere technical operation separating the Treaties into two parts, which, apart from anything else, would be very similar.
This is not the constitutional process, which should bear no resemblance to convoluted diplomatic negotiations and which, we feel, is essential to give the necessary boost to the integration process which, alone, can mobilise the citizens to strive for a better Europe.
We consider that the insistence on maintaining the limit on the number of Members at 700, even when we become a 20-State Europe, unnecessarily penalises the regions and those whose political orientations are neither socialist nor conservative.
In this regard, we hope that our amendment will find consensus in the House.
The Group is divided over double majority, closer cooperation, the number of Commissioners and security policy.
In particular, as regards the subject of the number of Commissioners, we will support the balanced position of those amendments which ensure both sufficient representation of the Member States and the efficiency of the Commission.
To sum up, this report may well be useful in assisting our two representatives in their often extremely frustrating daily work at the Intergovernmental Conference where others take the decisions, but to our citizens, it will seem about as clear as an interministerial memorandum.
Most importantly, in the same way as the 1984 Spinelli Treaty, this report does not live up to the challenge of being a milestone, a clear, unambiguous indication of where we want to be with those who wish to be there.
Mr President, our Group wishes to thank the rapporteurs, Messrs Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen, for the important work which they have carried out.
I must also tell them that, within my group, there are differing views, according to differing national experiences.
I will say the same thing here that I have said in my group: the debate is not whether we say yes or no to federalism.
The debate is how to go about European construction at the point of enlargement.
It is making sure that we do not just build a Europe of the States and a Europe of the people, but, especially, a Europe of the citizens.
We must create a fully democratic institutional fabric.
We know that there are democratic deficits and that they are considerable.
At the moment the challenge in the face of enlargement is to achieve, as the rapporteurs have said, greater efficiency and greater democracy.
The Intergovernmental Conference cannot end with the same disappointment that we had in Amsterdam.
We cannot create an Amsterdam 2.
We have to create a Treaty which gives rise to genuine European construction in which more than 400 million Europeans can share economic prosperity, a social dimension and a democratic life.
This is the great challenge for the European institutions and for European politics.
My vision of European construction is compatible with the fundamental lines which are laid out in the report which we are discussing today.
It is, of course, necessary to give the Commission the powers it needs and make it responsible to Parliament. This is precisely the issue.
We must clearly define the different democratic powers in the field of European competences and we must know who is making decisions and to whom they are responsible.
Mr President, Parliament does not take a corporate position.
Our minimum demand is that Parliament be treated as an adult which has to request that the Commission take certain responsibilities, but which also has to participate actively in European construction on behalf of the European citizens.
On behalf of the European citizens, we have to ask today not only for that fine-tuning of decision making but also for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights must give citizens the capacity to demand compliance with these rights in the European courts.
This is the position which we can adopt in our Group, asking for more efficiency and more democracy.
Mr President, in our view the European Parliament' s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference, as set out in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, are a misinterpretation.
What we urgently need today, on the eve of enlargement, is not to deepen the integration of the existing Member States at a faster rate.
It is not to trot out the old federalist recipes of the European Movement yet again.
It is not to propose a super-State again, with its own constitution, uniform rules and majority decisions.
No, what we urgently need today, ladies and gentlemen, is to show some evidence of clear-headedness, to accept that economic and political integration cannot be taken any further and to design new forms of cooperation that are far freer, and that will enable 30 or more States to work together on a basis of mutual respect.
Unfortunately, it would seem that the latest debates within the most well-informed groups of society stop at the doors of this Parliament.
In this matter, as in the case of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, our Parliament seems unable to depart from the federalist line it has been pursuing for many years.
That approach leads to an impasse, to what Mr Tsatsos a moment ago, if I understood him rightly, called a Europe built on sand.
First of all, it takes us away from the concept of Europe as an association of states, an association of national democracies, and puts all the countries, great or small, that are afraid of being marginalised on the defensive.
More generally, the rigid federalist approach reflects a more or less unconscious desire to set up institutional barriers against enlargement, which will once again call in question a whole range of long-standing patterns of behaviour.
We must adopt a more positive approach.
We must promote enlargement by adopting a new form of cooperation that is more differentiated, shows greater respect for national sovereignty, that is based on full recognition of the Luxembourg compromise, as I explained in the minority opinion attached to the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report.
Mr President, in Denmark there is a concept known as asset stripping.
Top class lawyers and accountants are being convicted one after the other because they have helped strip companies of assets and then left them with tax liabilities.
Asset stripping is a punishable offence.
The Intergovernmental Conference is designed to strip our constitutions and fundamental laws of assets and leave the voters with a democratic deficit, but constitution stripping of this kind is not punished.
The asset under our constitutions is the right of voters to be heard and to choose representatives who can pass laws on our behalf.
If we are dissatisfied with the laws, we can choose new representatives and obtain new laws.
This is the beating heart of our democracies, a heart which, because of the constitution strippers, will stop beating.
They are taking legislative power from our 15 national parliaments and transferring it to officials and ministers, from voters and elected representatives to the executive and from open assemblies to meetings behind closed doors in Brussels.
Electoral power is being transferred from our constitutions, but is not being transferred to the European Parliament.
We parliamentarians have been side-tracked.
Power lies with the Commission and the Council of Ministers.
The EU is not a parliamentary democracy, and the national parliaments have been still further marginalised.
A number of us in this House have therefore prepared 19 proposals for democratic reform of the EU.
We call the initiative SOS Democracy - "SOS" because it is a matter of urgency and "Democracy" because that is the heart of the problem.
We do not have democracy in today' s EU.
We should like to have it in tomorrow' s.
We have different opinions as to how the laws should look.
We have support across the political spectrum from communists to conservatives. We disagree about a lot but agree that our differences should be resolved in democratic parliaments.
The voters in our countries should always have the last word.
We reject any attempt to strip our constitutions of democratic content and we urge the public to get involved in the negotiations concerning the Nice Treaty before it is too late.
Join us in SOS Democracy.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am speaking as draftsman of the opinion of this Parliament' s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I understand the importance of institutional reforms, but I would also like to express the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the issues which we must tackle in relation to the Intergovernmental Conference.
We would like to make three points.
Firstly, the active recognition of the role, protagonism and participation of the regions in the process of European construction which began 50 years ago.
Secondly, the importance of transport.
To this end, we want an extended Article 70 and we also want it to be supplemented with a provision on the creation of a single European agency for air traffic control.
Lastly, the role of tourism for both the economy and for employment.
We - or at least I personally - accept Amendment No 168, presented by the chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy on this issue.
Mr President, I would first of all like to express my appreciation for the sterling work carried out by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen.
I believe that this is one of the best reports which have so far been produced in the framework of IGCs over recent years.
I am making this statement as former rapporteur on the Maastricht Treaty.
By the way, Maastricht is not a strange city, Mrs Frassoni, it is a very exciting city where the Dutch-Flemish, German and French cultures all flow into one.
Just try one of the pavement cafÃ©s and you will see what I mean.
I will repeat this to Mrs Frassoni in Italian some time.
Mr President, it is rather a shame that so many amendments have been tabled as this might affect the quality and balance of the report.
The large groups should, therefore, restrict themselves to the absolutely necessary amendments during the vote. This seems the best way to retain the good work which the rapporteurs have put in.
As far as our Group is concerned, the resolution needs to be amended on a number of points.
For example, we do not agree with the proposal in the resolution to restrict the number of Commissioners to 20 and to introduce a rota system for the smaller countries.
One Commissioner per Member State seems a much better solution to us.
In order to boost citizens' confidence in the European Commission, it is vital that each Member State should have a Commission Member.
Our Group, too, has therefore tabled amendments to this effect.
Next is the number of MEPs.
The resolution argues in favour of the possibility of European lists.
This is a sound idea, but if we want 10% of the European members on European lists, then this should not, of course, result in additional MEPs on top of the 700 which have been agreed upon.
It is important that we retain a maximum of 700, with or without the European list.
Parliament is already vast, the buildings are already packed and the whole thing has to remain workable.
The third point concerns the issue of unanimity.
We believe that in an enlarged Union, decision-making should not always be blocked by an excessive right of veto.
Unanimity should, therefore, be restricted to the bare essentials. These are constitutional issues such as the deployment of military troops and issues pertaining to territorial integrity.
All other decisions should be taken by qualified majority with weighted voting, as is proposed, and - this is vitally important - with colegislative powers exercised by Parliament.
We would also thank the Commission for this support.
I would like to end by commenting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
According to our Group, it is of paramount importance that this Charter be included in the Treaty.
Work to this effect is being carried out, and we sincerely hope that a text can be produced which everyone can agree to incorporate into the Treaty.
This is a key issue for the citizens of Europe.
Mr President, firstly, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to express my support for the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report and, furthermore, thank the Portuguese Presidency for their positive attitude towards the incorporation of Parliament into the Intergovernmental Conference.
This report is of great value and I therefore believe we should support it today by a majority in this Parliament, because this is an opportunity for a completely open debate on the great issues still facing us in Europe.
This debate is going on between political and national groups in different Member States.
Please allow me to make a correction, Mr President: there are no large and small countries here.
Here we must consider ourselves to be small. In the past, the countries in Europe which considered themselves to be large tried to impose their hegemony by force.
Here were are all amongst small countries, especially given the challenge of globalisation.
I believe this should be an important element in our coexistence.
In European Parliament debates, political groups, citizens of different countries and diverse interests and prejudices come into play and this allows us to be aware of when we touch a nerve and of when it is necessary for us to take special care in what we do.
Therefore, this is an important debate and I believe the Council should take account of the position we take.
Secondly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe we should also try to introduce some vision and some idealism into this debate.
I have always been against the idea that we had to deal with the 'leftovers' from Amsterdam.
Leftovers are thrown in the bin.
These are clear and fundamental challenges, which refer to and are linked to the membership of the Commission, the power of the President, fair contributions by the Member States and such important questions as closer cooperation, majority voting and - a vital issue - the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I say this particularly in view of the crisis which we have seen in a Member State as a result of the presence of a party whose fundamental values are contrary to the community of values which we hold here.
A final consideration: Commissioner Barnier has said that, before the end of the Conference, we must resolve certain problems relating to the chain of command.
Mr President, in relation to the appeal to public opinion which we are making, I believe we must clearly affirm the principles of democracy and transparency and also the chain of command.
We must not allow a situation where, while we are discussing this, a kind of Loch Ness monster reappears every month in the press.
I understand the journalists, but we cannot allow a situation where crises are created by certain anonymous officials, who are frustrated mandarins, and certain ambassadors, who seem to behave like a Praetorian Guard, and who do not hesitate to make anonymous declarations in the press.
Here, the only risk involved in democracy is the risk taken in elections.
This is the risk taken by Minister Gama, Commissioner Barnier and by all of us.
However, here in the gossip shops of Brussels we create a situation and certain centres of power which do not correspond to the principles of democracy and transparency, which are precisely the principles which we have to strengthen in this Intergovernmental Conference.
I believe that it is important for all of the institutions to confront this issue responsibly.
If not, the Intergovernmental Conference will not have been a success for our future.
Mr President, the EU is faced with enormous challenges.
In just a few years' time, the Union is to be enlarged to include almost double the number of Member States.
The euro is to be introduced.
We are to have a security policy worthy of the name, implement administrative reforms and, hopefully, win back some of the confidence our citizens have lost in the European project.
The Intergovernmental Conference should prepare the EU for these changes.
It provides us with the opportunity to adapt our work to the new Member States and to the new tasks we have before us.
It is a question of finding a balance between democracy and efficiency and of maintaining the historic balance between small and large countries.
These are the questions which remain following the conclusion of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
It is important in these discussions not to become lost in technical details and lose sight of the goal - that of making the EU more open, more efficient and more intelligible.
We must all make sacrifices in order to achieve this goal.
Unfortunately, governments appear to have lost sight of this goal.
The Intergovernmental Conference is making only limited progress, which is not the fault of the Portuguese Presidency.
Probably what will happen is what usually happens: at five minutes to midnight on the last day, a compromise will be reached with which no-one is entirely satisfied.
The talk is already of the next Intergovernmental Conference where the major questions will then be solved.
We have heard this before.
There is starting to be a surfeit of half-baked intergovernmental conferences.
Our citizens have higher expectations than that, and we do not have much time.
That is why we have to take the opportunity now.
The EU must be changed in the way we Liberals have demanded, that is to say in the direction of transparency, public control, more explicit accountability, a clearer distribution of competences and a common constitution.
Quite simply, the EU must become more liberal.
The report includes many of our amendments, and I support these with few exceptions.
The challenges faced by the EU are exciting and historic.
They should inspire us all to roll up our shirt sleeves.
We are in a position to create something unique: democratic, competitive and peaceful cooperation throughout the continent.
Instead, however, of awakening hope and enthusiasm, present developments appear, rather, to be giving rise to anxiety among governments.
One might well ask what has become of political leadership and vision.
Mr President, if the changes to the Treaty proposed in the resolution we are debating are implemented, the European Union will take an absolutely crucial step on the way to becoming a federal state and one, moreover, in which the national parliaments will lose control over almost all crucial areas of policy.
In addition to the massive increase in supranational forms of decision-making, the proposal contains quite a few qualitative changes in the direction of federalism, among these the proposal to remove the national right of veto in the course of changes to large parts of the current Treaty and, also, the demands for a single EU constituency in the elections for the European Parliament.
I am convinced that this transformation of the EU into a federal state is a blind alley in every way.
The EU' s major problem today is not a lack of centralised power but a shortage of real democracy.
What the Union needs in place of more supranationalism is democratic reform leading to a dramatic reduction in the Commission' s political power, to the legislative process in the Council' s being made public and to the national parliaments' being given decisive influence.
Through the Treaty changes proposed in the resolution, the EU would become a Union wholly dominated by the big Member States.
The power wielded by the major countries would be increased dramatically through the introduction of a system of "double simple majority" voting in the Council of Ministers.
Their power would also be increased through the increase in their representation in the European Parliament.
In an EU which has been enlarged by a further twelve States and in which seven hundred seats in Parliament have been distributed as proposed in the resolution, Sweden would have thirteen seats, Finland seven and Ireland five.
This would mean that, in many Member States, important political powers would not be represented at EU level.
This also shows how weak the democratic basis of such a Parliament would be.
Compared with other federal states, the "EU state" would, on this model, be unusually centralised and offer little protection to small constituent States.
A comparison might be made with the United States in which the one chamber in a two-chamber system has proportional representation, while representation in the second chamber is the same for all constituent States.
In the EU, the big countries would instead dominate both chambers on the basis of the proposal we are now debating.
For anyone who wants to change anything regarding monetary union or EMU, it is now, when the Treaty is being changed, that the opportunity exists.
Many adherents of EMU on the Left have, of course, argued in favour of altering the nature of monetary union in such a way that the Central Bank is placed under democratic control and that the goals of economic policy are not merely monetary.
It is noticeable that they are now completely silent and that it is now only the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left which is demanding the democratisation of monetary union.
As you have perhaps noted, I am going to vote against the present resolution.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I support the enlargement of the European Union because I know it will consolidate the new democracies in eastern and central Europe.
I know it will also increase the size of the European Union as a trading block which in time will ensure that the Union as an economic entity becomes more competitive.
I know that reform within the existing European institutions must take place.
However, any changes within the internal decision-making procedures must be balanced and fair.
We do not want to see a two-tier European Union in which larger Member States dictate the pace at the expense of the smaller Member States.
For example, the report which we are debating today recommends a rotation system for the composition of the European Commission.
This will mean that the automatic entitlement of smaller Member States to have one Member of the Commission will be downgraded.
I do not believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal.
380 million citizens of the Union have an affinity with the Commission.
Certainly, from an Irish perspective, Irish people recognise the importance of the Commission as an institutional body within the European Union.
It is still the institution that controls the operations of competition policy, the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and the common transport policy.
The Union must draw nearer to the citizens of the Union.
We should also remember that some Member States, including my country, must hold a referendum on any Treaty changes that arise at the forthcoming IGC.
The loss of an automatic right to nominate a Commissioner would certainly be a very difficult, if not impossible, proposal to sell to an Irish electorate in this referendum.
I would now like to return to the issue of extending the qualified majority voting system at European Council level.
The Council represents the interests of the 15 Member State governments within the institutional framework of the Union and currently, under existing EU Treaties, unanimous agreement of the 15 Member States is required for any tax changes sought within the Union.
The report we are discussing today seeks to extend qualified majority voting to all legislative activities except those of a constitutional nature.
I believe that national Member States should retain the right of veto on taxation matters.
The Irish taxation system is innovative in many ways and has contributed to our present growth rates.
I do not believe that the extension of qualified majority voting to taxation matters at European Council level is a particularly welcome development.
Mr President, a biblical parable teaches the reader to build his house on a rock.
After all, a house built on sand has no solid foundations.
This parable was meant as a reference to faith and its foundations.
Nonetheless, I was reminded of this parable during the IGC discussion.
The relentless attempts to turn Europe into a political unity seem to be built on quicksand.
Indeed, the citizens of Europe do not feel European and this will not change overnight.
Still, the discussion on the EU' s future is peppered with concepts such as European citizenship.
This does not exist by any stretch of the imagination and is simply quicksand!
In the IGC discussion or the present report for that matter, the end goal of European cooperation is not taken into consideration.
What do we want to achieve as a European Union?
I would be keen to hear the Council' s and Commission' s opinion on this.
If there is a well-considered vision on the foundation of European cooperation, the European House will be on more solid ground and will be able to brave the bad weather.
I share the minority view of Mr Berthu, a member of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, as it has been included in this report.
This document does include a solid foundation for the Union, namely a cooperative of independent states, in which the national democracies enjoy the highest level of legitimacy.
Regarding the enlargement issue, the fact that Member States joining the EU can become fully-fledged Members of the Union should be central.
"Degrading" acceding countries to second-class members does not do them justice and has unwanted political consequences.
Instead of the idea of different speeds, I support the idea of carrying out only the core tasks, that is to say in cross-border policy areas, at European level.
Another specific point I would like to raise concerns the European Commission.
This high official college should in future not have more or fewer than 20 members.
If necessary, combinations of countries can alternate in appointing a Euro Commissioner.
I support the policy of granting the European Parliament codecision in all cases in which the Council decides by qualified majority.
This must, however, go hand in hand with sound scrutiny by the national parliaments of their "own" ministers in the Council.
President, Commissioner, we are faced with a fundamental difficulty, in the exercise in which we are involved, in maintaining the balance between enlarging the EU and reforming the institutions to make that enlargement possible.
British Conservatives cannot accept the report, based on the long list of ancillary items which are not on the agenda of the IGC.
We are concerned by the proposals for constitutionalisation of the Union, by the proposals to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty, by the progressive diminishing of the distinction between the first and second pillars, by the proposal that the Council should adopt broad guidelines of economic, employment and social convergence policies by qualified majority.
These are just some examples of the complex and controversial issues which are raised.
We are overloading the wish list of the IGC.
The great danger, if all these extra items were to be adopted on the agenda, is that the deadline of December 2000 would inevitably be missed.
Where would that leave the candidate countries like Poland and Hungary, whose government leaders have already expressed concern over the timetable?
We believe the IGC should concentrate on the essential institutional reforms.
It should ensure that it meets the deadline, to enable the first wave of enlargement to include Central and Eastern European countries by 2004, and to continue any further necessary reforms with the full inclusion of our new partners.
If the EU delays enlargement too long, it may make it more difficult, or impossible, for some candidate countries to join within the envisaged timetable.
The President-in-Office addressed some of these concerns in his speech.
Commissioner Barnier in his speech said that the intention is to succeed with the reforms, not necessarily to conclude them.
Some people say that this is the last opportunity for reform.
I do not think that is a very fair reflection on the extraordinary reforms that many of the candidate countries have made in the last 9 and 10 years since they were within the Warsaw Pact or formerly part of the Soviet Union.
Our priority is enlargement.
We should not confuse or reverse our priorities.
Mr President, my group welcomes this report.
It sends a clear message to the IGC to be ambitious, to think long-term and not short-term, to think of how a Union with nearly double the number of Member States we have now can actually function effectively and to take this opportunity to change the Treaties, because future IGCs with nearly 30 states around the table will find it even more difficult than it is now to agree on reforms.
The report puts forward ambitious proposals, as one would expect of the European Parliament.
If adjusted by the amendments by my group, it will be a well-balanced set of proposals, well-balanced notably on the delicate question of the equilibrium between large and smaller Member States.
On the size of the Commission, for instance, the formulas that are likely to be adopted tomorrow will refer either to one Commissioner per Member State or to a smaller number, a fixed number of Commissioners.
The Commission cannot go on expanding indefinitely.
In the second case, it will be a rotating system, so that every Member State, large and small, has equal opportunities of seeing one of its nationals serve in the Commission.
On the question of the size of the European Parliament, we have also found a point of equilibrium, based on to a minimum number of Members for each Member State.
Every state will, of course, have to make a sacrifice following enlargement, but a minimum number will be guaranteed, with digressive proportionality thereafter.
So the report is balanced and I think can be welcomed.
It is ambitious.
Some people are saying: ' The IGC will never agree to this point or to that point' .
But we are not in this Parliament trying to guess the outcome of the IGC; we are trying to encourage it to move in a particular direction, in a more ambitious direction, to make sure that we actually have a Union capable of functioning effectively when we enlarge to nearly 30 Member States.
That is essential for our future.
Mr President, the aim of the IGC is to reconcile enlargement with deepening.
In particular, we need to review the interinstitutional balance, representation within the Commission and the other institutions, the weighting of votes and the areas covered by qualified majority voting.
Unanimity voting must apply to decisions of a constitutional and fundamental nature.
Closer cooperation must make it possible to manage diversity and avoid getting bogged down, without calling the fundamental structure of the Union into question.
The report by our fellow Members, whom I want to congratulate, has been substantially improved over the course of the discussions.
Nonetheless, the outlined reform will hit the small Member States hardest.
That applies in particular to the provisions on the composition and operation of the institutions.
A Parliament in which the ceiling of four seats per Member State, which does not allow for a balanced representation of the political forces, is unacceptable.
The same is true of a Council in which the qualified majority rules have to be readjusted and whose proposed method of operation will inevitably lead to deadlock and inconsistency, and of a Commission in which the rule must be one member per Member State.
Lastly, let me bring up the question of the seat of Parliament and call for the promise made to be respected.
I am always surprised to see our Parliament, which sets itself up as the committed champion of respect for minority rights when it comes to others, go against this approach when it comes to deciding on the institutional architecture of our own House.
Mr President, we, for our part, welcome the enlargement of Europe and will participate in the discussion of how to prepare for it.
The Scottish National Party, which I represent, is committed in its manifesto and its general policy to the idea of Europe as a confederation of peoples, countries and regions, not as a sovereign federal union in its own right.
That is something which the parties of European Free Alliance have in common and our votes will be cast in that light.
I want to draw attention particularly to Amendment No 138, in its interaction with paragraph 32 of the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report.
Regarding its proposal for all-Europe lists of candidates, we in Scotland - a small nation within a large Member State - are seriously concerned about the practical disappearance of Scotland as a distinct entity within the Union This would also apply to Euskadi, Flanders, Galicia, Andalusia and Wales.
The reduction in Members of the European Parliament that we would face, coupled with the arrival of new Member States which are smaller in population than Scotland or Wales and which would be fully represented in all the institutions of the Union, will certainly increase the pressure for and our people' s commitment to the idea of our own independence in this great European confederation.
As it is now voting time, the debate will be adjourned and will resume at 3 p.m.

WallstrÃ¶m, Commission.
Mr President, as I explained during the debate yesterday, the Commission is able to accept fully Amendments Nos 9, 17, 19, 29 and 47.
The Commission can also accept Amendments Nos 1 to 4, 8, 11, 24, 35 to 38, 46, 48, 49 and 52 in principle, as far as they clarify the intention of the Commission to establish an efficient, transparent and balanced regulatory framework for GMOs.
Some of these amendments need only to be brought into line with the legal wording of the text of the directive and the overall legislative framework.
For other amendments, for instance those amendments concerning antibiotic-resistant marker genes, the principle is politically acceptable but the proposed text as such does not seem to be appropriate.
The Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos 5 to 7, 10, 12 to 16, 18, 20 to 23, 25 to 28, 30 to 34, 39 to 45, 50 and 51.
More specifically concerning Amendments Nos 22, 23 and 25, the Commission cannot accept them as they stand but is willing to consider how due account can be taken of the concerns they reflect.
Mr President, I have a question for the Commission, so as to make it quite clear to my fellow delegates what we are voting about.
I have the Council' s common position of 9 December 1999 before me.
It says in the document passed to us by the Council that this common position was adopted unanimously.
If I remember correctly, we were still under the Finnish Council Presidency in December 1999, with a Green Environment Minister.
Political Union took place in June 1999, under the German Council Presidency, also with a green Environment Minister.
However, I am a little confused because the Greens in this House are maintaining that the common position is so weak that it is imperative that we make a huge number of improvements to it.
That is why I wanted to put the question again as to whether we are really voting on the common position that all the Environment Ministers subscribed to, or whether we are mistaken?
(Laughter, Applause)
Thank you, Mr Liese.
May I remind you that the debate is closed. Nevertheless I will give the floor to the Commission if it wishes to clarify the matter further.
It is that very common position.
Mr President, since Mr Liese has addressed a question to us, I will take the liberty of answering him.
The Green Group is not dependent on the positions of the Green ministers represented in the Environment Council.
We have freedom of choice, and I would hope the same applies to all the political groups here present.
But I wanted to speak specifically on the vote on Amendment No 37.
I think it is quite logical to vote on Amendment No 11 first, before Amendment No 37, because Amendment No 11 goes further than Amendment No 37.
It proposes a total ban on antibiotic-resistant marker genes, which is not the case in Amendment No 37, which relates only to Part C of the directive.
So I believe it would be more logical to vote first on the amendment that departs furthest from the original position.
Mr Lannoye, the rapporteur discussed this question with the competent services yesterday.
He does not seem to agree with you.
In fact he believes that the wording of Amendment No 11 is such as to suggest a different voting order from the one you recommend.
I can only regret that.
After the vote on Amendments Nos 38 and 49: President.
We will now adjourn the vote and resume after the formal sitting.
(The sitting was suspended at 12 noon for the formal sitting and resumed at 12.35 p.m.)
Mr President, I understand perfectly that it is an honour for us to receive a distinguished guest of state.
However, I would ask you, when the Bureau next meets, to address the question as to whether it is a constructive use of time to interrupt a vote that we need a qualified majority for and for which there are only seven or eight proposed amendments.
I would urge you to address this matter in the Bureau.
I am happy to put this question to the Bureau, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, but I was bound by decisions outside my control.
Mr President, just before the formal sitting you interrupted this vote very suddenly.
It rather surprised me, and I am sure many other Members of the House, who during the formal sitting expressed their surprise at the way in which the vote was interrupted.
We have just seen the first vote after the formal sitting fail to secure a qualified majority by only a handful of votes.
Does that not demonstrate what we were talking about and the point Mrs Roth-Behrendt has raised?
When we have qualified majority votes they should not be interrupted in any way by the formal sitting.
There were eight votes to go.
I can inform you, on the basis of my experience, that you could have completed that in three minutes.
It is ridiculous that we are now proceeding with qualified majority votes when Members have not been given a reasonable amount of time to come back into the Chamber.
I hope you could address that issue, Mr President.
I quite understand your feelings, Mr Bowe.
To tell the truth, I agree with you.
But I also had to respect the protocol which, once again, unfortunately often takes precedence over our proceedings.
That said, it is true that your comment makes good sense and I think the Bureau will have to give it the fullest consideration.
Mr President, I have a question about the method applied here.
It seems to me that, normally, when the sitting resumes and we resume the vote after a formal sitting, a bell sounds to warn our colleagues that the sitting and the vote are resuming.
I did not hear that bell and I would ask you to confirm the method used in such cases, for this probably adversely affected the result of the vote in this Chamber.
In principle, Mrs Lienemann, the bell sounds when the sitting has been adjourned in order to call Members back.
Some Members had left the Chamber, others remained.
I had in fact announced that the voting would resume immediately after the formal sitting.
Moreover this was indicated in the Minutes and on the agenda.
But I too am sometimes faced with imponderables.
Let me assure you that all your comments will be passed on to the Bureau.
You yourself are a member of the Bureau.
I think that by taking concerted action we will manage to improve the system.
(Mixed reactions)
Mr President, if the problem about sounding the bell is that the sitting has to resume first, the solution is quite simple.
I propose to the President that we suspend the sitting for two minutes.
For it is unacceptable...
... that for reasons purely of protocol the number of Members in the Chamber has decreased by about 60, which makes it extremely difficult to adopt amendments that will affect the health of European consumers for generations to come.
(Applause)
Once again, Mrs Liepitz, I can only take note of the situation, deplore it like you and propose that we finally press on with the vote.
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)

Joint motion for a resolution on the EU-Africa summit
Before the vote
Mr President, an error has slipped into paragraphs 15, 17 and 18 of this joint resolution of the European Union and Africa.
In paragraph 15, instead of saying "the OAU" it should say "the African States" .
In section 17, instead of "the OAU" it should say "Africa" .
In section 18, "members of the OAU" should be replaced by "Africans" .
(Parliament agreed to vote on the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Resolution on the additionality principle
Mr President, I would like to give the following explanation of the vote that I cast in the debate concerning additionality.
I would like particularly to underline the point in the motion that Parliament fully endorses the Commission' s statement that the spirit of additionality, as well as the letter of the law, represents a key consideration and is vital to ensuring that programmes have a maximum impact on the ground.
In that light it is absolutely unacceptable that the current policy allows Member States, after submission of region-based plans, to reallocate funds internally yet still formally comply with the additionality principle while defying its spirit.
This matter urgently calls for review by the Commission.
Since the debate - yesterday in fact - I have received a very courteous and helpful letter from Mr Barnier indicating that the Commission is moving our way on this.
I am very glad about that.
I should like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Evans, for setting up this marvellous debate and getting this superb result today.
Mr President, I am delighted this resolution has been adopted by Parliament in recognition of the problem that exists with additionality.
I represent Wales which, due to the practices of the UK Government, has not received, and will not receive, what the EU intends to be spent on combating poverty over and above normal government spending, even with Objective I status in the current programme period.
As Commissioner Barnier has stated, it is as important to comply with the spirit of additionality as with the letter of the law.
The Commissioner also endorsed the statement by Commissioner Liikanen that in future the Commission would be particularly attentive to the spending figures put forward by the Member States when there is evidence of reduced expenditure in a given region or regions.
I trust now that the Member States will comply with the wishes of Parliament and the Commission in this matter to ensure that the effective targeting of structural funds at the poorest regions is not undermined.
- The EPLP delegation voted in favour of the compromise resolution on additionality because we believe that the principle of additionality is one of the core fundamental pillars of the structural funds reforms, for which I was Parliament' s rapporteur.
However, I believe that parts of this resolution, rather than bringing clarity to the rules, will only serve to confuse the general public and in particular funding operators.
Paragraph A continues to confuse the principle of additionality with the separate but equally important principle of co-financing.
Paragraph G is inaccurate.
There is no regulatory requirement to check additionality on an annual basis, but as stated in the regulation, simplification requires three checks on additionality during the programming period.
It is inappropriate for Members to try with this resolution to rewrite regulations which were agreed unanimously by this Parliament and will be up for review in 2006.
More disappointing is the naked party political games which British Members Mr Davies, Mr Bradbourn and Mrs Evans have attempted in this resolution.
This will not serve the best interests of our poorest communities, with deliberate misinformation and hijacking this debate for narrow party political advantage.
Our real goal must be to plan and give our support to the successful implementation of these funds to improve the life prospects of people in our poorest regions.
My party is committed to this goal and will work with other parties in a constructive and positive way to achieve this.
