Until that date, requests from citizens for Council documents will be dealt with as previously on the basis of Decision 93/731/EC regarding public access to Council documents.
Each of the three institutions involved is at present taking measures to ensure that the new Regulation is actually applied from 3 December next.
According to Article 15 of the Regulation, they are required to set up an interinstitutional committee, which will investigate the best practice, deal with any disputes and discuss future developments relating to public access to documents.
As regards the Council, the competent services are at present holding discussions on the measures to be taken and on the timeframe for their introduction, in order to facilitate citizens' exercising of the rights that they have now been assigned more clearly on the basis of the new Regulation.
The necessary measures will be taken to be able to meet the deadline of 3 December.
As regards the various types of documents that may be consulted by the public, I can inform the honourable Member that at present, on the basis of Decision 93/731/EC of 20 December 1993 relating to public access to Council documents, all Council documents can be requested by the public.
Depending on their content and in particularly in the light of the exceptional regulations - that is, Article 4 of the Decision - a decision is taken as to whether or not they can be released to the applicant, after a full case-by-case investigation.
However, Article 1, paragraph 1 of Decision 93/731/EC, amended by Council Decision 2000/527/EC of 14 August last year, stipulated that if a request for access relates to a document marked highly secret, secret or confidential in the sense of the decision of the Secretary-General of the Council of 27 July 2000, that in addition refers to the security and defence affairs of the Union or of one or more of its Member States or to military or non-military crisis management, the applicant shall be informed that the document concerned does not fall within the scope of Decision 93/731/EC.
I would draw your attention to the fact that this provision was not included in the previously mentioned Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 that comes into effect on 3 December next.
However, Article 9 of the Regulation stipulates that requests for access to the sensitive documents described in it will be dealt with separately.
For example, people may only deal with such requests where they themselves are authorised to take cognisance of these documents.
Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is based on the same general principle as the Decision of 1993, namely that every document request is definitely looked at separately.
Access can only be possibly denied in the light of the exceptional regulation provided for in Article 4.
In addition, the Council decided in its Decision of 9 April this year on the classification of certain categories of Council documents, to place a whole series of documents, especially documents that fall under legislative activities, directly in the public domain via the Internet.
In this, the Council anticipated the coming into force of the Regulation as regards Article 12, paragraph 3.
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office on getting through so many answers in this Question Time.
You may have beaten the record.
I do not know what the record is, but you have been very good.
Secondly, I note your statement that this procedure will start on time on 3 December.
Everyone in Parliament and the public is delighted to hear that and thank you for your very full reply.
Can I just ask: is the next step to open up Council meetings to the public when you are legislating so we can see what you are doing?
Then we would have real democracy in the Council.
Will you do that next?
I am afraid that in order to do that we first need an IGC so you will have to wait for some time.
But as you heard from my answer, there is a lot of progress and we will see.
I will not quote the former Prime Minister of Belgium when I had the temerity to formulate this suggestion in my own national parliament but I can tell you in private afterwards.
Things are progressing and going forward and now let us wait and hope.
I too wish to thank the Council of Ministers for its comprehensive answer, but I should nonetheless like the Council to be more specific.
Is it possible to provide some examples - practical examples - of documents which previously were secret but which will now be made public under the new rules?
I am referring to certain types of document which you now hope it might be possible to make public.
It is only when it is known which types of document are really to be made public that there can be talk of genuine success and increased openness.
I see that I have failed in my attempt to convince you that some progress has indeed been made.
I suggest that early next year or during the course of December you again ask questions on this.
We will probably be able to give you a more detailed answer then than we can now because the new rulings are not yet applicable.
Progress has been made. I have tried to convince you of this.
Mr President, I really must protest at the way in which you are directing this debate.
You have written off all our supplementary questions as statements and you have not allowed the President-in-Office to reply.
You did the same to Mr Marinos, to Mr SacrÃ©deus and to me.
It seems to me that specific questions were asked and you should at least have allowed the President-in-Office to reply.
If she had no reply to our questions, she could simply have told us she had no reply.
It is the first time I have seen the President intervene as you did earlier and comment on our questions and positions as you have done.
I thank you for your observation, I take good note of it; but the Rules of Procedure explicitly state that only supplementary questions may be asked, not statements.
In any event, I will not prevent the President-in-Office from replying as she believes appropriate, although no question has been asked.
She always has the opportunity.
But you and the interpretation of Mr Marinos' s intervention - at least the interpretation into various languages, because I have consulted it - did not include any question but rather a broad statement.
This presidency has violated neither the letter nor the spirit of Question Time, the aim of which is to ask specific questions and receive the most specific possible replies.
I invite you to read the Rules of Procedure relating to Question Time.
Although we are out of time, we are going to ask two questions to the President, so that you are aware: Questions Nos 20 and 21; the rest will be replied to in writing.
Question No 20 by (H-0635/01):
Subject: Elections in Kosovo What support is the Council giving for the holding of the first general elections in Kosovo, and what prospects for that region does it see?
The elections on 17 November will certainly be a key event for the future of Kosovo and will facilitate a greater level of direct participation by the population and by local political leaders in the operation of the provisional constitutional framework established by UNMIK.
Against this background, the Council considers it vital that these elections should take place in a proper manner in accordance with European norms and with the participation of the entire population, in particular the Serbian minority in Kosovo.
Nevertheless, the Council of the European Union is not playing any part in the direct preparations for these elections.
This organisational task has in fact been given to the OSCE, to the Council of Europe and to the third pillar of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, better known by the abbreviation UNMIK.
However, all the Member States are making an important contribution to the budget established for this purpose via the OSCE and the Council of Europe and they are also involved in preparing for observers to be sent, once again under the aegis of the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
Mr President, firstly, I should like to ask whether the European Union is at least doing what it does everywhere else, namely working actively to fund the independent media, train politicians, support the democratic parties and promote institution building.
In essence, this is what we are doing everywhere, and I would find it incomprehensible if this were not the case in Kosovo.
Secondly, I should like to ask whether the Council plans to initiate direct contacts with the newly elected politicians in Kosovo after the forthcoming elections, so that the moderate forces which I believe will win are genuinely able to achieve success and there is no renewed upsurge in support for the radical forces later on?
As regards the organisation of the elections, I think I have given you all the facts and information available to me.
With regard to establishing a presence and maintaining frequent contacts with the authorities, leaders and personalities that play a role in Kosovo, you are well aware that that always has been and will remain the objective of the European Union.
On a personal note, I would like to say that it is perhaps advisable not to state a position before the elections which would make it all too clear who one wishes to emerge victorious in these elections.
In fact I believe that we have had several bitter disappointments in this region of Europe and that we need to have faith in the democratic process in Kosovo, whilst following events there very closely, including those after the elections, which we all hope will be conducted in a proper manner.
Mr President, I have my question written here and I shall send you a photocopy of the text and the translation so that you can see what I asked the Minister at a glance.
I assure you that I would not wish anyone to think that I am arguing with you.
I admire and respect you, especially when you are in the chair.
I have repeatedly attended sessions during which you have chaired question time and I have no complaints.
But may I add, just to prove that I did ask a question, that the Minister said that my supplementary question was not included in the text of my question.
So I should like, first, to say that I clearly asked a question and, secondly, to ask you, as President, if supplementary questions should be repeated by the person who asked the initial question or if they should supplement the first question in different words but - naturally - on the same subject?
I should like you to clarify this point given that you are far more experienced in procedural matters than I.
You are absolutely right, Mr Marinos.
The supplementary question is not the same, as its name suggests. It is a supplementary question.
What has happened is that we did not realise it was a question from the interpretation, but you have asked it, we have all understood very well and we thank you for your cooperation and assessment.
Thank you very much.
Question No 21 by (H-0637/01):
Subject: Adoption of the regulation on designs and models When is the regulation on designs and models scheduled to be adopted?
There is unanimous agreement in the Council on virtually all aspects of the draft Regulation.
Only one Gordian knot remains to be cut, and the presidency is organising bilateral contacts with some delegations with this in mind.
On this basis, we hope that this last obstacle can soon be cleared.
You will understand that I am unable to give further information on the subject at this delicate stage.
Mr President, I shall speak in the form of a question, so that the presidency will not object, with good reason, as it always does.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the truth is that I do not understand the reasons why you do not clarify this point which is still outstanding, because I do not actually understand what that point may be.
At the time, in the regulation on designs and models, when it came to the directive, certain points were controversial, for example the reparation clause, but once, with the very direct participation of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, a compromise was reached on that clause, which has been reflected in the Commission' s proposal and accepted as such by the European Parliament I do not understand what the controversial point can be.
Neither do I understand, as has been said, why there may be other controversial points which, at the time, delayed the approval of the Regulation on markings, such as those relating to language, procedure or the location of the office for the harmonisation of the internal market, because that was resolved with the Regulation on markings.
And now, as regards this proposed regulation on design, the procedure rules, the procedure languages and the competence of the office for harmonisation of the internal markets are issues which have already been resolved.
I therefore do not understand what that point is and, despite your invitation, I would be grateful if you could clarify it.
I can only repeat what I have just said.
It is not always necessary to understand or share the argument underpinning the reservations that a Member State may have on a particular point to realise that these reservations have nevertheless been expressed, that they have been maintained and that it is difficult to withdraw them.
The presidency will do what it can by the end of this year to have them lifted.
That is all I can say about the situation at this stage.
Thank you very much, Madam President-in-Office.
That reply ends this debate.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 22 to 36 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.13 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Statement by the President
Pursuant to Rule 74 of the Rules of Procedure, the presidency must make the following announcement:
The Council has delivered the following joint positions, which will appear in today' s Minutes, as well as the reasons for adopting them.
The period of three months available to Parliament to give its opinion will begin from tomorrow 6 September 2001.
Data protection in electronic communications (continuation)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to address all the issues raised in the Commission' s proposal for a directive on data protection in electronic communications.
Most of the proposals are well-founded and necessary, and have our support.
This also applies to the work of the rapporteur, Mr Cappato, whom I would like to congratulate on his work.
There is one highly controversial issue, however.
What is our position on direct advertising by e-mail?
At present, there are four Member States in Europe which have opt-in systems, which means that commercial e-mails are banned if they are unsolicited, and are permitted only with the prior consent of the recipient.
Most other Member States have an opt-out solution, with individuals having to register on Robinson lists if they do not wish to receive commercial e-mails.
We therefore have two options: Amendments Nos 42, 43 and 44 proposed by the Committee and the rapporteur call for an opt-out solution as a minimum standard, supplemented by Amendment No 61, which provides for review after three years.
Countries which have an existing opt-in system can continue with this as an "add-on" to the minimum standard.
Amendments Nos 53, 60 and 62 call for an immediate introduction of the opt-in system which would then be compulsory for all Member States.
There are good arguments for both opt-in and opt-out and we will hear many more of them in this debate, undoubtedly presented with passion.
I confess that I tend to favour an opt-in solution.
Nonetheless, there is a serious decision before us today, and that is whether to adopt option 1, i.e. opt-out as the minimum standard, thus maintaining the status quo in the Member States.
Why do we have this situation?
Firstly, we chose the opt-out solution as a minimum standard in the e-Commerce Directive a year ago, although this will also be reviewed in three years.
It would be absurd, incoherent and contradictory to adopt a conclusive solution in this directive, whether it be opt-in or opt-out, just a year later.
Secondly, no one can predict the precise course of events.
No one can say with certainty what the advantages and disadvantages of the two options will be in the next two years.
Trade practices, citizens' information requirements, but also their security needs are undergoing rapid change.
It is quite impossible to predict how the commercial sector will respond to the new opportunities afforded by direct advertising by e-mail.
It may be tempting to make comparisons with conventional mailshots, but this is inappropriate.
Let us remain faithful to our original approach, without drawing any hasty conclusions, and wait for the outcomes of this House' s wise decision - which was adopted with an overwhelming majority - on the e-Commerce Directive: opt-out as a minimum standard, and the option of opt-in for Member States, with monitoring of the two approaches.
Mr President, the Commission communication on the safe Information Society complements the preceding initiatives, in particular the global plan of action for electronic communications in Europe, and will require further interventions in a field that is constantly evolving.
The CederschiÃ¶ld report approves of this initiative and enhances it with appropriate legislative measures and suggestions for cooperation instruments to increase the effectiveness of the fight against cybercrime and to ensure a balance between demands for the prevention and punishment of crime and respect for civil liberties.
This balance, which is guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must always guide the actions of the European Union, and for this reason, too, the broad and accurate CederschiÃ¶ld report deserves our full agreement.
The Commission' s draft directive also deserves great appreciation; it aims to update personal data protection in the electronic communications sector and not to leave things as they are, since harmonisation is necessary.
On the one hand, the Cappato report proposes useful additions to the directive which reinforce the limits placed on the invasion of privacy by public authorities, especially as regards forms of generalised electronic surveillance, which was discussed this morning.
In this it will certainly be supported, even though, unfortunately, our legislative powers do not exist in this area.
In other respects, however, the Cappato report reduces the protection of citizens' privacy offered by the draft directive, particularly where we have legislative competence.
The Commission proposes that European citizens' e-mail addresses and mobile telephone data could be included in public lists and given out on-line only if the interested parties had given their prior consent.
The Cappato report, on the other hand, proposes that e-mail addresses and mobile telephone data should be included on public lists and each interested party could ask to have them taken off.
An analogous difference, we have already heard, concerns the regulation of unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes.
The European Commission proposes that messages should not be sent except to those who have given their own express consent, just as now happens with faxes.
The Cappato report proposes that the opt-out system could also be adopted.
If you consider the speed at which a list of e-mail addresses could be circulated on-line and come to the attention of an unlimited number of people interested in sending unsolicited messages, and if you consider the cost in time and money of eliminating these unwelcome messages and sending requests to the various senders to stop forwarding them, you will have an idea of the burden on citizens of adopting the opt-out system.
It is a prospect that runs the risk of discouraging and deterring people from using the net and e-commerce.
In an amusing article, an Italian journalist wrote: 'I thought I had bought a little telephone, but found myself with a tamagochi, that Japanese toy that needs looking after like a baby.
My phone company never leaves me alone; it sends me so many messages, like a teenager; it asks me if I want to take part in a competition, if I know about certain new discounts; it greets me when I go abroad, and then it welcomes me back.'
Just think when your mobile number and e-mail address are known not only by your own service provider but by all possible service providers in the world, who never confine themselves to selling goods but want their brand to please you, to seduce you and to belong to you.
If we want e-commerce to have a future, we cannot force consumers to spend their time cancelling unwanted messages or pursuing their senders to beg to be left in peace.
There is no reason not to ensure the same protection for e-mail as there is for faxes; the highest level of protection of people' s rights will also ensure the highest consumer loyalty.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, freedom of expression and freedom of choice are a precious right for liberals, but not at any price.
The receipt of e-mail is considerably less free of strings for the receiver than the receipt of paper leaflets and brochures.
The costs may total EUR 10 billion annually for receivers, not to mention the cost in time.
We therefore need, just as with paper leaflets, "No thank you" stickers.
Personally, I would gladly opt for self-regulation by industry, but in practice it is clear that "opt-out" is not sustainable.
For this reason, the Liberal group will support the Commission' s proposal for "opt-in" .
Meanwhile there is a bill before the US congress for an "opt-in" that paves the way for sound agreements worldwide, which is necessary in an age of unlimited communication.
Unwanted post will not be limited to the Internet.
The mobile telephone sector will play an increasing role in the period ahead, so that companies and consumers will be saddled with high costs, while the infrastructure becomes very vulnerable.
My second remark concerns the storage of traffic data.
I refer to the ECHELON debate of this morning.
In my view it is an invasion of privacy if traffic data are stored for longer than necessary.
As a result consumers will never gain the necessary trust in e-commerce.
In conclusion, the rules within the Union should be harmonised.
After all, our telecom companies work in a pan-European way and therefore need uniform rules so that legal uncertainty is ruled out.
For this reason, subsidiarity in this field is not an option.
Mr President, the right of freedom of expression entitles companies to display their wares on the Internet.
But that does not mean that they can force people to read what is there.
I regularly receive unwanted advertising on my e-mail.
I have often had to struggle through English language forms in order to fill in at the very end that I wish to be removed from the mailing list. Still, I am regularly unsuccessful.
An "opt-out" arrangement is bad for the consumer.
The latter is dependent on the goodwill of the company in actually deleting his or her name.
Deletion itself is time consuming and at the consumer' s expense.
It is often claimed that good companies only mail in a targeted way.
But first of all, in that case, supporters of the system are already assuming that there are a substantial number of bad companies that make a mess of things, and secondly, it may be well targeted from a marketing point of view if I receive information about baby clothes, but I do not want to download romper suits or nappies to my screen at my own expense.
Well targeted from a marketing point of view does not necessarily mean either welcome or limited.
If unsolicited advertising eventually really does take off, I foresee a situation where many people will turn away from the open Internet and e-mail. In that case freedom of expression will have suffered a great setback.
Mr President, I should like to join in congratulating the rapporteurs on their work.
Obviously the whole area of new technologies is one that has presented us with many problems as well as boundless opportunities.
Unfortunately, however, as with most new opportunities, these have been hijacked to a huge extent by people of criminal intent who use them for illicit means.
Therefore the onus is on us to ensure that we can put in place proper controls and measures, not with regard to access, but ensuring that parents can make certain their children will not be endangered by these new technologies and also that there is cooperation amongst the law enforcement agencies across the Member States.
I welcome the fact that in the reports there is a role for Europol and Eurojust as well as between the Member States.
I also welcome the establishment of the forum on cybercrime.
This is an important area where we can bring all the actors together, including the manufacturers of equipment who can put in place certain things that can help us.
Finally, it is a forward looking plan when we look at cooperation with the United States of America and other countries throughout the world, to ensure that this new technology can be used for the benefit of all of mankind and not for those who want to avoid our legal structures.
Mr President, with regard to the procedure followed in the approval of my report, Mr Van Velzen has made reference to a possible violation of procedure.
I ask the presidency to clarify this point for tomorrow' s debate, because I do not want there to be this ambiguity.
If the procedure has been violated, the work in violation of the procedure should be cancelled; if the procedure has been respected, it has been respected.
I believe this is the least we owe to the House.
Personally, as rapporteur of the committee with competence in the matter, I have never been consulted by any of the other committees; had it been an 'enhanced Hughes procedure' - which it is not - I would have had to be consulted.
However it may be - I am not an expert on procedure - and I ask that a check be made as to whether the procedures were violated. Results in violation of the procedures should be cancelled.
Mr Cappato, the presidency takes note of what you have just said.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I want to thank Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld and Mr Cappato for the sound work they have done.
I am in no doubt that the forum supported by the Commission and Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld will highlight new issues and new problems.
Moreover, the political front lines will probably not be the usual ones.
This was also abundantly clear in today' s debate on electronic communications.
I want to point out that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party does not support Amendment No 55, for I think that the Committee' s proposal is clearer on the issue of storing communications data.
A minority of the ELDR Group believes that we should wait and see how these systems work and that we should apply the principle of subsidiarity.
We support Amendment No 61 concerning the supervision clause.
Our approach is characterised by humility, for we do not believe that any of these proposals is the decisive factor. Rather, it is enlightened citizens who decide.
I believe that many of those who will be making decisions in the House tomorrow are really not aware that the issue of spamming is, in large part, also regulated through the general data protection directive.
We have a situation, for example in Great Britain, in which 44 per cent of all e-traders do not know that they are contravening this directive.
Moreover, people do not know what service they can obtain.
I believe that responsible and aware behaviour on the part of consumers is the most important thing of all.
I come from a country in which we have an opt-in arrangement, but we still cannot do anything regarding, for example, people who make use of changed addresses.
We are constantly seeing different forms of spamming.
I wonder if we shall begin to be required to have some form of register of addresses in the future.
I want to ask the Commission whether it has considered addressing the issue in the transatlantic or global dialogue.
What truth is there in what is said about America' s attitude?
We have received different information about this.
Many say that the Bush administration does not yet intend to do anything, that it is too soon and that there is a wish to monitor technical developments.
I also wonder which rules apply if a European company spams outside the EU.
Is it the e-commerce directive or this directive which applies in that case?
Mr President, I would like to focus my remarks this evening on Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld' s report.
That is why I am here, having shadowed it in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
I would like to commend Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld on the way that she has incorporated so many of the opinions of different committees into a very comprehensive report and also to congratulate the Commission on this initiative.
I feel this is a very worthwhile and challenging document.
One of the problems with the report is that it contains a huge amount of material and potential actions and priorities will therefore have to be set.
So this evening I should just like to address what I believe is a crucial problem that needs to be looked at in the short term: the whole question of how we encourage the development of electronic commerce to use these tools, to address the sort of business issues that some colleagues are already trying to frustrate, in my view, by moving prematurely to the sort of rigid opt-in arrangement that they are talking about.
The e-commerce market is at a very early stage and is still underdeveloped.
We do not want to choke it off by some of the things that we are talking about. But we do need to address the security issues.
A very important report produced by the British business association, the CBI, last week clearly showed that both businesses and consumers are discouraged from moving into the electronic commerce market place because of concerns about security.
Businesses, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, are worried about the vulnerability of their enterprises to fraud and fraudulent transactions.
I suggest to you that one of the things that we must work on is to ensure that small and medium sized enterprises get the benefits of this revolution.
Consumers are worried about getting involved in transactions because they are worried about the security of their payments.
Those are the critical issues we have to tackle.
We have to combine that with a regime that allows SMEs to use e-commerce in a targeted and effective way.
So I will combine my remarks on both reports by saying that I believe we are taking the right course with Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld and the right course with Mr Cappato.
Mr President, the new information and communication technologies have a fundamental impact on the daily lives of our citizens and on the very economy of our societies.
It is, therefore, becoming crucial to ensure that there is rigorous protection against potential abuses or even criminal acts.
We talk of cybercrime, both in terms of fundamental rights and privacy and also in the context of services of general interest, bank transfers, investments, credit card fraud amongst others.
Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld is therefore right to call for a coherent European strategy which, on the one hand, ensures the freedom of the market and improves the security of information services and infrastructures and, on the other, fights against criminal activities that affect not only the interests of individual citizens but also public interest itself.
We are also discussing the report by Mr Cappato, whom I should like to congratulate on his work on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector.
This is a report that warranted a lengthy debate and which seeks to find a balance between the protection of private life, the legal aspects and the interests of industry.
Apart from the issues concerning intervention by Member States when carrying out criminal investigations, the main issue concerns spamming.
I agree with the position put forward by Mr von Boetticher on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but I must also add my own personal view: in terms of protecting the interests of consumers, I incline more towards the Commission' s proposal than to that tabled by Mr Cappato, more towards the opt-in solution than towards opting out.
The question is whether it is effective, especially if it is only adopted by the European Union.
This is an issue that concerns the Union' s relationship with its partners, something that has already been mentioned in this debate.
I am sure that none of us wishes to see an e-mail system becoming increasingly unusable because it is swamped and blocked up by countless messages of this type, unsolicited and often of dubious taste.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are talking about e-mails, spamming and a wide range of other subjects.
I think that we should distinguish between three main areas, i.e. from business to business, from business to customer and from customer to customer.
Then we should start thinking about principles.
I do not believe that a separate solution is necessarily required for each type of technical communication.
We are all familiar with the idea that you can attach a sticker to a mailbox.
We have all learned to use the telephone, mobiles, sms, and e-mail.
I think that the real challenge now is to think about how we want to use this technology and this range of information and advertising opportunities in future.
Of course, it is important to take values into account here.
I know people who say: I want to receive as much information as possible in a wide range of areas.
I want to be able to decide for myself what I keep and what I throw away.
There are others who say: I only want to receive the information which I have requested myself.
We are also familiar with this concept with regard to debt payable to, and debt collectible by, the creditor.
I think we should discuss this point in detail as well.
As regards cyber war and cybercrime, we should focus on three main points. We should step up research and development in this area, especially in Ispra near Milan.
I think there is a great deal of work to be done in this area, especially as regards security in the Commission and the Parliament.
We should think about the type of education and training we can offer in this field, e.g. at colleges of higher education and through university departments.
I think that action is needed here.
We must also think about the type of security infrastructure which should be available in the hardware and software fields in future.
Finally, I should like to say that a separation of powers is also important.
The prosecution services, the courts and the operators must work together to ensure that these systems are not abused.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Cappato and also Mrs Thors, Mr Bakopoulos and Mrs SchrÃ¶der of the various contributing committees of the European Parliament for this report.
I will start with the Cappato report.
I am pleased that Parliament is now debating this important directive which forms an essential element of the electronic communications regulatory reform package.
This will enable us to try and minimise the procedural delay which the data protection directive has incurred, as compared with the rest of the package.
I would also like to concentrate on two issues which have been discussed by so many.
First, opt-in for unsolicited commercial e-mails and the question of traffic data retention for law enforcement purposes.
It appears from the debate that the proposed opt-in for unsolicited commercial e-mails divides opinions in this House.
This is understandable, since this is a complex issue and arguments on both sides of the debate have some merit.
However, I am convinced that the Commission proposal for opt-in is best, for essentially two reasons.
First, the internal market needs a harmonised solution, a simple and clear rule throughout the EU.
It is particularly important in an economic sector which is so profoundly without frontiers as electronic commerce over the Internet is.
Mr van Velzen asked me a question about the applicability of subsidiarity in this field.
I want to be crystal clear.
It is legally impossible for opt-in countries to enforce their system with regard to mail coming from opt-out countries.
These two systems cannot exist because the opt-out regime will override any opt-in systems.
We can discuss subsidiarity but in practice it cannot work with the two systems.
The opt-out system, especially, will override the opt-in system.
The second reason is the cost issue which has been mentioned by many.
It is very difficult to justify that the recipients of unsolicited commercial e-mail will have to pay for messages which they do not want to receive.
Receiving paper advertising material in your traditional mail box is annoying, but at least you do not pay for it.
You do not pay for the printing, you do not pay for the transport.
E-mail marketing may well be the only form of marketing where the recipient carries most of the cost.
In addition, removing unsolicited e-mails from mail servers entails a substantial cost for Internet service providers.
For that reason, Internet service providers strongly favour opt-in solutions.
Finally, we must remember that the Internet is going mobile.
This is starting now with SMS messages. But this legislation will concern all e-mails which will go in future to mobile terminals.
That will be more disruptive than receiving such messages on your PC.
Imagine the mobile device in your pocket beeping all the time to announce the arrival of yet another commercial offer you cannot refuse and you want to keep your mobile phone on because you want to be connected with the people close to you.
Moreover, messages to mobile terminals may also entail an even bigger cost, if the subscriber is roaming like most of us gathered here tonight.
We are roaming practically all the time.
With the advent of the Mobile Internet, the costs and nuisance of unsolicited communications will therefore increase significantly.
Mrs Thors raised two questions.
Firstly the situation in the United States.
I had the privilege to participate in many discussions with the Members of the Senate and the US Congress in this field.
Today, there are about 60 proposals in Congress on that issue.
In general, it is agreed that the present opt-out system has a lot of problems, but the solutions vary.
There are some who go for opt-in solutions, there are others who present different schemes to make strict rules such as that there should be a penalty for a company that does not take your name away as soon as you ask.
I cannot say that there is one simple solution, there is criticism of the present opt-out practice.
There are powerful Members of Senate and the Congress who advocate opt-in solutions.
You will be able to contact these people especially when the Internet caucus of Congress visits Europe in the next few weeks.
As far as the applicability of an opt-in regime outside Europe is concerned, the GATT agreement allows its members to take measures to enforce their data protection legislation within their territory.
On this basis, the EU can require non-EU based companies to comply with its opt-in legislation.
Mr Coelho asked whether it is difficult to control.
In this kind of world it is very difficult to draft legislation which is 100% waterproof. But I am sure that opt-out will be much more difficult to control than opt-in.
There is no harmonised system.
There are hundreds of thousands of databases, practices, private operations and if anybody is optimistic I invite you to try.
You could, for example, start by sending a letter to all those companies whose material you no longer wish to receive and then check how many will remove your name during the following days and how many respond to your request.
It is something anybody can try.
I have done it myself.
I am not optimistic.
The opt-in regime is one uniform legal solution.
We have difficulties there but I am sure that they are less than with the present opt-out regime.
For these reasons the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 19, 41 and 42.
However, knowing how difficult this issue is, and how divided opinions have been in this House, we should also look for compromise solutions and I want to be open and constructive on this issue.
We therefore welcome the constructive compromise amendments 53 and 62 which have been presented.
The Commission is willing to look for solutions along the lines of these amendments, but subject to some redrafting and streamlining within the existing legal framework.
The second important issue I would like to mention is general traffic retention for law enforcement purposes.
On this one, I have the impression that the Commission and the European Parliament are on the same line.
The existing telecommunications data protection directive states that traffic data must be erased when they are no longer needed for the provision of the service and for billing.
In addition, there is a clause referring to the reasons for which Member States may adopt specific legal measures in derogation of this principle in exceptional cases.
These reasons include, inter alia, national security, defence, and the investigation and prosecution of crimes.
We discussed these issues earlier today in this House.
Since the rights protected in this existing and proposed directive are based on Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - under the protection of privacy of home, family life and correspondence - any exception must remain within the rules established by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
As we discussed this morning during the Echelon debate, it is important that the rules for both citizens and for the State are very clear and precise regarding the rights and obligations in this sensitive area.
Therefore, the Commission can support Amendment No 4 which strengthens the recital text on this point.
However, the Commission is not in favour of copying the same text into Article 15, as proposed by Amendment 50, as it may overstep the legal basis of the directive.
In summary, out of the 62 amendments submitted to plenary, 35 can be fully supported by the Commission.
These are Amendments Nos 1 to 4, 7 to 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21 to 29, 31 to 35, 37, 39, 45, 49, 51, 52, 56 and 57.
Another seven amendments which can be supported in part or in principle subject to certain drafting changes are 5, 46 to 48, 53, 60 and 62.
I mentioned two of these earlier.
But there are 20 amendments which the Commission cannot support: 6, 11, 13, 16, 19, 20, 30, 36, 38, 40 to 44, 50, 54, 55, 58 and 59.
As regards the CederschiÃ¶ld report, I would like to thank the honourable Members of the European Parliament for the constructive approach to the Commission communication on cybercrime and cybersecurity.
I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, and also Mrs McCarthy and Mrs Zorba, the draftspersons of the contributing committees.
The report identifies key issues for further consideration.
Many of the recommendations in the report are in line with the current view of the Commission on policy development to combat cybercrime and improve security.
There is one recommendation, however, of which I have to say that it is not acceptable to the Commission, that is Recommendation No 5 concerning the transfer of responsibilities for data protection within the Commission and to concentrating responsibility for certain other tasks in single units.
This is a matter of internal organisation of the Commission which should be left entirely to the discretion of the President of the Commission.
Concerning the other recommendations, in as far as they are not already parts of plans for policy development, the Commission will give them full consideration, and will see how far they can be incorporated in upcoming or new initiatives.
As you know, this communication was issued in January this year.
It has been sponsored jointly by Commissioner Vitorino and myself.
This has been the first comprehensive policy statement of the European Commission on the issue of cybercrime.
In March, the Commission organised a public hearing.
Over 400 people came to Brussels to attend this event, which shows the strong interest of the public in participating in this discussion.
Next the Commission will shortly issue a proposal for a framework decision on combating serious attacks against information systems.
This initiative addresses acts like hacking, denial-of-service attacks, and the spread of viruses.
In June, the Commission issued a communication on network and information security, which I presented this morning in this House in detail.
This communication deals with preventive organisational and technical measures, and is complementary to the framework decision, which deals with ex-post criminal investigations.
At the technical level, as part of the Information Society Technologies Programme, the Commission is promoting research and development to understand and reduce vulnerabilities and stimulate the dissemination of know-how.
IST projects focus in particular on the development of confidence-building technologies.
The first legislative initiative announced in the communication has already been issued: a proposal for a framework decision that includes measures to combat child pornography.
I fully share the strong opinions expressed on this issue in this House tonight.
The communication has announced a forum in which the relevant parties will have the opportunity to discuss various issues to find an appropriate balance between network security, law enforcement powers, privacy protection and economic priority.
An open debate is vital to achieve an effective, coherent and balanced policy approach and to assure confidence and trust among European citizens.
Confidence and trust of the users is directly related to the take-up of electronic commerce and to the success of the Information Society.
The report of the European Parliament is an important milestone in this policy debate.
Mr President, the Commissioner made clear why, in his opinion, an opt-in and an opt-out system cannot operate in parallel in this directive.
But I have to ask him another question.
It is of vital importance for my group to know why it is possible in the electronic commerce directive.
Perhaps the Commissioner can give us an answer to that.
The reason was that the electronic commerce directive excluded all issues relating to data protection.
That was the reason they were dealt with in a different context in the data protection directive and in this directive.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Implementation of competition rules
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0229/2001) by Mr Evans, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the implementation of rules on competition.
Mr President, of all the issues debated this week there is none that can have a greater impact on the economic wealth of Europe than the reform of competition policy.
Fair and open competition is the bedrock on which the single European market is built and on which the growth of European economies depends.
That is why we must maintain our determination to root out monopolists and those who engage in shady anti-competitive price fixing or market sharing deals.
These actions not only undermine the interests of commercial competitors, they rip off consumers and undermine the dynamic competitive economy on which our future economic interests rely.
But we must also recognise that Commissioner Monti' s weapons for tackling such abuses are sadly out of date.
The Commission' s White Paper on competition policy reform highlighted the difficulties.
The 40 year old procedure under Regulation 17 had become a bureaucratic paper-pushing exercise.
The Commission wants radical change, devolving the application of EU competition law to national authorities in order to refocus its efforts in rooting out cartels and the abuse of market power.
Parliament agreed with these objectives.
But we strongly spelt out our concern on important issues like the need for legal certainty.
We also pointed to the possible danger of the reform leading to inconsistent application or even the renationalisation of competition policy, thereby destroying the single market.
These were real concerns voiced by many Members of the House as well as significant sectors of the business community throughout Europe.
I recognised and shared those worries and some colleagues and representatives of European business still share them today.
Nevertheless I believe that Commissioner Monti has genuinely taken account of our concerns and the Commission' s proposal reflects this.
Above all I want to draw attention to Article 3 of the regulation, which unambiguously states that in cases affecting trade between Member States it is European competition law that takes precedence.
This is a core requirement of the single market and strongly supported by all sides in our committee debates.
For us, the preservation of Article 3 is an essential part of this reform.
We recognise that there may well be some Member States that will try to dilute its impact.
We consider that Article 3 is such a central element of the reform that we will wish to be consulted again if the Council obliges the Commission to make any significant change to this article.
We have proposed a number of amendments in order to improve the operation of this radical reform.
We found, for instance, little support outside the Bundeskartellamt for the new registration scheme under Article 4, which we consider to be time-wasting and valueless.
We want it scrapped.
We have proposed a range of amendments to improve legal certainty for business, including the widening of Article 10 - changes which have received widespread business support.
We have urged proper safeguards on Commission powers in relation to the application of structural remedies.
We have suggested that penalties imposed under EU law by national authorities should be those provided for in EU law.
We have also proposed changes in the transitional arrangements and in undertaking a timely review.
We have also wrestled with the issue of the appropriate treatment of communications from in-house legal advisers.
I am deeply indebted to my colleague, Mr Rovsing, for the attention that he has given to this issue.
There are different rules in operation in different parts of the European Union.
We have tried to ensure that the professional status of in-house lawyers is acknowledged, whilst not impeding the Commission in the thorough investigation of possible infringements.
In the committee vote I indicated that this situation could possibly be resolved by a Commission declaration clarifying the treatment of such evidence in the application of Commission penalties.
Mr Rovsing and I now understand that Commissioner Monti may have it in mind to make some such declaration, in which event our group will no longer consider it appropriate to retain Amendment No 10.
This debate has also highlighted other important but wider issues of competition policy reform.
We welcome the dynamism which Commissioner Monti has brought to his brief.
"Supermario" , as he has been labelled in the media, has taken the lead and not only in pressing for radical reform in Europe.
He has been at the centre of moves towards the worldwide coordination of competition policy and enforcement.
We are sure that in an increasingly global economy such radical reform will be necessary.
But we also believe in checks and balances and we want the Commission' s actions to be fully reviewable by the Court of Justice.
Our committee thanks Commissioner Monti for his commitment to real and meaningful dialogue.
But we reiterate our objective of Parliament moving towards full codecision in respect of these matters.
The interest of my parliamentary colleagues in competition policy issues is not just some academic exercise for commercial lawyers.
In an increasingly global world we recognise that effective competition is the essential motor for the growth of European economies and the welfare of the people we have been sent here to represent depends on fair and open competition in order to drive that growth forward.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in a similar position to Mr von Boetticher in the previous debate.
I do not want to go into details on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
We think that Mr Evans has produced a good, well-rounded report, and congratulate him on doing so.
The amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and adopted by the committee responsible are intended to enhance the rapporteur' s report.
Let me give you an example. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has called for the new text to state that decisions must be made public, not 'may be published' , as the old text might imply, although confidential information is obviously excluded.
However, I would like to draw attention to one point which the rapporteur has also just mentioned, and highlight it to the Commissioner and the qualified minority of expert colleagues who are still assembled here. I am referring to Amendment No 10 proposed by the committee responsible.
Many Member States provide for confidentiality, i.e. legal privilege, between client and counsel.
This is part of established legal reality in the majority of Member States.
Whenever an individual wants to bare his soul completely, he needs a confidant; this may be a doctor, a solicitor or, in a religious situation, a priest.
Amendment No 10 safeguards this traditional relationship between legal counsel and client and extends it to in-house lawyers as well.
The Commissioner may assure us that disclosures from the documents held by such legal counsel will not result in stiffer sentences.
However, it is not very helpful, in my view, to set an upper limit on sentencing and say: Even your legal counsel told you not to do this.
Since you chose to do it anyway, your sentence will be increased.
This is sensible, but I would point out that such a declaration would not be sufficient, for the disclosures to legal counsel would, of course, almost certainly constitute significant evidence of guilt.
This violates professional independence and the principle of confidentiality between client and counsel.
In my view, we have to decide one way or the other.
"A bit pregnant" cannot exist here.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur once again for presenting his very good report in response to the Commission' s proposals, as well as the amendments put forward by the committee.
Thank you very much.
We all know that the competition rules go back to 1957, that Regulation 17 dates back to 1962, and that virtually all the framework conditions have changed since then.
On the one hand, we are confronted with globalisation; on the other hand, the European Union, originally a Community of six, will expand to a Community of 25 in future, and I personally think it is a good thing that the centralised system which reserved the right of application of Articles 81 and 82 exclusively to the Commission is now being restructured as a decentralised system.
However, this must not lead to the renationalisation of competition policy.
In reality, this is prevented by the fact that European law takes precedence over national law, and I anticipate that the current proposal will create fair competition and equal competition conditions.
It will also ensure legal certainty for all enterprises and the uniform application of competition policy, and will simplify procedures in line with the one-stop-shop principle.
It will coordinate the activities of the national - in my view, independent - competition authorities and enable the national authorities and courts to cooperate closely with the Commission. It will establish a clear division of responsibilities between the national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and cartel law, and ensure that the Commission continues to be the guardian of the treaties and thus has more time to devote to real problems, i.e. controlling mergers and cartels.
Many congratulations on having the courage to take these initiatives.
I wish we could see more of this in other areas too.
Mr President, since another member of my Group has given up his speaking time, I believe that I have accumulated additional time. In any event, I will not use it up.
Mr President, Mr Evans - whom I congratulate on his report - was absolutely right when he said that this is a very important issue, although it is also true that questions relating to the reform procedure in the field of competition do not inspire interest amongst the citizens, despite their importance for the economic world.
However, personally, I must confess that, for me, to participate in the reform of the rules on the procedure in the field of competition gives me particular personal satisfaction.
Because to participate, although in a very modest way, in the process of repealing Regulation 17 of 1962, against which I have fought a long-standing battle and on which I have written repeatedly in a very critical manner, is, I must confess, hugely gratifying.
But at the burial of this regulation, and may it be well buried, which I have always seen as wretched, perhaps at this time, with due respect for the dead, we should a pay slightly fairer tribute by recognising what has been good about it historically.
Regulation 17 made some sense at the time it was approved, that is, in 1962, when the application of Community competition law was being born, which could justify a centralisation of the powers of the Commission, in a Community of seven countries with less than 200 million inhabitants.
But the problem with Regulation 17 was not its creation or the rules it established at the time of its creation.
The problem has been its maintenance for almost forty years, during which conditions had changed radically.
Anybody who had contact with the Commission' s procedures in the field of competition was aware of the dissatisfaction caused by its application.
Finally - and fortunately - the Commission has opted to yield to the evidence and promote the derogation of this Regulation, replacing it with a more up-to-date regulation, in line with the views of the White Paper on the modernisation of the Community rules in the field of competition.
In the report produced on the White Paper, this Parliament had the opportunity to express its favourable opinion, although with some fine-tuning in certain cases.
This fine-tuning was perhaps related to the reticence of certain members of certain countries which had had a decisive influence on the creation of their national system and a fundamental influence on the Regulation of the procedure.
Of course, I did not feel this reticence.
I believe that the new approaches in the field of Community competition law not only constitute an enormous effort to modernise that Community law but also an effort in the right direction.
Today we are being presented with a legislative text which, to a large extent, responds to what had been anticipated in the White Paper.
And it also, to a certain extent, takes up some of the observations made at the time by this Parliament.
It is the case that in some respects the proposed regulation has surprised us with extremes which had not been laid out in the White Paper.
I am referring specifically to the provision of Article 7 on the possibility of adopting structural measures as a result of a decision on a case of prohibited conduct.
This consists, no more and no less, of adopting measures such as the splitting up of companies, particularly of those which have abused their dominant position.
As you know, these measures are normal in United States law.
Hence the Microsoft case and the famous case of the seven sisters, the splitting up of the Rockefeller oil company, possibilities which are enormously innovative within European law.
I personally support this measure unreservedly; and the fine-tuning which has been introduced by means of amendments in this Parliament are simply a demonstration of a desire that this power be used prudently, as I am sure the Commission is going to do.
Perhaps it is the case that in other respects the Commission' s proposal is not fully in line with what was approved at the time by the European Parliament.
Specifically, at the time this Parliament favoured a genuine procedural regulation which would regulate the logical principles of any judicial regulation, even if it was simply by incorporating the customs which the Directorate-General for Competition had introduced over almost forty years.
In this regard, the Commission' s proposal has been more timid than in other respects, but, in any event, if the amendments contained in the Evans report are adopted, or those still maintained by this parliamentary Group, this shortcoming may be corrected.
There are other points on which perhaps our satisfaction is not complete.
It is true that there is no single standard in the field of the guarantees of process or rights to defence.
But those of us who come from a country where the same principles are applied to administrative penalty procedures, with a constitutional guarantee, as to the criminal procedure, and the same rights are granted to physical persons as to legal persons, would have liked this standard, this level of guarantees, to have been raised in accordance with the amendments approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which have not been incorporated into the text.
However, at the end of the day, in my country we say that 'the best is the enemy of the good' and there is absolutely no doubt that this is a good regulation which we are supporting.
You had indeed accumulated Mrs Randzio-Plath' s time, a total of six minutes, which you have received.
Mr President, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Evans, very much for what has been sound and constructive cooperation that has led to a good report.
It has been a great pleasure to cooperate with you.
The continuation of sound competition policy is the main aim of the review being undertaken by legislation in the area of competition.
In Denmark this very summer, we have seen the importance of effective competition policy.
In that connection, I should like to commend and thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your active contribution regarding the great SAS/Maersk aviation issue which has enlivened our summer recess and which involved the discovery of an illegal cartel and the imposition of a large fine.
Without your and the Commission' s efforts, such progress would never have been made on this issue and consumers would never have received help.
I am therefore satisfied with Article 3 of the Commission' s proposal, which clearly states that it is the Community' s and not the Member States' competition law that is applied when it comes to transnational issues of competition.
For the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, it is vital that there be no renationalisation of the EU' s competition policy.
It is, of course, no secret that there are many of us who are concerned that the Commission' s proposal might lead to renationalisation and thus to an undermining of the internal market, something which would hit small and medium-sized companies hardest and be to the disadvantage of consumers.
You must therefore promise us, Commissioner, to keep a very careful eye on the national competition authorities, and I can assure you that I shall keep an eye on you and make sure you live up to our expectations, something which you have, of course, done so far.
I should therefore also like to strike a blow for the Commission' s competition authority being given more resources so that we do not run the risk of competition policy being watered down and taken over by the Member States.
If, as is rumoured, the Council rejects Article 3, I would strongly urge you, Mr Monti, to withdraw your entire proposal and start afresh.
Without Article 3, the proposal is unacceptable to the ELDR Group.
The Council' s hesitation concerning Article 3 makes it abundantly clear how crucial it is for Parliament to be given the right of codecision making on competition policy.
This is something that Parliament has demanded for many years now and, with the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the time must now be ripe for action.
Mr President, like those fellow Members who have spoken before me, I approve the principle of competition policy reform proposed by the Commission.
I welcome decentralisation.
The present centralised method, which means that there is a backlog of cases, is inevitably somewhat arbitrary.
It cannot guarantee legal certainty.
However, I believe that reform will inevitably lead to an extremely interesting raising of the stakes as regards the clarification and development of the rules.
And it is on that point that I differ somewhat.
Article 3 is clearly vital.
It establishes the principle that Community law overrides national law in cases where practices are likely to affect trade between Member States.
But this principle is not acceptable without some clarification.
For example, in the case of services of general interest or other services that are essential for the Member States and the regions, I am convinced that there is a need for derogating provisions.
At the very least, the Commission should, as proposed by the Economic and Social Committee, present an interpretative communication on this subject.
Article 10 is another important article.
It rightly provides that the Commission can make observations to the Member States for reasons of Community public interest.
Some clarification is essential here too.
Jonathan Evans highlights the example of major investments.
Services of general interest also need to be mentioned in this particular respect.
Two final remarks.
The rapporteur is right to stress that it is contradictory to replace prior notification by a register.
I think that we should do away with the register.
He is right to call for convergence in national law.
That is the heart of the problem.
It supposes that other countries' cultures are respected and that a certain balance is achieved between competition, social and environmental standards, including standards for general interest services.
So take a look at the Langen report and other reports.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Italian Radicals will vote for the report by Mr Evans, who has done an excellent job.
I believe that the measures we are discussing represent a serious attempt to face up to an unavoidable problem - the risk that the Commission will end up overwhelmed by notifications - and I think it was both right and courageous to choose to base this reform on decentralisation to national authorities and courts.
The alternative would have been to create a mammoth, over-bureaucratised structure in its directorate general, all the more so, of course, with the prospect of enlargement.
Of course, only experience will tell us if we are heading into an incomprehensible mosaic or a situation that guarantees legal certainty and, I might say, unity of law within the single European market.
I believe, however, that the attempt should be sustained, just as I believe there will be a very warm welcome for the abolition of mandatory notification and authorisation and the introduction of the exception rule, which seems to me a rather more liberal principle, especially in a sector - that of regulating authorities and competition - which is always running the risk of being a different, new instrument for state interference in market dynamics.
This is certainly not the case of the Commission, but a number of authorities - I am thinking of certain central banks, for instance, which in fact preserve anti-trust powers over the credit market - run this risk in my opinion, and sometimes go even further.
In conclusion, I believe, however, that strengthening the sanctioning and investigative powers of the Commission, which are in fact contained in the provision, Commissioner, requires suitable procedural and legal guarantees - this point is raised in Mr Evans' s justification - especially in a situation like Europe' s, in which the Commission accumulates the functions of both the investigator, one might say, and the judge, since we are not in a system in which the judge is a third party.
Of course, there are appeals, decisions can be appealed against, but I believe that in this, in the guarantees for the parties involved in the proceedings, the greatest guarantees must be assured.
Mr President, yesterday I was in this House addressing the issue of the European Aviation Safety Agency when I noted that the means by which it was being achieved was through the gradual integration of the national systems.
Naturally, as you would expect from me as a leader of a party that puts national sovereignty above the integrationalist tendencies of the EU, I strongly object to this process of gradual integration.
Today, under the different heading of reform of competition policy I find that I am confronted with exactly the same thing - yet another attempt by the Commission to achieve the gradual integration of national systems.
But what makes this attempt particularly sinister is that it is being sold under the beguiling and wholly misleading claim that the reform is - I quote from the session' s news briefing - "to free hard-pressed Commission staff in the Competition Policy Department from routine matters to enable them to concentrate on major cases of non-competitive behaviour" .
Although giving Commission officials an easier life might be one effect of this proposal, the way this is being done is to give national competition authorities limited powers to enforce the competition rules hitherto the monopoly of the Commission.
But these authorities are neither independent, as it is claimed, nor free to act.
They are being granted licenses to act for the Commission in accordance with Community rules, under the supervision of the Commission and responsible to it.
The Commission wants the competition authorities to form a network at the centre of which is the Commission.
In other words, the Commission wants civil servants in the different Member States, paid salaries by the Member States, in government buildings paid for by the Member States, using facilities provided by and paid for by Member State governments, to work not for the Member States which finance them, but for the Commission implementing Community law.
Amazingly - and it is a reflection of how superficial is the view and understanding of so many commentators - this is seen and presented as subsidiarity and decentralisation.
It is anything but decentralisation.
It is the opposite, absorbing the civil servants of many countries into one vast centralised nexus.
That is what the network is: everyone working for the one central authority - the Commission.
As for subsidiarity, this is not a matter of Member States being able to make their own decisions and run their own affairs at local level. This is the Commission running Member States' affairs, using the resources and the facilities of those Member States as if they were its own.
That state of affairs, it seems, also applies to the courts which will hear the cases in Member States.
Although they may nominally be the courts of the Member States and their running costs are paid for by the Member States, they are - as the draftsman so clearly reminded us - courts of Community law underlying the whole Community judicial system.
In other words, not only are Member States' civil servants being absorbed into the maw of the Community, but the courts are too.
All this is being done in the name of efficiency.
It should be remembered that the most efficient form of government is the centralised dictatorship.
The least efficient is the democracy.
In important ways, therefore, efficiency is the enemy of democracy.
I fear that in the supposed interests of efficiency we are surrendering something much more valuable - the very democracy at the heart of all our nations - to the centralised technocracy which is the Commission.
This is not so much integration as assimilation.
It will all end in tears.
Mr President, there is a general agreement that we clearly need some reform in some competition rules, and especially in their practical implementation.
Regulation 1017 has been applied with only little modification since the 1960s.
It is therefore understandable that the continued application of this regulation in its current form is no longer consistent with effective supervision of competition.
We have to serve our consumers and our companies better with up-to-date rules of application.
In my view, in a period of 30 years of implementation, EC competition law has reached a level where decentralising is not only possible, but almost necessary.
We are all aware of the workload of the DG for competition and we understand that we have to do something to reduce it, or drastically increase the resources in Brussels.
At the same time, we hear our voters reminding us how we should respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and that we should avoid centralising all decision making to Brussels bureaucrats.
In that question, I totally disagree with Mr Titford.
With the reform at hand we are able to achieve many of our objectives.
Ending the current system of prior notification should benefit business and make more resources available to the Commission to concentrate on more serious infringements.
Ex ante notification should not be replaced with a burdensome registration system.
However, the shift to the new regime will not be an easy task.
It is of the utmost importance to ensure that competition issues within the EU are treated similarly in all Member States.
There are many detailed situations where legal certainty might be a danger.
Personally I, and many of my colleagues from smaller Member States, are worried about the definitions of dominant position in the market.
Companies from Member States - especially from the smaller Member States - should have equal possibilities to grow in the single market and to achieve a strategic position to compete with the global rivals.
The Commission decision to say no to the Volvo/Scania merger was an example of the situation where the relevant market definition was maybe too narrow.
The Commission should not declare that the market is national or regional if there is clear evidence that is not the case.
Mr President, I can tell you that it is a long time since the Danish people have heard so much about the EU as they have in the last few weeks, and that is something for which we can thank Commissioner Monti His work opposing cartels has been front page news for a couple of weeks.
It has been thoroughly debated on television and radio, and it has led to debates within the population and in the Danish parliament. That is something for which I would thank the Commissioner, and I have observed that there has been support in all quarters for what the Commissioner has done.
We can therefore say that competition law has been accorded an important place in the Danish consciousness. That is something for which I would thank you.
In connection with Amendment No 10, there have been discussions between the Commissioner and his employees and, especially, between myself and my own employees.
We have observed the need for the Commission to be given access to all papers if the Commission is effectively to be able to make use of its powers and go after those cartels which do not comply with the laws.
I agree that that is necessary, but company managements and boards need their experts to be able to give them proper, independent advice without those experts having to fear that, if something subsequently goes wrong because either board or management acts against their advice, this will entail an increased penalty.
I have understood from Commissioner Monti and his colleagues that this is a view he shares and, as Mr Evans has said, the Group of the European People' s Party will therefore vote against Amendment No 10 if the Commissioner submits such an opinion.
I would thank the Commissioner for his sound cooperation and for the fine work which he can be relied upon to carry out and which is of enormous importance, especially for small countries.
Mr President, I am glad that, in the report drawn up by Mr Evans, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs emphasises the importance of reform as a means of ensuring effective implementation of the rules on competition in an enlarged Community.
I would like to thank Mr Evans personally for his consideration for the Commission, his commitment in dealing with this issue and the high quality of his report.
Next I would like to thank the European Parliament as a whole and all those who have spoken this evening for the support and encouragement Parliament has given the Commission during the debates on the White Paper and ever since.
I must say our proposal for a regulation has greatly benefited from the comments, criticism and encouragement emanating from the committees and from this House.
The central purpose of the reform is to create a more effective system of implementation, to the benefit of consumers, businesses and the European economy in general.
Abolishing the current system of notification and authorisation and the exclusive power of the Commission under Article 81(3) means the Commission and the national competition authorities will be able to concentrate their efforts on combating the worst infringements.
The establishment of a network of authorities for the protection of competition will allow us to coordinate our efforts and use our respective resources to best effect.
The essential premise for the success of such cooperation is for all the competition authorities to apply the Community rules more widely, otherwise the planned network would just be an empty framework.
This is essential if we want to create uniform competitive conditions for common market businesses and prevent renationalisation of Community competition policy.
I keenly appreciate, therefore, the fact that Mr Evans fully and firmly supports the Commission' s proposal contained in Article 3, aimed at making Community competition law the only set of rules to be applied in cases where trade between Member States might be prejudiced.
This proposal has very wide implications and is meeting with resistance on the part of various Member States within the Council' s working group.
However, I remain convinced of the solid logical foundation of the proposal and I can assure you that the Commission is determined to establish uniform conditions for agreements that might prejudice trade between Member States.
Mr President, I would now like to touch on some of the specific issues that have emerged, starting with professional secrecy.
Effective implementation of the rules on competition is closely linked to the capacity of the Commission to obtain evidence on infringements.
Our powers are closely linked to documentary evidence.
We base a great deal of our work on on-site inspections, looking for documents which demonstrate the existence of cartels.
Any change likely to reduce the effectiveness of our inspections would therefore have grave consequences on the possibility of implementing the rules on competition and on their effectiveness.
That makes me extremely worried about the amendment to extend duty of secrecy to in-house lawyers.
I want to avoid any misunderstanding on one point, however: the Commission is perfectly aware of the positive role that in-house lawyers can play by counselling companies about observing the rules on competition.
That role will assume greater importance under the new system, where companies will have to carry out more systematic self-assessment of their agreements in particular to establish compliance with the exemption conditions laid down by Article 81(3).
However, the question of duty of secrecy for in-house lawyers essentially arises in the context of inspections attempting to establish the existence of serious restrictions which fail to comply with the provisions of Article 81(3).
In this context, the reform proposed by the Commission does not change the current situation at all.
We have to recognise that, unlike external lawyers, in-house lawyers are employees of the company and take their orders from it.
They are in a position of occupational dependence and may face a conflict of interest between loyalty towards their employers and respect for ethical standards.
Furthermore, internal communications between a company lawyer and his employer are so numerous and indistinguishable from purely company advice - which differs from legal advice - that duty of secrecy for in-house lawyers could create conditions ripe for concealing documentary evidence.
If the communications between in-house lawyers and other employees became confidential, the Commission' s powers to apply the standards would be seriously compromised.
On this specific problem I have taken note of the information Mr Evans and Mr Rovsing gave just now, designed to promote a compromise solution. For my part, I can assure you that if Amendment No 10 is rejected, the Commission will cease to regard evidence contained in such documents as an aggravating circumstance in determining financial sanctions.
In that eventuality, I can give an assurance to propose the following form of words to the Commission: 'in determining what financial sanction to impose on a company in future cases, the Commission will not regard as an aggravating circumstance, under the guidelines for calculating fines imposed in implementation of Article 15(2) of Regulation 17 and Article 65(5) of the ECSC Treaty, the existence of texts demonstrating that the company' s in-house lawyers have alerted the directors to the unlawfulness of conduct covered by the Commission' s decision' .
I hope that this assurance can represent common ground between the Commission and those seeking to extend the duty of secrecy to in-house lawyers.
The Evans report rightly stresses the importance of legal certainty for companies.
The rules and their scope must be sufficiently predictable.
A wider application of Community competition rules by the relevant authorities in the context of a network of close cooperation will, in itself, represent a great step forward in ensuring predictability as compared with the present situation, in which sixteen competition authorities apply different rules.
The Commission recognises that under certain circumstances there may be a legitimate requirement for clarification in relation to an individual case, and that the guidelines, guiding principles and existing case law do not always provide answers.
However, it is essential to avoid any rules that might lead to the reintroduction of the notification system.
The amendment proposed to Article 10 raises concerns in this respect.
By way of supplement and clarification, it states that the Commission can decide that there is no violation of Articles 81 and 82, in particular whenever the agreements involve financial risk or considerable investment of capital.
This amendment would only be acceptable if the Commission was not in practice compelled to decide that there was no violation in all cases involving substantial investment.
The Commission believes the best way to ensure predictability in individual cases is to introduce a new instrument: the adoption of opinions.
The Commission has already undertaken to introduce such a system, whereby it can issue reasoned written opinions in cases where there are gaps in the existing rules and decision-making procedures.
The level of investment will also be one of the relevant criteria in deciding whether to issue an opinion or not.
My impression is that the proposed system for formulating opinions would be favourably received by the business world.
On harmonisation of the procedures and sanctions, the Commission' s proposal is based on the traditional approach, which leaves the Member States able to determine the procedures and sanctions for implementing Community law.
I agree with the Evans report that it is desirable to have common procedures and sanctions but, like Rome, the Community was not built in a day.
Our approach is to introduce a substantial framework first, leaving the possible introduction of common procedures and sanctions to a later stage.
Once experience of operating the system has been acquired, it will be easier to identify the areas that give rise to practical problems and draw up rules to deal with them effectively.
The last point I want to mention, Mr President, relates to the national courts.
I am persuaded that they will be fully capable of applying Community competition rules in their entirety, because they already play a fundamental role in implementing Community law.
Nor should we forget that, to guarantee consistent implementation of the rules, the proposal provides, in particular, for the Commission, together with the national competition authorities, to be entitled to comment as amicus curiae on proceedings pending before the courts.
The proposed powers will allow the Commission to protect the public interest in the effective and consistent implementation of the rules, by drawing the attention of the courts to important points relating to their interpretation and implementation.
As regards the independence of the courts, of course they will not be bound by the comments of the amicus curiae and they will, in any case, be free to submit preliminary questions to the Court of Justice.
We are aware of the fact that the proposed reform may mean the courts have to acquire new powers.
The implementation of the competition rules can indeed be a complex matter.
I therefore agree entirely with Mr Evans that the question of training judges requires careful consideration.
The Commission can contribute in substance, providing material and human resources.
We are also looking at the possibility of cooperating with the national authorities in this matter and providing finance from existing training programmes.
I conclude, Mr President, by expressing sincere and heartfelt thanks to the European Parliament for travelling a common road with us through this very complicated terrain, which is, however, as various speakers this evening have sought to highlight, of such vital interest to the economy and indeed to our individual citizens whom you represent.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0269/2001), by Mr Andria, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the establishment of a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report I am presenting to you arises from Council Regulation 1969/88, which established a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments.
Article 119 of the Treaty provides that where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments, the Council shall grant 'mutual assistance' so that the functioning of the common market is not jeopardised.
That mechanism can be activated by the Council following an initiative from the Member State which is in difficulty or following an initiative from the Commission.
At least in its intended form, the mechanism should be distinguished above all by rapidity of intervention and, in response to the loan received, by the adoption of all appropriate economic measures for re-establishing a sustainable balance of payments position.
Since it came into force - on 25 June 1988 - the facility has not been activated much. It has only been used twice, in 1991 for the grant of a EUR 2.2 billion loan, of which only one billion was released, and in 1993 for the sum of EUR 8 billion, of which only the first tranches were released.
It immediately seems clear that many European facilities offered to the Member States are not fully taken up; the failure on the part of some Member States to make use of the Structural Funds also comes to mind.
Perhaps there ought to be superior delivery of information to encourage the members to make better use of the opportunities available.
Coming back to the report, I should mention that, as a result of the conclusions adopted by the Economic and Financial Committee on 13 October 1997 and pursuant to Article 12 of the regulation in force, the Commission submitted a report to the Council and Parliament advocating retention of the facility.
That position can be ascribed to the fact that, while only countries with derogations can use the facility, with enlargement the eventuality could arise repeatedly.
To be on the safe side, it was decided to reduce the ceiling from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion - Amendment No 2, Recital 8; the Council shall adopt the decisions after consulting the European Parliament - Amendment No 3, Article 9; and shall examine whether the facility is adequate every two years, not three - Amendment No 4, Article 11.
Subsequent amendment, including altering the ceiling, is therefore still possible.
We also support the Committee on Budget' s amendment - Amendment 1, Recital 6a (new) - on the establishment of a mechanism to protect the Community budget from any potential risks of default and corresponding call on the guarantee.
We actually think that possibility is rather remote.
With enlargement the new countries joining have made significant efforts to put their accounts and balances of payments in order.
The Community budget is protected as regards loans granted to third countries by the Guarantee Fund Mechanism.
An analogous system could be considered, though with a smaller financial commitment, in the case of finance for countries with derogations.
In conclusion: first, the loans are directly guaranteed 100 percent from the Community budget; second, the risk of default, which can never be ruled out, is covered by an adequate protection mechanism; third, the instrument is likely to be better and more widely used at the stage of European enlargement; fourth and last, the management of the loans is entrusted to the ECB, replacing the Commission which was previously responsible for this.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Party of European Socialists supports the current Commission proposal because it seeks to simplify and modernise the sole mechanism of financial support for the balances of payments of the European Union' s Member States which are not part of the eurozone.
The fact that only three countries, Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark, should benefit from this mechanism, in addition to the fact that this instrument has only been used twice since its entry into force in June 1988, justify a reduction in the overall sums earmarked for loans from EUR 16 to 12 billion.
Other proposals also warrant our support, such as the possibility of the Commission undertaking swap operations, the recognition of the role of the Economic and Financial Committee and the need to make the support mechanism compatible with the possible opening, in the very short term, of a line of credit by the European Central Bank.
Three problems have become clear, however, and I should like to hear Commissioner Solbes Mira' s position on them.
Firstly, with the proposal to apply this mechanism to the countries included in enlargement, will it really not be possible to have imbalances appearing in the balances of payments of future Member States, given the substantial structural reforms that must be implemented in order to make accession possible?
Mechanisms must, therefore, be planned forthwith to address these situations.
Secondly, must and can this mechanism apply to candidate countries as early as the pre-accession period?
Lastly, what advantage do we gain by having the Commission and not the European Central Bank supervising these loans?
I wish to thank the Commissioner for the answers he may give us and I congratulate Mr Andria on this report.
Mr President, many thanks to Mr Andria for his report on the amendment of the Regulation on the facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments.
In your interventions you have raised a series of doubts and questions which I would like to clarify.
The first fundamental doubt is: can this facility be extended to the candidate countries?
You know, and your report clearly expresses this, that this exact model cannot be extended to the candidate countries.
This system applies to Member States.
Another question is whether we can apply this facility to the candidate countries once they have signed the accession agreements and before they have been ratified, in other words, at the point that it becomes necessary to make more progress on the processes of structural adaptation of their economies.
Does this mean though that the candidate countries do not have any support system to resolve any possible difficulties in this area?
Absolutely not.
We are still applying the macrofinancial aid system which can be applied to the candidate countries, just as it is applied to any third country.
We believe that that is the thinking behind the model and we believe that if we modify the system, trying to give special treatment to the candidate countries at the point of negotiation, not only would we introduce uncertainty in terms of which countries we apply it to, but we would also introduce doubts into the financial markets if the process of liberalising capital movements generates risks which would lead us inevitably to implementing a mechanism for compensating them.
The Commission therefore believes that it is much more logical to maintain the system as it is at the moment, with the guarantee that, without any doubt, if any candidate countries have problems, the macrofinancial aid system will be applied to them.
We believe that any other model would create more confusion and more problems, rather than helping to resolve the difficulties.
The second point that you have raised is the problem of the degree to which the new model implemented may negatively affect the Community budget.
I believe that there is no difficulty here.
You well know that we have a different model of guarantees, whether we refer to macrofinancial aid to third countries, or whether we do so in relation to long-term aid within the Community framework.
It is true that we grant macrofinancial aid to certain third countries with difficulties.
It is also true that we do so in cooperation with other international financial institutions and by applying programmes that have been agreed by them.
Experience suggests that non-payment difficulties do not generally arise.
There is a risk, albeit a slight one, but it cannot be ignored.
That is why the guarantee fund was implemented, allowing us to confront these difficulties in the event of non-payments.
And that system must be maintained.
An equivalent guarantee fund must be implemented for long-term aid to Member States of the Union.
In our opinion, that situation is not reasonable either now or in the future.
When we talk about long-term aid or loans to the Member States of the European Union, we are clearly talking about countries with solid financial structures, bound by Community obligations and therefore not posing any risk in terms of non-payments.
Will the candidate countries pose more risks than the current Member States at the point that they become members of the European Union?
In my opinion, no.
Compliance with the obligations resulting from enlargement is going to mean, amongst other things, cooperation in the monitoring systems which allow us not only to help them to modify and improve their financial systems, but also to have all the necessary guarantees so that their situation may be similar to that of the current Member States.
We therefore do not believe that it is necessary to modify the system in this regard.
We believe that when the system is applied to them, the candidate countries will already be members of the European Union and therefore no special guarantee system will be necessary.
If they have to receive macrofinancial aid while they are candidate countries, the same model applied to macrofinancial aid would be applied to them.
The third problem you have raised is: who should grant this type of aid, the Bank or the Commission?
This is subject to a technical debate.
It has not been resolved. I do not believe this is the greatest problem, however; each model has its advantages and its disadvantages, in terms of coherence and speed, and I hope that a solution will be found in the Council.
However, for the Commission this is not the greatest problem.
The last point you have raised is: to what extent can the European Parliament be involved in the granting of this medium-term aid for balances of payments?
The mechanism which has currently been implemented is based on a fundamental idea: urgency.
When we talk about a situation of balance of payments difficulties, we are talking about decisions which have to be taken very quickly and, secondly, with sufficient technical support to allow the financial markets to positively assess the decision adopted.
With regard to urgency, according to the current model, the decision is adopted by the Council on the proposal of the Commission, subject to a report from the Economic and Financial Committee.
We believe that this model allows us to respond to the urgency and also allows us to receive the necessary technical support so that loans or aid may be positively assessed by the market.
Should the European Parliament participate in this model?
In my opinion, it is no accident that the Treaty does not include the European Parliament as an institution to be consulted previously.
I believe that this is due to precisely that idea of urgency.
But this must in no way mean that the European Parliament does not have the right to receive all the information and know what decisions are taken and why.
In my opinion, we could improve the system by giving information to the European Parliament as soon as these decisions are taken, so that they may have detailed knowledge of them, know why they have been adopted and know all their content.
Of course, the possibility of reviewing the regulation in the future, in two or three years, is not a great problem for us and clearly, in the event of a review of the Regulation, the European Parliament must continue to play the role it has played until now.
I would like to thank all of you for your participation on this issue, which is sometimes rather dry, but which I believe is also fundamental to everyone.
We must study the mechanisms which, as you have said, will provide us with a safety valve in the event that difficulties may arise in any Member State in the future, as a result of enlargement, difficulties which will have to be resolved efficiently, making full use of the procedures laid down in our Treaty.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0271/2001) by Mrs Ries, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank all those Members who took part in the debates on my report in committee, and in particular the shadow rapporteurs of the various political groups, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, Mr Bowe, Mrs SchÃ¶rling and Mr SjÃ¶stedt.
We have before us the proposal for a directive amending for the 24th time the 1976 dangerous substances directive, which proposes restrictions on the marketing and use of pentabromodiphenyl ether.
What exactly is at issue here?
Pentabromodiphenyl ether is a flame retardant, 95% of which is used in the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam for furniture and in particular upholstery.
It is found, for example, in car head-rests and in the protective foam used for packing items of electrical and electronic equipment.
Starting with pentaBDE and its harmful effect on our environment and on our health, the picture is very clear indeed.
A preliminary study carried out in 1998 by the Swedish authorities indicates a high concentration of this substance in breast milk.
Two opinions of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment from February and June 2000 highlight the damage that could be caused by pentaBDE in relation to discharging this substance into the environment and its being a persistent and bioaccumulative substance.
There is therefore a risk to the environment and to human health.
There is a unanimity of opinions on this.
It was therefore totally logical for the Commission to propose in January of this year a total ban on the marketing and use of pentaBDE.
And I would say that it was also logical for our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to vote to confirm this ban.
A second substance, octabromodiphenyl ether, is also directly affected by the directive in view of the percentage of pentaBDE residues that it contains when it is sold.
OctaBDE is used mainly here as a flame retardant in furniture made of plastic and in office equipment.
In this case, the Commission preferred to accept the final conclusions of the risk assessment study still being carried out for this substance.
It therefore restricted itself to limiting the percentage of pentaBDE residues authorised in octaBDE to 5%.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy does not share this view.
In fact it seems to us to be totally contradictory to ban pentaBDE while permitting the presence of what we regard as significant quantities of pentaBDE in other chemical products, in other substances.
Furthermore, I would say that the initial results of the current risk assessment, of which I am aware, are negative and tend to prove the harmful effect of this product not only on the environment but also on public health. These two areas have been assessed by British and French experts respectively, and I have consulted those experts in detail.
In view of these different factors, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tabled an amendment which would extend the marketing ban to octabromodiphenyl ether also, thus strictly applying the precautionary principle.
I think I do not need to remind you that the precautionary principle does not mean waiting until there is absolute proof, which in this case would mean waiting for the final result of the risk assessment, when there is sufficiently serious and tangible evidence to demonstrate that a substance could have harmful effects on public health and on the environment.
That is exactly the case with octaBDE.
Third and last, and things always seem to go in threes, there is decabromodiphenyl ether, another flame retardant in the same family, which in practice accounts for 80% of this family of brominated substances and has a great many applications, not just in electrical and electronic equipment but also and above all in insulating and building products and in textiles.
DecaBDE is the only one of these three substances not to be mentioned at all in the Commission document.
Yet I regard it as being difficult, nay, impossible, and I will come back to this point in a few moments, to exclude decaBDE, which is why in Amendment No 4 in my report I call for a method for the evaluation of risks by family of chemical products, and no longer on an individual substance by substance basis.
In order to ensure coherence, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has extended the scope of this directive to cover all the polybromodiphenyl ethers.
This is totally in line with this House' s recent vote on the electrical and electronic equipment directive.
While waiting for precise information to emerge from the risk assessment in relation to decaBDE which is also currently in progress, Amendment No 16, which I have tabled in conjunction with the PPE Group and the Socialist Group, essentially proposes a ban on decaBDE with effect from 1 January 2006, unless the risk assessment in some way exonerates this substance and concludes that decaBDE does not pose any problems.
So this is a sort of reversibility clause.
While I am on the subject of amendments, I would like to mention that I oppose Amendment No 9, which aims to change the title of the proposal so as to extend the immediate ban to the marketing of decaBDE.
I do not really have any fundamental philosophical objection to Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 14, but I prefer the Commission' s original text.
With regard to the other amendment tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I believe that my report already takes account of the criticisms contained in Amendment No 11 regarding the extremely cumbersome nature of the risk assessment and control procedures for existing substances.
I mentioned that just now.
To conclude, the Council Working Party on Dangerous Substances, which will be meeting in a week' s time, will determine the broad guidelines to be adopted by the Internal Market Council on 27 September.
I hope that they will make it possible to narrow the gap between the positions of Parliament and the Commission.
I also hope, indeed I think, that it will be quite possible at second reading to finalise the adoption of this proposal for a directive amending the dangerous substances directive for the 24th time.
Mr President, may I first of all compliment Mrs Ries on her excellent and sound report?
We are talking today about the limitations of introducing on the market and using certain hazardous substances and preparations, especially flame retardant agents such as pentabromodiphenyl ether.
Risk assessments have shown, as Mrs Ries has just said, that the use of pentabromodiphenyl ether carries risks for the environment and public health, because this bromide-based, flame retardant agent is used in the production of furniture and upholstery.
So for this reason, in the interests of public health and the environment, the marketing and use of pentaBDE and all articles containing pentaBDE must be prohibited.
As alternative flame retardants are available, fire and environmental risks will not increase as a result of this ban.
Besides penta, two other bromide-based flame retardants are available on the market, namely decaBDE and octaBDE.
Octa is mainly used in plastic office equipment and in components of household appliances.
In dealing with the directive on the limitation of the use of certain hazardous substances in electric and electronic equipment, this House has already come out in favour of a gradual ban on all PDBEs in specific uses by January 2006.
The possible risks of octa and decaBDE are being evaluated at present and the results of this study will be submitted to the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment by the end of this year.
With regard to decaBDE, on which there are as yet no negative conclusions, the ban must, in the view of the PPE-DE Group, be revocable, hence dependent on the results of the risk assessment which will be available before the end of the year.
For octaBDE, however, I share the opinion of Mrs Ries that the use of this substance must be banned forthwith, even though the assessment of the risks is not yet concluded.
The first known results of the risk assessments for octaBDE, which are at present being carried out in the United Kingdom as regards the impact of the environment and in France as regards the consequences for public health, show that with this substance there are clear risks for human health and the environment.
The precautionary principle, therefore, prescribes that we do not wait to impose a ban on this substance until the final results of the investigation are known.
Mr President, in the interests of health, the protection of European citizens, the protection of the environment and the maintenance of the internal market, on the basis of results so far known of the risk assessments of bromide-based flame retardants and on the basis of the principle of prevention, there should be a ban on penta- and octaBDE and also on decaBDE if the risk assessment expected before the end of the year shows that decaBDE gives cause for concern.
Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the report which has been a difficult one in terms of reaching a balance between the interests of what is clearly the very important - and very immediate - issue of fire safety and the more difficult, but more long-term problem of future harm to public health and the environment.
The substances which are the subject of this report have clear and demonstrated beneficial properties as flame retardants in materials and products such as foam-filled furniture.
However, they also have important negative properties.
They are toxic.
They are bioaccumulative in animals and in the general environment and they have even been found, as has been said already, in human breast milk.
Action on these substances in the opinion of many Members of this Parliament has been long delayed due to the slow progress of the risk assessments undertaken under the existing substance regulations of 1993.
The final results and publications of the risk assessments of certain of these substances are still awaited.
I hope the Commission notes that.
The general conclusions are clear.
These substances which have a potential for harm to the environment must be strictly controlled.
One cannot ignore however their very real and positive benefits in terms of reducing substantially the annual human death toll due to accidental fires.
Accordingly, I would welcome the report.
I give my support to the amendments to that report which enable the continued use of the most stable isomer, that is decaBDE, until such time as this substance has a complete risk assessment and its real uses and risks are assessed and we have some conclusions on it.
I commend the report to the House.
Mr President, I am really pleased that the rapporteur, Mrs Ries, and the discussion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have tightened up the Commission' s proposal concerning brominated flame retardants.
We are of course aware that pentaBDEs, octaBDEs and also decaBDEs are resistant, toxic and also bioaccumulative, since highly brominated flame retardants have been found high up in the food chain. It is within the field of Swedish environmental research that it has been established that decaBDEs too are bioaccumulative.
The whole group must therefore be banned.
The precautionary principle requires that we act now and not wait for the results of the current risk assessment, as proposed in the case of decaBDEs in Amendment 16, for decaBDEs account for 80 per cent of the use of brominated flame retardants.
If we were to wait for a ban in 2006, this would mean tons of high-risk chemicals being released into the environment, something which would clearly contravene the precautionary principle.
I therefore applaud the amendment by the Group of the Greens, designed to place an immediate ban on the entire group of brominated flame retardants right now.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to add my own congratulations to those addressed to the rapporteur.
Everyone has already said that this is a very difficult matter since various interests backed by large lobbies are involved, but also fire safety and the long-term protection and future of the environment.
It will probably be a very technical debate.
Pentabromodiphenyl ether. What' s in a name?
This concerns bromide-based flame retardants, but also a socially very relevant theme.
The previous speakers have clearly shown the problems this creates for the environment and public health.
OctaBDE and decaBDE are, as a result of a Regulation on risk analysis, which is now seven years old, the first to have been placed on the first list of priority substances for risk analysis.
The evaluations have not yet been concluded.
Since those substances are known to be dangerous for the environment, waiting for the conclusions of that slow risk analysis would unnecessarily delay better protection of human beings and the environment.
Although I should have preferred to see an immediate ban on bromide-based flame retardants - as my fellow MEPs are aware - I completely support the compromise, since it is also acceptable.
It provides for an immediate ban on penta- and octaBDE and the banning in 2006 of decaBDE, unless - and this is important - it is proved to be harmless.
It also immediately indicates that in this matter we are balanced between policy based on risk analysis and the new chemical policy that we are dealing with at present and that is designed to facilitate faster analyses, but also above all that responsibility for this no longer lies with the Commission and the Member States but with the manufacturers.
This matter shows yet again that the current chemical policy with a substance-by-substance analysis takes years and that as a result the authorities are in a very weak position for protecting human beings and the environment.
Therefore, in the strongest possible terms, we are calling for an urgent revision of the policy, as we are at present doing with the White Paper on Chemical Policy.
Firstly, I would like to express my thanks to Members for their interest in this proposal and especially to Mrs Ries, the rapporteur, for her constructive work.
PentaBDE is a flame retardant used in the production of polyurethane foam for furniture and upholstery.
It poses a risk to the environment, is bioaccumulating and has been found in human breast milk.
In response to the findings of a risk assessment under the regulation on the evaluation and control of existing substances, the Commission proposed, in January of this year, a directive banning the marketing and use of pentaBDE.
The Commission' s proposed directive covers all uses of pentaBDE, and articles containing pentaBDE.
It is an application of the precautionary principle, given concern about the presence of pentaBDE in breast milk from unidentified sources.
The costs and benefits of the proposed ban have been carefully analysed.
Suitable alternatives, both in technical and economic terms, are available.
I would stress that the proposal will not result in greater risks from fires or greater risks to the environment.
I believe it is a proportionate measure.
The proposed directive provides not only for the protection of the environment, of consumers' and workers' health but would also preserve the Internal Market.
It would introduce harmonised rules in the Member States.
The Commission is unable to accept those amendments of the Parliament which would extend the scope of the proposed directive to include bans also on other substances i.e. octaBDE and decaBDE (Amendments No 1, second part of No 2, Nos 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15).
These other substances could be the subject of a subsequent proposal of the Commission when risk assessments have been completed and the availability of safe substitutes analysed.
The Commission is also unable to accept the amendments that would introduce bans on octaBDE and decaBDE taking effect from 1 January 2006 if the risk assessments do not conclude that the substances cause no reasons for concern (Amendments Nos 8 and 16).
Accordingly, these substances would be totally banned from 2006 if the assessments show concern or they would be left totally unregulated if the assessments show no concern.
The Commission favours a more nuanced approach which would mean that measures could take effect much earlier than 2006.
The completion of the risk assessments and analyses of availability of safe substitutes would allow the uses of concern to be identified and appropriate measures to be quickly taken.
If necessary, the precautionary principle could be applied to ban such uses.
As the assessments are expected to be completed in the autumn of 2001, the chosen measures could be effective well before 2006.
Nor is the Commission able to accept the amendment on procedures for risk assessment under Regulation 793/93 (Amendment No 4).
This amendment goes beyond the present proposal to restrict the marketing and use of pentaBDE.
The Commission can accept in principle to delete the derogation on pentaBDE in concentrations of less than 5% in technical grade octaBDE from the ban (first part of Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 5 of the Environment Committee) as new information from producers indicates that octaBDE can be produced without pentaBDE.
To summarise our position, the Commission can accept Amendment No 5.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1 to 4 and 6 to 16.
However, the Commission can, in principle, support the first part of Amendment No 2.
We wish to carry on the dialogue with Parliament and I am convinced we can reach a constructive solution.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Quality and safety standards for human blood and blood components
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0272/2001) by Mr NisticÃ², on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the quality and safety standards for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all my sincere thanks to the chairman, Caroline Jackson, for giving this report preferential passage. Equally sincere thanks go to all the shadow rapporteurs for the optimum cooperation there has been, and thanks, too, to the Commission officers, the representatives of the various associations and all those Members who have contributed to improving this important and sensitive directive with excellent amendments.
The directive fills a void which has existed in Europe up to now around standards of blood quality and safety.
The objective of this directive is primarily the protection of donors and patients, finally making it possible for all the Member States to have the same standards which ensure the maximum possible level of quality and safety of blood and blood components, not only for blood available in the countries of the European Union but also for blood imported from third countries.
The directive provides for continuous updating, at least annually, of laboratory tests to identify bacterial or viral pathogens and other infective agents, as well as upgrading to the most sophisticated technology for safer and more effective sterilisation of blood and blood components.
There are also recommendations to the Member States to strengthen scientific research in the sector.
The existence of a new European directive which provides for the same standards of quality in the individual Member States will facilitate the free movement of blood from one European Union country to another and remove uncalled-for restrictions on donors moving between countries.
High standards of quality and safety must apply during all stages in the transfusion chain, from donation to inspection by means of specific laboratory tests, collection, processing, storage, distribution and utilisation of whole human blood and its components.
The quality and effectiveness guarantees must therefore cover the suitability of blood donors, plasma and their components, the transfusion structures, the qualifications and training of medical, technical and nursing staff and the checking, inspection and control mechanisms, as well as a system for ensuring the traceability of blood from donor to recipient.
The European Parliament provides for the person responsible to have a qualification in medicine, preferably with a specialisation in haematology or transfusion medicine or related medical specialisation.
In order to gain a better understanding of the importance of monitoring each stage in the process, it is worth considering the unfortunate, terrible, adverse reactions which have occurred and which we hope will never occur again, for example AIDS, hepatitis B and C and other, sometimes fatal infections, like anaphylactic shock or endotoxic shock.
The Commission has accepted the rapporteur' s proposal to delete the annexes, as they cover extremely complex technical matters. They should be updated periodically by a simple and flexible mechanism.
Finally, the principle by which all donations should take place on a voluntary non-remunerated basis has been strengthened by numerous amendments from Parliament.
However in my opinion, Commissioner, the priority is to safeguard the needs and requirements of patients.
In fact, in view of the sadly limited number of donors still, and Europe' s lack of self-sufficiency in blood, if all forms of incentive for donors were immediately banned it would create enormous, even fatal, difficulties for patients.
The shortage of blood and plasma is a well-known problem in Europe.
That is why I hope the House will approve the amendment by the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party which upholds the principle of free and voluntary donation on the one hand, but allows a transitional phase for achieving that principle on the other.
An oral amendment by Mr Lisi states that by the end of December 2008 all donations must be voluntary and non-remunerated.
Individual Member States must encourage the achievement of that principle, but sufficiently gradually to avoid any possible catastrophic effects on the public.
As regards imported blood - Amendment No 43 - it should be specified that the criteria this amendment refers to relate to the quality and safety of the blood.
In conclusion, Mr President, the guarantee of high standards of quality, effectiveness and safety of blood provided for in the directive will mean greater peace of mind for European Union citizens about any treatment with blood, as well as greater confidence in the European institutions and the national authorities.
Mr President, a well-regulated and hence safe supply of blood is of great importance for the health of the European citizen.
I therefore warmly welcome this directive with its inclusion of quality and safety norms for collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of blood and blood constituents.
I am happy to compliment Mr NisticÃ² on his report and the way in which he has also improved the structure of the bill. However, on one point I disagree with him.
In my view - and this is also the view of Mr NisticÃ² for that matter - there are two important principles to which we in Europe must adhere and which I have constantly championed, in this House from 1989 and before that in the Netherlands.
What are those principles?
Besides self-supply within the Union, this is the voluntary and unpaid provision of blood and blood products.
The amendments show that, as regards free provision, it is quite possible to give the donor a small consideration for his/her trouble.
Recently there has been much talk about the no-payment principle in particular.
I should like to make a few remarks about this.
First and foremost, for me the safety of blood and blood products carries top priority.
This cannot be overlooked.
Voluntary and unpaid donation is a question of safety and not just an act of human benevolence.
The safety of blood obtained free of charge is greater in comparison with other kinds of donations - and that has been demonstrated scientifically and not only in my own country.
Should shortages of certain products arise that are needed, for instance, for haemophilia patients, there is absolutely nothing against making up for those shortfalls by importing other blood.
If we start meddling with this principle, that will have a disruptive effect on the public bloodbanks which we are familiar with in a number of Member States.
Therefore I believe, unfortunately, Mr NisticÃ², that in the compromise that you have struck, there has been too much tampering with the principle.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the Commission for now having led the way by implementing the new provisions in the Treaty of Amsterdam establishing quality and safety standards for, among other things, human blood and blood components.
I should also, however, like to thank Mr NisticÃ² for the work he has put into the report.
I think it is a fine piece of work, and I am very pleased that, through the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we are able to help improve the directive.
With the improvements proposed by the Committee, we can make for greater safety and ensure blood of a higher quality, from collection right up to distribution.
I also think that we shall have some crucial issues settled: firstly, that blood is not a commodity subject to the usual rules governing free trade.
I think that, with regard to self-sufficiency too, it is important for it to be said that, by means of these rules in the individual countries and in the EU as a whole, we can prioritise the issue of self-sufficiency.
Blood donated from a country' s own population is clearly the best solution, and I would therefore urge all countries to establish large pools of donors who see it as their task, both personally and as members of society, to give blood and plasma to help other people in their own societies.
Many countries have already established pools of donors.
It can be done in actual fact, and there is therefore no excuse for those countries which have still not established such pools.
It is just a question of getting them going.
If such a large corps of donors is obtained, so too is a larger quantity of blood and, thus, the opportunity of genuinely becoming self-sufficient in blood of the highest quality.
That also leads me to say a few words about the extent to which blood donation should be non-remunerated, which is of course the major issue here.
I believe that blood donation should be non-remunerated, as also recommended by the Council of Europe in its guidelines and by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I think there are two reasons for specifying this.
The first reason is ethical.
In my view, a person' s blood, tissue and organs ought not to be commodities.
That is one reason.
The other reason is that non-remunerated donation provides blood which is safest and of the highest quality.
Countless investigations show that blood donated for no remuneration is of a higher quality than blood otherwise obtained, and I think we have to tell it like it is: a pool of donors based upon voluntary and non-remunerated blood donation is different from a pool based upon remunerated donation.
In that connection, I am delighted with the broad support given by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to the Council of Europe' s definition of voluntary, non-remunerated blood donation.
There are sectors of industry which have lobbied powerfully against non-remunerated blood donation and, as usual, patients have been elbowed out of the way in the process.
I find that unsavoury, and I think that, in reality, industry is quite cynically helping to prevent the ideal situation for patients who have to be given blood, namely that blood and plasma are donated without remuneration and thus from an established and stable body of donors.
I think it provides food for thought that those countries in which there is non-remunerated donation by a large and stable body of donors are also, in actual fact, self-sufficient in blood and plasma.
However, I should like to add to what Mr NisticÃ² has said by pointing out that I am pleased with the oral amendment to Mr NisticÃ²' s Amendment No 75 and that, in my view, there is no one at all in this House who could dream of putting a patient in a situation in which he was unable to obtain blood or plasma.
Naturally, all patients must be able to obtain these, but I believe that we serve patients best by having non-remunerated blood donation and thus securing blood of the highest quality.
Mr President, first of all, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr NisticÃ², for his thorough and excellent report, and for his open-mindedness and willingness to cooperate with the shadow rapporteurs.
This directive is essential.
For the first time, it lays down in Community legislation quality and safety standards for blood products, whether they are intended for transfusions or as starting materials for medicinal products.
I should also say that it also provides for the free movement of donors and blood products within the Union.
I regard the proposal as being both ambitious and satisfactory overall.
I would like to add that the main improvements approved by the committee all seek the same thing: to strengthen checking, inspection and monitoring measures throughout the transfusion chain, in order to protect donors from human error and to protect recipients against the risks of being exposed to donated blood that may be contaminated.
Having said that, patients now face another threat: the shortage of plasma and plasma derivates in the Union.
That is why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is opposed to the absolute and immediate obligation to make donation non-remunerated, that is to Amendments Nos 55 and 56, which, I would like to say in passing, also seem to run totally counter to the whole principle of subsidiarity.
I say that first of all because non-remunerated donation is in no way under threat.
We have never questioned the principle of voluntary donation or the essential social role played by voluntary donors.
So it is not the principle of non-remunerated donation that is being questioned, but compulsory non-remuneration.
I am also and above all opposed to these amendments because they totally disregard the concerns of patients.
We consulted in depth patients who are particularly concerned, and here I am using a euphemism, about the ever-increasing dependence on imports of American plasma in particular. This especially applies to haemophiliacs who remember that non-remuneration in no way protected them against viral contamination.
We do not want the better to be the enemy of the good here.
It is clear and it is vital that blood should not be a source of profit.
This is repeated in several places, in several recitals, in the compromise amendment which we have tabled together with the PPE Group.
This is an objective imposed on the Member States in accordance with the conditions and timing laid down in Amendment No 75, but making non-remuneration an absolute condition for donating blood would be a disaster for patients, and I mean patients and not industrialists, Mr Lund, because we have had in-depth discussions with haemophiliacs in particular.
What really counts here is that blood should be of the highest quality and the directive ensures this, but what is the use of ensuring quality and safety if the blood is not available?
Let me remind you that Europe has 7 million blood donors out of a population of 360 million.
In conclusion, Mr President, that is why I am calling on all the political groups to support this compromise amendment which ensures free access on the part of patients to blood and to medicinal products, both of which each day save thousands of lives.
Mr President, we have been waiting for a long time for a directive on blood quality, which is vital to ensure safety for donors and recipients at European level.
From this point of view, Mr NisticÃ²' s report, which has been enhanced by various amendments adopted almost unanimously in committee, is a step towards improved human health protection, in particular because it calls for better medical checks on donors and also increases the responsibility of doctors and establishments dealing with blood at all stages, from collection through to storage and including the point at which blood is converted into blood derivates.
As we have seen, there remains an important question on which there is no consensus between us: whether donation should be remunerated or not.
We believe that the principle of non-remunerated blood donation is very important, a principle applied in many European countries without leading to shortages, and we cannot accept that this principle should be undermined, for two essential reasons.
Firstly, from an ethical point of view, we cannot advocate the idea of selling blood or any body part.
The human body is not a commodity.
Furthermore, we find it extremely shocking that companies should be able to profit from blood donated without remuneration.
Secondly, remunerating blood donation could be counter-productive in terms of quality.
Donors attracted by a financial inventive may want to conceal possible health problems, which could have dramatic consequences for their own health and the health of the recipients.
Recent information on the hundreds of thousands of Chinese now affected by AIDS because they have sold their plasma is a tragic illustration of this and we do not want the same situation to occur in Europe tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr NisticÃ² has submitted an outstanding report whose content I fully support.
It is essential that this directive creates uniform standards for the safety and quality of blood and plasma in the Member States.
To this end, identical procedures for testing blood and plasma must be adopted which comply with the most recent techniques.
Trained personnel should ensure the highest safety standards for donors and recipients alike.
A transparent system of traceability and labelling will allow blood to be traced from donor to recipient and back.
This also helps to minimise the risk of infection.
Voluntary, non-remunerated donation is, and should remain, a basic principle.
Unlike Mr Lund, I believe that there is certainly no direct link between non-remunerated and remunerated donation and safety/quality.
The key issue is the selection of donors and testing by qualified personnel.
However, reimbursement for plasma donors must not be ruled out in the European Union in future.
Europe can only cover 50% of its plasma needs.
The shortfall is made up from plasma from the US, for which the donors have received payment.
The import of plasma from paid donors must not be prohibited by the new directive.
This would inevitably lead to supply shortages, which would also affect the manufacture of medicines from these products.
Plasma is required to produce vital medicines such as coagulation factor 8 and coagulation factor 7 for haemophiliacs, and immunoglobulins to prevent infection in patients with congenital immune deficiency.
A shortage would put many patients' health at risk.
I would ask you to bear this in mind when voting.
Mr President, the safety and quality of blood products have never been so important.
Every week we hear across the EU story after story about this issue.
I believe that every Member of the House wants to be reassured with the knowledge that there is a level of safety and quality of blood and blood products throughout the transfusion process in Member States.
For our citizens it means that in the unfortunate situation where, for instance, you have had an accident on holiday and you require a blood transfusion, you can guarantee the quality and safety being the same, whether it is on a Greek island or on a Scottish island.
As we all know, the main area of difference between Members has been on the issue of remunerated and non-remunerated blood products.
I believe that the preferred option should be that blood is given voluntarily.
As the European Blood Alliance outline, voluntary and non-remunerated donations of blood and blood components are considered to be a gift from healthy citizens to those in need.
But more importantly, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits the making of the human body and its parts a source of financial gain.
We as a parliament, and within the institutions, have consistently advocated voluntary, non-remunerated donations.
Evidence shows that the prevalence of viruses and diseases which may be transmitted through blood is higher in those donors who are remunerated than those who donate without receiving payment.
There is, however, one issue which I would like to highlight.
That is Amendment No 43.
In Scotland and the UK we have a specific issue with CJD.
Many haemophiliacs and those with immune disorders depend on blood products from the US, the reason being that in Scotland and the UK we no longer use plasma from UK donors to make blood products because of CJD and rely instead on imports of plasma from the US.
The oral amendment advocated by Mrs Korhola to Amendment No 43 is greatly welcomed.
I hope Members will support it tomorrow.
In conclusion, the safety, quality and standard of blood and blood products is an important issue which we have to get right.
Perhaps in the second reading the rapporteur could organise outside this Chamber an opportunity for Members to donate blood.
After all, as Members, we should lead by example.
Giving blood is a positive act of citizenship.
Mr President, a friend of mine lives with AIDS and so does his wife because he received contaminated blood in a transfusion and then unknowingly affected his wife.
I know the risks and dangers and the importance of quality and safety in our blood supplies.
That is why I welcome this proposal, particularly the work of my colleague Mr NisticÃ².
But it would be a tragedy if it was spoiled by one amendment, an amendment which exacerbated the known shortages of rare blood groups and plasma.
It would be a tragedy in a very real sense because the WHO points out that there are 80 primary immune deficiency conditions in our world and it is estimated that some 50 000 to 90 000 people in our Europe suffer from those conditions.
Most are treatable, most people can lead fairly full lives but only if, every three weeks of their life for as long as they live, they have an infusion of immunoglobin which comes from human plasma and that keeps them alive.
Europe uses 7 million litres per annum, and 4 million litres come from compensated donors.
Of course we would all prefer all donations to be voluntary.
In the United Kingdom they are all voluntary but in the United Kingdom, as we have heard, there is no plasma coming from UK donors for blood products because of the theoretical risk of variant CJD being transmitted by blood.
Nor can we take any from other countries in Europe.
It does not matter about blood banks or plasma banks in Europe - we cannot take them from countries in the EU where there has been BSE or new variant CJD so we have to look elsewhere, and we and others rely largely on the United States' supplies.
The United Kingdom Department of Health has said there are no acceptable alternative sources.
Of course, such imports include remunerated donations and there is no evidence at all that they are any less safe than unremunerated ones.
Amendment No 43 would ban the import of such literally life-saving plasma and I urge the support of this House for the rapporteur' s compromise amendment.
Mr President, the proposal for a directive setting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components has come at exactly the right time, given recent developments in the medical and public health sectors.
The primary objective in introducing new rules is to update the legislative framework, so that it covers areas not covered by Community legislation, by tightening the requirements for suitable blood donors, plasma and blood tests and creating a Community quality system for blood donation centres.
I should like to highlight two points where I have tried to improve the Commission text - and hence safety - for both the donors and the recipients of blood or blood components.
I refer to Amendment No 33, requiring the manager of the blood donation centre to have at least a medical degree, preferably specialising in haematology or some related discipline.
The second important point is that blood is in ever shorter supply.
In Greece, the demand has increased to the point at which about three in ten patients require blood and, despite the increase in the supply of blood from volunteers, more and more blood has to be imported.
The aim of Amendment No 75 is to ensure that the ban on blood donation incentives is not an absolute ban because it is wrong, for medical and scientific reasons, to be dogmatic on such an important health issue.
The fact that we want blood donors to be volunteers should not be expressed in absolute terms.
We must give the Member States and blood donation centres the facility to offer incentives to cover the collection, testing, storage and distribution of rare blood groups and their components as and where necessary.
I should like to congratulate Mr NisticÃ² on his really excellent work and to ask the House to vote in favour of Amendment No 75 which, while adhering to the principle of voluntary blood donation, really does give the Member States and blood donation centres the facility to meet any requirements and, medically and scientifically speaking, this is exactly how it should be.
Mr President, the dispute in connection with Mr NisticÃ²' s excellent report regarding the remuneration of blood donors is important in terms of its multidimensional, ethical and practical aspects, and a lot more serious than might be inferred from the debate.
I tabled an amendment regarding the non-remuneration of donor services together with my colleague, Mrs GrossetÃªte, and the committee adopted it.
I appeal to my colleagues to maintain this position now also.
Various patient groups and authorities have appealed to us here in Parliament not to allow blood donation to become commercialised.
Firstly there is a safety risk.
Allowing remuneration will mean the donor profile will change and the overall risk increase: comparative studies show that the state of health of remunerated donors is poorer.
The importance of tests has been emphasised here, and that is good.
But with HIV tests, for example, there is a certain window period, as it is known, when the virus still does not show up.
There is also an ethical risk.
I want to stress that we also have a responsibility for how the rest of the world might imitate our practices.
If we permit the trade in what is part of the human body, i.e. blood, we have to remember that the less developed countries will follow Europe' s example.
This will not only lead to exploitation but increased risks.
We already know of a case in China where an absolute catastrophe related to blood quality occurred when blood donors were paid what were for them vast sums of money.
In Austria 200 schillings is a nominal amount for the donor, but in Eastern Europe it is a considerable income.
Is this what we really want for others and ourselves?
Thirdly, there is the risk of being guilty of inconsistency.
Many EU countries have signed the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, which categorically prohibits the financial exploitation of the human body and its parts, including blood.
I do not dispute the need for plasma, and its shortage is very much a reality.
It is nevertheless intellectually dishonest to open up this whole area to market forces just because there is a shortage of plasma.
Amendment No 17, however, makes adequate guarantees regarding the possibility of reimbursing costs incurred in donating plasma including travel expenses, and of offering compensation for lost working time.
At the same time I would like to ask my colleagues to support the oral amendment I intend to propose for Amendment No 43.
It would allow exceptions to be made in cases where the plasma shortage really is an insurmountable problem.
Mr President, there are two principal issues here: one is an adequate supply and the second is a safe supply.
For the hundreds and thousands of haemophiliacs and all those patients with the whole range of immunodeficiency diseases, these are life threatening issues which they are faced with on a daily basis.
While I agree - and no one disagrees in this House - that we must foster a culture of voluntary donations as the norm, as the ethos, in all our Member States, I plead with this House not to specifically exclude paid donations.
Let us not exclude them for the rare blood groups and for the very scarce plasma and plasma products if they are needed to pay to ensure adequacy of supply.
It is not a question of 'if there is a shortage of supply' .
There is one already.
Today 40-50% of plasma products used each year by European patients come from plasma donors who are compensated for their time and inconvenience for this lengthy process.
These plasma products, particularly in the UK and Ireland, are largely imported from the US from paid donors.
The amendments to this directive, which were voted and passed by the Environment Committee, will have a major impact on public health.
They will prevent the remuneration of donors in any circumstances and preclude importation of plasma and plasma products from paid donors.
There is no longer any public health justification for imposing an absolute requirement for all donations to be non-remunerated.
This was the case in the seventies and eighties but it is no longer with our screening and sterilisation process.
Commissioner Byrne, I would like to put a question specifically to you and maybe you could answer it in your reply: do the amendments which were passed in the Environment Committee violate EU law, particularly various sections of Article 152?
I draw your attention to Article 152(5) which prevents Community action from affecting national provisions on the donation of blood.
Do the amendments actually violate EU law?
The doctors' organisations, the patients' organisations throughout Europe are pleading with us not to specifically exclude paid donations.
I congratulate Mr NisticÃ² on his excellent work and I commend Amendment No 75 which gets the balance right.
Yes, Mr President, I must put the record straight on one count.
I was approached by the Netherlands Haemophilia Patients' Association to hold on to the no-payment principle, and that means, therefore, that fellow MEPs who have argued otherwise, are certainly in favour of safety and are also acting on behalf of their patient groups.
Mr President, let me first say that I am very grateful for all the work on this important and ambitious directive.
