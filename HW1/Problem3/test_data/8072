Is the Commission suggesting that the European baccalaureate should be available in schools other than the European schools?
I simply do not see why it is necessary to interfere with other schools in order to broaden and modernise the curriculum of the European schools.
If I were a teacher and a pupil gave the EU as the answer, I would have to conclude that it was a very stupid question.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, listening to this debate, one is tempted to ask a couple of basic questions.
EURÂ 127Â million of taxpayersâ money â for whom?
Why?
Is it not the case that Europe is now so evolved that many officials stay in one place for a very long time, not to say their entire career?
Is this form of assistance not tantamount to a further subsidy for this handful of privileged individuals in Luxembourg, Brussels and elsewhere?
Is it not also true that, in reality, as a cost-accounting matter, these additional costs should be factored in from the outset when locating and relocating agencies?
Yet this is not being done; the procedure is still marked by a lack of transparency.
There is a reason why these reports have been appearing at two-year intervals, and it is that these schools are not doing particularly well.
At the end of the day, the fundamental question arises as to whether this system, which actually did have some justification 20, 30, or 40 years ago, is sustainable as such.
Every enterprise sending staff abroad knows that there is a variety of other schools on offer â German schools, English schools, UN schools â so why are we allowing ourselves this luxury?
Is it really necessary?
Â Â  I have heard a lot of good things about the European schools from parents.
However, as a result of more complex organisation and the large number of pupils, certain deficiencies have begun to appear, and particularly since the accession of the new Member States last year, when the number of pupils increased significantly.
Some schools have been over-subscribed and this has impacted on the quality of the teaching.
Increased demand also requires more funds to be earmarked.
The first year at school is particularly stressful, both for parents and for pupils, as from day one they have to cope with adapting to a new environment, a new language, new classmates and new teachers, so the understanding of teachers during this period of integration is essential.
The greatest difficulties are experienced by those pupils who have to follow most subjects in a foreign language.
Pupils who know a foreign language at a conversational level also have problems in specific subjects like chemistry, geography, maths and so on. The children attending these schools have varying talents and some are more hard-working than others, and not all of them can meet the demands of the programme leading to the European school leaving examination (baccalaureate).
It is therefore necessary for pupils to have the possibility of receiving a different school leaving certificate and not only the certificate that they have passed the school leaving examination.
Likewise there is insufficient provision for children with special needs, who require a greater degree of accommodation and specially trained teachers.
In overcrowded classes teachers cannot devote sufficient attention to children with special needs or those with learning and social difficulties.
In any event we should praise the efforts of all those who are striving to ensure high-quality teaching and assistance in the integration of and familiarisation with multicultural Europe.
We should try to ensure that as many children as possible can use their mother tongue for at least some of the time in the European schools, or when they finish school they will have a great deal of knowledge but will not be able to use their own mother tongue correctly.
Â Â  Mr President, in the few seconds that are available to me I would like to raise the question of children with special educational needs.
I was quite surprised to hear the Commissioner here this evening offering his defence and support for those children when the Commission has in fact defended discrimination against families with children with special educational needs.
The Ombudsman has found it necessary to present a special report to this House in the light of a complaint made to the Commission by a family who had been discriminated against, and the Commission defended that discrimination, despite the fact that it is contrary to the European Treaties.
The Ombudsman found that the discrimination was such that it constituted an unjustified discrimination.
It is sad to say that this is not the only such case: a number of other cases have also been the subject of complaint to the Commission, and have also been defended by the Commission.
I support the Honeyball report and urge this House to support, in particular, paragraphs 24, 25, 26 and 27, which deal with this question of special educational needs and the need for the Commission to ensure that sufficient resources are available to ensure that no child is turned away from the European school system because of their disability.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that my experience as headteacher of a grammar school in a large provincial Czech town, where pupil numbers are comparable to those of the European school in the Spanish town of Alicante, makes me well placed to comment on the issues that most affect the European schools.
The Commission communication makes it clear that constraints are placed on the long-term financial planning of individual European schools in the shape of staff management and school development strategies.
It is impossible to manage any company well in the face of such uncertainty, let alone an educational institution.
I therefore very much welcome the proposal to transfer such decisions to headteachers and boards of governors, as they are the ones who best know the current needs and requirements of their institutions.
If I may, I should now like to touch on a number of areas where improvements would lead to an increase in the standard of education.
Many fellow Members of this House, as well as teachers, experts and parents in the majority of Member States, would be up in arms if the maximum number of pupils per class were 32.
In most places such class sizes have been consigned to the dim and distant past, but in certain European schools they are part of everyday life.
Classes are not usually so large, of course, but such cases have been known.
It is self-evident that a smaller number of pupils makes it possible to apply different pedagogical methods and procedures in the classroom.
We must not neglect the requirements of pupils with special educational needs and those who receive most of their education in a language other than their mother tongue.
If the EU institutions wish to make good on the commitment they made 50Â years ago, namely to offer the children of their employees a high-quality education, then they should give due consideration to these obvious requirements.
In conclusion, I should like to lend my support to calls for the introduction of an alternative leaving certificate, in addition to the highly academic European Baccalaureate, for pupils who decide to study vocational subjects.
At the same time, it would be appropriate to earmark a certain percentage of resources for the civic and practical skills needed to prepare all children for their future.
I should like to thank the rapporteur.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Honeyball, on her excellent work.
However, the objectives of European schools cannot be better expressed than through the words of Jean Monnet, who said that children of Europe educated side by side from an early age familiarise themselves with all the different cultures.
They learn to live without prejudice and thus there is born and matures within them the idea that they belong together.
Looking incessantly at their earth with love and pride, they will become Europeans in spirit and through education they will be ready to complete and consolidate the work of their fathers and to put flesh and bones on a unified and flourishing Europe.
European schools, therefore, are an institution which promote the ideas on which the European Union was built.
They are an institution which respects and promotes multilingualism, while pupils learn from pre-school age to live and act within a multicultural framework.
The 14 schools which exist today provide a common education of a high standard which will prove in future to be fundamental to European integration.
The European baccalaureate awarded to pupils is their passport to university and certifies the European profile of future workers.
It is therefore important for more European schools to be founded, probably in the new Member States also; this will bring us a step closer to European integration.
Finally, in order to safeguard and maintain the standard of education, a solution needs to be found for oversubscribed schools, especially the schools in Brussels.
The European schools are an institution which need to be safeguarded and developed in proportion to the demands of the times, because education is the most important means of shaping perceptions and because, to paraphrase Monnet, when children become European in spirit, they will find it easier to love their earth and to forge a more substantial path towards European union.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity to address a number of questions to the Commission concerning the four smaller European Schools.
Firstly, does the Commission agree that the sharp increase in the number of CategoryÂ I and CategoryÂ II pupils in the Karlsruhe European School differentiates it clearly from the other three smaller schools?
Secondly, is the Commission aware that, currently, more than 60Â companies throughout the Karlsruhe region have CategoryÂ II agreements in place?
Thirdly, can the Commission confirm that its own financial contribution to the Karlsruhe European School has been halved over the past five years thanks to these CategoryÂ II agreements?
Fourthly, does the Commission agree that this schoolâs pupils now include not only CategoryÂ I children of employees of the Institute for Transuranium Elements, but also some 50Â children whose parents work at institutions here in Strasbourg, and who take the daily shuttle bus?
Fifthly, does the Commission agree that the city of Karlsruhe only recently invested large sums of its own money in an exemplary school renovation and extension project?
Sixthly, why, in its answer to my written question dated 15Â June of this year, was the Commission unable to tell me the number of pupils with CategoryÂ I entitlement within a 100Â km radius of the school?
Is it still possible for the Commission to ascertain and publish these figures?
Seventh: particularly as the rapporteur mentions at the beginning that CategoryÂ III pupils are not paying sufficient school fees to cover all the costs, how does the Commission justify the privilege â incomprehensible to the public â of its own staff and other parents of CategoryÂ I pupils, which is that they do not have to pay any school fees at all?
I am very much obliged to CommissionerÂ Kallas for his attention and for his readiness to provide a written answer to these questions.
I would invite him most cordially to join me and see for himself the significance of this site in Karlsruhe at either end of one of the forthcoming plenary sessions.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, are the European Schools the flagship of the European education system?
No, they are not.
Where do they rank according to the PISA study?
Are they meeting quality targets?
The answer is ânoâ.
Are their shortcomings purely due to budgetary factors?
Again, the answer is ânoâ.
The list of shortcomings grows longer; complaints by parents and pupils grow louder.
Action is needed, as indeed the present report makes plain for all to see.
I should like to use my speaking time to give a voice to the letters of complaint I have received from parents and pupils.
They complain of overcrowding in the European Schools.
In Brussels, there has been an intake of 8Â 600 pupils this year, although the intended number was just 7Â 300.
The classes are too large.
High-achieving pupils are rarely being stretched or encouraged.
In the second school year following the major enlargement, the languages of the new Member States are still not on the curriculum.
The availability of languages rapidly decreases if pupils put the main emphasis on scientific subjects.
Furthermore, the role of the âeducational advisersâ, as they are known, remains unclear.
The European Schools lack an appropriate administrative culture.
Letters are going unanswered.
The European Schools and their heads need more efficient disciplinary control.
There are often failures in control at Member State level, and there is insufficient provision for control at European level.
In May, the Commission received a petition from parents of pupils in the German language section at WoluwÃ©, voicing their concern and asking the fundamental question as to whether a fourth German language section would be set up in Brussels at all, and whether the German section would be forced to move from WoluwÃ© to Laeken.
These are questions about questions, not just questions about money.
I would ask the Commissioner to tell us how he is dealing with these misgivings on the part of parents.
Â Â  . Mr President, once again I must say that a lot of these questions â or at least some of these questions â should not be addressed to me but to the board of governors.
I know about the problem of overcrowded schools in Brussels very well because when I started my work I was immediately made aware of the urgent need for additional schools.
I therefore approached the Belgian authorities, who provide the schools, and asked them to speed up the process of building a new school.
A very interesting picture emerged.
We have a school, we have three categories of pupils, we have category 3 pupils, and we at the Commission say that there has been an increase in the number of officials in the European institutions with children and we have to provide these children with normal conditions in schools, but in fact they cannot go to these schools because they are overcrowded and the schools themselves have taken in a lot of category 3 pupils.
The Commission has asked the board of governors several times to suspend the enrolment of category 3 pupils until the opening of the fourth school in Laeken, but this has constantly been rejected.
It is very interesting; the European institutions are providing money and asking for good conditions for their children in return, but the board of governors is deciding otherwise and they are deciding whom to take and whom not to take.
Therefore, we have a controversial situation.
The Belgian authorities ask us to clarify the situation ourselves among the institutions, and then we can talk because they are the same finances.
In Brussels, there is a very big concentration of officials in European institutions.
One aspect which has not been touched on at all so far is relations with the local authorities.
This is another big issue and one that I do not want to raise.
So, please, provide your support, let us take the same line with all the institutions and make it very clear that we need clear policy guidelines on this issue, more transparent management and more transparent decision-making on all these issues.
What about multilingualism?
From my point of view, I can only assure you that I come from a very small country, and multilingualism and linguistic problems are very serious for small nations.
I can only promote multilingualism, and we will try to find solutions to allow the continuation of teaching in all languages that are in use and to ensure that children can learn in national languages as much as possible.
That is the main issue.
Somebody raised the question of whether these schools are like ghettos or some place that nobody wants to go.
I investigated this issue a little in Brussels.
Of course, the schools are considered to be good ones and are very attractive.
That is the reason why there is a very clear desire to have people from outside.
It was very interesting to hear that there is some doubt about the question of institutions that are not European institutions that can provide places for category 1 pupils for their officials; we will definitely examine this question.
Regarding Karlsruhe, I understand that you do not expect me to give immediate oral answers, but, as you asked, this can be also answered through the written procedure.
I will do that with pleasure and will definitely provide all information concerning the Karlsruhe school.
Regarding the specific question raised about the discrimination of pupils with special needs: according to the information I have, no discrimination was discovered, but there was just the question of how to cover all costs for this particular case.
Parents were asked to provide some additional financing.
Of course, we have a special allowance for children with special educational needs, but sometimes we have asked for additional resources from parents in this particular case.
That is the information available to me.
I would emphasise that this schools issue is a very serious issue and I can promise you that the Commission takes it very seriously.
But let us also clarify the whole landscape: what is going on in this whole entity concerning possible decision-making?
How are decisions made, how are strategies defined?
In this particular case, again, as in many different cases, a responsibility is being asked of players who are not so directly involved in decision-making.
So the responsibility for the consequences is in one place and the decision-making in another.
Of course, financial matters are also very serious.
As I have said before, especially concerning education and cultural issues, people sometimes say that we are again talking about finances but nothing can be done.
Finances are a kind of common denominator, and in this particular case I must say that we are not satisfied with the current system of financial organisation of this entity.
You know as well as I do that these things can explode and can have very dangerous consequences, as we have seen in the European institutions, and they can do enormous damage to the image of our undertakings.
So, on this particular point also, I would like to ask for your support when we have certain proposals on how to clarify, for example, fiscal management, as we have done in several other cases.
Of course, on the question of agencies, there is an enormous desire to establish new agencies and new institutions everywhere in Europe.
I absolutely agree with the opinion that the educational aspects can also be considered, and so the Commission certainly asks for Parliament's support, and asks Parliament to be very cautious and to investigate all these proposals on all the possible consequences very carefully, including the consequences for the development of the system of European schools.
Â Â  Mr President, I am afraid that the Commissioner is misinformed in relation to the question of discrimination.
The summary of the Ombudsman's recommendation of 27 May 2005 stated that: 'The Ombudsman found that the financial aspects of the situation constituted an unjustified discrimination and made a draft recommendation that the Commission should take the necessary steps to ensure that parents of special educational needs children who are excluded from the European school because of their degree of disability should not be required to contribute to the educational costs of their children.'
They found clear discrimination.
I would ask the Commissioner to address that fact and to provide me with his opinion in writing.
Â Â  The Commission has taken note of your question, to which you will receive a reply.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Commission Statement â the Northern Dimension.
Commissioner Michel has the floor on behalf of the Commission.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted about the opportunity offered to us in this Chamber to debate the policy relating to the Northern Dimension and to do so in advance of the meeting of ministers on 21Â November, which will be devoted to this issue.
The Northern Dimension is an integrated policy of the European Union.
Its purpose is to encourage dialogue and practical cooperation in the northern parts of Europe comprising the Baltic region and the Arctic and sub-Arctic areas of our continent.
It is designed to ensure the general well-being of this vast region endowed with many natural resources and to do so by means of effective and long-lasting regional cooperation.
It also makes it possible to overcome the divisions experienced within a region whose constituent parts have very many shared characteristics and which has to face common challenges on both sides of the borders of the states concerned.
Northern Dimension policy has moved on considerably since its launch in 1999, when it was officially inaugurated by the Helsinki European Council.
The Feira European Council of June 2000 then incorporated the initial action plan for the Northern Dimension, extending over the period 2000-2003, into the European Unionâs external and cross-border policies.
The Brussels European Council of October 2003 supported the second action plan in favour of the Northern Dimension, which entered into force on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2004 and covers the period 2004-2006.
This second plan took account of the European Unionâs enlargement, set for 1Â MayÂ 2004.
Since that date, eight of the nine Baltic Sea states have been members of the European Union. The ninth is the Russian Federation.
Even before that, Northern Dimension policy had placed ever greater emphasis upon relations and cooperation with North-West Russia, an aspect that will certainly be reinforced in the years after 2006.
The second action plan relates to five areas deemed essential to the northern countries: the economic side of trade and infrastructure, the development of human resources â education, culture, research and health â the environment and nuclear safety, cross-border cooperation and, finally, justice and home affairs.
Moreover, Kaliningrad and the Arctic are considered as cross-disciplinary themes to be integrated into the five priorities.
The action plan emphasises the notions of subsidiarity and of dynamic interplay between the various actors in the Northern Dimension.
These two ideas guarantee full participation by all the parties in implementing the action plan, the parties concerned being, in particular, the partner states, the regional organisations, the regional and local authorities, the educational establishments and research institutes and, finally, civil society, not forgetting the EU itself.
In particular, I should like to stress the importance of the role played by the CBSS (Council of Baltic Sea States) and the BEAC (Barents Euro-Arctic Council), as well as the councilsâ activities and projects.
The Commission is a member of these two organisations and remains fully involved with them.
Since the beginning, the initiatives adopted within the framework of the Northern Dimension have been implemented thanks to the existing Community programmes or to the respective budgets of the parties concerned with this dimension, whether they be states or regional organisations.
At present, the European Unionâs financial instruments devoted to Northern Dimension policy are the TACIS programmes, the national and regional programmes, including what are known as the neighbourhood programmes, Interreg and, to a lesser degree, the other Community policies affecting the Northern Dimension indirectly.
The Northern Dimension also benefits from the greater scope for loans granted to Russia by the European Investment Bank.
The Commission has proposed that, as from 2007, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, that is to say one of the four new instruments for funding external actions, constitute the main source of Community funding for Russia and, hence, for Northern Dimension policy.
The institutional framework put in place by the second action plan has operated as anticipated, with ministerial meetings organised every two years and, in between, meetings of senior officials.
The first meeting of senior officials took place in Brussels on 21Â October 2004 and brought the following together: all the states involved with the Northern Dimension, together with all the other Member States of the European Union; the four Northern region organisations, that is to say the Council of Baltic Sea States, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, the Nordic Council of Ministers and the Arctic Council; the international financial institutions operating in Northern Europe; and representatives of the European Union institutions.
Canada and the United States have also taken part as observers.
The 2005 ministerial meeting, which will be held on 21Â November in Brussels on the initiative of the British Presidency, will be important as its purpose will be to approve the guidelines for preparing a political statement and a framework document for implementing the policy to be considered in the years following 2006, that is to say upon expiry of the second action plan.
According to the Commission, the main objective must be to make Northern Dimension policy a policy common to all the parties concerned, notably the Russian Federation.
If this new Northern Dimension policy is to be a success, all the parties, and Russia in particular, need to feel fully involved.
That also presupposes an unqualified commitment to the objectives and structures concerned with this dimension.
Once all the parties have demonstrated this commitment, we could envisage new partnerships in the Northern region, inspired by the successful model provided by the environmental partnership in the Northern Dimension, for which the European Union is the main provider of funds and which illustrates the very fruitful cooperation established between the four international financial institutions concerned, Russia and the Commission.
From the Commissionâs point of view, the new Northern Dimension must be considered as the form of regional expression to the north of the Common Spaces agreed at the summit on 10 May between the European Union and the Russian Federation â regional expression that would be enhanced by full participation on the part of Norway and Iceland.
It should also continue to include a number of additional objectives related to the specific characteristics of the North, in particular its fragile environment and the issue of native populations, as well as issues of health and social well-being.
The Commission is at present preparing the basic documents concerning the new Northern Dimension.
These should consist of a common political statement and a strategic framework setting out the objectives and listing the measures required for achieving them.
These documents should be approved during the second half of 2006 following a very extensive process of consultation involving everyone concerned with this dimension, in particular the four northern region organisations, the international financial institutions operating in this same region, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
The documents should enter into force in 2007 upon expiry of the second action plan.
The political statement and strategic framework related to the new dimension should be permanent in character, replacing the current model of three-year action plans while necessarily remaining subject to regular review.
By way of facilitating these periodic reviews, the idea is also that, in future, everyone involved in the Northern Dimension should present assessments at the Northern Dimension ministerial meetings.
The consultations on the new strategy have begun, and I am delighted at the opportunity they offer me to exchange views with Parliament.
The Commission will gladly listen to any new idea or suggestion from Parliament about the development of this strategy and will also keep Parliament fully informed of this development.
As for the Commission, it will continue to prepare annual reports.
The information system concerning the Northern Dimension is also available on the Relex DG web site.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude by expressing the hope that the discussions we are currently conducting with Russia will lead to Russia committing itself unreservedly to the new phase on which the Northern Dimension strategy will embark in 2007.
I also wish to emphasise that the Commission is fully determined to go on working to make this strategy succeed, both by implementing the second action plan and by developing the strategy.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is excellent that the Northern Dimension is once again entering the debate, and I am very encouraged by Commissioner Michelâs eagerness to commit to its development.
When you look at the list of speakers, however, you notice one substantial problem associated with this concept: up till now the Northern Dimension has been the concern of far too few people.
Too few in Parliament and the EU Member States feel it has to do with them.
The programme has not yet produced the results that were hoped for, and many people still know very little about it.
This major initiative of the Finnish Presidency in 1999 is far too worthwhile a project to be lost simply because of a lack of political clout.
The Northern Dimension must be made more viable, and I am grateful that a Member of the Commission should have the same objective.
Apart from attracting very little attention, the Northern Dimension has been given very little money.
Not having its own budget line, it has remained theoretical.
If sums are compared with the financing which the EU has provided for the Mediterranean, they obviously amount to just a fraction of that, but I am delighted to hear about new financial instruments.
The Northern Dimension has suffered from a certain lack of identity, and so far has been unable to create a clear profile for itself that distinguishes it from other programmes.
We should be realistic: only a strategy with a clear financial framework and a budget line will succeed in establishing its status.
This is one reason why some of us representatives of the Nordic countries have recently been looking in the direction of the Baltic Sea and the countries on its coastline.
The Baltic Sea is unquestionably part of the Northern Dimension.
With the eastward enlargement of the EU, the Baltic became almost completely an internal sea of the European Union, and it should be accorded the importance it deserves.
It is our sea: .
Surrounding it are new Member States of the EU which are highly motivated to strengthen cooperation in the Baltic region so that all the important elements of the Northern Dimension are reinforced and new political muscle is used for regional cooperation.
The Northern Dimension has been a tool of external relations, but the separate elements of its sphere of operation have not benefited sufficiently from factors that would unite it.
It now needs a new approach that would unify the region.
This is where Baltic Sea conservation and development of the Baltic Sea economic region are important.
When we first joined the EU it might have been enough if we were able to have an impact on verbal reality and at least some people repeated the words and ideas we expressed.
That is no longer enough; as the Union expands and as, at the same time, the need is great, I want the Northern Dimension and the Baltic Sea strategy to become a research project that will benefit the people who live in the region and one of environmental conservation.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for this communication.
The enlarged European Union needs visibility in its various geographical regions.
It is widely recognised in the European Union that there has to be visible action in the Mediterranean region to maintain peopleâs security and welfare and our continentâs steady and sustainable development.
The Northern Dimension is a later arrival in the sphere of EU activity.
It has been a part of Union policy, as decided by the Council, since the German Presidency in 1999.
As has been said here, however, commitment to this policy on the part of the Commission and the Member States has been very unsatisfactory, and it was very interesting and satisfying to hear the Commissionerâs assurance that there is to be a change with regard to this issue.
The EUâs most recent round of enlargement also raises the matter of the need for a new Eastern Dimension.
The Northern Dimension is an umbrella arrangement designed to try to give attention not only to the Unionâs northern regions but also to its northern neighbouring regions, in the form, for example, of practical cooperation with the northwestern part of Russia and the Arctic regions.
The practical work of the Northern Dimension is based on partnerships in which the European Union and Russia, Norway and Iceland are participants.
Canada, too, is involved in many projects.
The practical work of the Northern dimension is based on partnerships, and the best example of this is the realisation of environmental partnerships and the way these have come about could serve as an example to all the other EU regional projects.
In short, the contribution of EUR 75 million by the partnership countries and the EU has meant we have been able to start or we have planned environmental projects worth EUR 2 billion.
This autumn a sewage works southwest of St Petersburg will be completed.
It will have considerable importance for reducing the waste load in the Baltic Sea.
In the future we will have to develop a Northern Dimension policy, get new bodies and agencies involved in it, and provide support for the work of earlier partners.
As the Commissioner said, the Nordic Council of Ministers, the Council of the Baltic Sea States, and the Barents Euro-Arctic Regional Council are all important players in the Northern Dimension.
Most important of all, however, is the Commissionâs own commitment and that of the Member States.
The Northern Dimension must be made a reality so that it can genuinely become a part of our common policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for his very full, descriptive statement on the Northern Dimension and also for sharing with us some of the thoughts about the future.
It is about the future â what comes after 2006 â that there is much concern.
Over the last six years, I have had the privilege to represent this Parliament on a number of parliamentary bodies in the Arctic, Barents and Baltic region.
It is quite clear that our parliamentary colleagues on those bodies look to this Parliament and the European Union to provide a robust and functioning Northern Dimension policy.
It is somewhat ironic that this is a policy that is normally played out at a regional level and it is therefore absolutely essential that it involves elected Members and all other stakeholders, as the Commissioner has said.
However, it is a policy that tends to be set at the biannual ministerial meetings.
Therefore this Parliament has sometimes suggested that some form of Northern Dimension forum, bringing in all the stakeholders and elected representatives, would be a good idea for the future.
We must give this policy bottom-up motion so that it is really working and dynamic and represents the wishes of the area it is there to serve.
Also, the original Northern Dimension had a wide vision of a policy from the Urals to Greenland, encompassing the Arctic and the subarctic region.
It is right that we concentrate much effort on our relationship with Russia, and there is much that can be done there.
If we have a dynamic St Petersburg, then the Baltic itself will be dynamic and that even reflects on trade in the area I know best â the north-east coast of the United Kingdom.
So it can benefit all of us and we must take an interest.
However, it must be a shared policy in partnership with Russia, not a covert way of directing some EU policy towards Russia.
As has already been mentioned, we must also bring in our other partners, Norway and Iceland.
The Norwegian Government has recently produced a very full policy document for discussion on the High North.
It wants European Union involvement.
We should respond to that.
This fragile area of our world gives us the opportunity to cooperate with many partners and even to have dialogue with the US on climate change.
We should seize that opportunity within a wider Northern Dimension policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Northern Dimension is both an issue of external relations and an internal matter.
The Baltic Sea is a part of the Northern Dimension which is connected with both.
As has already been said, since enlargement it has become almost entirely an internal sea of the EU.
The Baltic is one of the most vulnerable areas of sea in the world, and at present it is in very poor shape.
None of this is visible from the surface, however.
The often repeated depressing fact is that the largest stretch of wasteland in Europe lies at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
It is actually a vast zone devoid of oxygen, where the basic living organisms have died.
The Baltic is fairly large in area but it is shallow.
The average depth is only 58 metres, while that of the Mediterranean, for example, is several kilometres.
The pollution load reaching the Baltic, however, is high.
Approximately 0.5% of the worldâs people live in its catchment area, although around 10% of the worldâs sea traffic passes through it.
The number of oil consignments from ports in Russia in particular is increasing very rapidly.
We know that a major oil tanker accident is a catastrophe wherever it may occur.
In the Baltic Sea, however, the consequences would be vastly more disastrous and longer-term than in the Atlantic.
Eutrophication in the Baltic is visible in the summer, for example, in the form of blue-green algae.
The greatest cause of this is agriculture.
Environmental toxicity levels are high: for example, levels of contamination in seals and white-tailed eagles are approximately five times greater than in the Atlantic.
Some of these problems can only be solved in collaboration with Russia, but some, such as agricultural emissions, are matters the resolution of which is in the hands of the European Union and its Member States.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union is like a boat, whose keel is in the Mediterranean Sea and whose mast is in the Baltic.
Winds blow into its sails from every direction, not least from where our partners are in the Northern Dimension: Russia, Norway and Iceland.
This is sometimes forgotten by our southern friends in the Mediterranean region.
Russia is a rich country, where there are a lot of poor people.
The country has drifted into a state of chaos, in a way which we humanists cannot behold with indifference: there are street children and prostitutes, criminals and terrorists, and there are huge environmental problems.
Russiaâs state of health is reflected in the fact that the countryâs population is falling by a million a year.
It would be good if the Commissioner put on headphones, as I do not suppose he understands Finnish.
It is possible to help this neighbour state of the EU solve its problems with funding, for example, under TACIS and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership programmes, under the umbrella of the Northern Dimension.
We need a new and better Northern Dimension action programme, which must be drafted together with Russia.
Now that the good Commissioner is listening, I will continue.
The Northern Dimension must not, however, be merely a matter of helping Russia: it needs to be a means of cooperation.
There needs to be a belief in good intentions on either side.
The Northern Dimension must also cover cooperation with oil-rich Norway and energy-rich Iceland.
Its action plan should extend into the northern region to include Greenland and Alaska, to say nothing of the Barents Sea.
In the same way, there should be closer cooperation with the regional councils.
The fact that the EU does not always take part in the meetings of the Arctic Council, the Barents Council or the Barents Euro-Arctic Council says something about its indifferent approach to external relations in the development of the Northern Dimension.
The Commission should take seriously the desire of the EUâs northern Member States to develop Europeâs northern regions alongside the Mediterranean region, and the Commissioner should listen to the debate through his headphones if he does not understand the language.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there is unfortunately a constant attempt to get involved in just about every area.
We are to vote on many such objectionable proposals later today.
When it comes to the Northern Dimension, it is therefore, in my view, very important for us to concentrate on results-oriented activity and not on everything under heaven and earth that is north of the fiftieth degree of latitude.
What, then, is important in the Northern Dimension over the next ten or fifteen years?
Generally speaking, I agree entirely with all the previous speakers that the answer is the Baltic Sea.
What is more, I would add that the nuclear plants outside Saint Petersburg give rise to one of those topical issues that are genuinely of extreme importance.
It should be noted that, in both cases, Russia has a crucial role to play.
It is a matter, therefore, of cultivating the contact we have with Russia and developing it in both these areas.
The Baltic is an absolutely unique inland sea.
There is no comparison with the Mediterranean or, indeed, any other sea in the world.
The Baltic consists of brackish water, meaning that flora and fauna that are actually suited to salty sea water or fresh water are in constant danger.
The salt content goes up or down depending on how the water flows through the Sound.
That makes the Baltic incredibly sensitive because, as quite a few speakers have pointed out, it is a shallow sea.
The Baltic cannot cope with pollution, yet around the Baltic there is now intensive economic activity and intensive agriculture with a host of discharges.
This means that our efforts should be directed at, for example, rescuing flora and fauna, cleaning up after discharges, monitoring marine transport and closing down the Saint Petersburg nuclear plants.
Â Â  . Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems that now, when the European Union has taken on a leading role in the realisation of the Northern Dimension, it is showing signs of being more like a business plan than a policy.
Why?
In spite of the fact that it is welcome that the Northern Dimension is applied to the Baltic Sea region with the aim of developing cooperation both within the region and also in the border region from the Baltic Sea towards the east, and that efforts are being made to involve Russia, which is nurturing its understanding of western values, it is time to take a good look at how seriously Russia has taken the Northern Dimension itself and factors connected with it into account so far.
It is quite obvious that in the wider context of the region Russia thinks predominantly of its own interests.
This is proven by its inability to free itself of imperial thinking, based on Tsar Peter Iâs approach to Europe, in the 17th century, of forcing a breach, continuing right up to its inability to accept the independence regained by the Baltic states and their equal membership of the Baltic Sea region within the context of development and security.
As a result, the facilities developed in the Baltic Sea are completely inadequate in terms of meeting the Northern Dimensionâs goals: for example, the transport and energy systems and the new ports at St Petersburg, which not only complicate the environmental situation, but make it more expensive for European Union consumers to obtain natural resources in the northern region.
As a result, ships and tankersâ routes are lengthening, traffic in the Baltic Sea is continuing to increase and in the near future will double or treble, the cost of raw materials is increasing and there are growing risks of shipping collisions in the Baltic Sea.
All this should be taken into account.
I would also like to place particular emphasis on the fact that Russia has a special need to foster democracy, since, unfortunately, it is absolutely clear that the current Russian regime is ignoring this extremely important objective.
Only once Russia has managed to solve these problems will we be able to hope that the Northern Dimension will achieve its technical and economic objectives in relation to Russia.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to start by making a point to the people who prepare the European Parliament agendas and also to the English interpretation booth.
Today we are talking about the Dimension, not the Dimension.
There is a rather substantial difference.
There are four Nordic countries; the Northern Dimension encompasses the whole north of Europe.
It is important to remember that when drawing up the agenda next time.
I think that the Northern Dimension stands at a crossroads. It has two options.
One is that it withers away under the Russian road map and becomes just a part of it. The second is that we start refocusing it, for instance towards the Baltic Sea.
I happen to have a preference for the second option.
I am very happy that the Commission is dealing with the matter today and that we are able to discuss it.
I am also very happy to see that there are other non-Finns in the Chamber besides Mrs Wallis, who was the only non-Finn to speak about the subject in November 2003.
So the concept is moving forward and that is a good thing.
I would like to make three observations.
Firstly, I think that the Northern Dimension should have its own budget line.
I firmly believe that it needs it.
If it is put under the neighbourhood policy I think it will only get crumbs from the general budget.
So give it its own budget line.
Secondly, I think we need to rejuvenate the Northern Dimension, give it more content than before.
The ideas that Commissioner Michel put forward are a step in the right direction.
However, I fully agree with, for example, Mrs Korhola and Mrs Hassi, who said that we should refocus it on the Baltic Sea, because that probably is the sickest sea we have in Europe today.
To all the people sitting in the Parliament for the first time today, just remember that the Baltic Sea has an average depth of 59 metres compared to the two to three kilometres of the Mediterranean.
If there were to be an oil accident, that would be the end of the Baltic Sea, and I am sure no one would like to see that happen.
So let us get more focus.
Thirdly, we need to start coordinating the institutions that are dealing with the Northern Dimension and the Baltic Sea region.
We need more coordination between the Nordic Council, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, and the Baltic Sea Council.
They need to work together.
I want to ask the Commissioner one final question.
Do you not think it would be a good idea to have a Northern Dimension as the overarching concept, but a Baltic Sea strategy as an underlying theme working within the Northern Dimension?
Â Â  Mr President, the Northern Dimension has served as a useful framework for cooperation across national borders and, in particular, across the EUâs external border with Russia.
It has a considerable importance for this sort of cooperation between people and various organisations, and it has importance specifically for regional security, welfare and stability.
The Northern Dimension should be included in all the EUâs policies and not remain a separate heading.
It was good to hear that the Commissioner agrees.
Whether it is a matter of the environment, health or culture, everything also has its northern dimension in the same way the EUâs policy on the Mediterranean does.
The EUâs northeastern border is at least as crucially important as its border in the southern Mediterranean.
The standard-of-living gap in the north is the widest in Europe.
On the Russian side, the economic and health statistics are on a par with Africa.
HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis, drugs and alcoholism have lowered life expectancy in males to levels in the developing countries.
Of the hundreds of projects, those which stand out most clearly are the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership and the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well-being.
The aim of the latest programme is the control of these infectious diseases and the prevention of various dangers to society in our neighbouring areas: which will be no minor feat in the future either.
MrÂ President, the EUâs best investments in the environment and in health are still being made behind Finlandâs eastern border, and it is on that border that the interests of the whole of the EU are being watched over above all by the Finns.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissionâs report shows that the importance of the Northern Dimension in the Unionâs external relations is growing in strength.
Especially gratifying is the fact that Russiaâs attitude towards it is becoming more positive than what it was before.
In order to develop the Northern Dimensionâs importance in the Unionâs external relations the Commission should be given two tasks.
Firstly, not only Russia but also our northern European Economic Area partners, Iceland and Norway, should be strongly encouraged to be involved in cooperation in the northern regions and, for example, the new EU Neighbourhood Policy.
Secondly, the Commission should participate more dynamically in the work of the councils that operate in the northernmost region of the earth: the Council of the Baltic Sea States, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, and the Arctic Council.
My main message, however, is connected with what is missing from the Commissionâs report entirely: cooperation in the Baltic Sea region.
Until spring of last year, the Baltic countries and Poland were our neighbours and partners in external relations.
Now they have joined the Union the development of the Baltic Sea region is essentially based on mutual cooperation between the Member States and the Unionâs internal policy.
The Commission needs to take this into account when shaping the guidelines for the Northern Dimension.
Now that our Northern Dimension partners have gone from just being neighbours to being members, a comprehensive strategy for developing the Baltic Sea region should be drawn up, within the framework of which the Member States and the Commission can collaborate on projects such as improving environmental conservation and the energy economy in the region as well as its internal communications.
Baltic Sea cooperation will establish the Northern Dimension in the Unionâs internal policies, but cooperation with Russia will obviously still be conducted as part of the Northern Dimension of external relations.
Baltic Sea cooperation will finally contribute some real substance to those views of the Council which have emphasised the importance of the Northern Dimension generally and also in the internal development of the Union.
There should be some reorganisation in the Commission so that it is not only the External Relations Directorate-General that deals with questions relating to the Northern Dimension but other Directorate-Generals as well.
Â Â  Mr President, it is indeed timely that we should be discussing the Northern dimension in this House.
I also join with others in saluting the initiative taken by the Finnish Government.
It is also good to remark, as colleagues have said, that this debate is attended by French, German, Austrian, Belgian, British and other colleagues.
It is timely, as has been said, that we extend the work of the Northern Dimension to encompass a Baltic Sea strategy, which is a true reflection of today's reality, the Baltic bordered by eight EU Member States and the Russian Federation.
In this Parliament there is a Baltic Europe intergroup, which meets every month in Strasbourg and which I have the honour to chair.
It encompasses members not only from each political group but also representing the great majority of Member States.
We have been working to produce a Baltic Sea strategy.
Yesterday we had the honour to meet with President-in-Office and Minister for Europe Mr Alexander. We are extremely grateful for his enthusiasm and interest in the project leading up to the ministerial meeting on 21 November on the Northern dimension.
Commissioner Michel, I would urge you â perhaps in your reply â just to confirm that the Commission, you and your colleagues will be working extremely closely with the British Presidency to ensure the successful initiation and implementation of the Baltic Sea strategy, which will be seen as a natural extension â a complement â to the work of the Northern Dimension.
I wholly agree with others, that we shall have a discreet budget line for the Baltic Sea strategy to match and balance the very successful work that we do through the Euromed policy, which â obviously â historically predates the work in the Baltic.
The scope of this work cannot be underestimated: its importance ranks in the very highest policy that the EU should now be developing.
What we are talking about is nothing less than offsetting and overcoming half a century of Soviet occupation, oppression, misrule and marginalisation.
We are pledged to restore the economic harmony, security, prosperity and cultural vibrancy of the Baltic region.
To ensure the success of this work, it is absolutely vital that the British, German, Polish, French and Italian Governments and the whole of the EU administration lend their support to this great work.
We want to see a truly successful enlarged European Union.
That will not happen unless we have a successful Baltic Sea strategy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I shall begin by thanking the Commissioner for his encouraging presentation, and I shall continue in Swedish.
Last yearâs enlargement of the EU has a very great effect upon the Northern Dimension.
The Baltic Sea region, which comprises all of eight Member States, now forms the very heart of the Northern Dimension.
It is a region with great potential for economic development and urgent challenges in, for example, the area of environmental policy, which must become part of the agenda for the whole of the EU.
The people there expect a policy that makes it possible to make full use of the regionâs potential, a factor that must also be taken into account in the EUâs policy on Russia.
When the European Parliament set up what are known as its intergroups, the group that was to deal with the Baltic region as a whole was one of the most popular, which is a sign of just how much demand there is for such cooperation.
That being said, there is a lack of shared awareness and, consequently, of solidarity and a common sense of identity in the region.
We must now take steps to heal this wound following the division of Europe.
The Baltic must become a matter for the whole of the EU. A flourishing EU needs a flourishing Baltic region, and the region needs the EU in order to be able to solve a range of problems, environmental as well as social and economic.
It is also important for Russia to get involved in the cooperation taking place under the banner of the Northern Dimension.
It would be of symbolic importance to support Saint Petersburg so that, in future, all the waste water from the city might be cleaned up, so benefiting everyone living in the Baltic region.
The population of that region expects such obvious problems to be solved.
It is unfortunate that the Northern Dimension has often been seen as an issue internal to Finland.
It is also regrettable that Baltic cooperation, which is important, has in a way fallen outside the Northern Dimension, in spite of the fact that Baltic cooperation is an essential part of that dimension.
It is important for the Commission to succeed now in properly strengthening the Baltic side of the Northern Dimension.
It must be possible to do a better job of coordinating research in the region and directing it at issues of common concern.
Important infrastructure projects can bind the region together.
We also need an extensive exchange of students and labour.
Energy supplies must become more diverse.
My message to the Commissioner is this: incorporate the Baltic as an important part of the Northern Dimension.
Draw up a bold strategy for the region, and be more daring.
Â Â  Mr President, I am encouraged by the Commissioner's fresh approach to this topic.
For me, the Northern dimension was an ambitious initiative when it was proposed by the Finnish Prime Minister, Mr Lipponen, eight years ago.
Under the first Finnish Presidency it succeeded in turning the EU's attention towards north-eastern Europe.
Today, the Baltic Sea has become an internal sea of the EU, uniting an extremely promising region of 85Â million inhabitants with immense economic potential.
I should like to make three observations.
My first concern is related to the highly alarming ecological situation of the Baltic Sea, where environmental and toxic hazards are often up to five times higher than in the North Sea area.
These growing risks and challenges need to be addressed by more cohesive and long-term policies, using the resources of the EU as a whole.
It is high time, therefore, to widen the concept of the Northern dimension beyond cooperation projects with Russia's north-west regions, to cover the whole area of the Baltic Sea including the Kaliningrad area.
Secondly, within the Northern dimension, we should have a special Baltic Sea strategy, just as there is an EU strategy for the Mediterranean.
The time has come to draw practical conclusions from the enlargement of the EU to the east and north-east.
Clearly, we need a much more creative and balanced approach to these areas, including the creation of concrete financial instruments.
Thirdly, one of the core elements of the Northern dimension is cooperation with Russia.
The efficiency and reliability of the EU common foreign policy are being particularly tested in this region.
Despite the European Parliament's May resolution on Russia, which called on Member States to resist Russia's attempts to differentiate between old and new Members, unfortunately the date of 8 September stands as a symbol of the separate relations between Russia and some larger Member States.
The so-called SchrÃ¶der-Putin agreement will officially start the building of a new under-sea gas pipeline between Germany and Russia, solidifying the special relationship between those two countries.
The side effect of that project would be to expose Poland, the Baltic States and Ukraine to the Russian practice of using economic pressure to advance its foreign policy aims.
If its long-term cooperation with Russia is to be successful, the EU needs to start sending a clear and coherent signal to Moscow.
Our first priority must be to convince Russian policy-makers that we take our own common foreign policy seriously.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that Europe is home to almost 500 million people has made it the part of the world with the greatest purchasing power, and that makes the sort of strategy that we are discussing today especially important.
Purchasing power has not only advantages but also disadvantages, and so we have to consider in what areas we want to include this new dimension.
I would like to draw particular attention to energy policy.
I regard the Baltic region in particular as a region with a future, and as one that is of the utmost importance to us.
Countries such as Norway, with its reserves of crude oil and natural gas, and Iceland, with its renewable geothermal energy, are examples for us to follow in this respect and present us with an immense opportunity to develop common strategies for energy policy in this area; I believe that the current state of energy prices â for both oil and gas â means that this will be one of the most important issues in the future.
Not only in that respect, but also as regards the security of our energy supply, this area will, in future, have a special part to play.
When I say that the infrastructure, too, presents us with a vitally important challenge, I am referring not only to the energy infrastructure, but also to such things as telecommunications.
Tasks such as developing broadband technology and ensuring access to information on the Internet by a wider cross-section of society will in future have an important part to play in the future, particularly in remote regions.
A primary concern in cross-border cooperation is economic in nature â to bring together small and medium-sized businesses.
The need to create jobs and to attempt to raise the standard of living in these regions make it particularly important that our promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and of cooperation above all, should take no account of borders.
That brings me on to a really fundamental issue, that of the WTO and Russia.
I believe it to be crucial to the Hong Kong talks in particular that we should join together with Russia in considering a common strategy as regards global lawmaking.
I regard this dimension as being of particular importance to us in terms of our trade relations, and the importance to Europe of the further development of the WTO structures will be consistent with this.
A very interesting debate is currently going on in this region about how we can join together in adapting to the new situations in the global context, and that I see as being the real challenge for Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Parliament for the great interest it has expressed in this Chamber for a subject that is clearly important.
I should also like to thank the speakers who, overall, reacted very positively to the statement I made on behalf of MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner.
I should like to point out that it is she who deserves the credit because I was speaking on her behalf, and I shall be sure to convey this general feeling of support to her.
I shall also pass on all the suggestions and reflections expressed that do not necessarily relate to the statement, in particular those concerning the place and role of Russia and cooperation with that country.
The Russian economy shows encouraging growth, so it is likely that European Union budgets will not increase in this area.
However, the Commission does not dismiss the possibility of new partnerships if Russia commits itself formally to the Northern Dimension.
I would just add that, in my view, the comparison with the Mediterranean is not entirely appropriate, given the different characteristics of the two regions, particularly with regard to economic indicators, the populations concerned and the number of countries involved etc.
To return to Russia, the Commission is receptive to that countryâs proposals and contributions.
Russia needs to be present at the ministerial meeting about the Northern Dimension, to be held on 21Â NovemberÂ 2005, and then to participate fully in the entire range of the Northern Dimensionâs activities.
Russia is a strategic partner of the European Union, as witnessed to by the positive conclusions of the summit of 10Â May and by the adoption of the road maps for the four Common Spaces.
Our objective consists of devising a joint European Union-Russia policy on the Northern Dimension, also involving Norway and Iceland.
This policy should be in keeping with the Common Spaces, with which it should be aligned in terms of the Northern region, and it should have a number of specific characteristics.
I shall now say something about specific funding.
I think that the European Community should continue to support the Northern Dimension within the framework of the programmes at present being implemented, that is to say TACIS and the European Neighbourhood Policy, and of those to be implemented in the future within the framework of the draft European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.
It should also be noted that what will also be useful in terms of infrastructure is the fact that the opportunities for loans by the European Investment Bank to Russia and the western NIS (newly independent states) have recently been increased.
Thanks to the practical support froma wide range of donors, the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnershipis showing how useful it is for meeting very specific and urgent needs.
It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that these results could be reproduced in other areas, but that would require a similar level of commitment from all those providing funds.
Because it is important, I need to reply to a question I was asked several times, namely that concerning a Baltic strategy within the Northern Dimension.
That option obviously has its merits. However, I think that we should, for all that, point out that the Commission is active around the Baltic Sea through the EUâs internal policies.
The fact is that, as I mentioned earlier, eight of the nine countries bordering the Baltic are Member States, benefiting from the EUâs internal policies and programmes.
There can be no forgetting the far North with its specific characteristics: relatively unpopulated, but with a very large native culture and environmental problems peculiar to itself. I am thinking, for example, of the former Russian nuclear bases on the Kola Peninsula.
Those, then, are the replies we intended giving today. Obviously, though, I shall be very particular in conveying the feelings, reflections and very strong commitment of the MEPs who spoke in this debate.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  I have listened to this debate with interest, yet not taken part, much like the country I represent, Scotland.
The Scottish Parliament has complete competence in areas like Fisheries, the Environment and several other areas relevant to the Northern Dimension.
Sadly, we have had little input to the development of this policy, though I do hope that that will change.
We have much to contribute from our own experience, and much to learn as a West-Nordic nation.
I today make a plea to the European Commission to remember us in their planning, and to the Scottish government to play a more active part alongside our neighbours Iceland, Norway and others.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0173/2005) by Mr Thierry Cornillet, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on tourism and development [2004/2212(INI)].
Â Â  MrÂ President, tourism is the largest global economic activity, both in terms of turnover and number of jobs.
It is one of the most dynamic sectors in the world, true though it is that it is extremely volatile and very sensitive, particularly in the wake of attacks. Think of those of 11Â September, which brought tourist development to a sudden halt.
Developing countries were the first to suffer from this reversal.
The tourist economy characteristically cuts across an extremely wide range of areas. It naturally leads to the development of hotels, together with other forms of accommodation, such as self-catering cottages and family-run guest houses, that are outside the hotel system proper.
It gives rise to restaurants, which may or may not be attached to hotels.
It enables staff to be trained not only in the professions associated with the hotel and catering industry but also in languages.
It makes for extremely wide-ranging economic activity, with all types of salespeople eager to respond to the demands of, for example, people who have forgotten their toothpaste or medicines or who want croissants to eat every morning in their hotel. Tourist development has bearing upon all areas of the food industry, not to mention, of course, all the souvenir shops there are.
What is more, tourism in itself generates a very heavy demand for substantial forms of infrastructure, most prominent among which are not only airports but also sea ports and main roads, as well as smaller roads serving tourist destinations and other places to visit.
Moreover, tourism encourages specific demand affecting areas over which the state traditionally has jurisdiction, be it in matters of security or public health.
I shall return to this point.
By the way in which it cuts across such a variety of areas, tourism therefore guarantees genuine economic development, but it does not stop there.
Tourism also makes for land conservation and better protection of the environment, the fact of the matter being that, with the creation of world heritage sites, we now give serious thought to areas that are to be protected, without however being set piously apart, so enabling them to be exploited âintelligentlyâ for tourist purposes.
Tourism is also a factor in democracy and political stability because tourists with no intention of being bound by any all-inclusivepackage see a country open up before them; because tourism is enriching and is educational in a way that, as everyone knows, undermines dictatorship; because tourism can establish ethical rules, particularly regarding child labour; and because the idea of fair tourism, which in fact constitutes a form of dissuasion, is beginning to make itself felt in our part of the world.
Finally, tourism is an essential factor in public health and education.
Health risks constitute absolutely the wrong type of advertising.
Remember the problem of Ebola virus in Congo and elsewhere. The same applies, however, to malaria and makes states much more sensitive to the need to eradicate these diseases.
Tourism is extremely demanding in terms of decent hospital infrastructure which, of course, will also serve the local population.
Finally, tourism is an educational factor because it makes people learn languages and in that way opens peopleâs minds.
Let us not deceive ourselves.
Tourism can also be a factor causing disturbance and leading to abuse.
I shall give just two examples.
The first is sex tourism, which is clearly a means of development for certain countries that do not provide themselves with the resources for preventing it.
The second is property speculation, in particular that whereby leading families buy up properties or that whereby, if one is not careful, sites are destroyed.
The fact that tourism is the worldâs largest form of economic activity and that it can be an economic lever for developing countries cannot be a matter of indifference to the European Union.
Tourism must therefore be better integrated into all forms of the aid we offer.
That naturally applies to all our programmes, be they the EDF, MEDA, ASEAN or other programmes.
The percentage of these funds directly appropriated to tourist development projects must be increased.
We ourselves must strengthen our own structures.
I am glad that MrÂ Michel is in the Chamber, because what I have just said applies not only to the Enterprise DG but also to the Development DG, both of which should have tourism departments with a bit more clout.
We need help in strengthening the public-private partnership.
Let us not delude ourselves. The public sector will not take care of tourist development in its entirety.
Through the aid it supplies through ourselves and through the impetus it provides, in particular for the creation of major infrastructure, the public sector can, however, help tourism develop further.
Finally, tourism must give rise to ethical reflection within the European Union and, more generally, at global level.
To prevent corruption and merciless speculation in all its forms, help should not be given to just anyone, anywhere.
Thought needs to be given to ways of putting a stop to sex tourism and, in particular, to the forms of legal action available to us in our own countries.
Particularly when it comes to child labour, we need to be sure about the situation regarding working conditions and public freedoms within developing countries.
Tourism, which encourages knowledge of other people and the exchange of experiences, offers a promising route for developing countries to go down.
Finally, visitors to other countries are perhaps more aware than others of the urgent need there is to increase and channel international aid.
The presence of that aid becomes apparent.
Having seen evidence of it, people take an interest; and, having taken an interest, they give in a much more visible way.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome the in-depth work that has been done on the drawing up of this report and the resolution on tourism and development that is packed with interesting ideas.
As the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, has noted, the Development Directorate-General, which is under my authority, has no specialised service for tourism issues.
That obviously does not mean, though, that there are no projects in this sector.
Furthermore, in his explanatory statement, the rapporteur points to the significant funding from the European Development Fund in the sector.
The Commission deals with the issue of tourism in the developing countries from the point of view of aid for the private sector and the sustainable management of natural resources.
Tourist promoters in the developing countries therefore have all the instruments for aid to the private sector available to them.
The investment facility managed by the European Investment Bank has thereby funded several hotel projects in the ACP countries, while the PROINVEST programme provides the sector with non-financial support, such as the strengthening of capacities and the promotion of investments.
Furthermore, the European Development fund has funded hotel training schools in numerous countries to accompany the rapid development of the tourism sector.
Furthermore, road, port and airport investments funded by the European Development Fund play a crucial role in the development of tourism, as well as water supply, electrification, sanitation, waste treatment and environmental conservation programmes.
Furthermore, the ecolabel system, promoted by the Commission, enables tourism entrepreneurs to obtain a label certifying that their tourism company respects environmental standards, which is important for the ecotourism market.
It is therefore very difficult to isolate purely tourist projects.
The report acknowledges the transversal nature of the sector.
I entirely agree with this idea.
The European Unionâs strategy consists of supporting the partners in their development efforts by helping them to enhance all the resources available to them, including tourism.
In the case of the small island countries of the Caribbean and the Pacific, tourism is one of the only resources available.
Furthermore, proper environmental management of ecosystems such as forests, coral reefs or rivers would allow these resources to be conserved and generate long-term revenue for the local population.
I agree with the points of view expressed in points 1 and 2 relating to durable or sustainable tourism.
The European Unionâs cooperation with its partners is aimed at promoting sustainable development based on local resources and which is respectful of the environment.
With regard to the increase in tourism projects advocated, I must point out that we must prevent the scattering of funding and, in order to achieve the maximum impact, the Commission, in agreement with the partner States, focuses its aid on a relatively limited number of sectors.
These sectors are determined in joint agreement with the countries in question.
Since tourism is essentially a private sector activity, the multiplication of tourist projects falls within the domain of promoters.
For promoters in ACP countries, the Commission has established the Investment Facility, with a capital of EUR 2.2 billion, in order to respond to an increase in requests for funding.
The Commission treats the participatory approach and the quest for adherence of the beneficiaries as one of the cardinal principles of its development policy.
The private sector is consulted as recommended in pointÂ 15.
As for the support for countries falling victim to natural disasters, this is already a constant of Community aid, as is the obligation to respect and protect the environment and local cultures.
We share the concerns expressed in point 30 about the training of specialised personnel on the ground in the countries in question, and we would point out that this is precisely what the Commission has always favoured.
In Madagascar, for example, the Commission has established a training project that is directed at both promoters and their employees.
The Commission naturally agrees on the need vigorously to combat sex tourism, especially where the victims are children, in particular by providing the judicial systems of partner countries with all the assistance they need to eradicate this scourge.
I would like to thank the European Parliament for the attention it has given the Commissionâs services and you may rest assured that I will take all the necessary steps to ensure a more effective monitoring of all activities relating to tourism.
Nevertheless, the Commission does not believe that a Directorate-General should be created solely responsible for tourism.
Â Â  . â Mr President, no one doubts the importance of tourism as a central component in European development policy.
Tourism, as the rapporteur rightly states in his report, is not only a factor of economic growth; it also makes a substantial contribution to democracy and political equilibrium in developing countries.
Nonetheless, an effective EU policy of tourism to other countries depends on an integrated policy for sustainable European tourism within the European Union.
I should like to link our debate today with the debate held on the guidelines for sustainable European tourism, because I believe that only if the European Union creates conditions of harmonious correlation between internal and external competence on tourism issues will it have an effective tourism policy for developing countries.
In other words, .
Since the Treaty of Maastricht, tourism policy has been a central objective of the action of the European Union.
With the European Constitution, tourism is reintegrated into the sectors of supporting, coordinating or complementary action by the Union.
The legal basis therefore exists, as does the challenge to create a coordinated European policy of action in the tourism sector.
The challenge of moving from the level of pronouncements to a cohesive and effective structural policy cofinanced by the Union, a policy of sustainable tourism, a source of economic development of both traditional and rural destinations, a source of knowledge of history and cultural heritage, a policy with specific strategic guidelines, clear objectives and linked objectives and means.
A politically mature and institutionally perfect European policy for sustainable European tourism will also facilitate the smooth interconnection of European tourism policy with European development policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Cornillet for his report, which highlights the importance of tourism and its potential in the developing world.
When looking at the developing world, we have to remember that tourism plays more of a role in some regions and countries than in others; the figures in the report show that.
In the Caribbean, tourism is a key driver of the economy, but that is not the case across sub-Saharan Africa where, with a few exceptions, tourism is not such a big factor.
For that reason, the Socialist Group cannot support the report in its entirety.
For example, we cannot support paragraph 8, which asks all developing countries to draft tourism development plans, to produce annual reports on figures and contributions, because that is not appropriate in all cases and in many countries it would be a pretty low priority.
Nor can we agree with paragraph 10.
At a time when the EU is demanding more and more visa controls from third country nationals, it seems a bit ironic that we then ask other countries to drop their visa requirements.
Visas are often a major source of income for developing countries, so that is not something that we can support.
There are also a couple of areas where the report could be more nuanced.
For example, recitals Q and T. Experience shows that, unfortunately, it is quite possible for tourism to flourish alongside undemocratic regimes.
Some of those regimes have proved good at protecting tourism and tourists with very strong-arm police tactics. However, they have at the same time been oppressing their own people, which is why I have reservations about paragraphs 24 and 25.
We in the Socialist Group strongly support moves to develop tourism, particularly eco-tourism, sustainable tourism, and we welcome what the Commissioner said.
We want the private sector to invest in tourism, but to do so responsibly, to develop tourism projects that contribute to the local economy and help micro-businesses to grow, so that local people benefit and local produce is consumed.
In too many areas including, for example, all-inclusive packages and cruise tours, tourism takes out of local economies, but often does not put much back in.
In some cases â and here I disagree with Mr Cornillet â it can damage the environment, using scarce resources too much.
We need to look more carefully at the kind of tourism projects we want to invest in.
Could the EU and the Commission do more?
I am sure they could, and we have heard some examples of what might be proposed.
Do we need a new DG to do that?
I am not so sure.
I am not sure that if we had a DG Tourism it would in any case do much for the developing world.
I very much welcome the section on sex tourism.
It is extremely important that we do a lot more to tackle this criminal activity, so thanks again to Mr Cornillet for his report.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report by Mr Cornillet contains a plethora of valuable suggestions and justified demands.
Most of the recitals are illuminating and critically enumerate a large number of problems, including child labour, the sexual exploitation of children and speculation in property.
The Verts/ALE Group is glad to see this subject being discussed in this House at all and consideration being given to such aspects as the investment of profits from tourism in the developing country in question, the avoidance of mass tourism, the promotion of human rights and the maintenance of bio-diversity.
We find it regrettable â and it is on this point that I largely agree with Mrs McAvan â that this document shows Europeans largely adopting an arrogant attitude towards third countries and regarding themselves as the measure of all things.
We believe that the report attaches far too little weight, in this area, to the protection of the environment and to the need for a truly sustainable economy.
Discussion of the ecological and social consequences of mass tourism, such as water pollution, the alienation of the local population, or exploitation on the part of multinational hotel chains is absent or too diffuse.
As a first attempt, this report is important, but there are many things that it considers only half-heartedly or too vaguely.
We hope that the Commission will go into the matters it has highlighted in greater depth, and that greater emphasis will be placed on international solidarity as a means of promoting peace.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we have to debate and vote on today is one that takes a wide-ranging approach to issues associated with the development of tourism, especially in developing countries.
For that the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, deserves our thanks.
For many of the poorest countries in the world, tourism does of course represent an important potential source of income, and that is why it is to the credit of both the rapporteur and the Committee on Development that, in considering the use of tourism in association with projects to combat poverty, they do not lose sight of the millennium development goals.
That is something I regard as very important.
What prompts my fundamental criticism, though, is the way in which the report gives the impression that the EU is, as an outsider, announcing to the developing countries what they may and may not do.
That I regard as improper.
I do not think it right that the EU should interfere in the way the developing countries manage their visa policies.
I do not think it legitimate that developing countries should be called on to submit reports to whomsoever, irrespective of what is then done with those reports.
Nor, in my view, is a report of this kind the right place for the EU to demand the creation of special police units.
There is no mistaking the EUâs assumption, expressed yet again in this report, that tourism will help to resolve all the worldâs remaining problems.
It is because that is something I regard as highly dubious that I welcome the tabling of the amendment calling for the deletion of recital Q, according to which tourism is the enemy of totalitarianism, dictators and over-centralised power.
That is wishful thinking that bears no relation to reality.
Like Mr Kusstatscher, though, I do find it regrettable that this report scarcely mentions the real ecological problems associated with mass tourism, at any rate not to such an extent as would make it possible to resolve them.
The amendments adopted in the Development Committee mean that the report does now contain wordings advocating that, but they go against the fundamental tendency of the report as a whole.
My Group will not therefore be able to endorse this report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the emphatic ânoâ delivered by the French and the Dutch to the EU Constitution demonstrated that broad swathes of the people we represent want to see less extensive, rather than broader, EU cooperation.
The report proposes, among other things, that an independent Directorate General for Tourism should be set up within the Commission. That means more power for the EU, something to which the June List is opposed.
It is true that a well-organised tourist sector has a lot of potential for helping improve the situation of people in many developing countries.
The EU should not, however, conduct a common policy on tourism, as proposed in the report.
We believe that the EU should only work on genuinely cross-border issues where it can add something of unique value not offered by already existing international organisations.
This means that the EU should not devote itself to development policy and policy on tourism.
ParagraphÂ 10 calls on developing countries to introduce non-restrictive visa policies.
That is a completely absurd proposal.
Developing countries must of course decide for themselves what visa policies they wish to operate.
Otherwise, developing countries should demand that the EU too introduce a non-restrictive visa policy.
ParagraphÂ 24 advocates that criminal activity in developing countries be combated in such a way as not to damage those countriesâ image as tourist destinations.
Should the EU dictate to other countries how criminal activity should be combated?
ParagraphÂ 25 calls for tourism to be promoted, protected and secured through initiatives to tackle crime directed against tourism, with such initiatives to include the setting up of specially trained police units.
Again, this is not a task for the EU.
We are critical of the fact that paragraphÂ 30 refers to the EU Constitution, which has already been rejected by the French and the Dutch.
We advocate an EU with limited influence and shall accordingly vote against this report.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cornillet report undoubtedly contains many valid points, when it, for example, explores the seamy side of certain forms of tourism, such as the sexual exploitation of children in certain tourist destinations or property exploitation that affects the indigenous â and often less well-off â population.
There is, however, one important point missing from this report in my view, namely a clear position on tourism to countries where human rights are grossly violated and where it would be useful if the European Union were to consider introducing an embargo in order to exert more pressure on the countries concerned.
An example of this was given a few months ago by MrÂ Deva, who remarked that, in the Seychelles, the paradise islands, tourists pay 300 dollars a night and more for a hotel room, while the local people have to slave for the local potentate and his court of cronies for a few dollars a day.
The Communist dictatorship of Cuba also springs to mind; this report makes cautious reference to it, but it is a place where opponents disappear behind bars for months and years without any form of trial, while the regime of an old and senile man guilty of crimes against humanity feeds on the currency of debauched western Europeans.
These too are sad side effects of tourism that deserve our attention.
Â Â  MrÂ President, tourism is a major source of income for many developing countries and it has a significant impact on the transformation of their economies.
Clearly, aid in this area should be one of the priorities of the support provided by the European Union.
At the same time, however, we need to be aware of certain threats to which tourists are exposed and of threats related to the flow of tourists affecting the 25 Member States of the Union.
Issues concerning the way in which the tourist sector might support totalitarian regimes must feature prominently in any debate on tourism and development.
I note with concern that there is no reference to the drugs trade in the text.
Nonetheless, it is the case that pleasure-seeking travellers to developing countries frequently resort to drugs.
This leads to a boom in trade in all types of drugs on the territory of the country concerned.
It is important not to overlook the threats posed to tourists by terrorists, whose activities are often directed against the former.
Events in Egypt, where Islamic terrorists tend to target tourists, are a case in point.
Potential epidemics represent another negative influence on the development of tourism, because travellers are deterred from visiting the country in question.
We should therefore assure financial support to childrenâs immunisation programmes providing antigens to diphtheria, tetanus and other infectious diseases.
A new disease representing a direct threat to European countries has recently emerged.
I refer to avian influenza, which is also acting as a strong deterrent against travel to areas affected by this disease.
Failure to react to this threat will be to nobodyâs advantage.
Sex tourism must not be overlooked either.
It claims numerous child victims, and a determined and unequivocal attack on this practice and all the types of criminality associated with it is needed.
I therefore propose providing logistical support to countries facing problems of this kind.
Victims of sex tourism need to be rehabilitated, but it is important not to deal only with the consequences, but also to ensure tourists are fully aware of the treatment that will be meted out to them if they commit offences of this kind.
Offenders must be dealt with with the utmost severity.
Tourism serves as a source of income to totalitarian regimes.
This is an important issue, but it is rarely mentioned.
For the governments of several Member States of the European Union, the issue of maintaining diplomatic relations with the Cuban regime is a sensitive one, because it is so often linked to the tourist sector.
On the one hand we realise how much such a poor country can be helped by supporting the tourist sector, but on the other we are aware that all the proceeds end up in the hands of a small exclusive group closely linked to Fidel Castroâs regime.
I regret the lack of a clear and convincing approach to such situations in the document under discussion.
Â Â  Mr President, my thanks and congratulations go to the rapporteur.
It is very important that we acknowledge that tourism is a major industry in many developing countries.
Many developing countries such as poorer countries, and LDCs such as Mozambique and others, see it as a sector which needs to be developed further.
Therefore, it is appropriate to ask the Commission to look at ways that we can do that, certainly with ACP countries, under the provisions already existing in the Cotonu agreement.
For some developing countries, tourism accounts for something like 50% of GDP, so we should be aware of that.
We can be positive; it leads to the development of infrastructure, it can help to reduce the isolation of rural communities and it offers new opportunities for vegetable growers and others in developing countries.
However, there are downsides, which all of us here would acknowledge.
We need to have a proper regulatory framework that ensures that there are no corrupt practices and that there is no property speculation or environmental damage, and it should not be beyond the wit of us as donors to ensure that host countries do not suffer in any way from the development of tourism.
What I see and hear from the Commission is that there does not seem to be very much understanding of how we can actually integrate tourism into the broader development strategies we have; that ought to be positive and something that can be thought about.
There need to be well publicised penalties, as my colleague has said, for people who are involved in sex tourism because so many people, especially children, are drawn into prostitution and drugs.
The European Union has a role to play here, and we have a role in pressing the industry â nobody here has spoken about the responsibility of the tourist industries in our own countries to ensure that their practices do not damage the countries where they are.
We need to be sure that we are pressing the need for workers' rights â on low wages, on long hours and on the lack of secure contracts.
This is the kind of thing that could be monitored through our ACP relationship with 78 countries.
Â Â  Mr President, I echo the comments of my group colleague, Mr Kusstatscher, concerning the many positive aspects of this report, which does a decent job of highlighting the paradox that exists in the developing world when it comes to tourism.
In developing this issue, however, the Commission should bear in mind the principles of yesterday's sustainable tourism debate.
The sustainable tourism report was excellent.
I would hope that the Commission would view that debate and this one as two sides of the same coin, when looking to come up with a strategy in this area.
I quite agree with the rapporteur that tourism can be a powerful force for good in countries in the developing world.
However, I remember well, when I was working in India for six months, how very often the impact of tourism on local communities was negative.
I suggest that one of the most useful things that we and the Commission can do to take this forward is to focus on sustainability and perhaps even the production of a code of best practice that companies can aspire to.
We can be positive in this field.
I look forward to seeing how the Commission will take it forward.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
As the Cornillet report has rightly shown, tourism has provided developing countries with an important opportunity for sustainable growth.
They must, however, make use of this resource with respect for the local peoplesâ cultures, individualities, socioeconomic situations and traditions.
I want to mention two serious kinds of illegal activities that unfortunately often go hand in hand with tourism in those areas.
First of all there is sex tourism, considered the third largest form of illegal trade in the world, which often involves minors and is a shameful but expanding business.
Another kind of illegal activity is property speculation, which has involved â and generally spoilt â areas of environmental value and cultural heritage, with the tacit agreement and often even the approval of run-down local authorities.
A strong, vigorous initiative is needed from the Community institutions as soon as possible, focusing particularly on funding and legislation to combat these two illicit practices, which are carried on above all by Europeans.
Â Â  Mr President, I will keep my speech to two minutes.
Tourism today is an undisputed promoter of development, and it is also a key part of our development policy.
It boosts employment, standards of living, health, and the infrastructure of many developing countries.
I wish to raise three points.
The first is that we need cross-border cooperation between the EU and the developing countries, between the countries of Africa and the developing countries, and cooperation too within the countries themselves.
This requires cooperation between the public and the private sector.
The second point is that, in my opinion, we need rules based on sustainable development.
We have to pay attention, as many have already done in their speeches earlier on, to the matter of combating and weeding out child sex tourism.
I think we would do well to earmark financial assistance for this.
It is very much a matter of enlightening peopleâs attitudes both in the West and elsewhere.
My third and last point is that we should invest in loans of cerebral capital, by which I mean people are sent from Europe to the developing countries to help promote economic growth, although in such a way that always takes account of the countryâs own standpoint, the countryâs special features, and the countryâs culture.
I spoke for two minutes.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, previous speakers have already pointed out that tourism is both the worldâs foremost economic activity and a sector that is developing very dynamically, both in developed and naturally also in developing countries.
In economic terms, tourism is of crucial importance for a variety of industries.
It lends impetus to the construction of infrastructure such as hotels, restaurants, airports and roads, as well as acting as a driving force behind improvements to educational systems, the growth of the construction and banking sectors and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.
There can therefore be no question that the economic significance of tourism should be viewed in a positive light.
Moving on to the political significance of tourism, a number of Members have already drawn attention to the fact that tourism can in many instances promote respect for human rights, civil liberties and democracy, as well as increasing political stability.
I would furthermore point out that, at best, tourism can also encourage the mutual recognition of cultures, which is of enormous importance in this era of globalisation and diverse global risks.
At the same time, however, it is quite clear that tourism also poses certain risks.
As far as the economy is concerned, these risks relate to over-dependence on tourism, which is a problem that previous speakers have already mentioned.
Reference has also been made to environmental risks, for example the threat posed to sources of drinking and industrial water, which in many countries have been exhausted.
A further unresolved problem relates to the treatment of waste, by which I mean both solid and liquid waste.
It goes without saying that tourism also poses risks to society, for example the eradication of local cultures, prostitution and child prostitution, as mentioned by previous speakers, and, in a number of countries, the rise of various forms of intolerance, such as religious intolerance, various forms of xenophobia, racism and frequently also extremism.
I for my part am delighted that this report has been tabled, since it emphasises the opportunities offered by tourism, at the same time as highlighting the many risks it poses.
Despite my reservations, I will vote in favour of it, although I too do not believe that a directorate-general should be set up for tourism.
Â Â  Mr President, tourism in any region should be a positive contributor to economic growth and stability.
Obviously, tourism and terrorism do not mix and as an area meant to be emerging for good from the dark shadow of terrorism, we in Northern Ireland are beginning, I am glad to say, to see a steady gain from increased tourism.
I greatly welcome that, but one has to recognise that, without real governmental commitment, the full potential can never be achieved.
Tourism must plan well. It must build on opportunities.
The Olympic Games coming to London in 2012 is such an opportunity for my region.
I call not just for the Games but for the tourism spin-off to be managed and organised in such a way that every region of the UK will benefit.
2012 also presents particular opportunities for Belfast as it is the centenary of the Titanic â I might add that we had a âtitanicâ victory last night on the football field over England!
A world-class Titanic exhibition centre is planned for the very site where that famous ship was built.
I trust neither national government nor Commission will be found wanting in financially contributing to the great success that venture can be.
Â Â  Mr President, that tourism can have many side-effects is not a matter of dispute.
Being from the Tyrol myself, I know what I am talking about, for the Tyrol is now one of the world regions most visited by tourists.
Tourism is the fastest-growing area of the economy and is already providing millions of people with jobs.
Although it has the potential to stabilise incomes and economic conditions in developing countries, it is important that we create the legal framework that is needed if they are to be rid of the perils and risks that follow in tourismâs wake.
What is most important is that we should put the development of tourism in each tourist destination on foundations that will be secure in the long term.
As is stated in paragraph 35 of the motion for a resolution, which makes reference to the WTOâs code of ethics, we have to protect our hosts, and that means that tourists must treat their hosts as such, with respect, rather than behaving in such a way as to wreck structures that have evolved over time.
Such aberrations as sex tourism deserve the most forthright condemnation, and, above all else, punishment at the hands of the law.
We should maintain the European programmes that support financially the fight against these pernicious activities.
Secondly, we have to protect nature in the places abroad that tourists visit, and not just by preventing the speculation in property to which paragraph 40 of the report refers.
It is by our own habits of life that we destroy the natural resources of these countries.
Let us bear in mind that we use far more water and energy than they do, and our lifestyles are of course exported by the way we act when we are there.
There is also a dramatic increase in the amount of waste, which can result in the destruction of natural areas and to over-exploitation.
This is where we have to start from the very outset with concepts of what sustainable tourism is and build on them.
It is only if these conditions are in place that the beneficial effects of foreign travel can be felt to the full, by creating jobs and bringing prosperity, fostering economic development and, above all, stimulating population growth and the life of society.
It can promote understanding between peoples, something that we need in a world that is, alas, becoming less and less secure.
In any case, the report gets a warm welcome from me.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to agree on the importance of tourism as an economic factor and a factor for sustainable development.
I have some doubts, however, about the Cornillet report, in which a number of redundant and naÃ¯ve statements stand out.
In recital S, for instance, the emphasis given by âand its defendersâ seems, quite frankly, worth changing; and in recital AG there are some rather meaningless points: it proposes that sex tourism should be combated by the authorities, in coordination with NGOs, and also the proposal of promoting tourism initiatives controlled by the Union seems impracticable.
Lastly, for the sake of propriety, in paragraph 30 one cannot âwelcomeâ the new legal basis concerning tourism established in the European Constitution, since the Constitution is now worthless, dead and buried by the outcome of the referenda and also, for example, by the Blair Governmentâs fear of holding any more polls in the near future.
Finally, development and tourism do not require increased spending.
I am against strengthening the existing services or creating new ones in the directorates-general of the European Commission, as proposed by the rapporteur.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been very interested to hear the opinions and comments expressed in relation to this report.
I will say first of all that, in general terms, I agree with the fundamental elements of the report, except perhaps for certain points raised during the debates, which I can agree with.
Tourism may be a significant driving force for the development of a poor country.
Having said that, however, we must also consider the social effects, the environmental effects and, I would even say, the effects on cultural heritage.
In fact, even here in Europe, large numbers of visitors to certain places lead to wear and tear and measures have to be taken to deal with it.
I therefore believe that we must always bear in mind the need to protect countriesâ cultural heritage.
To the effects that I have already mentioned, I would also add the speculative effects and the economic effects.
Having said that, I believe that we must respect a fundamental principle, and that is that it falls first and foremost to the partner States to decide whether to treat tourism as a priority economic sector.
It is not our job to decide for them.
On this basis, what seems to me to be important at Commission level â and I shall offer a very firm commitment in this regard, MrsÂ Kinnock â is that, as well as contributing to the creation of tourist infrastructures by means of development projects, it could provide governments with useful know-how in terms of assessing the positive and negative effects of investments in the tourism sector and the use of the various instruments available in order to prevent the least desirable consequences.
I believe that there is a lot of study to be done in this regard but I agree with you, MrsÂ Kinnock, that, for our part, we have not given this issue sufficient consideration.
I therefore promise that we will work on this issue because I believe that we can provide the countries in question with the necessary know-how to ensure that investments in tourism conform to a whole series of criteria relating to best practices.
In this connection, I would like to digress slightly.
I am currently working on an idea which would be a kind of ethical label intended for private companies that receive and manage the funds that the Commission grants them within the framework of cooperation.
I shall soon have the opportunity to hold an exchange of views and to consult Parliament on this issue.
We will be able to create a link between that label and the reflection that I was talking about.
Finally, I shall say a word about sex tourism.
It is proposed to restore the budget line dedicated to the fight against sex tourism in order to guarantee the effective allocation of resources for that action.
The reform of budget lines proposed by the Commission within the framework of the financial perspectives 2007-2013 is aimed at establishing a more efficient and rational framework for the creation and management of these lines, to put an end to the pointless fragmentation and to improve the establishment of priorities within the lines.
The European Parliament and civil society will be fully consulted with regard to the implementation of this reform.
That is a promise.
Such an important issue as combating sex tourism will certainly find its rightful place within the context of 'Human and social development', together with other issues such as the fight against AIDS, gender equality, training problems or social cohesion.
Be that as it may, you may rest assured that we shall apply every possible attention and determination to trying to put in place an arsenal of support instruments aimed at developing countries that want to invest in tourism.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0215/2005) by MrÂ Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on major and neglected diseases in developing countries [2005/2047(INI)].
Â Â  . Mr President, my reports always start with a quotation.
On this occasion it is: If that is difficult for the interpreters, that is the oldest language â or one of them â of Europe.
It is Ovid, and it translates as 'Stop it at the start; it is late for medicine to be prepared when disease has grown strong through long delays'.
That is my theme.
In 2005, we have seen many health threats, and a new health threat on our agenda as Marburg has emerged in Angola with a mortality rate of over 90%.
Europe responded swiftly, supporting providing not just the powerful antibiotics and the intravenous fluids, but water purification systems and disposable, protective gear.
That is just one example of the need for vigilance, prevention and rapid response, just one reason why we must never 'cherry-pick' in our battle against disease.
We must continue to tackle the big three of AIDS, TB and malaria, but just as many â or even more â people die, become chronically ill or live with disabilities caused by diseases that the world neglects.
It is time to end that poverty of fatalism; it is time to bring neglected diseases in from the cold and to bring real hope to those who live with and, too often, die from these diseases.
Ten per cent of the world's biomedical research funds are dedicated to addressing the problems that are responsible for 90% of the world's burden of disease; that is the imbalance.
At the end of 2004, for all neglected diseases, we had just 18 R[amp]D projects in clinical development and a further 42 on the way.
While, for other diseases, we had 2Â 100 projects in clinical development.
Less than 1% of the 1Â 393 new drugs placed on the market between 1975 and 1999 were for infectious tropical diseases.
Every year, 1.5 million children under five die from vaccine-preventable diseases.
Patients suffering from sleeping sickness, leish-maniasis, dengue, trachoma and many others are given, too often, archaic drugs, some highly toxic, some ineffective.
Some diseases are neglected because they are rare in western countries, so no market has emerged to develop such drugs.
Some are neglected because western drugs are not made available or affordable.
In my case, I live with diabetes.
I have access to western medicine, treatment and care.
When we were in Mali for the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I went to visit the local diabetes support clinics.
There were two â only in Bamako â and they could not afford the drugs or the insulin, so the result was amputations and blindness, liver disease and early deaths.
My call is for more research for neglected diseases and more support for care projects in developing countries.
Clinical research is slow and patchy.
There is plenty of basic research and knowledge about parasites and genomes, but there needs to be more bridging research to translate basic research into tested and safe drugs and clinical applications.
I support very much the DNDi call for more research in this area, and I hope colleagues will sign up to its campaign.
The call is also for more help â both available and affordable â for diseases which affect the developed world, like diabetes, epilepsy, depression and schizophrenia.
Fifty-two million people are afflicted with epilepsy in our world; 80% of them are not treated; 70% could live seizure-free lives with comparatively cheap five-euros-a-day anti-epileptic drugs.
The story goes on.
I very much welcome what the Commission has brought forward on HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB.
Its communication and then the programme for action are very welcome.
We know that there were more new infections with AIDS in 2004 than in any previous year.
We know that anti-retroviral prices are an increasingly serious public health hazard â that is a statement by the WHO.
We know that malaria is giving real opportunity with the new drugs made from the plant , and we need to accelerate the production and distribution of that as well as of insecticide-protected nets.
With TB we need to recognise the link to AIDS â the multi-drug resistance versions which kill two million a year.
I urge the Commission to carry on its good work on TB, AIDS and malaria and to renew its efforts in the neglected diseases, because they are also killing and debilitating people across the developing world.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate MrÂ Bowis on his report.
He has identified some of the essential points on which the Commission will focus its action over the coming years with the assistance of Parliament and the Member States.
The European Commission supports the improvement of results in the field of health by means of projects, sectoral budgetary support and general budgetary support relating to results in the field of health.
The Commission will also continue to support research and development with a view to preventing, treating and curing diseases, including the so-called neglected diseases.
The action programme to speed up the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in external actions, proposes supplementary actions for combating these three major diseases of poverty.
The programme proposes a series of coherent and concrete actions that are often jointly managed by the European Commission and the Member States, to be undertaken both in the partner countries and at world level, with a view to strengthening the fight against these diseases and to contribute to achieving the Millennium development objectives.
Our actions must contribute to increasing the credibility of the policy of prevention, of access for treatment and of investments in the development of new vaccines and other tools and interventions for prevention or treatment.
Within this context, Europe will enhance its political dialogue with its partners, with a view to helping them to confront the enormous challenges facing them by means of ambitious strategies and active participation by civil society and the private sector.
Europe will contribute to strengthening the capacities of these countries in key fields, in particular regulation in the field of the evaluation and licensing of pharmaceutical products, as well as research.
I would also like to inform you of other initiatives that I have already taken and which are closely linked to the action programme.
The first initiative relates to the human resources crisis in the health sector in the developing countries.
As you know, this problem is critical in the countries that are trying to enhance their actions within the framework of the fight against the three diseases.
I shall therefore present the College with a communication indicating the means for strengthening this fight, in cooperation with the Member States of the European Union and the African Union.
I am also going to launch a new initiative aimed at guaranteeing the availability of new medicines.
This requires additional support from the World Health Organisation.
It will also require new measures at European level, with a view to encouragingÂ âÂ as you have said very wellÂ âÂ the private sector to invest in research and development of new medicines more specifically geared towards the curing of diseases suffered by certain countries that are clearly currently of little economic interest to the sector.
I have tried to give you a clearer idea of how the Commission intends to implement the action programme, through cooperation with the Member States of the European Union, the programming of resources and the launching of specific initiatives.
I very much hope to hold a dialogue with you on these issues.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have always dreamed of being the last speaker before the vote: that is a guarantee for having a lot of people in attendance, although no one really listens.
I wish to make three very brief points.
The first is that my Group and I support Mr Bowis' report, which is excellent.
Development policy is often seen as some kind of post-colonial deal that eases our conscience.
This time it is not: it is about people and preventing epidemic diseases spreading around the world.
These are issues that touch all of us and my Group therefore supports it.
My second observation is that this field needs more research.
We know very little about epidemic diseases and how they spread.
Extensive work is being done, but more money needs to be invested and the Commission, and indeed the European Union, could be the right source.
My final point is that we need more money.
It is absolutely clear, as also pointed out in Mr Bowis' report, that funding is the main priority.
For example, between the years 1975 and 1999, less than 1% of new medicines was for the treatment of tropical and epidemic diseases.
We really need to do some work.
What we basically need is more money and research, but my Group fully supports the report on the table.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  â I should like to propose an amendment, whereby the phrase âand creating a joint border civil protection corpsâ in paragraph 9 of the Resolution be replaced with the phrase âand creating a European civil protection corps taking special account of the vulnerabilities of border zonesâ.
I should also like to point out that there is a small mistake in paragraph 17 of the Portuguese translation.
The English version of paragraph 17 should therefore be taken as authentic.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have an oral amendment.
It is true that the wording of paragraph Q is a little abrupt when it says, âtourism is the enemy of totalitarianism and dictatorshipsâ.
I would therefore like to tone it down so that my fellow Members can accept the amendment, changing it to: âthe development of tourism may be a means for combating totalitarianism and dictatorshipsâ.
â That concludes voting time.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate and thank all the Members who have been involved in the drawing up of this resolution.
This is unfortunately not the first and probably will not be the last.
I hope, however, that it will be followed up.
I personally have voted for it because it contains a paragraph 12 which addresses the Commission and asks it to take full account of the need to fund measures for preventing forest fires.
InÂ 1992, there was a regulation.
This regulation was abolished inÂ 2003 in favour of Forest Focus, which is currently provided with EUR 61Â million for ecological protection programmes and only EUR 9Â million for the fight against fires.
I myself come from a forest region and I must tell you that the foresters regret this situation, since the funding is necessary for the creation of firebreaks, equipment and monitoring and control systems which are very effective in terms of preventing forest fires.
I therefore hope that the Commission will take full account of this resolution and that it will give back the prevention of forest fires and the creation of preventive systems the place they deserve within our budget.
Otherwise we will unfortunately be obliged to admit that our compassion is often short-lived.
Â Â  IÂ consider the joint draft resolution on natural disasters to be an extremely important signal for the European citizens, and IÂ voted to support it.
Its importance is underlined by the fact that climatic extremes are no longer chance events, but aÂ well-defined weather trend.
The influence of global warming on daily weather is obvious.
Achieving the Kyoto targets has become aÂ great challenge for the whole world.
If we do not sharply reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, scientists believe that Europe is yet to feel the force of the weather in the next half century.
The time has come to devise aÂ clear strategy and take measures including financial instruments that will allow us to prevent, avert or at least postpone natural disasters.
The long time it took to release the aid for the Slovak Tatra mountains has shown us that remedying the consequences of natural disasters in the future will require full commitment on the part of Europe, and immediate financial aid from the solidarity fund when aÂ Member State requests it.
Â Â  We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the resolution on natural disasters because we are able to support the overall thrust of the resolution.
We share the view that disasters are largely due to climate change, bringing about extreme weather conditions.
If climate change is to be reversed, the global work on the Kyoto protocol must be continued and stepped up.
We also believe that the EU Member States can join in helping one another cope successfully with the emergencies that arise in the wake of natural disasters.
We think, however, that some of the proposals in the resolution are too detailed and far-reaching.
We are dubious about agricultural aid being used for setting up fire-breaks, and we do not want to see an EU-funded system of agricultural insurance.
Â Â  We welcome international solidarity when countries are hit by natural disasters or other events with devastating consequences.
We do not, however, believe that the EU should use events of this kind to strengthen its influence over different policy areas.
The Commission should not carry out detailed analyses of the causes of forest fires.
The EU should not develop a common policy for preventing forest fires.
No EU bodies should be set up with responsibility for monitoring a variety of climate factors.
It is a pity that the European Parliament should try to take every opportunity to promote the positions adopted by the EU.
Â Â  . We welcome the adoption of this resolution, to which we made a substantial contribution.
We wish to highlight the adoption of the following proposals, which we tabled again in plenary:
- insists on the need to apply the EU Solidarity Fund immediately to areas and countries affected;
- urges the Commission to expedite all the relevant Community administrative procedures, namely those relating to the need to reprogramme the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and to make the overly-rigid processing of these funds more flexible;
- emphasises the need for Community support for the replanting of forests in the affected areas;
We trust that they will come to fruition.
We also regret that our proposals were rejected, which were as follows:
- a public farming insurance scheme, funded by the EU, should be set up in order to guarantee farmers a minimum income in situations of public calamity, such as droughts, fires and floods;
- urges the Council to take into account, in its proposal for the forthcoming financial perspective for 2007-2013, the need to create mechanisms in support of the affected population with a view to the prevention of further large-scale disasters resulting from climate change, aimed at trying to minimise their consequences.
Â Â  . The widespread fires and floods experienced this summer in Europe further emphasise the need to take seriously a global strategy on climate change.
It is appropriate to ensure that the Solidarity Fund rules clearly allow for aid to populations directly affected by natural disasters, and that funds can be released quickly on receipt of Member State requests.
Â Â  . It is a good thing that the European Parliament has at last realised the need for something to be done about natural disasters.
As a matter of urgency, and not least in view of the large-scale fires in southern Europe and the major flooding in central Europe, the EU needs to develop its existing public-sector capacities.
The wholesale failure of the US Administration in the face of the disastrous floods in New Orleans is another reason why it is time to put a stop to the neoliberal compulsion to cut costs and break up institutions one by one that save lives.
We must prevent the merger of civilian and military structures advocated by such spokespersons on EU military policy as Javier Solana, the EUâs representative for foreign and security policy, and the Green MEP Angelika Beer, for this would result not only in the militarisation of civilian structures, but would also expose civilian aid workers to the very considerable risk of being regarded as part of the armed forces and thus â as has happened in Afghanistan â as another party to the conflict.
In order to make more funding available for disaster aid, such EU projects as the Galileo satellite guidance system, which is also capable of being â and is intended to be â used for military purposes, should be stopped.
Not only does Galileo subsidise the aerospace and armaments firm EADS, but the system is also being introduced too late in the day to be a success.
Galileo is also intended to play a crucial role in future European security and defence policy, which is to be oriented towards armed intervention.
Â Â  . The disaster that has once again struck Portugal, which has reduced hundreds of thousands hectares to ashes, left families homeless, destroyed areas of countryside and worst of all taken a number of lives, deserves our concern and our commitment to finding solutions to keep its effects, where possible, to a minimum.
A serious, concerted effort is also required to ensure that this does not happen again.
It is clear that climate change, and the extreme heat that is has brought, is the direct, immediate cause of the scale of the disaster.
Human neglect, however, is a further factor that should not be discounted.
I personally believe that the commitment shown by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the initiative of the MEPs from the Peopleâs Party in Portugal (CDS-PP), will ultimately make a major contribution towards raising awareness among the Community institutions and towards providing resources.
This resolution, which also refers to disasters in other Member States deserving of our solidarity for similar reasons, will help the decision-making process and the implementation of the measures required.
Of these measures, I should like to highlight the urgent need to reinstate aid for creating firebreaks and the call for the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund.
With regard to these two aspects, incidentally, I have no choice but to conclude that the Portuguese Government has been dreadfully negligent.
Â Â  . As a Member of the European Parliament for an area of France, the Massif central, which relies very heavily on the development of tourism, I am happy to have supported the report by LuisÂ Queiro and I too would like to congratulate him on his excellent work.
This vote has been eagerly awaited by tourism professionals.
In fact, tourism is one of the European Unionâs sectors that is experiencing the greatest progress.
It involves more than 2 million companies, the majority of which are SMEs.
I am very satisfied with the amendments calling for the simplification of the special VAT system in relation to the profit margin of travel agents and tour-operators, as well as the preservation of the competitive position of operators established in the European Union compared to third-country operators.
I also hope that the Council will take a decision on reduced VAT rates without any further delay, thereby allowing Member States to apply reduced rates for restaurants, as already exist for other activities relating to tourism.
Restaurateurs have been given many promises and they are now expecting concrete results from us.
Let us not disappoint them!
Finally, it is essential that the European Council and the European Commission should take a global approach in favour of tourism ...
Â Â  Tourism is a very important industry for most EU countries, but it does not belong to the area of Community policy.
Yet this report calls on the Commission to adopt a series of measures in the sphere of tourism.
The report also proposes that a special post be set up in the EU budget for tourism-related measures.
We believe that tourism is an example of something that the Member States should deal with themselves and not an area in which the EU should interfere.
We have therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  The Moderates have voted against the report on tourism and accordingly emphasise that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, tourism is the Member Statesâ area of competence.
Because this is not a Community area, the reportâs tendency to view it as such, together with the various steps it proposes, are also things to which we are opposed.
For example, we see no reason for the Commission to prepare a tourist package comprising a survey of current directives on consumer rights within tourism.
Such measures should be developed in the Member States with the parties concerned.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report by Mr QueirÃ³, which, broadly speaking, was worthy of my support and that of my group.


Coming from Madeira as I do, a region in which tourism is one of the main factors in its sustainable growth, it stands to reason that I support the report, and I do primarily for the following reasons: firstly, because of the importance of tourism, at European, national and regional level, and its contribution towards economic growth, job creation and technological innovation, which in turn represents a contribution towards fulfilling the aims of the Lisbon Strategy; secondly, the development potential that it offers regions with economic difficulties and specific geographical characteristics, such as the outermost regions; thirdly, the contribution made by EU and Community measures â supporting, coordinating and complementing the actions of Member States â towards the development of the tourism sector; fourthly, still in this context, the EUâs incentive to set up the most effective structures and provide the appropriate financial resources; fifthly, the role of tourism in environmental protection, in regional planning and in preserving and revitalising cultural values, traditions, customs and natural and artistic heritage; and lastly, security concerns and the protection of the rights of the tourist as consumer.



Â Â  We are voting against this report.
This is not an issue with which the EU should concern itself.
Paragraph E of the report states that tourism does not at present constitute an area of Community policy but, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, comes within the remit of the Member States.
That is an absolutely correct assessment.
In spite of that, the report contains a host of proposals for a tourism policy at EU level.
- tourist services would be classified at EU level
- a special training network for tourism-related skills would be set up
- bodies representing tourists in their capacity as consumers would be established
- a contact group would be set up with the participation of the Member States and the tourist operators
- a network would be established to enable organisations concerned with high-risk sports and leisure activities to exchange good practice.
We are opposed to all such proposals.
In spite of the fact that the draft Constitution for the EU has been rejected, it is referred to as the basis for tourism being an EU issue.
It is proposed that a special tourism line should be established in the EU budget.
The June summit clearly showed that the Member States do not wish to pay for all sorts of new policy areas.
The reportâs justification, namely that tourism contributes to growth and employment and is therefore central to the Lisbon process, can be applied to just about every area.
We believe that the principle of subsidiarity takes precedence over such ways of thinking.
Â Â  . We welcome the adoption of our proposal, which:
- âpoints out that preserving the cultural heritage (in particular that which is designated world heritage by UNESCO), is of major importance to the sustainable development of tourism in the EUâ, and calls âupon the Commission to make more money available for preserving the cultural heritageâ.
That being said, we regret the rejection, among others, of the following proposals that we tabled, which expressed:
- âconcern at the amount of precarious work in the tourism sector, as a result of contractual arrangements, wage levels, working conditions and seasonal factorsâ, and stated that âin order to improve the quality of the services provided and to promote greater social cohesion, investment must be made in creating high-quality jobs and in helping the workers in the sector to obtain qualifications (vocational training, improved working conditions, promotion of stable contractual arrangements)â;
- and stated âthat the tourism sector makes a major contribution towards economic development, towards employment at regional level and towards territorial cohesionâ and that it is necessary âto support the development of this sector, both on a broad scale, through various Community policies and funds, and specifically, via the creation of a dedicated Community programme aimed at promoting the sector and the synergies between the various economic and social agents involvedâ.
Â Â  . I agree with the broad lines of this report.
Nevertheless, I would raise certain reservations in relation to the fact that its approach to the development of tourism is overly focussed on the protection of the environment and the consumer.
The voice of the consumers and the defenders of the environment is already fully heard within the European institutions: the protection of consumers and of the environment are subject to specific headings in the Treaties and entire directorates-general within the Commission deal respectively with these two areas.
Why, therefore, do we want to over-emphasise these fields?
I personally believe that any tourism policy should principally focus on the economic activity generated by the tourism industry and that a balanced approach to the different areas can only be achieved if the interests of providers of tourist services (hoteliers, restaurateurs, tour-operators, crafts of all kinds, private transport etc.) are fully defended.
The rapporteur is right to state that tourism creates growth, but in order for this to be fully the case, we must allow our national economic actors to be competitive and prevent them from being hindered by regulations and taxation as they exist in particular in France.
Â Â  The Moderates have voted against the own-initiative report on gender discrimination in health systems.
Like many other issues in connection with which there are different solutions and traditions in the different Member States, issues of gender equality and of health care and medical treatment should be dealt with at national level.
The EU should only get involved in such issues in cases where the individual Member States cannot deal with them better themselves.
The above-mentioned report addresses many important aspects of womenâs health and access to health care.
Unlike the rapporteur, MrsÂ Svensson, we believe that many of these aspects are best taken care of by individual Member States, individual hospitals or individual people.
One way of developing and improving health care and medical treatment, without, for example, the EU interfering in national health strategies or the Commission being required to carry out investigations into certain tendencies within health care, is through best practice and the exchange of information between the Member States, hospitals, research institutes and other affected parties, this being a development we should sincerely welcome.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this initiative report, which highlights discrepancies between men and women in terms of prescription, treatments and costs.
Although I oppose human cloning, I believe that there is merit in researching the potential for stem cell treatments for degenerative diseases.
Â Â  . The fact that members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have rejected paragraph 10 of the Svensson report or abstained from voting has to do with differing interpretations of the UN Resolution to which it refers and to the unfortunate fact that it was not possible, in the course of preparatory deliberations, to deal with the differences between versions of the report in different languages.
In my capacity as the PSE Groupâs shadow rapporteur, and in order to prevent misunderstandings, I would therefore like to make this clarificatory statement:
It goes without saying that, if any person in my group rejects paragraph 10 or abstains from voting on it, it does not mean that he or she is in favour of human cloning.
We unreservedly endorse UN Resolution A/59/516/Add 1 (âDeclaration on Human Cloningâ), which states that practices contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning, must not be permitted.
As we do not want to tolerate such things under any circumstances, it is more specifically demanded in the German version that âhuman cloning shall be excluded from support and funding under European Union programmesâ.
This demand is made explicitly in the future tense, as the intention is that such practices should never be permissible in the EU and that it should of course never be possible to fund them surreptitiously.
It is regrettable that versions in many languages â English, French and Swedish among them â give the impression that we are today allowing EU programmes to promote the cloning of humans.
That is self-evidently not the case, and for that reason, we have not agreed to paragraph 10 of the report.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues are supportive of efforts to deal with gender discrimination in health systems across the EU.
Poor access to healthcare and any form of exploitation of women are matters that should be addressed by Member States in public policy development.
It is clearly desirable that Member StatesÂ share informationÂ and best practice on how these problems should be addressed and sections of this report do provide some useful ideas.
However, there a number of suggestions in this report with which we take issue and which have led to our decision on the final vote.
UsingÂ structural funds for preventative medical purposes andÂ demanding specific conditions on employment of medical personnel are issues that are rightly the preserve of Member States.
Â Â  The own-initiative report on gender discrimination in health systems addresses many very important issues affecting womenâs health, especially the fact that it is male physiognomy that is the point of departure in modern medicine, in spite of the fact that there clearly are significant biological differences between the sexes.
That is an unsatisfactory state of affairs to which my party, the Liberal Peopleâs Party, has called attention on several occasions.
Despite the reportâs good intentions in terms of promoting womenâs health within the EU, I am voting against the report.
I choose to do so because I believe that, in too many respects, the report contravenes the principle of subsidiarity.
A good many of the proposals presented infringe the sovereignty of the Member States and also encroach on the right of individuals to take their own decisions affecting their own lives.
It is not for the European Parliament to decide whether women should be entitled to Caesarean sections or whether nursing staff should have shorter working periods and higher salaries.
At the same time, the report is characterised in other areas by its unduly broad-brush approach to wordings.
I am thinking here mainly of the sections on ovarian stimulation and on removing egg cells.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate MrsÂ Svensson on her important report on gender discrimination in health systems, to which I give my full backing.
I particularly wish to highlight the need to ensure that both sexes can enjoy the benefits of treatment, but that they can also provide medical treatment and care on the basis of equal opportunities.
I should also like to point out the need to invest in health research with patientsâ gender taken into account.
I therefore support the initiative to include research into the health situation of the sexes in the new health and consumer protection programme (2007-2013) and take it into account when planning the Seventh Framework Research Programme.
Â Â  . As long ago as 1957, in the Treaties of Rome, the removal of inequalities between men and women was defined as an objective.
A certain amount has been achieved since then, particularly as a result of womenâs health programmes in the 1990s, but much still remains to be done.
For example, the proportion of women working in healthcare may well generally be very high â it is over 78% in Austria â but it is small to the point of insignificance in senior management and other professions that enjoy high status and consequent high earnings.
This runs counter to what has been called the âfeminisation of ageingâ, as men form the majority of the population up to about the age of 45 and women thereafter.
This makes it essential that greater consideration be given to problems specific to women.
The establishment by some Member States of universal screening programmes for the early detection of breast cancer in women between the ages of 50 and 69 was another advance, and there is no doubt about the importance of doing this as the report suggests and urging the others to take the same course of action.
We should, however, be concerned about the fact that it is between the ages of 35 and 55 that breast cancer most frequently proves fatal, and so we must do more to promote awareness of the dangers among this age group and adapt the screening programmes accordingly.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues Conservatives are largely supportive of this report that suggests much needed reform to an outdated system where the EU gives â¬127 million to European Schools.
However, it is essential that a budget ceiling is put in place for the EU's contributions; that Member States hosting the schools give a greater contribution towards the local costs; that there is a realistic contribution from parents of Category III children.
We also urge the Commission to make an appropriate response to the Advisory Board's recommendations to deliver value for money and to protect the interests of the EU taxpayer.
Â Â  It is unacceptable that fees should have risen by 62.2% for 2005/2006 compared with 2002/2003.
That is a scandalous rise, because it is prohibitive for most of the families involved and because it was decided while the 1994 agreement, which covered a 10-year period, was still in force.
Because European Schools provide a public service, such unilateral decisions violating familiesâ established rights should not be allowed.




Whatever compromises may be possible on budgetary matters, we feel we must stand fast on a number of points: 1) European Schools should exist in all Member States; 2) there should be as many language sections as possible, according to the principle of respecting cultural identity; 3) the maximum class size should be reduced from the current 32; 4) it would be worth making a few adjustments to the curricula: art history, for instance, is currently excluded, although it would encourage a greater understanding of the common cultural values that have inspired the peoples of Europe over the centuries; 5) a vocational baccalaureate should be added alongside the current arts- and science-based European baccalaureate: both courses would remain a specific, valid point of reference for providing young people with a European training.
Â Â  The European Schools system is taking on a life of its own with the debate as to whether âthe European Schools system fosters the concept of European citizenshipâ (to quote recital C of the report).
We can understand the need for European Schools designed to provide mother-tongue education to the children of EU officials.
However, the system has come to look odd when, for example, only 1.6% of the pupils at the European School, Culham are children of staff at EU institutions and bodies.
With EU enlargement, the number of official languages has become so large that the whole situation involving European Schools needs to be reviewed.
With EU bodies being placed in decentralised locations, European Schools would now have to be founded in all the Member States.
We believe that a more flexible solution needs to be found when it comes to the education of EU officialsâ children.
The EU institutions and bodies should, as employers, quite simply pay the school fees (up to a certain level) for their staffâs children.
If the parents then choose to send their children to a state or local authority school or to a private independent one, they should sort the matter out locally.
As a rule, there is the opportunity to choose between a local and an international school in those places where the EU institutions and bodies are situated.
The system of European Schools appears to have had its day.
We have therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  . Since 1957, Europe has set up special schools intended to educate the children of the staff of the European Communities together while accepting a very limited number of external pupils.
So what was the thinking behind this policy of exception, applying a principle of corporatist preference, a policy which furthermore is condemned in other fields by this same Europe?
Do as I say and not as I do!
This system of European schools therefore promotes the concept of European citizenship, which is, for Europe, what the concept of national preference should be for France and the other free nations of Europe.
But the development of these schools is intended not to build the Europe of nations to which we aspire, but to promote European integration; a policy which has just been condemned by the French people on 29 May 2005.
These schools are not only discriminatory against non-European civil servants, but against all of the children of Europe.
They also create a system of outrageous privileges intended almost exclusively for civil servants of the European institutions in order to reproduce a single and obligatory European model: a federal Europe by integration.
Â Â  . The European Schools exist to provide an education in their mother tongue for the children of officials of the European Institutions.
Unlike some Members I welcome this.
Children of EU officials deserve a quality education in their mother tongue and the existence of the schools helps the institutions in the recruitment and retention of suitable qualified personnel.
The Rapporteur is right to focus on two issues which the schools have so far failed to address, firstly, access and provision for pupils with special needs which must be improved, secondly, the need to introduce a more vocational curriculum and set of qualifications.
Â Â  .
The European schools are obviously beneficial and valuable and should be viewed as a facility offered to Community employees.
Like any institution, however, it is necessary from time to time to assess the quality and effectiveness of its operations and, reasonably and judiciously, to propose useful and effective reforms that will make a difference.
As this is the main thrust of the report before us, I voted in favour.
There is one aspect raised in the report, however, which I wish to make a point of emphasising, namely the issue of not communitarising the Member Statesâ functions and responsibilities.
Â Â  The motion is worthy of being supported by the European Parliament.
The concept of multilingual and multinational education implemented in these schools could serve as a model for Member Statesâ educational systems.
Nonetheless, the programme has its weaknesses.
There are no standard rules for all such institutions concerning the admission of candidates, overly large classes, and pupils being obliged to attend lessons given in a language other than their mother tongue.
There are no recommendations either concerning the education of children with special needs.
Such shortcomings must be remedied.
