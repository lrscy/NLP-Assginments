At the same time I would like to ask this: will these private sponsors possibly also be imposing conditions on the funding they provide?
Member of the Commission. - I would say it would be boring if there were only United States companies interested in dialogue and cooperation and possible investment.
There are many more, and there are many more also from Europe.
Many of these companies, whether European, US or international, already invest a lot in Europe.
The EIT should create even more incentives and friendly conditions for innovation in Europe.
I would not eliminate interest from outside, but I would encourage the commitment of Parliament, Council and Commission to finding the definite answer and agreeing on the full proposal in order to mobilise European investment in international cooperation.
But all positive constructive signals, both inside and outside, are really welcome.
Commissioner, do I detect from your answer to Mr SeppÃ€nen just now that you actually have indications of major interest from companies wishing to invest in the EIT?
Because, if not, if you do not achieve substantial or sufficient funds from the private sector, will you refrain from attacking the EU budget and will you take it as a lesson that perhaps there is not that much interest in funding the EIT?
But I would like your assurance that perhaps you have these sincere expressions of interest.
Member of the Commission. - We had and we have an increasing interest, especially now we have reached the current stage of the proposal itself, because at the beginning this was more of an idea or a concept and now it is a concrete text.
It has not yet been finalised formally - we hope to do that by the end of this year - but the messages from individual businesses or business organisations have been more and more concrete and positive, in the sense of possibly deeper involvement in the future.
We had talks with the European Round Table of Industrialists, Business Europe, Eurochambers and many other associations, like the European Association of Research and Technology Organisations (EARTO).
I really can say that the messages were more and more concrete.
Of course, nobody writes a blank cheque or makes commitments in advance, and what we do should not replace what is going on in a positive sense in some centres or in partnerships, but the EIT should create still further momentum, incentives and scope for a more innovation-friendly Europe Union.
That is the intention and this is a shared responsibility.
(LT) The idea of the European Institute of Technology is to generate innovations which would contribute to the enhancement of the competitiveness of the European Union.
If large private companies were to participate in the activities of the Institute, would innovations be accessible to other market participants?
What about the Member States?
Should the Member States and the European Community not be the main financing bodies of a European institution?
Member of the Commission. - We have to define the role of the EIT itself, which is the institution for running the competition selection, the evaluation monitoring and organising the framework for a whole range of knowledge and innovation communities.
However, regarding innovation, the core partnership is at the level of KICs.
There, one can imagine considerable cooperation with SMEs, and the internal arrangement is not only their right but also works to their advantage because they must build trust to increase or to start new cooperation under the umbrella of the EIT and for the basic relations around the intellectual property, the proposal refers to the principles of the Seventh Framework Programme.
I am sure that there must be enough freedom and flexibility to arrange intellectual property rights between partners for the benefit of their cooperation and of the relation between KICs, vis-Ã -vis or with the EIT, and also for the benefit of course of further application of innovation.
We have many models in Europe.
I think we can use a lot of inspiration for real encouragement and actually EIT could be a kind of an icebreaker to open better conditions for a knowledge-friendly Europe, including intellectual property friendliness or Community patents or policies which are very much needed and important for a real transfer of knowledge between partners.
Questions 38 and 39 will receive written answers.
Subject: Absolute prohibition of conversion of fixed-term contracts into contracts of indefinite duration in Greek public sector
It is six years since Directive 1999/70/EC entered into force in 2001 and Greece has not yet complied therewith.
Despite final judgments in favour of workers on fixed-term contracts, the Greek Supreme Court has ruled, with reference to the Greek Constitution and setting aside previous case-law, that it is absolutely prohibited to convert fixed-term employment contracts into contracts of indefinite duration in the Greek public sector.
This ruling is totally contrary to the spirit and the letter of Directive 1999/70/EC and to the judgment of the Court of Justice (Case C-212/04), which stresses that Directive 1999/70/EC 'precludes the application of national legislation which, in the public sector alone, prohibits absolutely the conversion into an employment contract of indefinite duration of a succession of fixed-term contracts that, in fact, have been intended to cover 'fixed and permanent needs' of the employer and must therefore be regarded as constituting an abuse.'
What are the Commission's views on the evident refusal of Greece to implement Directive 1999/70/EC?
Will it initiate proceedings against Greece before the Court of Justice?
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Council Directive 1999/70/EC concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work requires the Member States to adopt such measures that would prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts.
However, the Member States are not obliged to replace fixed-term contracts with open-ended contracts assuming that there are other effective measures in place that would prevent or sanction such abuse.
The European Court of Justice confirmed this interpretation in its judgment of 4 July 2006 in Case C-212/04 (Adeneler) pertaining to Greek legislation.
The European Court of Justice also stated that interpretation of the relevant national legislation does not fall within its competence.
It is entirely for the Greek courts to provide an interpretation of relevant Greek legislation and to determine whether this legislation complies with the requirements of the Directive regarding the existence of effective measures that would prevent and sanction abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts.
Greece implemented the above-mentioned Directive through Presidential Decree No 164/2004 concerning the public sector.
The Commission carried out a thorough analysis of this Decree and concluded that it was compatible with the requirements of the Directive.
Since the Directive was implemented at a late stage, on 19 July 2004, the Presidential Decree contained an exceptional temporary provision that makes it possible under certain conditions to change successive fixed-term employment contracts concluded before the date on which the Decree entered into force into employment contracts of indefinite duration.
I am aware that the legal situation concerning the abuse of fixed-term employment contracts in the Greek public sector was a subject of disputes over the last few years.
This was confirmed by the recent judgment of the Greek Supreme Court of 11 June 2007 in which the court annulled its previous case-law.
As already mentioned, according to the judgment of the European Court of Justice, the national courts are responsible for interpreting and applying the relevant Greek legislation, including the Constitution, in relation to the circumstances of particular cases submitted to them.
However, in doing so the courts must duly observe the applicable EU legislation, in particular Directive 1999/70/EC.
The Commission is closely monitoring the development of the situation in Greece.
It will carefully examine the latest ruling of the Supreme Court and will monitor subsequent measures adopted by the Greek authorities.
To conclude I would like to mention that according to the information supplied by the Commission, several Greek courts have already submitted preliminary questions concerning this matter to the European Court of Justice.
The European Court of Justice will thus get the opportunity to deliver an opinion on the interpretation of the relevant Community legislation.
(EL) Commissioner, you are well aware that Greece is the only country that has still failed to implement a directive that has been in force for six years.
Tens of thousands of contractors are cursed with a government that you say ought to respect the decisions of the courts but nonetheless passes laws whereby it refuses to respect the final decisions of the courts and the case-law of the European Court.
Many of those who died in Greece's fires this year in were contracted forest fire-fighters with more than 10 years' service, employed on a temporary basis, and with deficient training.
For months now you have claimed to be studying this question.
As guardians of European legislation, do you intend to do something?
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years after the inclusion of Article 13 in the EC Treaty we have made important progress in making sure that all citizens of the European Union are protected from discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin or sexual orientation, among other things.
However, this protection is not yet complete, nor have we yet the real 'equality' mentioned by the honourable Member.
All the Member States must abide by the so-called Racial Equality Directive and Employment Equality Directive and it is the task of the European Union to monitor the correct transposition of both Directives into national legislation and their effective application.
Consequently, on 27 June 2007 the Commission issued Reasoned Opinions to 14 Member States that have not transposed Directive 2000/43/EC correctly.
I want to state that the factual grounds that gave rise to these reasoned opinions vary of course from country to country as does their gravity.
In any event, 14 states have received these reasoned opinions.
2007 is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and it has given the public authorities and civil society an incentive to organise actions and campaigns focusing on the benefits of diversity and non-discrimination.
The fight against discrimination must constantly be at the forefront of our mind.
In 2008 the Commission will submit proposals for the European Year of Equal Opportunities follow-up programmes: these may contain measures for finalising the framework of anti-discrimination legislation.
An on-line consultation that was launched in July and will last until mid-October forms part of preparations for assessing the corresponding impact.
I would also like to state that the Commission rejects all forms of homophobia and promotes a society based on tolerance and respect.
It welcomed the European Parliament resolution of 26 April 2007 on homophobia in Europe.
In this context the Commission regrets that local authorities did not grant the necessary permissions for the truck promoting diversity in Europe to visit Vilnius on 25 May as had been planned, and banned the accompanying gay parade.
The Commission also regrets that the participants in the march for diversity during the Romanian GayFest 2007 festival on 11 June (which received moral support and used the European Year logo) were intimidated by extremist groups and needed police protection.
The Racial Equality Directive I mentioned earlier prevents discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin.
I would like to stress that this applies in full to the Roma as well.
Furthermore, the Commission is of the opinion that in order to be applied properly, the EU legislation must be complemented by information campaigns that would inform the Roma of their rights, and by events that will inform the general public about the rights and duties resulting from the anti-discrimination law.
In 2007, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, events focusing on the Roma are taking place in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Finland and Slovakia.
Actions aimed at combating discrimination against the Roma are also financed under the auspices of the European Social Fund and PROGRESS 2007-2013, a programme for employment and social solidarity, which supports capacity-building among the Roma.
Although it is regrettable that 14 Member States have had to have reasoned opinions, I am, at least, delighted that the Commission is taking forceful infringement proceedings, because at the moment we have had a complete gap between the letter of the legislation and what is actually happening.
Commissioner Å pidla has mentioned some of the problems relating to the Equality truck denied access to Vilnius.
Apparently, half of Lithuanian MPs think that homosexuality is a perversion.
You have real problems in the public and governmental sector.
Last week, the Fundamental Rights Agency said that many Member States were failing to properly enforce race discrimination legislation, so I hope that toughness goes on because we really need it.
Will you take account in the infringement proceedings of the various pronouncements and the tolerance of extremism by ministers and public officials?
Member of the Commission. - (CS) I do not think that the speech by the honourable Member contained any questions but I would like to endorse the opinion she expressed in any case.
Both of the Directives on non-discrimination are fundamental European laws.
We must ensure that they are fully transposed and we must ensure that non-discrimination, equal opportunities and tolerance continue to be fundamental values that are actively implemented.
That is why the European Commission has initiated infringement proceedings against 14 Member States.
However, I also want to say that in general the individual Member States accept these high values and that the majority of problems we have been debating, problems that necessitate the initiation of infringement proceedings, are of a legislative and therefore a technical/administrative nature.
They do not represent a trend of a Member State rejecting the Treaties.
We now have a series of five questions relating to persons with disabilities.
I understand that the questioners were possibly expecting a block answer.
I would not want to deprive anyone of an individual answer, but if you wish to deal with the questions together, Commissioner, I would be happy for you to do so.
First, however, I should like to take some guidance from one of the questioners before we proceed.
I too would be happy if the Commissioner would answer all the questions together, if that were possible.
But, if not, perhaps you might allow him to read the answers to all five, if he has separate answers, and we will take all of the supplementaries at the end of the five replies.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Since I am going to try to give a very brief reply to all of the questions together, I will concentrate only on the most important issues.
A program focusing on the active integration of disabled people has been developed since 2006 as part of the European Action Plan for people with disabilities.
At the heart of this program is the right of disabled people to independent living.
Since the Commission advocates de-institutionalisation and since the general opinion in this area is similar, the Commission is also examining alternatives to care provided in sheltered institutions.
The Commission supports research into suitable methods for so-called de-institutionalisation.
Independent living for disabled people must be supported by the provision of quality community services to these people; not only of a physical nature but also respect for human dignity.
Drawing on my own personal experience I can say that educating the people who provide these services to persons dependent on them is very important for the quality of the social services.
The way in which the basic rights of disabled people are observed and the quality of their lives depend to a large degree on education.
As I have already mentioned, the Commission is using its right to actively support the development of community services and I want to say that in this process the Commission always concentrates on the quality of life of individuals.
Indeed, de-institutionalisation itself does not automatically guarantee an improved quality of life and autonomy: they are only guaranteed when de-institutionalisation is replaced by community services of a corresponding quality and standard.
In this context, the Commission has requested a study on social integration, the purpose of which is to assess the situation of disabled people in large sheltered institutions where, as you know, there are many instances where the standards and way of life are not up to the standards and quality the people undoubtedly deserve.
We must therefore monitor this situation to ensure that it is improved.
However, the Commission cannot confirm the opinion that the number of people in sheltered institutions is on the increase.
We do not have the figures at our disposal but, as I have already said, de-institutionalisation is the principle we follow and we will continue to follow that path.
I would also like to stress that we welcome initiatives that concentrate on the basic principles of the quality of provision of social care at a European level.
I would stress, too, that the fact that the issue of the rights of disabled people has been elevated to an international level thanks to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is, in my opinion, a huge step forward.
The Commission encourages the Member States to ratify this Convention and to give a concrete response to it as quickly as possible.
The Commission has pledged to take account of the needs and rights of disabled persons and to include them in all relevant EU strategies.
The issue of providing for the needs of disabled people is dealt with, at EU level, by the Commission's Inter-Service Group on Disability, as well as through cooperation with the Member States and parties concerned, including disabled persons, in the High Level Group on Disability in the European Union.
Since 2000 the European Community has co-financed approximately 160 projects for disabled persons in developing countries amounting to EUR 100 million.
These projects provide support for Eastern Europe, the Middle East and ACP countries and concentrate on people with mental and physical disabilities, capacity-building, community rehabilitation, the rights of disabled people, social inclusion, poverty reduction, de-institutionalisation, etc.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the Commission implements active policies for disabled people and that we have achieved significant progress within the European Union.
However, as I said when answering a previous question, we still have a long way to go.
We have been working on the basic process of possible amendments to the existing European legislation.
This is what I was talking about when replying to the question about the Directives on non-discrimination.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have tried briefly to touch on the most important issues and due to the rather improvised nature of this debate I may well have neglected some issues while there are others that I might not have explained quite clearly.
Therefore, I would suggest - if this is acceptable - that I now listen to your supplementary questions and respond to them.
However, I will respond again in writing to the questions that I have now answered orally so that they receive the attention they deserve.
Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his flexibility.
A number of us who are active in the Disability Intergroup of Parliament have chosen to table these questions to mark the presence in Strasbourg of some 200 people with severe and multiple disabilities, who are living in institutions throughout Europe and are part of what is called the European Network on Independent Living.
I know they will be very proud that this Parliament is addressing their concerns and needs in this Question Time.
I wonder if the Commissioner could join me and if you, Madam President, could join me in welcoming their representatives to the Chamber.
I wonder if, Commissioner, you could confirm that the European Network on Independent Living, as a user-led organisation run for and by disabled people, represents a very important interest group for disabled people in Europe and that you would join me in hoping that they could benefit from the support for coordination of disability organisations Europe-wide currently benefiting organisations such as the European Blind Union and the European Union of the Deaf in the future.
Secondly and finally, Commissioner, you said some very good words, which I thank you for, about independent living and community care for disabled people.
The point in my question about a European strategy for personal assistance, enabling professional workers who are managed by and employed by disabled people to meet their care needs, is a very important objective of this freedom ride of the European Network on Independent Living, and I hope you will commit yourself to advancing their cause in this respect.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of disabled groups: conducting a dialogue with those who should sit around the table, with those who have direct vested interests, is something at the very heart of practically all European strategies.
I cannot imagine us developing any strategy, any plan without such a dialogue.
This dialogue is comprehensive and valuable but I think that we should search for yet more effective methods and solutions.
The Commission intends to contribute to progress in this matter by coordinating the mutual exchange of opinions and other actions supporting the exchange of information.
It will also provide an emphatic reminder of the need to develop important paths for the preparation of new strategies, jointly approved by the Member States, to be submitted in the autumn of 2008.
In other words, we have a lot of work to do together.
(EL) Commissioner, contrary to the right of all European citizens, a significant number of disabled people are forced to live in institutions, regardless of their choice.
Since the active integration of the disabled into economic and social life depends on their ability to live independently, I should like to ask whether the European Commission intends to adopt legislative measures to guarantee this right.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am of the opinion that the current European legislation is of a high quality compared with the rest of the world.
The adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is extremely important too.
It is also clear that de-institutionalisation forms a part of all European strategies in this field, including those that are funded by our financial instruments.
This transition is possible.
There are countries that have done away with institutional care completely, to the benefit of disabled persons - there may be only a few of them but they do exist - and these prove that this goal can be achieved.
On the other hand, it is a goal that has to be achieved gradually and in a very organic way because, as I have already said, de-institutionalisation that lacks corresponding safety provisions may conversely worsen the position of disabled people, as has been demonstrated in many countries around the world.
I am thinking in particular of cases of de-institutionalisation in the United States where this route, in the absence of corresponding safety provisions, has proved to be very controversial.
Madam President, it is true that progress has been made but it has to be said that progress is painfully slow.
Indeed, a lot of the progress would not have been made without the campaigning that has been undertaken by people with disabilities themselves.
What I want to ask you specifically, Commissioner, with regard to the study you mentioned on integration into society: does this study deal with the issue of independent living?
Of course, it is extremely important that quality community services are put in place in order to ensure that people can be taken out of institutions.
However, these community care services need to be directed towards enabling people with disabilities to lead independent lives, which is a crucial demand for people with disabilities.
Linked to that, as a European Union, we need to look at how, for instance, the right to personal assistance could be made available to people wherever they move to within the European Union.
Could I ask if that aspect of independent living is being addressed by the study and, if not, would you undertake that a study of the availability of personal assistance and the generalisation of such a scheme across the European Union could be addressed, and indeed the portability of it?
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I think that have you touched on very serious issues that are generally linked to the issue of disability.
Firstly, I would like to say that unfortunately at present we do not have as yet at our disposal comparable data that provides a good basis for a reliable European strategy.
Acquiring data that can be interpreted as such is one of the Commission's goals.
We also have to realise that the debate you started and the issue you mentioned are very closely connected to the debate on services, on generally beneficial social services.
Again, this is a related topic.
I would also like to stress that a Directive concerning air traffic and the mobility of workers or mobility of people within the European Union has been implemented, and that of course there are plans to extend these regulations to other types of transport, which is logical.
There is also the issue of the transferability and accessibility of social services or various social measures for disabled people.
This issue is dealt with within the framework of implementation of Regulation 1408/71/EEC on the coordination of social security schemes and in the Directive on the portability of supplementary pension rights.
The aim of all of these tools is fundamentally to reinforce the values of, and opportunities for, an independent life, with a corresponding degree of safety, anywhere in the European Union.
I can be brief because many of my questions have been asked.
Some EU Member States will be proactive in acknowledging the rights of their citizens with disabilities.
Some, unfortunately, resist improvement of standards and even create or tolerate obstacles.
We have strategies and action plans, which are well and good, but only an enforceable disability directive has a chance of bringing errant states - like the one I live in - into line.
When can we expect this directive, Commissioner?
Could you confirm that you will be giving written answers to the five questions?
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, in my first reply dealing with the Directives on non-discrimination I mentioned a study drafted within the framework of a process for the assessment of implementation and effectiveness, which examines whether and how it would be suitable to amend the relevant European legislation.
One of the issues this study will certainly look into is the possibility of drafting a separate directive dealing with disabled people.
This issue is under discussion and we are using the appropriate European means to determine which method is the most effective for achieving the goal in question.
As I said in my previous remarks, of course I will reply to all questions in writing in case some questions were not answered sufficiently due to the nature of this slightly improvised session.
That is clear.
I will provide additional written answers to all the questions raised during this debate.
Thank you, Commissioner, and thank you for the manner in which we have been able to conduct these last questions.
I think that has been helpful and, I hope, satisfactory.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers, apart from Question 58, which has been withdrawn, and Question 73, which is inadmissible (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.

Reducing alcohol-related harm (debate)
The next item is the report by Alessandro Foglietta, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on a European Union strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very satisfying to see the culmination and conclusion of such an important report.
I should like to offer my warmest thanks to colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, the groups and the officials who have made this outcome possible.
Reducing harmful alcohol consumption has in recent years become one of the priorities of health and social policies throughout the world, and the European Union is playing its part here too.
The European Commission gave us a text that contained a great deal of food for thought, which we have tried to build on and supplement.
Examination of the harm caused by alcohol abuse gave an extremely bleak and worrying picture: very high mortality among young people, in particular as a result of road accidents, ill-treatment in the family, growing numbers of cases of foetal alcohol syndrome, increasingly widespread liver disease and alcohol dependence, among young people as well, in all the Member States.
The costs of health treatment amount in Europe to EUR 17 billion, alongside the EUR 5 billion spent on treatment and prevention.
It should be stressed that it is alcohol abuse that is the problem; alcohol consumption cannot be demonised per se since it is part of the culture, history and traditions of many Member States and the quality of some alcohol products in many cases makes them the jewel in the crown of the producer countries.
The employment aspect should not be forgotten either.
It is estimated that alcohol production and processing provides jobs for over a million people in Europe.
The European Commission, which I thank, presented a communication focusing on a number of priorities which we have taken up while attempting to extend their scope through various key points: in-depth examination of the problem of consumption by young people, comprehensive provision of information, assistance and prevention, better public information campaigns making the community aware of the risks that they run when they consume alcohol irresponsibly, and examination of the problems of violence, especially domestic, connected with alcohol consumption.
In particular, measures to counter the harm resulting from abuse include: awareness-raising and risk education campaigns in schools, targeted on parents as well, making more public transport available as an alternative to private transport for people leaving night-time venues and support for initiatives by individual States focusing on the 'don't drink and drive' principle, a European prize for the best information campaign run in schools, financial support for the dissemination of instruments enabling people themselves to monitor their blood alcohol content, and strict action against 'alcopops'.
Another of the innovative points of the report, which has been welcomed by the Commission, is the idea of using the so-called brief intervention to disseminate a responsible and informed approach to alcohol consumption.
General practitioners, through the daily and direct relationship that they have with patients, could be a valuable resource for identifying alcohol-related problems even before patients themselves become aware of them: a simple questionnaire, known as an audit, which is already being tried out in some European cities, could supplement such personal action.
Other measures in particular include the promotion of measures to reduce the road accidents caused by alcohol abuse, for instance by stepping up checks on drink-driving, disseminating tests enabling people themselves to monitor their blood alcohol content, offering incentives for 'designated-driver' programmes, lowering admissible blood alcohol contents and introducing harsher penalties for drink-drivers.
The report proposes, and here it seems to have the support of all the European Parliament's groups, a blood alcohol content limit which is as close as possible to 0 for new drivers, in order to provide a concrete foundation for the strategy which goes beyond the simple statement of principle and the caution shown by the Commission in its text, even though many of the measures that could be adopted to counter alcohol abuse come within the competence of the individual States, especially measures in the health and safety field.
The European Union can try to stimulate, offer incentives for, promote and suggest the adoption of some of these measures.
One of the issues on which consensus was lacking was undoubtedly the question of labelling to highlight the risks and dangers of excessive alcohol consumption.
On a personal level, I feel that I should ask the Commission for a detailed study from which the various systems of information and communication, including labelling, can be drawn up.
In conclusion, the strategy, as amended by Parliament, could provide substantial added value over individual national policies, especially as it would be possible to direct the work of the Member States towards common objectives.
In the text of the report, I have tried above all to tackle this issue in a balanced and common-sense way, avoiding any demonisation of moderate alcohol consumption in order to take account of the centuries-old tradition of responsible drinking, and by trying to suggest measures likely to counter the problems which are unfortunately now so common in Europe and throughout the world.
I should like to thank everyone for their support and cooperation.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the excellent work and the very good report that he has produced, and also the other members of the committee who have supported him and worked with him in producing such an interesting, useful and positive report.
I do not want to repeat much of what has been included in the communication or in the report, and I begin by saying that I am very happy that we see eye to eye as to how we can solve and deal with such a difficult and important problem.
We know the statistics, which are worrying.
Almost 200 000 people a year in the European Union die of diseases related to excessive alcohol consumption.
We have 43-45 million people who drink at hazardous levels in the European Union which amounts to 70.4% of all ill health and early deaths, and this is one of the largest causes of death among young people.
So the statistics are worrying, but we have to emphasise from the outset that we are not dealing with alcohol as a product on its own: it is the excessive consumption and the abuse of alcohol that are creating these problems.
Sometimes it makes it more difficult to educate and teach people how to consume, in moderate and more responsible ways, a product which has been around for centuries; it is the excess or the abuse that is causing the problems.
I am very happy that Parliament agrees with the need for a European strategy and for European action in this respect.
It is true that we have to complement the policy of the Member States, as is stated in Article 152, but that does not mean that we do nothing.
On the contrary, we are there to support, complement and add to the actions taken by the Member States.
It is also true that we have different cultures and different traditions in the Member States but, unfortunately, we now see the problems that until recently existed only in some Member States spreading everywhere in the European Union.
Unfortunately, bad habits travel fast and are very easily copied, especially by young people.
The possibility exists to exchange best practice through cooperation and working together, before it is too late.
We can take action before the problem gets out of hand, and this is one of the most important aspects of this strategy.
We should focus on young people.
Binge drinking is now a main concern regarding young people, but drink-driving is also one of the highest causes of deaths among young people.
At the same time, it is extremely important to focus on the priorities, and I am glad that the report agrees with the Commission on the main priorities, as I said, especially regarding young people, but also pregnant women.
Unfortunately, it is still a problem in the European Union that we still have children born with problems because of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
One would have expected, in this day and age, with the highest level of education in the European Union, this would not happen, but unfortunately it does.
I have noted with great interest the reference made in the report to the problem among elderly people.
This will be seriously taken into consideration for the next actions because I can see that this can also be a serious social and health problem.
The European Union as a whole will work on two levels.
Firstly, there is the Committee on National Policy and Action, where the Member States are represented, and this will coordinate national alcohol policies and develop further policies, especially those identified in the communication.
But, at the same time, we also have the European Alcohol and Health Forum, where all the stakeholders are present and there we will develop concrete actions at the appropriate levels.
However, it will not be a debating society or just a 'talk show'.
On the contrary, we are asking for firm commitments which will not only have to produce specific results but also will have to be made public and closely monitored, and the results of the monitoring will also be made public.
We are optimistic that this will be able to deal with some complicated issues, for example responsible marketing, responsible advertising - as identified in the report - and, at the same time, other aspects, like responsible serving, because it is not just the producers but also the retailers who have a serious responsibility in this area, and we will focus on this as well.
Most of the issues raised in the report confirm the policy orientations set out in the strategy outlined in the Commission's communication.
Some points strive to further develop this strategy and, of course, I will pay close attention to these; other points go beyond the recommendations of the Commission's communication on some issues, such as labelling and taxation.
We will reflect on these issues as well.
Concerning the warning labels on alcoholic drinks, which I know has been an issue of great debate both when the communication was being drafted and in Parliament as well, we will study the experience obtained by Member States which are already in the process of introducing them and we will explore the possibility, in cooperation with the Member States, of developing official common approaches throughout the Community regarding this issue.
We have evidence that warning labels raise awareness - and that is why Member States introduced them - but, at the same time, they have to be part of a broader strategy; on their own, they cannot achieve the goals we wish for.
Therefore, we need campaigns for raising awareness of education programmes.
For example, we can put warning labels on bottles, but what happens to drinks served in restaurants, bars and homes where the consumer does not see the bottle and, therefore, does not see the label?
So we have to come up with new ideas, for example leaflets accompanying purchases of alcoholic beverages and advice from doctors, as was mentioned in the report.
These are important aspects.
Responsible communication, responsible sales and responsible marketing are also important aspects, and we have what is provided in the audiovisual services legislation.
However, through the forum, we can develop a code of conduct to be complied with by all stakeholders.
I should like to finish by saying that addressing alcoholic-related harm is a difficult challenge, precisely because we have to deal with one particular aspect, the excessive consumption and not the product itself.
However, I believe we are moving in the right direction, before the problem becomes unmanageable.
So I am looking forward to achieving concrete results, in the bodies I mentioned earlier, but, most importantly, in close cooperation with Parliament, and I am looking forward to your support in this continuous effort.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that harmful and risky alcohol consumption has a considerable health, economic and social impact.
It is, however, also a fact that alcohol forms part of the European cultural heritage and the majority of Europeans take a responsible attitude to it.
So we do not want to condemn alcohol as such or lay down new laws.
What we want to do is to focus on groups at risk and risky situations.
A young person who drinks him or herself into oblivion, a pregnant women who damages her unborn child because of alcohol consumption, or a drunken driver who puts himself or others in danger: it is in precisely those areas that we need to act.
This report provides an excellent basis for doing so.
It is balanced, targeted and includes all stakeholders: Member States, the alcohol industry, retailers, the catering industry, doctors, schools and parents.
It clearly demarcates the various powers.
The Member States are the main players.
The EU only has a supporting role.
Its task is to collect data, point to well-established procedures and draw up and support information campaigns.
It is up to Member States to improve the implementation of existing national legislation.
What, after all, is the point of strict youth protection legislation if it is not observed and if offences go unpunished?
We also recommend a 0.00% limit for young newly-qualified drivers and professional lorry drivers.
The alcohol industry should undertake to refrain from directing alcohol advertising at young people.
My Group is not, however, in favour of obligatory warnings on alcoholic beverages, which is why I ask you to support the draft amendments deleting provisions to that effect from the report.
It is well known, and surveys confirm it, that warning labels have no effect in this case.
On the contrary, people need to be informed as early as possible about the dangers of alcohol abuse.
We must inform and we must convince, rather than prescribe and prohibit.
I think we have reached the point where we must realise that we are the representatives of the people, not their educators.
I thank Mr Foglietta, the rapporteur, for the close collaboration.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, fellow Members, I should like first to congratulate Mr Foglietta on his work.
He has produced a balanced report, showing a grasp of the problem and presenting sensible and generally speaking suitable proposals for dealing with the situation.
We agree with the objectives of encouraging responsible patterns of consumption and avoiding alcohol abuse in general and especially in the case of minors, pregnant women and drivers - we are all agreed.
The proposals presented by my Group are on the same lines: we are against alcohol abuse, but it is important to distinguish between moderate and responsible consumption and abuse.
Moderate and responsible consumption is not bad, on the contrary moderate consumption of wine, for example, is positively good for the health.
Also, habits in alcohol consumption vary widely in different parts of Europe.
In the south, there is a culture of moderate consumption of beverages, such as wine and beer, with a relatively low alcohol content.
Beverages of this kind are part of the culture in some parts of Europe and make an important contribution to the local economy.
So, in our view, it does not make sense to attach warning labels indiscriminately to bottles of wine like the labels on cigarette packets, for example.
Tobacco always damages health but alcohol only does in cases of alcohol abuse.
We also think information and awareness-raising campaigns are needed, to alert people to the risks of alcohol abuse.
These campaigns should start in schools.
This is a subject that must be approached sensibly, without preconceived fundamentalist ideas.
We are worried about the increase in alcohol consumption among young people, about the fact that they are starting to drink at an increasingly early age, mixing alcohol with drugs, and driving under the influence.
These situations must be dealt with by all possible means, both at national and at European level, because the future of our young people is at stake.
We agree with most of the measures proposed to address the risks arising from excessive consumption of alcohol by young people, and with the need for measures to tackle the harmful social impact of alcohol abuse, particularly domestic violence - we know that the incidence of domestic violence resulting from alcohol abuse is very high.
In most Member States, the laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to young people are adequate; the problem is the low level of compliance.
Member States must strengthen the control mechanisms and secure compliance with the legislation involving the business sector, in other words we must all take responsibility and fight abuse, but we must not demonise moderate or irresponsible consumption.
Mr President, the European Commission puts the total economic cost of alcohol abuse in Europe at 125 000 million euros a year and estimates that it is responsible for a quarter of all crimes of violence.
Some more statistics: drinking alcohol during pregnancy is the leading cause of mental and physical defects in children.
About 1% of the European population live with the effects of foetal alcohol syndrome.
That means nearly five million Europeans, when foetal alcohol syndrome is entirely preventable.
Sixty per cent of people who suffer foetal alcohol syndrome end up in prison or in psychiatric institutions.
This afternoon we had a meeting, organised together with Eurocare, with a visiting specialist from my own country of the Netherlands, Dr Nico van der Lely.
He said that the number of people requiring treatment for alcohol poisoning in his hospital, the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis in Delft, had doubled over a five-year period and that in children between the ages of 10 and 15 it had actually increased six-fold.
Binge drinking in particular, where you literally drank yourself under the table, seemed to be popular.
During the first half of this year a good 80 juveniles had already been admitted to the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis in Delft as a result of excessive drinking.
There are many measures which can and should be taken.
Probably the most important factors here will be cost and availability plus, of course, education and information.
The question is: who is best placed to handle this?
The situation varies widely from one Member State to another, as the Commissioner rightly points out.
So very often help will be given locally by local authorities and measures will most effectively be taken by doctors or the Member States.
And under the Treaty there is little scope for it to be otherwise.
It is important to have an ambitious alcohol strategy for Europe, but not to get in the way of Member States' own plans.
Europe must lay down broad policy lines, and they must be clear.
Alcohol abuse needs to be tackled energetically, especially amongst the young, and Europe must give the Member States as much support as it can.
I am very loath to announce legislation which we cannot then carry through, because that does nothing to increase confidence in our institutions.
Mr President, I talked about foetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol abuse in juveniles.
It is indeed a European problem, as the Commissioner rightly says.
So I think the Member States must face up to their responsibility here and do so at European level.
I think that European level is the right place for agreeing clear targets for reducing foetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol abuse in juveniles.
And the resolution says as much.
To my mind it could have been spelled out in more concrete terms than it in fact is, but if the Member States are prepared to agree this, then at least we shall have some kind of a clear-cut result, because I do not believe in saying that subsidiarity is important but then doing absolutely nothing.
Lastly, I am keen to know what the results of labelling have been.
In France labels now carry a warning against alcohol consumption by pregnant women.
If we have those results and it appears that labelling works, I think we should consider similar action at European level.
There are also single-market reasons for doing so.
We can and should do this.
But I think we should only do it if it is effective, in which case I shall be happy to consider it.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to congratulate Mr Foglietta for his excellent work: his report very effectively tackles a tragically topical issue, that of alcohol abuse, in particular by minors.
It has already been said that the aim is in no way to criminalise consumption of alcohol which, when taken in moderate quantities, may well have health benefits.
The aim is rather to take a strong line against the spread of alcohol consumption among the very young.
Alcohol is often taken with drugs or alcohol itself may end up as a drug.
Alcohol abuse is now a social emergency among young people because it brings with it very serious physical and psychological damage, not to mention the victims of road accidents which are increasingly being caused by drink-drivers.
In Europe, Italy is sadly in the lead here with the highest number of road traffic accidents, half of whose victims are young people aged under thirty.
In the majority of cases, they lose their lives at weekends, during the evening, during the night, often returning from a party or a discotheque after consuming excessive amounts of alcohol.
In conclusion, Mr President, this is an excellent report, whose line we support as it is capable of reconciling prevention of the problem with appropriate action in terms of education and information and with zero tolerance for those failing to abide by the rules.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, a European alcohol strategy is long overdue, but we would have liked to have seen it brought forward more boldly and courageously.
We have heard about the horrendous costs of EUR 125 billion a year, not to mention the great human suffering resulting from accidents or domestic violence, or the 10 million children living in families with alcohol problems.
That is why it is important not to bow to the massive pressure being exerted by the alcohol lobby.
I am hugely disappointed by the announcements made by the speakers from the two big Groups, who obviously do not endorse the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, whose key concern is to bring in warning labels together with bans on advertising.
Mr Maaten told us about the risks, about the major problem of drinking during pregnancy, about the appalling effects of foetal alcohol syndrome and the irreversible damage done to the development of the child's brain.
We know about the experiences in the USA and today experts have again confirmed that warnings do have the required effect, especially in pointing out to pregnant women that drinking has devastating effects.
Why then are we not courageous enough to say that we are prepared to implement these ideas transparently and to use warning labels as wake-up calls for the women concerned?
Why do we bow to the pressure of the lobby industry?
I beg you once again from my heart: we would be acting like cowards if we gave way and did not have the courage to introduce those warnings, which have proved effective, and to endorse the vote by the Committee on Public Health.
The same applies to advertising bans.
We know, and the WHO has said it, that the European Union would save EUR 95 billion a year if we really introduced advertising bans and warning labels.
After all, we know that adverts are particularly persuasive in inducing young people to consume.
That is why I really can only beg you from my heart to have the courage tomorrow to implement this report.
Without legislative measures in the field of warning labels and advertising bans, the alcohol strategy will be a paper tiger.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr President, when I was discussing the original version of the strategy with an expert in the Czech Republic, he made just one comment: 'too little, too late'.
I would like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur for improving this outlook and for managing to give the text of this strategy a very positive direction.
I would like to stress the following points in particular.
Firstly, the amended text takes a positive attitude to the fact that it is necessary to spend more money on information and prevention programs to combat alcoholism.
Secondly, the strategy focuses on young people, who represent a category that is particularly at risk.
In this context, I welcome and support in particular Article 7 on university students and Article 16, which makes it obligatory to include warnings on labels.
Thirdly, I believe that the text of Article 21, which draws attention to the relationship between sick leave and alcohol consumption, is very important.
We must not forget that if the European workforce is affected by alcohol, it will not be very competitive in a global world.
I have a few doubts about the text of Article 2, which refers to a study by the World Health Organisation about the usefulness of alcohol in prevention of some diseases.
With due respect to the WHO, I would like to point out that there are expert analyses available on this topic, such as the study by the team lead by Mrs Fillmore that was published in 2006: these studies show that analysis of the benefits of alcohol was based on the wrong data and that it also included, for example, older people who have stopped drinking and casual drinkers.
The findings of this study are therefore fairly problematic.
There is also the question of the message we want to convey to citizens with this text in Article 2.
I hope that the message is not that if alcohol is drunk in small quantities, no amount will prove harmful.
Although I have made this one criticism, I very much support the strategy, that is, the text that was amended in mutual cooperation with the rapporteur, and I believe that it will be beneficial for our fellow citizens.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, in my capacity as shadow rapporteur, I want to thank Mr Foglietta for his excellent cooperation.
The report describes in detail the measures that should be taken by the EU to reduce alcohol-related harm in the Member States.
Criminal law is a national matter, however, not an EU matter.
We cannot have opinions on what sort of penalties the Member States should issue for drink-driving or how long driving licences can be withdrawn for these types of offence.
Criminal law is a strictly national preserve and must remain so.
It is also proposed that information campaigns be run at EU level even through it is in fact recognised that each Member State has its own drinking culture.
Each country knows best how to prevent alcohol-related harm on the basis of its own social experiences, traditions and resources.
It is beneficial to exchange information but the initiative must come from the Member States and not from Brussels.
The setting-up of a European prize is another way to increase the EU's influence in these matters.
We need to review cooperation where the EU is competent, for example through the internal market.
The Environment Committee is trying to interfere with national matters.
So I now urge everyone to rap the committee's knuckles.
And as far as the alcohol content limit is concerned, someone is equally dangerous whether they are a young driver, an old driver or a professional driver if they have been drinking and are out in traffic.
Mr President, I very much welcome this report and the compromise position that came from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, with the sole exception of the clause on labelling, which we will try to put right in the vote tomorrow.
I start from the belief that alcohol can be good for you in regular and limited quantities, particularly at the years of discretion which you and I have reached.
It is good for people as we approach maturity.
However, it can be bad for us, and that is what this report is about: it is about the binge drinking, the under-age drinking and the drink-driving; it is about the consequences of alcohol consumption in terms of the deaths of 195 000 people in Europe from accidents, violence, liver disease, lung disease, breast cancer, mental disorders, addiction, cardiovascular, foetal and reproductive problems and so forth and so on.
It is the third-biggest cause of early death.
That is why we need a sensible drinking policy; that is why we urge the Commissioner to stick to that sensible message that he began with and why we would suggest that he does not go down the road of trying to harmonise criminal law, not least because you cannot harmonise the enforcement of criminal law, and we know that in drink-driving that is a major problem between Member States.
Equally, it is a mistake to try to harmonise labelling.
By all means, let us see what France does and let us learn from the lessons that it comes up with.
However, our message tonight is: let us have a sensible policy for sensible drinking, recognising the benefits but also the risks and the hazards of alcohol, some of which can be drunk to excess, some of which can be drunk to such excess that it is alcoholism.
But alcohol is with us and we need to learn to live with it.
(DE) Mr President, our rapporteur and Commissioner Kyprianou made it quite clear in their opening statements that we are concerned not with condemning alcohol as a product but with its abuse.
Nor is this discussion about offering our citizens alcohol, as the report also makes clear.
Let me simply remind Members of the regulation on health-related information that we adopted in this House last year.
It bans health-related labelling on alcoholic drinks.
The European Parliament decided to endorse that too, on the basis of very good arguments.
The resolution incorporates the priorities set out in the Commission's communication of last October - to reduce the number of injuries and deaths resulting from alcohol-related road traffic accidents.
The focus on alcohol abuse by young people and children is important, but it would be a strategic mistake to pretend that only young people are affected by alcohol abuse and its adverse effects in the European Union.
Precisely because alcohol and the moderate consumption of alcohol are important components of our European culture - and that should remain the case and nor should it be criticised - we must give particular priority to raising awareness about alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
The consumption even of small quantities of alcohol during pregnancy can adversely affect the child's development.
I do not think the discussion about whether or not to introduce labelling will come to an end with tomorrow's vote, and in fact Commissioner Kyprianou has indicated that the Commission will very carefully observe Member States' experiences and then possibly take measures at European level.
Mr President, alcohol-related mortality and morbidity affect hundreds of thousands of EU citizens every year and alcohol competes strongly with tobacco as a main cause of preventable serious harm to humans.
Road traffic accidents, domestic violence, sexual abuse of children, hepatic cancer, liver cirrhosis and foetal damage are just some of the known detriments of alcohol.
Yet alcohol is widely available at affordable prices everywhere in Europe.
It is regarded as a necessary component in most social events, including many such events in the European Parliament.
Its production is supported and subsidised by the EU.
Its consumption is extensively and directly advertised on TV, radio and the press, and most alcoholic beverages carry no proper health hazard warning.
Why is this so?
Why are national governments, national parliaments and the EU so tolerant of alcohol?
Is it because of the very strong alcohol industry-related lobby?
Is it because there is, historically, a general degree of naivety as regards this substance?
Is it because of an as yet not well understood psychological or cultural factor?
The sad fact is that the EU strategy in reducing alcohol-related harm has fallen victim to the same factors.
I dare say, respectfully, that this report, despite the noble intentions of the rapporteur, instead of tackling the problem drastically and effectively, merely scratches the surface and deals mildly mainly with heavy drinking and extreme drinking patterns, or drinking in particular circumstances, e.g. by children or pregnant women.
I am not advocating alcohol prohibition, but I believe that our chance as MEPs to deal with alcohol as a potentially killer drug of addiction, the use of which needs to be seriously, not mildly, restricted, has been missed.
Unfortunately, the alcohol lobby has succeeded once again.
This much watered-down alcohol strategy for Europe proved that the alcohol industry won and the EU citizens lost.
Just as a piece of information, alcohol acts by interfering with the function of neurones in the central nervous system and by killing nerve cells which can never be replaced again in a person's life.
So, whether we drink little or much, the damage is there.
It is just the degree of damage that differs.
(SV) I want to thank the Commission for its strategy.
It initiates an important and necessary discussion about alcohol in Europe even though many practical measures that I had wanted to see are absent.
Alcohol is not a normal product.
It has side-effects on health and the internal market must therefore take health considerations into account.
This does not mean banning alcohol. It means a balanced policy with health warnings and a fair policy on alcohol imports and advertising.
No one is talking about a new EU competence here, only a better application of a competence.
Is a warning label and time limits for television advertising too much to expect?
Is it too much to expect, having due regard to the subsidiarity principle, to recommend zero tolerance of alcohol on the road, which saves many lives?
Many seem to think that only young people, pregnant women, professional drivers and addicts can have problems with alcohol.
That is wrong.
Total freedom for the alcohol trade is not liberal.
It reduces people's freedom and increases the costs of healthcare unnecessarily.
It reduces the freedom to feel safe on the road.
It reduces the confidence in being able to go home safely from the pub and it reduces children's safety in the home.
It is anti-liberal not to take health considerations into account in alcohol policy.
(GA) Mr President, I should like to support the call in the report for society to address the problems of alcohol abuse.
The social and economic impact of alcohol abuse on Ireland as a whole is almost incalculable.
We should also look at good practice in other EU countries, for we could devise a much better long-term policy to tackle alcohol-related harm.
The signs of alcohol abuse are discernible in the indiscriminate violence on the streets and in domestic violence.
There should be interpreting!
(The speaker continues in English.)
People knew I was coming tonight, people knew I was speaking at this time, people know that my language is now a working language of the European Union.
I gave proper notice.
I would like there to be interpreting.
I will be very unhappy if there is no interpreting for what I wish to say tonight.
(The speaker reverts to Irish.)
(GA) We need to exercise scrutiny.
We have to deal with the matter of alcopops and the use of special offers and other marketing ploys designed to increase alcoholic drink sales among young people in particular.
It would also be a good thing to put a warning on labels aimed especially at pregnant women.
The sale of alcohol needs to be monitored more closely.
(The speaker repeats her comments in English.)
We need, certainly, a special focus on alcohol-related harm in young people.
We need more stringent monitoring of the laws on selling alcohol to under-age children.
We need to address the question of alcohol, alcopops, the use of special offers and other marketing devices designed to increase the sales of alcoholic drinks among young people in particular, looking at the availability of public transport at night, the encouragement of designator-driver programmes, and it would also be good to have labelling on alcoholic drinks specifically designed and directed towards women who are pregnant.
(The speaker reverts to Irish.)
(GA) I am most annoyed that interpreting is not available!
(The speaker continues in English.)
I am very unhappy that there was no interpreting here.
I have played fair with Parliament since my language became an official and working language and I had hoped that it would also play fair with me.
(Applause)
(PL) Mr President, the resolutions that have been prepared and other preventative measures aimed at counteracting the negative effects of alcohol abuse cannot at the same time promote the consumption of alcohol advertised as being part of the European cultural heritage and lifestyle, as well as questionable WHO opinions about the health-promoting effects of alcohol, which are problematic, since the harmful effects of this product have been proven.
A liberal law allowing children and young people to consume addictive substances, including alcohol in tubes or alcopops, at a time where there is an epidemic of psychological disorders would be both careless and reprehensible, and cannot be considered as counteracting, but rather as promoting, alcoholism and other addictions.
Even the smallest dose of alcohol and narcotics given to a child is extremely harmful.
It should be a priority to impose a strict ban on the advertising and supply of alcohol and narcotics to children and young people, including when this is done in a covert manner.
(PL) Mr President, alcohol abuse is currently a serious social problem in the European Union.
In fact, the highest percentage of persons abusing alcohol is found in Europe.
I do not believe, however, that one can make a comparison between tobacco products and alcohol.
While it has been shown scientifically that tobacco products are harmful, alcohol is harmful only when consumed in excessive quantities or by persons who should not drink it.
What is more, there is well-known research showing that small quantities of alcohol have a positive effect on circulation.
The issue here is the drinking culture and the promotion of social responsibility by alcohol producers in Europe.
Taking the above arguments into account, I believe there is no justification for labelling alcoholic beverages in a similar way to tobacco products.
On the contrary, it would be much more effective for reducing alcohol consumption to avoid expensive procedures for harmonising the manufacture of packaging and invest money in information campaigns.
It is our responsibility to reach high-risk groups such as pregnant women, young people and drivers through well-structured educational approaches.
It would be worth extending standard campaigns to include alcopops, alcoholic beverages frequently consumed by young people, which are generally considered to be fairly harmless or even as not containing alcohol.
Actions that I absolutely do support are moves to reduce to a minimum the permitted blood alcohol levels not just for young drivers, but also for persons working in public transport.
All these measures, which are essentially hardly coercive, are however enormously effective and will help to limit the consumption of alcohol in Member States.
It is also worth considering one additional issue: the consumption of alcohol and alcohol dependence, especially in young people, goes hand in hand with other addictions, which combine and often lead to tragedy.
It would be worthwhile for Parliament and the Commission also to consider these other addictions among young people.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, alcohol-related damage is a growing problem.
The figures speak for themselves.
Five per cent of men and 1% of women are addicted to alcohol.
Twenty-five per cent of deaths in young people aged 15 to 30 are alcohol-related.
Child abuse is often the result of excessive drinking.
These figures often conceal a lot of suffering.
Addiction, medical problems, social misery, abuse, all these things are well known.
Less well known are the serious consequences of drinking alcohol when pregnant.
There may be serious harm to the unborn child.
Children with foetal alcohol syndrome are damaged for life.
It is increasingly recognised that drinking is extremely harmful to children and young people.
Youth drinking can cause lasting damage and can adversely affect academic performance and IQ.
Obviously, measures are needed quickly to dissuade youngsters and pregnant women from drinking.
One of the most effective ways may be health warnings on bottles.
So I urge Member States to bring forward proposals as soon as possible to make health warnings compulsory.
In the absence of any European legislation each Member State is free to make its own rules.
Warnings on bottles are effective, as studies in the USA have already shown.
And I urge the drinks industry to take responsibility itself for warning young people and pregnant women about alcohol.
Better to warn people now than face a whole lot of damage claims in ten years' time.
Warnings are now a normal part of social responsibility, in which the drinks industry too must share.
Lastly, I call on the Commission to come up with adequate proposals at the earliest opportunity.
It is hard to see why warnings on cigarette packets have not been followed by warnings against alcohol.
So I urge the Commission please to waste no time in introducing measures to make health warnings aimed at young people and pregnant women compulsory.
It is important to place the health of the public above the interests of the wine industry.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on this important report.
I wish to draw attention to the role that alcohol plays in the incidence of suicide, with studies showing that over 20% of persons committing suicide used alcohol prior to death.
Indeed, when the legal age for drinking alcohol was raised from 18 to 21 in the US, the most notable impact was on the reduction of accidents in the home, at work and on the roads, but there was also a 7% reduction in suicides.
There are many excellent suggestions in this report that I support.
However, I have one slight reservation concerning the part of recital K which states: 'whereas measures should also be taken to prevent the consumption of alcohol by minors and pregnant women'.
I know there are major issues with regard to foetal alcohol syndrome, and I am in favour of information labels, warning labels, curbs on advertising and pre- and post-natal support, but the suggestion that we should prevent pregnant women from taking a drink is a step too far.
We are not in the business of prohibition - that does not work - but we need what is proposed in this report, and much more.
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, the report fails to mention one crucial issue: a position on the price of alcohol and taxes on alcohol.
In Finland we have identified a clear link between the price of alcohol and its consumption.
The lower the price, the more it is used, and vice versa.
Raising tax on alcohol reduces its consumption.
In Estonia, our neighbouring country, the tax on alcohol is low.
Because of this, and because the EU prevents quantitative restrictions on imports, Estonia is causing a huge public health problem in Finland.
Finns can get cheap spirits in Estonia, less than 100 kilometres away, and that is stopping Finland from adopting what has been found to be the best approach, which is to impose a fairly high tax on alcohol for the sake of the health of its citizens.
Estonia's cheap spirits, its policy if you like, and the resulting reduction in tax on alcohol in Finland, has led to almost a thousand alcohol-related deaths in my country.
In that way Estonia is killing Finns.
In this context, therefore, we need to speak about prices and taxes.
Mr President, in the US there has been warning of the effect of alcohol on babies in utero for 20 years because they had a problem with alcohol-related harm.
Only 20% of American mothers-to-be drink in pregnancy.
In Europe, we do not label.
Eighty per cent of Irish mothers drink.
Seventy per cent of mothers in the UK drink.
I know mothers in Ireland.
I know that many of them would not drink if they understood the harm.
Labelling may not be an instant solution, but, over time, it is proved by the US experience that it has an effect and brings down foetal harm.
For adults, moderation is the key word, but for the child before birth there is no safe level.
Even low consumption can create organic brain damage that results in hyperactivity, impulsivity and even an increased risk of suicide.
There are learning and coordination difficulties as well.
One of the results of foetal alcohol exposure is a tendency for the child to grow up and to binge drink when he or she gets older. That shows it becomes self perpetuating.
It is time to break this cycle.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, first I would like to welcome this strategy on alcohol which the Commission is proposing, precisely because it seeks to resolve the problem through prevention and education by publicising guidelines for moderate, responsible drinking.
I would also like to congratulate Mr Foglietta on his prudent report, but I would say once again that it is not alcoholic drinks per se that should be criminalised but abuse of them.
Moderate consumption of fermented drinks such as wine or beer by healthy adults is not only unharmful but even good for one's health and can form part of a balanced diet.
Moderate consumption may protect the body from cardiovascular and degenerative diseases, as has been shown in many scientific reports.
Consumers are entitled to full, truthful information on the risks and benefits to health of alcohol consumption, but the appropriateness of health warnings on wine and beer labels must be called into question given that they have been shown to be ineffective in countries where they have been adopted.
Specifically, there is no scientific evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of health warnings on labels in terms of preventing abusive consumption.
Moreover, specific labelling for pregnant women would also appear to be ineffective.
The best ways to achieve the objectives set out are good awareness-raising and educational campaigns directed especially at pregnant women and young people.
I would also like to say that the recently established Forum on health and alcohol, which brings all interested parties together with the objective of combating excessive, abusive alcohol consumption, appears to me to be a very appropriate initiative and I hope that the Forum's conclusions can also help to resolve this problem.
Finally, I would like to point out that the phenomenon of drunkenness in young people has gone hand in hand with a reduction in the per capita consumption of wine in the European Union.
I think that this is something to bear in mind because the issue is a good deal more complex than it would appear.
Mr President, tonight's debate on an EU strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm should be wholeheartedly welcomed.
It carries on the work that I conducted in my report in 2001 on young people and alcohol and its negative effects.
The globalisation of the alcoholic drinks market and the increase in binge drinking across the EU is a phenomenon that politicians and health bodies alike are trying to grapple with.
In order to share best practice and to see how other countries are coping with similar problems, cooperation at EU level is essential.
For starters, one accident in four can be linked to alcohol consumption, with 10 000 people killed in alcohol-related road accidents in the EU each year; 35% to 45% of traffic accident deaths are of young people aged 18 to 24.
Drink-driving accidents are even more revealing: two thirds of the people involved were between 15 and 34 years old and 96% were male.
Alcohol is estimated to be the causal factor in 16% of cases of child abuse and neglect.
Take the subject of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD): prenatal alcohol abuse is the commonest acquired cause of mental retardation.
More recently, medical professionals have stated there is no such thing as a safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
In 2001, at the time of my report on young people and alcohol, FAS was relatively unknown.
Six years later there would appear to be more than acceptance of the argument that, if the same alcoholic beverage in the USA has an FAS health warning, why cannot the exact same product in the EU have the same warning?
There is no difference between the two products: just that one is sold in the US and the other is not.
As Ms Sinnott said, the rates of women drinking whilst pregnant are 20% in the USA, where FAS labelling has been used, whereas in Ireland they are 80%, in the UK 75% and in the EU as a whole 40%.
FAS warnings on alcohol products would be easy to introduce and their impact, combined with public health education and information, would be important in preventing FAS in the EU.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, various figures have been quoted this evening, and in the report by Mr Foglietta.
I would like to point out that behind these cold statistics there are, first and foremost, human tragedies.
I was head of a psychiatric hospital for some years and many of our patients were alcohol-dependent.
Paragraph 26 of the report states that we need to know the causes.
We have not talked enough about that this evening.
If we want to decide on the right action to be taken with young people, old people, men and women, we have to know the causes.
I am therefore urging that, in any action that is taken, more research is done in each of the Member States and in the European Union as a whole to find out more about why these young people feel the need to drink to excess.
Why, too, do old people, isolated at home, drink too much?
Why do men drink at work?
Until we have found out the real reasons for this over-consumption, we shall not be able to provide proper answers.
Mr President, overall I welcome this report.
I think it finds the right balance between recognising established cultural habits and the very worrying trend of harmful consumption of alcohol, particularly the growth in the hazardous binge-drinking culture among our young people.
The Commission in its approach identified key targets - protecting our children, combating binge-drinking, reducing injuries and deaths from alcohol rage, road accidents and the whole area of suicide.
My colleagues have pointed out the areas of concern extremely well.
I would now like to emphasise myself the need to add the serious risks of pre-natal alcohol exposure as a key target in the Commission's list to be worked on, and for the health and alcohol forum proposed by the Commission particularly to take up this issue. This is because the area of the pre-natal damage done by the consumption of alcohol is one very poorly understood by the public at large.
No amount of alcohol is safe during pregnancy, because alcohol is a teratogen.
In fact it is more dangerous during the second and third trimesters, which is what most pregnant women do not understand, because it is usually the first trimester that is the area of concern in terms of taking medication or drugs or any such substances.
Alcohol is particularly dangerous in the second and third trimesters.
Without shaming and blaming, we need to get an educational information campaign out through the Member States, through the GPs, to alert pregnant women immediately to the dangers of alcohol in this area.
Colleagues have mentioned ADHD.
There is also Asperger's Syndrome.
The medical research community has had difficulty in getting published in this area, owing to the politics of alcohol.
Let your forum take over this issue and go further with it.
A final word on alcohol abuse as part of polydrug abuse.
In Ireland a fifth of those treated for problem alcohol use also misuse drugs, and a recent study in France found that driving under the influence of cannabis doubles the risk of being responsible for an accident.
The increasing prevalence of polydrug use needs to be addressed urgently by your forum too, and by each Member State, and the necessary technical supports to detect polydrug use, particularly at roadside police checks, need to be enhanced, with technical support being given to our police authorities.
(RO) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
The results of the report are meant to reduce the damage caused by alcohol and to protect the health and welfare of EU citizens, as we all know very well that alcohol is one of the most dangerous factors causing disease and premature death in Europe and also a series of social problems.
I appreciate that attention is paid both to reducing the harmful effects of alcohol on consumers and on third parties, vulnerable social groups, such as children, young people and pregnant women.
We can also add to all these, social damage such as domestic violence, neglected children, unemployment and social exclusion.
The importance paid to education, to information and education campaigns in order to prevent the dangerous and harmful effects of alcohol consumption, such as exchanges of best practices at European level, are important elements in reducing the harmful effects caused by alcohol.
The general approach of the report succeeded in bringing out the essential problems of alcohol consumption in the European Union and is an important step in the fight against excessive consumption.
(FI) Mr President, the problems resulting from the dangerous and harmful consumption of alcohol have grown alarmingly in recent years in all the Member States of the European Union.
Our society pays a hard price for this every year, in terms of both direct and indirect costs.
The most acute problems of alcohol consumption relate to young people.
The young are more prone to physical and mental problems and to the social harm caused by their own drinking and that of others.
The problems of alcohol use, however, do not just concern the young.
Alcohol plays a part in the majority of homicides, and it causes 17 000 needless deaths on the road a year.
In the 1970s 200 people died of cirrhosis of the liver every year in Finland: now it kills 1 000 people a year.
At European level we need to take urgent action to harmonise the tax on alcohol upwards.
I would like to urge the Commission to draft ambitious common targets for the Member States to reduce the dangerous and harmful consumption of alcohol.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European need not, may not and cannot regulate everything.
Member State subsidiarity and less bureaucracy are the slogans of the moment, which we keep repeating when we speak with members of the public.
The European Union's competence is constantly being questioned, but Europe should and indeed must be the motive force for development.
The Commission's right of initiative is a documented right.
Where no legislative instrument exists, it uses that right of initiative to focus on a thorny subject, draw Member States' attention to abuses and call for action.
That is the legal basis of this Commission proposal, and we must use it.
We must curb the adverse effects on health of risky and excessive alcohol consumption and its social and economic consequences.
A European strategy is to be formulated in order to support the Member States in their endeavour to reduce and prevent alcohol-related damage.
That includes research into its root causes, as has just been said.
It also includes, however, informing, instructing and raising awareness among the public; that is the crux of the matter, those are the key points.
Every individual is free to decide.
But individuals can use that freedom only if they are informed about the consequences and effects of their actions.
Upbringing and education are the key factors.
Upbringing within the family lays the foundations for a well-ordered and solid way of life, and we should put the focus on that, followed by schooling and advice.
The same applies to alcohol awareness.
I support Parliament's report, which improves the Commission document in many areas.
I am, however, resolutely opposed to the calls for health warnings.
There are clear rules on the labelling of alcohol.
The labels indicate the alcohol content.
Transposing and understanding what it says on the labels is the basic way to pass on information.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is general knowledge!
Everybody must be in a position to use that information for themselves in a responsible manner.
The same applies to most things in life: to eating and drinking just as to exercise, sport and fitness.
(BG) Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, it is a gratifying fact that the European Parliament is adopting this strategy as a timely and important measure.
The use of alcohol, which often turns into abuse, affects many people, including children and adolescents.
This is a threat which society still fails to recognize, probably due to information deficit.
The abuse of alcohol affects not only the individual health condition and reproductive health but it also damages healthcare systems, increases anti-social behaviour, leads to growing crime rates and drop-outs from school and, for this reason, to decline in the education rates.
Therefore we need public awareness, educational and preventive programmes to form a specific type of behaviour.
I find two key words in this report: risk and security.
For the purposes of achieving solidarity in the policy, the European Commission could discuss two important measures: to propose a targeted programme to be implemented by the Member States for a large-scale study of the impact of the use of alcohol and the impact of the awareness of this problem among citizens, and to establish a specialised fund for preventive programmes, where part of the revenues from advertising alcohol could be allocated.
(LT) The battle against the harmful effects of alcohol is as old as time.
The Dry Law and various prohibitions that were applied in some countries did not produce positive results.
However, the Commission Communication on an EU strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol related harm is a very important initiative.
The Commission, having generalised the experience of the Member States and identified the problems common to them all, has introduced the priorities for reducing alcohol-related harm.
It is believed that implementation of the important priorities introduced, such as the protection of young people, children and unborn babies, the prevention of drinking when driving and other restrictions will make our society more responsible, healthy and abstemious.
I wish to emphasise the huge risks faced by young people drinking alcohol.
It is sad, but the permissible age for drinking alcohol is getting lower and lower in many countries.
Good practice is therefore very important.
I would like to propose linking the practice of reducing alcohol related harm in young people to EU programmes for young people.
The development and implementation of such programmes would help to occupy their leisure time and help to protect them from malignant alcohol consumption.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I believe alcohol was dangerous in the past and alcohol is dangerous today.
In paragraph 5.4.1 of its proposal the Commission rightly states that moderate alcohol consumption appears to offer some protection against coronary heart disease among people over the age of 45, but I believe it is a myth, based on very weak scientific foundations, to say that a little alcohol is good for you.
Alcohol is dangerous.
It is a poison and even small quantities affect health.
Of course tolerance thresholds must be laid down.
We in the various European countries have learned how to handle the drug that is alcohol.
The British, for instance, seen in terms of consumer habits, are what is called binge drinkers.
Consumption per capita is relatively low, yet there are sometimes these excesses, which lead to serious damage.
We in Austria are so-called integrative drinkers.
We have a relatively high per capita alcohol consumption but fewer excesses.
There are, therefore, very wide national differences depending on national historical developments.
The Commission is taking the right approach to the problem.
It is saying that it will not relieve the Member States of their responsibility.
Yet there are European tasks that can be tackled together.
One example is the attempt to create a proper database.
The statistics vary widely.
It is a mistake to believe that we saw less alcohol-related damage in the past.
The diagnostic approach was different at the time, and there was less public awareness of the issue.
That is why I believe it is important for us in Europe to know what we are actually talking about.
It is also important to tackle new phenomena in consumption patterns.
One is the fact that growing numbers of young people begin to drink at a very early age, which causes very serious harm.
On the question of labelling in general, let me say that I think that falls short of what we need.
It would be wrong to believe that a phenomenon as complex as alcohol consumption can be resolved simply by putting a label on a bottle.
That would be an easy way of shirking our political responsibility.
(SV) Mr President, I welcome the strategy even though I think that it has been watered down.
At last there is a single document with targets which can hopefully only be developed.
The positive thing about the strategy is that it shows which methods work in reducing alcohol consumption and thus in reducing damage and tragedies caused by alcohol.
But if the methods proposed by the report are to be used fully in the Member States, the EU's legislation must be adapted.
First of all, import quotas must be reduced.
Each country's efforts to work with restrictive measures are undermined or made impossible when alcohol may in principle be freely imported from other countries.
In addition, minimum taxes should be raised on public health grounds.
I would also like to see health warnings introduced on alcohol just as on tobacco.
I would therefore urge you to vote against amendments that weaken the text.
(FI) Mr President, one of the most common proverbs in my country describes alcohol as the drink of the wise.
This is certainly not a message that alcohol would make anyone wise, but that it only suits those for whom a sense of occasion and moderation are familiar concepts.
I therefore have no problem agreeing when our Group's shadow rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, draws attention to a strategy for preventing the dangers associated with alcohol.
We need to start by recognising the various alcohol cultures that exist and finding effective solutions to real problems, i.e. abuse and underage drinking.
There is no need to stigmatise the products themselves or moderate consumption.
We therefore need cooperation on the part of different agencies and national solutions to local problems.
On one issue I nevertheless want to see EU action, and that is an upward adjustment of the taxation levels for alcohol across a broad front.
We need to acknowledge that the costs of alcohol abuse to public health are massive, and they will not be held in check unless we have common economic policy instruments.
In this respect my own country is an unfortunately good example.
EU membership compelled Finland to lower tax on alcohol, when the right to restrict imports of alcohol ended.
A recent study shows that the number of sudden alcohol-related deaths has clearly increased since the tax on alcohol was reduced in 2004 and consumption began to rise sharply.
The rise was 17% up on the figures for 2003, and that does not take account of the other consequences.
Our public health problems are so serious that we are once again compelled to raise taxes.
At one time I myself simply proposed disobedience on the part of individual Member States, which is to say restricting imports after the transition period had ended, on the grounds of Article 30 or 95 of the Treaty.
Nothing was done at the time, unfortunately, and now the whole nation is paying the price, a nation which is obviously not wise enough.
(SK) I was recently watching a television report about young people in Scandinavian countries who go on a boat trip on Friday evening to Estonia, for example.
Once there they buy two big cases of vodka and drink themselves into a stupor on their way back.
That said, similar and other variations on drinking to excess can be seen in all countries of the European Union.
There is no doubt that measures leading to lower alcohol consumption will have a positive impact on the health of the population, social conditions, accidents both at work and outside work, and traffic accidents.
I would like to focus on the damage done to health by excessive consumption of all types of alcoholic drinks.
It is necessary to keep pointing out, to young people in particular, that even regular consumption of beer leads to alcohol addiction that is no less serious than the alcohol addiction caused by wine or spirits.
It is terrible that people keep on frivolously underestimating the seriousness of liver disease, which can result often in cirrhosis and frequently in death.
Regular drinking gradually changes not only an individual's desires and character traits, but can also destroy one's family life, in addition to causing serious neurological changes on many occasions.
A young alcoholic loses his ability to strive for higher aims and ideals and his emotions become so numb that he finds it difficult to form healthy relationships or to have a healthy family environment.
Foetal alcohol syndrome seriously harms not only the mother but above all the child, causing developmental disabilities and malformations in new-born babies.
It is surprising how little attention is paid to informing pregnant women about this in many Member States.
Finally, the number of people who drive a car or a motorbike under the influence of alcohol is shocking.
I personally advocate the possibility of harmonisation right across the EU, where zero tolerance for blood alcohol levels in drivers should apply.
on behalf of ITS Group. - (RO) Mr President, dear colleagues, alcohol consumption is a habit transmitted from generation to generation.
In several countries there is a saying related to alcohol consumption, according to which it should be the exclusive concern of men.
There are not many approaches for reducing the harmful effects of the dangerous and noxious consumption on children and pregnant women.
Alcohol has more numerous and more various consumers than tobacco, traditional production techniques, meaning uncontrolled marketing methods and related risks.
In this case it is necessary that article 16 of the report encourage the approach of innovative means of disseminating information and awareness-raising related to alcohol consumption.
Instead, using warnings on the labels of alcohol products, similar to those for tobacco products, cannot be viewed an innovative approach since it has not proven adequately effective for tobacco.
It is necessary to carry out a European survey on the influence of this warning procedure for addicted consumers, regardless of their age, occupation and gender, but also for the internal market.
The European Parliament must put forward a resolution without any ambiguity, to give some time to draw up other information and awareness-raising methods so that it provides the Member States with an efficient framework for combating abusive alcohol consumption and promoting moderate and responsible alcohol consumption.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should also like to thank all the Members for a very interesting debate.
I would like to tell you a story from Greek mythology.
You can find this story depicted in mosaics in Pathos in Cyprus.
It is the story of the first wine drinkers.
A servant of the god Dionysus stole wine to give it to humans for the first time.
They drank it, got drunk for the first time in human history, thought they were poisoned and killed the servant who had given them the wine.
In this day and age the solutions are much more complicated, and we must come up with a different approach.
Everyone has chosen a different approach.
Some say that we have gone too far, others that we have not gone far enough.
Some would have wanted us to legislate on everything, others that everything should be done by the Member States.
The fact is that the solution lies somewhere in the middle.
We are to complement Member States and support them in their policies, but that does not mean that there is no role for the European Union, as was reflected in the report and what Members have said.
At the same time, not everything can be solved through legislation.
We must, therefore, give the forum a chance to work and produce concrete results, which we will monitor.
However, at the same time, as has already been said, legislation exists in the Member States on many of these aspects.
It is implementation that is lacking and causing the problem.
Therefore, putting pressure on the Member States will help us to achieve positive results.
No matter what each side expected, we should not underestimate the importance of the fact that, for the first time, we have acknowledged at European level that there is a problem regarding alcohol-related harm, that there should be a European strategy - which has been adopted today - and that we now have a European debate, a European initiative and European action.
This is important.
No Member State can solve this problem in isolation and no Member State is immune from this problem.
There is now binge-drinking in Spain, which used to be a north-western European problem.
Therefore, one sees that, given cultural interchanges and other reasons - a social analyst could explain why this is happening - we have the same problems moving across borders, and there are no geographical barriers to such problems.
They exist everywhere in the European Union.
This is the first important step, though not the last one.
If we do not see a result within a reasonable time then we can re-evaluate, reassess and re-examine this strategy and take a different approach or a different course.
However, we are on the right track for now.
Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur, the committee and the Members for supporting this strategy.
I look forward to working with you to achieve the results that we all desire.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) The excessive consumption of alcohol is a blight in European societies.
We are losing innumerable lives to illnesses caused by alcohol consumption, and the number of victims of drink-driving is also extraordinarily high in the Member States.
Alcohol consumption and habits vary from country to country and indeed from region to region and so it is proper that defensive strategies are created in the Member States.
There is still a need for individual EU directives.
Minors have to be protected in every possible way from alcohol, and to achieve this even more stringent sanctions are needed.
In the spirit of 'don't drink and drive', zero tolerance and a 0.00% blood alcohol level must be introduced for drivers throughout the entire EU.
But we will not make progress with prohibitions alone, as is so well demonstrated by the ignominious failure of the American Prohibition.
We must popularise good habits in alcohol consumption and the consumption of low-alcohol beer and wine.
We must act robustly against the trade in types of alcohol that are adulterated, fake, of poor quality and harmful to health.
in writing. - It is a worrying trend that in recent years alcohol manufacturers are targeting under-age drinkers with products such as 'alcopops'.
Binge drinking is increasing amongst young people and it is important that we tackle this development effectively.
I believe that a good way to do this is to encourage supermarkets and shops to better separate alcopops from soft drinks.
Alcopops, along with other alcohol drinks, should also carry adequate health warnings.
I am pleased that my amendments along these lines were incorporated into the report.
Of course, to tackle under-age and binge drinking effectively, national governments must also focus on the consumer through changing attitudes towards alcohol.
I therefore welcome the focus on information and awareness-raising campaigns such as through school-based educational programmes.
I also support the recommendations that the limit for blood alcohol content (BAC) should be set as close to 0.00% as possible, especially for new drivers.
I believe that the widespread availability of breath analysers, suggested in the report, can help to deter potential drink drivers.
National governments can do more to ensure the availability of public transportation for drivers who have consumed alcohol.
Dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption - Common organisation of the milk and milk products market - Additional rules on the common organisation of the milk and milk products markets (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Elisabeth Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2001/114/EC relating to certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption - C6-0083/2007 -,
the report by Elisabeth Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products - C6-0084/2007 -, and
the report by Elisabeth Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2597/97 laying down additional rules on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products for drinking milk - C6-0085/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by thanking Parliament, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in particular the rapporteur, Ms Jeggle, for this constructive report on the milk mini-package.
The package provides amendments for three legal acts.
The first concerns the Directive on preserved milk, in which we now allow standardisation of the protein content, totally in line with the Codex standards.
This meets a longstanding request from our dairy industry and exporters of milk powder, and their position vis-Ã -vis their competitors in third countries will clearly improve.
Not only industry and trade, but also milk producers - our farmers - stand to benefit because this standardisation of protein can yield a higher valorisation of the milk.
Furthermore, the forecasted strong demand for proteins will easily absorb the increase in the available quantities of proteins.
I welcome your full support for this proposal.
The second proposal concerns the common market organisation for milk and for milk products.
Here we propose a whole series of adaptations on which the European Parliament has expressed its full support.
These include the proposal to reduce the intervention price for skimmed milk powder as a mathematical result of lower protein content owing to standardisation.
It contains an elimination of the price-trigger system per Member State in the butter intervention system.
It also contains the abolition of the national quantities for butter as an eligible criterion for aid, removal of the obsolete aid for military forces and abandoning the compulsory use of import licences.
Your amendment for maintaining the private storage of cream and skimmed milk powder is a little surprising because these schemes have never been used in practice and can be considered obsolete.
Furthermore, private storage for butter is maintained, so there is really no need to maintain the scheme for cream.
Concerning your amendments on the school-milk scheme, we are on the same wavelength.
As we have proposed, the system will be simplified by introducing one single rate of aid.
DG AGRI was already exploring the different possibilities of reviewing the school-milk scheme and had invited Member States to provide suggestions for trying to improve the system, as well as for additional products to be covered by the scheme.
The resulting changes in the system will soon be presented in the Milk Management Committee.
I hope that an agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission can be found on the increased aid level for school milk, up EUR 18.15 per 100 kilograms.
Concerning your amendment that would introduce a milk fund to finance a restructuring programme, I would underline that the proposals contained in the milk mini-package are really not of a restructuring nature.
I therefore have great difficulty in correlating these basic technical and simplification measures with a perceived need to establish a new 'milk fund' budget line.
Discussions on the need for appropriate measures for the milk sector should take place in view of the upcoming health check discussions and the various discussions we will have on the future of the common agricultural policy.
The third act concerns liberalisation of the drinking-milk market, where I note that we are also on the same wavelength.
The suggestion to delete the 0.2% tolerance for the fat contents seems to be acceptable.
You also propose that a reference be made to Directive 2000/13/EC.
Please be informed that this Directive automatically applies.
So, all in all, I note with pleasure that our views are in line with one another.
Thank you for all your work.
I look forward to our continuing discussion tonight.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is talking about the good and stable market situation for milk and milk products at the moment and the resulting rise in milk prices.
The rise in milk prices urgently needed by farmers is providing new fuel for the much-disputed question of quotas.
Today I want to discuss the mini milk package and begin by taking the opportunity to thank the Commissioner and her colleagues for the good cooperation.
They have presented three good and well-thought through proposals and Parliament is, therefore, not tabling many amendments.
I do believe, however, that our draft amendments provide some food for thought and I hope the Commission and the Council will endorse them in the same way as the Committee on Agriculture.
The first report submitted by the Commission contains amendments to the Council directive relating to certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption.
In this report, the Commission proposes standardising the protein content at a minimum of 34%, expressed in fat-free dry matter.
That standardisation will make it possible for European manufacturers to compete with manufacturers in third countries under the same conditions.
This simplification of international trade is welcome and is one reason why the Committee on Agriculture adopted this report without amendments and with only one vote against.
Such standardisation saves money, which is why in the second report I proposed a milk fund programme to ensure that the milk sector could retain any saved money.
The Commission proposal amending the regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products provides for several important technical adjustments, which will clearly also lead to improvements.
Firstly, it will reduce the intervention price for skimmed milk powder by an average of 2.8%.
By removing the intervention trigger for butter, abolishing national quality classes for butter, introducing a standard quality definition, removing disposal aid for military forces and abandoning the compulsory use of import licences, we are reducing the red tape.
I am, however, quite definitely against abolishing private storage for cream and skimmed milk powder.
It represents a safety net and I believe we should discuss this in the context of the Health Check and not of the mini milk package.
Aside from that, the proposal to introduce a single rate of aid for school milk is no doubt right.
Given the nutritional importance of school milk, however, the aid for products falling within that regulation should be increased substantially, from EUR 16.11 per 100 kg to EUR 18.15 per 100 kg.
It is also urgently necessary to broaden the range of products.
Some fantastic new milk, quark and yoghurt products are now available, which can cater for everyone's tastes and likes, and if we introduced innovative school programmes we could whet children's curiosity about those products while also doing something for nutrition.
The potential EUR 117.3 million in savings resulting from the standardisation of protein for the period 2008-2013, or possible further savings within the milk market organisation, should be used to accompany and support milk sector reform.
I would be quite prepared to discuss that too in the context of the Health Check debate.
This measure is intended to facilitate our proposed milk fund programme.
The resources could be used, in the context of promoting milk sector sales, for better nutritional information and also for further accompanying measures such as modernising milk production, in areas where conditions are more difficult and in mountainous regions.
The committee unanimously adopted this second report.
The third report concerns drinking milk.
It proposes increased flexibility in the definition of drinking milk.
The current regulation recognises three categories of drinking milk that can be produced and marketed in the Community.
These are skimmed milk (maximum 0.5% fat), semi-skimmed milk (1.5% to 1.8% fat) and whole milk (at least 3.5% fat).
The Commission's proposal to allow the production and marketing of drinking milk that does not comply with those three categories, as long as a clear and easily readable indication of the fat content is given on the label, is right.
This liberalisation measure will not only mean that transitional national derogations can be removed but also broadens the consumers' options, which could certainly help revive intra-Community trade.
To avoid any uncertainty, the fat content percentage of the milk should be clearly visible on the packaging and directly linked to the product description.
Yet I think it is unnecessary to set a tolerance margin of +/-0.2% when indicating the fat content, since that would not improve clarity but be more likely to hinder implementation.
These two draft amendments, like this third report, were also adopted unanimously in committee.
Given the clear position taken by the Committee on Agriculture, I am confident that the entire mini milk package will be endorsed by a clear majority during tomorrow's plenary vote too.
I cannot, however, accept the ALDE Group's three draft amendments.
They do not substantially improve the report.
The third draft amendment refers only to school milk, which would go against what we want, namely to improve supply of the entire range of products.
That is why I must, unfortunately, reject that draft amendment too.
I extend warm thanks to all colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and in the Group.
I thank them for their trust and for the good working relationship.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Jeggle on her three reports - the mini-milk package.
It was very clear right from the start that there was general agreement on her reports, and that was demonstrated by the Commissioner.
Members asked for this debate so that they could discuss the wider issues affecting Europe's dairy industry, and I will be no exception to that.
Until very recently, dairy farms were the Cinderella sector of the UK farming industry.
Thanks to murky economic practices, which allow supermarkets to squeeze down the price of milk to 17p per litre while they sell it on to the public at 50p a litre, many of our dairy farmers were going out of business.
It is worth remembering that even at 50p per litre, milk is still half the price of bottled water in our supermarkets, and you do not have to calve a bottle of water or send for the vet to attend to its needs.
Until quite recently, of the 27 EU Member States, only Slovakia, Estonia, Hungary and Lithuania had lower milk prices than the UK, and the result has been that in the last five years in my constituency in Scotland we have lost around 500 dairy farmers.
There are now an estimated 1 400 dairy farms left in Scotland - that is all.
It is estimated that across the UK one dairy farmer is leaving the industry every day.
It is only now as world cereal prices - in particular wheat - have almost doubled, forcing up the price of feed, and as pressure on productive farmland grows for biofuels and other non-food crops, that some supermarkets have finally begun to panic at the prospect of an actual milk shortage and, as a result, have started paying dairy farmers a slightly higher price.
At long last, dairy farmers have begun to see some light at the end of the tunnel and they are at least getting more than the cost of production for their commodity.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would also first like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work which has allowed us at all times to feel comfortable with her proposals.
I would also like to thank her especially for allowing the oral amendment I tabled on the school-milk scheme.
Having said that, what I would like to do is reiterate my criticism on moving this mini-reform forward when major reform of the COM is anticipated next year and November will see a CAP 'Health Check', and as yet, Commissioner, we obviously do not know whether this will have any consequences for the sector.
But today, Commissioner, reality, and Mr Stevenson explained this, is taking us in other directions.
The price crisis in agricultural produce has resurrected the debate on the issue of agricultural food production in Europe.
My assessment of the milk crisis differs from yours.
In my opinion, the main cause of the rise in milk prices lies not in increased consumption in Asia but in low Community productivity.
Indeed, yield last season was the lowest of the last 15 years.
Some organisations say that Europe is likely to need an extra thousand million litres per year to satisfy its needs.
Certainly, today, consumers are overwhelmed by the increase in prices of basic foods and farmers in turn by the price of cattle feed.
Although like you I am of the view that producing biofuels is neither the ultimate nor the main cause of the rise in prices, we should not be fooled, there are others.
Neither a fall in set-aside nor a reduction in fallow land will be enough to stabilise prices.
The Commission should be very alert to other types of current speculation, such as the speculation on the stock markets.
Large groups will easily be able to pass the increase in prices of raw materials on to the consumer, in fact they are doing this already, but this will be much more difficult for local producers to do, and therefore the rise will penalise the more fragile SMEs most of all.
Indeed, as Mr Stevenson has just said, the increase is not being reflected in the price charged by farmers; they blame the gap between the price paid to them and the price paid by the consumer on a Common Agricultural Policy based on promoting set-aside.
That being the case, Commissioner, I would advise you not to come here and tell us that quota removal will be implemented gradually.
Low morale among farmers who feel insecure about the future of something which they viewed as their own, as a capital asset, namely the quota, whose forthcoming removal has been announced, is one of the barriers to relaunching milk production in Europe; the same was true in its day of the sharp drop in milk prices which led to many producers moving to more profitable, but less labour-intensive crops; those producers will no longer be able to benefit from the price rise.
The arduous job of the dairy farmer is compounded by difficulties in obtaining a quota, difficulties in obtaining cattle...
Were you aware, Commissioner that at present European dairy-farmers are having to go to countries like Canada or the United States to buy dairy cows because they cannot find cattle to buy in the Community market?
In view of all this, Commissioner, I would ask you to react, and I am sure you will, appropriately to these new circumstances, circumstances that were unthinkable only twelve months ago and whose consequences for the agricultural food production sector we should begin to debate.
In my opinion we should not merely hope, as I have read in your blog, that the competitiveness of European farmers in world markets will not be too badly affected, but react rapidly to prevent that from becoming the case.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, first I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, for her excellent reports.
Milk is one of the most important areas of agricultural production.
It is all the more important as beef production is largely dependent on the calves which dairy cattle farms produce.
Milk production is also eminently suited to areas where natural conditions are poorest.
For example, dairy farming in northern Europe can effectively exploit the fact that the arable land there is an excellent source of coarse fodder, which also makes production resistant to rain, frost and other unfavourable natural conditions.
The proposals before us will simplify EU laws on the dairy industry.
The quality class system for butter would be simplified, the strict classification for fat content abolished, aid for school milk made independent of its fat content and the intervention system clarified.
These measures seem positive ones and I want to thank Commissioner Fischer Boel for these reforms.
The big question is the overall reform of the milk sector, which is to take place in the near future in connection with the Health Check, the mid-term review of the CAP.
Its main focus is milk quotas.
The current balance in milk production has been achieved thanks to milk quotas.
It is because of these that the 1 300 million kilo butter mountain, which we still had at the end of the 1980s, has melted away and at the same time it has been possible to guarantee consumers a steady supply and diverse range of agricultural produce.
A predictable framework within which milk producers can develop production has also been established.
In my opinion, it is the EU's obligation to guarantee such predictable frameworks for milk production in the future too.
This is important because the necessary investments are made to cover periods of time lasting decades and they are massive sums for family farms.
Furthermore, the regulation of production is a slow process because it takes around two years before cows are ready for production.
That is why it is in the interests of both the consumer and producer to continue with milk quotas.
If the quotas are abolished it will mean the investments that farmers have made buying quotas and thereby stabilising production conditions will have gone to waste.
With these observations, we would like to support the reports presented.
on behalf of the UEN group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, in taking the floor in this debate, I would like to draw attention to the following issues: first of all, I would like to support the rapporteur's proposal that the savings made as a result of this reform, i.e. the sum of EUR 117 million, could be used to create a milk fund.
Secondly, this fund should be allocated primarily to those milk producers and processors who, as a result of the increasing market liberalisation, have to carry out restructuring at their farms or companies, and also to promote the consumption of milk and milk products, and, particularly, to increase financial support for supplying milk and milk products to schools.
Thirdly, the Commission's proposal concerning abandoning the three categories of milk that have been marketed to date, i.e. skimmed, semi-skimmed and full cream, also deserves to be supported.
As a result it will be possible to market milk with any fat content, provided that this is marked clearly on the packaging.
While supporting the solutions contained in the reports prepared by Mrs Jeggle, I would however like to remind Commissioner Fischer Boel that a serious debate is needed on the subject of the amounts and the future of the milk production quotas that are in force in the European Union, since these are glaringly unjust, especially for the new Member States.
Commissioner, you promised us this debate when responding to my question on this matter, which was addressed to the Commission in October 2006.
A country such as Poland, with 38 million inhabitants, has a quota of about 9 million tonnes, giving 0.23 tonnes per inhabitant, whereas this amount is 0.33 tonnes in Germany, 0.39 tonnes in France and as much as 0.67 tons in the Netherlands.
Poland, which even now has excellent possibilities for developing milk production, just three years after joining the EU, is already very close to the maximum limit and cannot develop it further.
This has a very negative effect on the profitability of farms that have specialised in milk production.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I shall be no exception in this debate in offering my group's congratulations to the rapporteur for an excellent piece of work which has achieved the fairly unusual feat of keeping everyone pretty well happy.
I would also praise the Commission for acting on this ahead of the health check, because this is a good piece of work which is long overdue.
I shall summarise our own view on the initial comments here from the National Farmers' Union of Scotland briefing.
The proposed changes do not necessarily have a direct impact on farmers, but they will lead to simplification, cost savings and efficiencies further up the chain, all of which will improve dairy sector competitiveness and as such should lead to an indirect benefit to farmers through the marketplace.
In my view, the simplification of the school milk regime is particularly to be welcomed.
What better way to fulfil so many agricultural, economic and health aims than by encouraging the drinking of milk and milk products by Europe's children?
Making the system more logical is, if we are honest, long overdue.
In praising this package I must agree with my Scottish - if not political - colleague, Mr Stevenson, in pointing to the elephant in the room that is the poor prices that farmers still have to endure, because the supply chain is beyond breaking point and too many of those involved in the market are abusing their position.
We in the Commission and Parliament here tonight have done our part by making the system simpler.
We could just as well ask why it was so complicated in the first place, but we have done our job tonight.
Now national and EU competition authorities must intervene forcefully on the side of farmers who, because of de facto abuses of dominant positions in the market by supermarkets in particular, are continuing to receive a pittance for their quality products.
As the Commissioner says, the health check is a good opportunity, because until the EU takes action to tackle that elephant in the room, all the good efforts like this package will continue to be overshadowed and lose out in the noise.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Generally speaking, we agree with Mrs Jeggle's proposals in the three reports she has presented, notably the proposal to use the budgetary savings to set up a restructuring programme which could be used for marketing support and nutrition information on quantities of milk and milk products.
Similarly, we think it is important to strengthen the scope and quality of the school milk scheme by extending the range of products that can be included in the scheme, operating as a genuine programme to encourage consumption of milk and milk products, more in line with the tastes of children and young people and paying due attention to nutrition and balanced diet.
We also agree that there should be very clear rules on labelling drinking milk, as it seems to us quite right that the fat content should be included in the so-called 'product description'.
Lastly, a note on the times we live in, when milk production is failing to meet current demand because of the need to support less prosperous farmers and milk producers and increase milk subsidies in the areas most in need, notably in Portugal, bearing in mind that in the islands in the Autonomous Region of the Azores, for example, milk production could be increased without expanding the stock density and that this is an extremely remote region where the conditions for milk production are excellent.
(SK) In the context of the dairy 'mini-reform' being debated, I would like to put special emphasis on the need to adopt at this sitting Amendments 5 and 7 to the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk.
Amendment 5 provides for a single rate of aid of EUR 18.15/100 kg of all milk in the school milk scheme.
There is no doubt that by increasing the aid and simplifying the regime we will help to achieve the goals of ensuring healthy eating and combating obesity among young people.
Amendment 7 sets out the main objectives of the milk fund restructuring programme.
The objectives of this programme, such as strengthening nutrition awareness measures and increasing milk consumption, as well as modernising milk production for example in mountain regions, are an incentive for the new Member States in particular.
After all, in recent years many new Member States have seen an incredible reduction in milk production and in the number of cattle of more than 50%.
Unfortunately, milk consumption has fallen as a result, to below the amounts recommended by doctors, particularly among children.
By approving these three texts the European Parliament can help to achieve a balance between the consumption and production of milk in all countries of the European Union.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join the rapporteur in extending thanks, for I think the overwhelming endorsement in committee is enough to show what good work has been done here.
The mini milk package is an important step not just for European farming and the milk sector, but above all for promoting the use of milk in nutrition.
Balanced nutrition is especially important for children, and here milk and milk products have a major part to play.
The healthy development of our children is determined by the supply of healthy foods, such as local milk products.
That is why it is most important to promote milk and all the various milk products, from yoghurts to soft drinks and low-fat products, which children and schoolchildren love so much.
One reason why it is important to promote sales of milk and milk products is that it is becoming increasingly clear that unhealthy eating is leading to a growing number of health problems among Europeans too.
The advertising budget contained in the mini milk package will increase people's awareness, which will in turn benefit the population as a whole.
It is vital to ensure that the savings resulting from the reform remain within the milk sector.
In conclusion, let me say that direct production prices for farmers are finally rising, although this is certainly not due to the fact that we are now producing bio-energy but is mainly the result of environmental disasters and better markets within the EU and outside it, i.e. in third countries.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her excellent work.
I particularly support her objections to the abolition of private storage aid for cream and skimmed milk powder and the wish to introduce a single rate of aid for milk distributed in schools.
However, along with some of my colleagues, I should like in particular to mention the current milk shortage, which is undoubtedly due not just to an increase in worldwide demand but also to a reduction in supply which could have been anticipated because it was, in my view, foreseeable.
Due to the reform of the CAP and the fall in the price paid to milk producers, some farmers, such as those in France, have got rid of some of their dairy cows and are focusing more on beef and veal or, in Germany for instance, have given up rearing cattle altogether and are growing cereals instead.
As a result, France has 100 000 fewer dairy cows than it needs to fill its quota and the European Union needs one billion litres of milk to meet European demand.
That shortage is already having and will continue to have serious effects on the prices of milk and hence milk products, as well as on the prices of various other food products.
In addition to those increases, the price of other basic foodstuffs such as cereals and meat will rise as a result of the rising prices of animal feed.
Obviously that is going to cause extra difficulties for consumers.
It therefore seems to me necessary to introduce price stabilisation instruments.
In particular, there is a need to build up further stocks as soon as possible to make the market more secure; increase the milk price paid to producers to encourage them to continue and increase production and help them cope with the rise in animal feed prices; provide more support for marketing and distribution channels; increase European milk production quotas as quickly as possible; and evaluate the CMO for milk in the 2008 review of the CAP, in the light of the current shortage and before any consideration is given to abolishing milk quotas in 2015.
Finally, I should like to draw attention to the even more difficult situation of milk producers in mountain areas, the producers I represent. Their production costs are higher and supplies are more difficult.
What is more, in some countries such as France they are faced with a reduction in the collection aid that offset part of the extra cost of collection in mountain areas.
Milk production is one of the sectors that make the biggest contribution to land conservation and land use planning, especially in problem areas.
I hope, therefore, that proper consideration will be given to the specific problems of the mountain areas in any future debates on the CAP review and the new CAP.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, 'milk is good for you' and today everyone is talking about it.
Milk is the oldest energy drink in the world, it is a particularly important product, and it is good that we are debating it today.
What we call the mini milk package, made up of three documents, is only one, albeit very important, building block in the further simplification of EU legislation in agriculture, and in principle the Commission's reform and simplification measures in this connection are most welcome.
As we know, reforming the Common Agricultural Policy is a long-term, continuous process and the proposed mini milk package is a step in the right reform direction.
Rome was not built in a day, however.
The Commissioner knows that better than anyone.
I would like to address an important political aspect that some colleagues have already discussed: school milk.
Here the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has called for an increase from EUR 16.11 to EUR 18.11 per 100 kg.
That is a sensible correction and we were right to call for it.
Perhaps we could now seriously consider a school fruit programme, which would probably also please the Commissioner's colleague, Mr Kyprianou.
I also welcome the standardisation of the protein content of milk and milk production because it allows European producers to enter into fair competition with their third-country competitors, given that competition is a basic liberal concern.
At the same time it is right, important and also urgently necessary for milk producers and dairies to pool their resources even more, so that it becomes even easier for them to assert their interests on the market.
A good deal of work on the ground is still required here too.
Let me put forward an idea from the consumers' point of view, and looking towards the future.
The demand for milk has risen worldwide.
It is particularly clear that living and eating habits are changing in Asia as a whole, i.e. demand is rising and prices are rising.
It is a pity that the higher prices are attributable above all to trade.
Yet we must also be honest with our citizens.
To some extent the higher prices tell the environmental truth.
For instance, it is not comprehensible that a litre of milk now costs less than a litre of water.
Butter is cheaper now than it was 20 years ago.
We certainly must tell the citizens that there are of course also some improvements.
The money should remain in the sector, however, and not go to trade.
A word on the quota.
Evidently we will still have the quota for some time.
That has been debated here and the reasons for having that quota have been given.
Yet the current milk quota must expire in March 2015, and not just for German farmers who could then profit from the rising global demand for milk and products.
What the Commissioner said when she was thinking out loud of considering actually raising the quota could be taken to mean it needs removing.
We should be honest here and call for its removal.
I thank Mrs Jeggle for what was, on the whole, a very good report.
I wish the Commissioner all the best on the way to further reforms of the agricultural policy.
(PL) Mr President, the proposed changes to the milk market and the creation of a milk fund are meant to provide support to farmers and consumers, not to damage the existing situation.
There is no doubt that provision must be made for exceptional circumstances and a legal basis guaranteed for the storage of milk products in different conditions.
A particularly important part of the battle for healthy food is to provide support for agricultural production in mountainous areas.
Good quality milk is produced there because of the relatively low levels of pollution.
It is equally important to give the public accurate information about the product, i.e. milk, as well as about the country and producer responsible for its manufacture.
This should include information that genetically modified plants were or were not used during its production.
This is particularly important when giving milk to children.
Finally I would like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her excellent report.
Mr President, there are three points in the report on the common organisation of the market in milk which I strongly support.
One: private storage of cream and skimmed milk powder should not be abolished, but retained as a safety net in the volatile world of milk production.
Two: the school milk scheme is of critical importance, not least in the fight against obesity, and it should be widened to include new and healthy dairy products.
Three: a milk fund restructuring programme should be set up for the purpose of retaining for the milk sector savings resulting from the implementation of the mini-milk package, with such a fund being used for marketing support and nutrition awareness.
Though, at present, the outlook on milk is more optimistic, we need to be sure that no steps are taken that would remove the current safety nets or fail to expand the vision for milk.
Nor should savings made be lost to the industry and its promotion.
(NL) Mr President, this late in the day, when only our dogged spokesmen on agriculture and the agriculture Commissioner are still with us - for which my thanks, Commissioner - milk may not be the most obvious refreshment we are thirsty for, especially after the previous debate.
But we must not forget that we are talking here about one of the giants of European agricultural production.
Every Member State of the EU is a dairy producer and dairy accounts for no less than 14% of Europe's agricultural output.
Notwithstanding its relatively modest share of the farm budget, it must be said.
The dairy sector also offers us quality products and a choice of regional specialities.
General De Gaulle made a connection between this great diversity of products and his country's governability.
'How can you govern a country which has 246 kinds of cheese?' he asked rhetorically.
What this French observation might mean for a European Union of 27 Member States and no doubt thousands of kinds of cheese, well, we won't go into that this evening.
We must not forget the contribution which dairy farmers make to our countryside.
A sector to be proud of, then, but one which has not had an easy time of it in recent years.
It is tempting, in the light of those difficult years and present-day market developments, to dwell on questions which go beyond the scope of this debate.
I shall be the exception to the rule and will not do that, though most Members have given in to the temptation.
I will merely echo Struan Stevenson, who quite properly asks how much of the price rise actually feeds through to the farmers.
Back then to the subject of our debate: Mrs Jeggle's most excellent reports.
I specifically want to address the call to widen the school milk scheme.
The link between fat percentage and support has rightly been scrapped, so to me it makes sense, in widening the scheme, to think above all about innovative and healthy products, especially in view of Europe's growing obesity problem.
The Commissioner has already said that she is having talks on this with the Member States, but maybe she can tell us when we can expect concrete proposals on the subject and consequently when this package is actually likely to be expanded.
Lastly, I agree with the rapporteur that it is too soon to do away with existing safety nets altogether, even if they are not currently used, but that this too is a matter for the Health Check.
'To be continued', is the message, then.
(HU) I warmly compliment Mrs Jeggle on her outstanding work and would also like to welcome the Commission's mini milk package.
In the new Member States it has so far been possible to deviate from the EU regulations on fat content, due to the hard-won derogations, but it is good news that after 2009 we will still be able to consume the milk products to which we are well accustomed.
With the anticipated intensification of trade between the Member States as a result of liberalisation, we have to be ever more alert to the issue of food safety.
I would like to draw the Commissioner's attention to the fact that food safety poses an ever greater problem throughout the whole of Europe, and one which is particularly pertinent to the new Member States.
I support the proposal adopted by the Committee on Agriculture that the budget savings from standardisation must remain within the milk sector.
This money must be devoted to two aims.
One is the reorganisation of the milk support and the other is the school milk programme which is an excellent initiative by the Commission.
The programme is one of the fundamental elements of healthy nutrition in the fight against obesity and weight gain.
Support for this programme must be increased.
I would like to point out to Mr Chatzimarkakis that he is knocking at an open door, since eighteen months ago I proposed a school fruit programme which Mrs Fischer Boel accepted to such an extent that it now forms part of the already completed fruit and vegetable reform.
The school milk programme and the school fruit programme complement each other very well.
Many people have mentioned the quota system.
It is both evident and to be feared that the Commission will scrap it but nonetheless I would ask that what happened with the maize intervention should not be repeated.
Let there be a 'soft landing', let there be a preparatory period for the milk producers.
I am afraid that the increase in the national quota and the abolition of fines will lead to the devaluation of quotas in the years that follow.
(PL) Mr President, the common organisation of the market for milk and milk products is an important issue both for individual Member States and for the entire European Union.
We are all agreed that it requires certain changes, but these should be based on the results of thorough research, and not on industry or trade lobbying.
We must remember that our objective should always be the good of humanity and in this case that of consumers, who have the right to expect us to protect their interests.
In this context the proposal from the European Commission to abolish the tolerance of plus or minus 0.2% for the fat content in milk for human consumption in relation to the value given on the packaging is unacceptable.
