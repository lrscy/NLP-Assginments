Subject: Work of the European Group on Ethics
Will the Commission guarantee that in the new Action Plan on life sciences, the ethical implications of biotechnology and genetic research will remain under consideration without delaying potentially beneficial technologies such as genetic testing and pharmacogenomics and if so, how?
Mr President, Mr Whitehead, the Commission has indeed acknowledged, in the action plan on life sciences and biotechnology published on 23 January 2002, that this area requires us to take into account both ethical and economic, even industrial considerations.
The Commission is convinced that we can and must reconcile these two dimensions, including in the area of genetic and pharmacogenomic testing.
In practice, this involves, first and foremost, identifying and analysing the ethical, legal and social implications as early as possible in the development phases and before the technologies are widely applied.
It is important to encourage ethics experts, lawyers and sociologists to work closely with scientists and manufacturers, in order to encourage their mutual education and a dialogue involving the main players, including patients, political decision-makers and the public in the widest sense.
These initiatives will be included in the objectives of the Sixth Framework Programme for research, particularly under the first priority thematic area of 'Genomics and biotechnology for health'.
Secondly, we wish to continue to stimulate research into ethics in order to increase knowledge and further understanding of the various approaches at European level.
Thirdly, we want to develop a legal and regulatory framework for biotechnology, concerning, in particular, genetic tests, which is based on a broad social consensus which can only be achieved through open, two-way communication.
I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he will personally be involved in the drawing up and implementation of the work plan which is being produced by the European Group on Ethics?
If he is, will he take into account the fact that these debates involve matters of urgency as well as fundamental principle?
Mr Whitehead, I would ask you to repeat the last part of your question, which was not very clear.
Does the Commissioner acknowledge that there are questions of urgency in some of the research involved, as well as the fundamental debate on first principles and that this should not be an area in which there is unnecessary filibustering by any ethical committee or group?
We of course want these questions to be the subject of a broad debate.
These are problems for society.
However, I do not believe that this debate will delay the adoption of a framework programme for research, which is much wider.
We must not focus the problems on this aspect alone.
On the basis of the discussions on the last two questions and the fact we are approving the research programme tomorrow - hopefully - I would like to ask the Commissioner a direct question.
It is quite clear that the Group on Ethics is going to be increasingly important, so are you not a little concerned that there is no clear work plan for it?
Are you not a little concerned that there is no chairman at the moment?
And can you guarantee us personally, that you are going to ensure that the questions that myself and other colleagues wanted to ask you today about the work of this group and the appointment of a new chairman are going to be answered quickly and correctly, in an open and transparent way?
I hope that you can give us some quick and clear promises about this because we are very concerned that this is done quickly.
Mr Bowe, as far as the science/society aspect of the new framework programme is concerned, we have drawn up an action plan which is designed to establish contacts and widen the debate with the citizens on these issues. This aspect is particularly important to Parliament, which is illustrated, for example, by the fact that it has allocated a more substantial budget for science/society problems.
Ethical questions occupy an important place in the science/society action plan.
In the next framework programme, we must clearly increase the financial resources at European level in order to launch a dialogue that is as useful as possible on these issues.
Since you, Commissioner, will evidently be using the European Group on Ethics as an instrument for conducting the framework programme on research, can you let us know to what extent you will inform Parliament about the advice given to you by that group, about the composition of the group and indeed the discussions that you have with the group and with its Chair - when that person arrives?
Mrs McNally, as you know, the European Group on Ethics was set up some years ago now.
It was chaired by Mrs Lenoir and acquired, I believe, a certain reputation, a reputation as a result of its opinions. These are moderate opinions, which are generally accepted and are, of course, communicated to Parliament.
I believe that you had invited Mrs Lenoir to come before the House.
I now understand that Mrs Lenoir has resigned from her position as chair for personal reasons, meaning that the European Group on Ethics, whose members had recently been appointed, will have to elect a new president, most likely in the next few months.
Whatever happens, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is following events closely.
I believe that, up to now, the ethics group issued opinions - which were, of course, only opinions - and these were prepared in a pluralist manner. In other words, scientists, lawyers and sociologists all contributed - and it is important that this is the case for contributions to an open debate on these issues, which are, of course, fundamental but also delicate.
The European Group on Ethics has so far produced some extremely valuable work and I hope that it will continue to do so in the future.
Thank you, Mr Busquin.
Questions to Commissioner Verheugen
Question No 35 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0264/02):
Subject: Protection of Roma from racial discrimination in Europe
A Council of Europe report entitled 'Extremist Threats to Democracy' reveals that there has been a surge in racist attacks on Roma in many of the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe.
The report goes on to express fears that Roma are also subjected to discrimination of a clearly xenophobic and racist nature in the Member States, for which political forces participating in the governments of those States are partly responsible.
Since this report reaches different conclusions from the optimistic reports produced by EU observers on the applicant countries' progress towards accession, will the Commission say what measures the applicant countries are taking to ensure a high level of protection for Roma from racial and ethnic discrimination?
Will the Commission also provide information on the situation in the Member States?
Mr President, Mr Papayannakis, there is no doubt that discrimination against Roma is still prevalent in many candidate countries and that living conditions for Roma are still very difficult.
The Commission has repeatedly mentioned this and other deficiencies in its regular reports.
Further efforts are needed, combined with appropriate financial support, to ensure that the various programmes are implemented in the candidate countries in a lasting way.
I do not therefore share Mr Papayannakis's opinion that the Commission's conclusions in this area are too optimistic.
I would be very happy to make the relevant extracts from the Commission's statements and reports available to you again.
The Commission has constantly touched on this subject in the pre-accession strategy, and also regularly monitors developments.
However, the issue of discrimination against Roma is a long-standing one of a very complex nature and we have to accept that extensive improvements will only be possible in the medium and long term.
The Commission has demanded that all candidate countries with a significant Roma population should implement national action plans to combat discrimination, and that has indeed taken place.
Various EU programmes have made an important contribution towards this.
However, I also have to make it very clear that our political message to the candidate countries is that they are responsible for improving the position of Roma.
We should not let these countries wriggle out of their responsibility for this problem.
In July 2000, the European Union adopted binding legislation banning racial and ethnic discrimination at the workplace, in education, in the social field, etc. A second directive bans discrimination at the workplace on grounds of religion and faith, disability, age and sexual orientation.
The Member States have to transpose these directives into national law by 2003, that is to say that the future new Member States must implement these directives before they join the European Union.
The legal framework goes hand in hand with an action programme with a budget of EUR 100 million which should increase our ability to combat racism and all other forms of discrimination.
Furthermore, in November 2001 the Commission presented a proposal for a Council framework decision with a view to creating a legal instrument in the field of criminal law.
The aim of this legal instrument is to ensure that racist and xenophobic behaviour in all Member States attracts the same sentences for the same offences.
The second objective is to ensure that judicial cooperation in this area is enhanced and promoted.
Mr President, I have one comment and one question.
My intention was not to accuse the Commission of rampant optimism, I was merely comparing what the Commission says with the Council of Europe report entitled "Extremist threat to democracy" and I used that as the basis for my judgment.
The question, Commissioner, is this: we are calling for everyone else to do a whole host of things.
But what are we doing?
I do not mean programmes and money, I mean something else.
You know that, because they have no country of their own to look after them, no place to call home, the Roma, of whom there are some 7 or 8 million, need to find a different mode of expression.
They have set up a council, they have made a number of requests, they have asked for a pan-European forum, they have asked for special relations with institutions of the European Union, some sort of recognition because, as they have no country to recognise them and kick up a fuss about the holocaust, the horrendous holocaust which they suffered half a century ago, someone has to speak for them.
We cannot speak for them.
Do you intend to submit a proposal for us to recognise some sort of special representation of the Roma to the European Union?
. (DE) No, Mr Papayannakis, the Commission does not have any such proposals and I must make it quite clear that I would have great concerns about agreeing to the idea that the Roma issue should be 'Europeanised' by treating Roma as a transnational European minority with their own European minority status.
No, I believe that what we need to do here is to urge the Member States and future Member States, using all the means at our disposal, to vigorously combat the problem of discrimination, and by means of Community programmes we can help to support that fight, which is just what we are doing.
Question No 36 by Sarah Ludford (H-0280/02):
Subject: Cyprus
What plans does the Commission have to lift or ease the trade and economic embargo on Northern Cyprus, within the limits of European and international law, in order to help alleviate the present isolation of the Turkish Cypriot people and assist in the progress towards a political settlement on the island with a view to EU accession?
. (DE) Baroness Ludford, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 5 July 1994 on the Anastasiou case, Cypriot goods have privileged access to the EU market if accompanied by a certificate of origin issued by the relevant authorities in the Republic of Cyprus.
At present, Turkish Cypriot exporters based in Northern Cyprus are required to use the stamp of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
This Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is not recognised under international law by any state in the entire world except Turkey.
That is why this stamp cannot be used as proof of the Cypriot origin of goods in accordance with the regulations.
On 5 August 1994 Cyprus's President Klerides formally notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations in writing that if the procedures laid down under national, European and international law were adhered to, Turkish Cypriots could export their goods in accordance with the same conditions as the population of the remainder of Cyprus.
This letter accordingly gave a clear political undertaking on the part of the Republic of Cyprus to issue certificates of origin at the request of Turkish Cypriot exporters.
It is therefore up to the Cypriots to reach agreement on how Turkish Cypriots are in practice to obtain certificates of origin issued by the Republic of Cyprus.
Baroness Ludford, I am sure that we both agree with all the Members of this House that it will only be possible to find a solution to this incredibly difficult problem as part of the solution to the Cyprus question as a whole.
That is why it is one of our objectives to solve this problem, which is also very unfortunate for Turkish Cypriots, so that the Cyprus question can be resolved this year before we take decisions on accession.
. (DE) Mr Duff, we are not refusing to trade with the Turkish Cypriots.
I very much agree with you that from the Commission's point of view the increased involvement of the northern part of Cyprus in trade is if anything highly desirable, because it is a very regrettable situation that the Greek part of the island is developing positively and rapidly whilst the Turkish part is sinking ever deeper into poverty.
We are not refusing to trade.
The problem is that the Turkish Cypriots are being prevented by their own 'authorities', and please note the quotation marks, from fulfilling the necessary requirements, by which I mean the certificates of origin that cannot be issued by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus but only by the Republic of Cyprus, which is recognised under international law.
There is nothing the Commission can do to change this perfectly clear legal situation.
We would undoubtedly be breaking the law if we were to behave any differently in this case.
Question No 37 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (H-0324/02):
Subject: Prospects of a settlement in Cyprus and accession negotiations
In the Commission's view, what are the prospects of reaching a settlement in Cyprus by June 2002 and to what extent does it consider that the Turkish Cypriots can finally be involved in the accession process?
Will the Commission point out to Mr Denktash that obstructing dialogue and attempting to give the impression that the Cyprus question can be resolved on the very eve of closing negotiations for the accession of the applicant countries, or after that point, will not prevent the accession of the Republic of Cyprus but, on the contrary, will harm the vital interests of the Turkish Cypriots?
.
(DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I quite agree with you. At present it is impossible to judge if the direct discussions in Cyprus about the resolution of the conflict will have the desired outcome.
The Commission fully supports the direct discussions between the leaders of the two communities and their declared intention of finding a solution by the end of June 2002.
The Turkish Cypriots have been invited to take part in the accession negotiations as part of the Cypriot delegation.
This invitation has been on the table since 1998, but the Turkish Cypriots have so far unfortunately not accepted it.
The present situation in Cyprus in no way alters the planned timetable for expansion. The Helsinki Strategy remains equally valid.
The desired outcome is to solve the conflict, but that is not a prerequisite for Cyprus's accession.
The Council will make the final decision taking account of all relevant factors.
The Commission does not intend to send a note to the leader of the Turkish Cypriots, Rauf Denktash.
However, the Commission is willing to continue the dialogue with Mr Denktash.
I myself have had three detailed discussions with Mr Denktash during my period of office.
These discussions covered all the key political issues around Cyprus's accession to the EU and the resolution of the conflict.
Commissioner, that you are fully acquainted with the Cyprus issue I do not doubt.
But my question was more specific than your reply.
You have reiterated what was said in Helsinki and of course I have a great deal of respect for that, but what I am referring to are the negotiations taking place between the two sides.
These negotiations may finish in June.
On the other hand, they may not.
Does the Commission intend to make it clear to the Turkish Cypriots that if, for any reason, they obstruct the negotiations or give us to understand that they will probably agree next year, Cyprus will still accede to the Union?
As you know, this is a scenario which is currently being discussed.
We may have a situation where Cyprus does not accede to the European Union due to obstruction on the part of the Turkish Cypriots, who give us reason to believe they will agree later, with the result that we delay Cyprus's accession to the European Union.
That was my specific question.
. (DE) Mr Hatzidakis, I have already answered your question and I repeat what I said.
Every word I used was important.
The present situation in Cyprus in no way alters the planned timetable for expansion.
That means that the decision on accessions will be taken in Copenhagen at the end of this year, as planned.
As I can safely assume that the negotiations with Cyprus will have been concluded by then, and, as you know the negotiations with Cyprus are going extremely well, the decision about Cyprus will of course also be taken at the end of this year.
One of most important political messages I had to send during my most recent visit to Cyprus and also during my most recent visits to Turkey and Greece was that the timetable for expansion would be respected regardless of the situation in Cyprus.
Question No 38 by Michl Ebner, which has been taken over by Mr Posselt (H-0295/02):
Subject: Benes Decree of 19 May 1945
With regard to the Decree of the President of the Republic of Czechoslovakia of 19 May 1945 'concerning the invalidity of transactions involving property rights from the time of the oppression and concerning the national administration of property assets of Germans, Magyars, traitors and collaborationists and of certain organisations and associations' (Benes Decree), will the Commission say whether that decree is still in force and whether any census has been conducted in the Czech Republic since 8 May 1946?
. (DE) Mr Posselt, as far as the Commission is aware, Decree No 5 of 19 May 1945 has not been formally rescinded.
That decree is one of a number of decrees that has not had any fresh impact for a considerable time now.
The Commission regards it as being obsolete.
Censuses have been held in Czechoslovakia on the following dates since 8 May 1946: 1 March 1950, 1 March 1961, 1 December 1970, 1 November 1980 and 3 March 1991.
A census was also held on 1 March 2001 in the Czech Republic founded in 1993.
Commissioner, this decree seems particularly important to me, because it also touches on a non-material but vital issue, that is to say 'National Reliability', which collectively takes away the rights of entire ethnic groups that following 1929 did something perfectly legal, by which I mean identifying with a defined language group.
Just a few months ago, at the German-Czech Coordination Council in Berlin a representative of the Czech ODS party denied that representatives of the German minority who were present were loyal to the Czech state.
So this is a very topical subject and I would like to ask you a very specific question: has the Czech Republic officially informed you that this decree is no longer in force?
As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 39 to 88 will be answered in writing.
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on two reports on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, by Mr Trentin and Mr Marinos.
Mr President, to understand the debate we are holding on the two magnificent reports presented by Mr Trentin and Mr Marinos, we should remember that Maastricht was not just another European Council; it was to all intents and purposes a Council at which two dogmas were enshrined: the dogma of price stability and that of budgetary balance.
Lisbon and Barcelona have added a new dogma, a clarification of the doctrine, and point to reform as the only path to salvation, with salvation meaning closing the gap that separates us from the United States.
The task of defending the dogma is entrusted to the European Central Bank - the defender of the faith on issues of monetary policy - although, in the fields of budgetary and macroeconomic policy, where the risk of dispersal is greater, it is difficult to know exactly who should play this role.
We are currently witnessing a resurrection of misguided and perverse behaviour, and, what is even worse, the emergence of doctrines that seek to justify this kind of perversion; few in the field of monetary policy, but more in the fields of budgetary and macroeconomic policy.
Document after document reaffirming these dogmas appear, but they lack coordination and strength.
At a time when we are tackling the reform of the Treaties, and now that the Convention is up and running, I would, therefore, say the same thing about these economic guidelines as about the employment guidelines: they should serve to share diagnoses, to establish clear codes of conduct and mechanisms for sanctions or penalties where misguided behaviour occurs.
I would also like - and Mrs Randzio-Plath will probably explain this to you - the Commission to continue to be the driving force, to continue to hold the monopoly of initiative and for the principle of qualified majority to be extended, together with that of codecision, to cover most macroeconomic areas.
Mr Solbes is no mere altar boy; he is a high priest, and has a fundamental role - that of spearhead, like Saint Vicente Ferrer - in this process of reform.
Mr President, the interdependence between macropolicy and full employment is evident.
If we are to achieve full employment and raise the employment rate to the level of other regions of the world, we need growth over and above growth in productivity.
We also need full employment to step up internal demand and to achieve gross income from the EU Member States.
This is a prerequisite if we are to achieve sustainable growth at a high level over a substantial period, and a prerequisite that needs to be expressed more clearly in the broad guidelines for economic policies and which needs to be made clearer in the guidelines for Member States.
The present guidelines are still too much geared towards structural reforms.
But such reforms have only limited scope for acting as an engine for growth and employment.
No doubt the implementation of the financial action plan will partly close the gap in productivity between the EU and the USA, but only partly.
That is why we need to aim for a higher level of investment.
Increases in investment of 4% were possible in the USA during the 1990s, with a significant impact on growth and employment.
So why not in the EU?
There is not enough emphasis in the broad guidelines for economic policies on investment.
I am not denying that it represents progress that all the EU Member States intend to invest 3% of their GDP in research and development, and that they also intend to invest more in human resources.
After all, human resources are Europe's raw material.
However, more needs to be invested in education and training if the knowledge-based society is to become a reality in Europe.
Investment would need to rise from 21% to 25%.
This applies primarily to private investment needed to create production capacity and jobs which would make this sustainable growth possible in the longer term, but which would also promote technological progress and thus contribute in turn to increased demand.
But public-sector investment also needs to increase.
In this field we chiefly need investment in infrastructure, which was particularly hit because of the consolidation process in 2001, with a level of 2.3% of GDP.
A target of 3% needs to be introduced for stability programmes here.
I think that is worth considering.
By way of conclusion I would like to mention that the Commission is quite right to touch on the need for the coordination of fiscal policies.
We know that companies are now critical of the fact that there is no scope for planning in the EU in relation to taxation and above all in relation to cross-border economic activity, something we would like to see.
As much provision as possible should therefore be made in the broad guidelines for economic policies to ensure coordination where there are disruptions in the functioning of the internal market.
The good doctor Duisenberg has been telling us for several months that economic recovery is underway.
Disciples of the other good doctor - Doctor CouÃ© - have been saying the same thing.
They see the signs of recovery almost everywhere, in the same way that a fortune-teller can predict happiness by looking at tea leaves.
What we should actually be asking ourselves is whether or not we have gone into recession.
Faced with this reality, the liberal ideas governing the European Union's economic policy would seem to be rather harmful.
The so-called Stability and Growth Pact and the independence of the European Central Bank are starving the authorities of the resources to cope with the crisis.
In light of this situation, the infamous Lisbon declaration has more to do with some magical formula than with politics, and the Commission recommendation for the 2002 Broad Guidelines of the Economic Policy of the Member States and the Community makes use of the same hocus-pocus.
When the invisible hand of the market works, everything works, more or less.
I say more or less, because we must acknowledge that, in spite of everything, the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow inexorably.
This is happening throughout the world as well as in Europe, with tragic consequences, and we see, to take the example of the Republic of France, that those politicians who appeal to the masses are waiting in the wings to take advantage of the situation.
Incidentally, I would like to congratulate the handful of Members who recently organised the Europe of the Poor Summit in conjunction with the Fourth World Movement NGO.
Seventeen per cent of the population today make up this Europe: in other words, there are 60 million people who survive on less than 60% of the average income.
Allow me to return to the idea of the invisible hand, if I may.
When the hand suffers from pins and needles, tingling and rheumatism, which appears to be the case at the moment, everything stops working.
It will be increasingly difficult for the Member States to respect the liberal restrictions, such as the infamous 3% threshold.
And what can I say about the budgetary balance for 2004?
Several States are experiencing difficulties: Germany, for example, is currently in this situation, and, as you know, Germany has the strongest economy of the Fifteen.
Berlin only has to sneeze and Europe catches a cold.
Take the example of our trans-Atlantic neighbours: with their usual pragmatism, the United States of North America, who extol the virtues of liberalism, have just proven once again that anti-liberal measures must occasionally be used.
We would do well to draw some inspiration from that side of the Atlantic.
Tentatively, rather too tentatively in fact - and I am about to finish, Mr President - the rapporteur is introducing some homeopathic amendments using the liberal credo of the Commission.
I have considerable regard for Bruno Trentin but?
(The President cut the speaker off)
In contrast to the Council and the Commission which represent the governments, the European Parliament is supposed to be the democratic expression of the entire population.
The Trentin report, however, shows that although Parliament is elected by the people, it represents the interests of employers alone, instead of the interests of the working classes of the European Union.
The modifications requested by Parliament's rapporteur all have the same goal, namely to make employees' conditions worse.
The aim of the report is to achieve job flexibility.
It recommends what it has the cheek to call active ageing, in other words to make people work longer and to push back the age of retirement.
The only reason that social policy is mentioned is to affirm with brutal cynicism that this must be a productive factor.
For example, although it promotes a policy of lifelong learning, this is so that employers will have a mobile and qualified workforce to meet their needs.
Regarding what it calls restructuring processes - which, in actual fact, means collective redundancies - it limits itself to promoting preventative consultation of workers.
The only social measure in this report is, therefore, that workers must be warned when they will be made redundant.
We shall vote against this text which is designed for employers.
Mr President, I refer mainly to Mr Marinos' report, which I certainly welcome for it has succeeded in taking into account all the major economic issues that are relevant to modern, well-equipped companies.
Capital transfers, migrations flows, the labour market and pension systems have been analysed with synthetic proposals for solutions.
The central panel of the European economic horizon is still, however, the Stability and Growth Pact, which has emerged victorious from the economic storm of recent months.
After September 11, there were really very few of us who believed that the parameters established by the Pact could be respected.
Now, however, the sceptics - or many of them, at least - acknowledge their mistake and have changed their views.
The States which have erred in any way, particularly Germany and Portugal, have set themselves with a will to removing the uncertainties and realigning any parameters which were likely to require attention.
With great skill, the rapporteur covers all the economic issues and major summits, from Lisbon to Barcelona, focusing on the major challenges represented by the ever-increasing number of elderly people and by economic refugees and their families, who represent an uncertain variable for the host State because of their tendency to work illegally.
I know paragraph 20 of the report contains a reference to the labour market, but the issue calls for greater, more thorough analysis.
The profit-sharing system and the profit-related pay system, which benefits 20% of the workforce in employment in the United Kingdom, are models which must be further explored and applied to good effect.
The efforts to find the best, most productive labour processes must be matched by endeavours to improve the quality of jobs.
Jobs must be developed to incorporate more creativity, to provide a better response to social requirements and to promote human dignity.
An increase in professional skill is necessary for reorganisation of the production system to take place but professional skill will also be enhanced as a result of the process.
The level of culture will increase and the creative abilities of employees will be enhanced.
We have a constitutional and moral responsibility to provide jobs for all our citizens.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to restrict my comments to the report by Mr Bruno Trentin. First of all, I would like to thank him unreservedly for the excellent contribution that the European Parliament will make, through this report, to the broad economic policy guidelines.
I shall make two points.
My first point is that, like the Commission and the Council, the European Parliament attaches great importance to the drafting of the broad economic policy guidelines.
To put it simply, if this is to remain a purely academic exercise, we are wasting our time.
The broad economic policy guidelines will only be meaningful if the national parliaments can be involved from the outset; so that, when drawing up the budgets of the Member States, they can bear the broad guidelines in mind.
They will only be meaningful if, from the outset, the governments - particularly those of the eurozone - agree to increase coordination of their economic policies, whether this is in terms of the budget, taxation or in the area of structural policies.
Otherwise, what we are doing is pointless.
And we realise this when it is almost too late, when the Commission is forced to put in place early warning systems.
We have a useful tool, we must use it to improve coordination.
In the same spirit, my second point relates to the contribution that the European Parliament can make to the broad economic policy guidelines.
We hope that, through the Convention perhaps, but also by using a specific method, the amendments that Parliament has drawn up are taken into greater account when the broad economic policy guidelines are finalised.
And in this respect, I would like to highlight three of the amendments which have been proposed to you by your committee.
The first is Amendment No 6 which relates to the role of social partners and macro-economic dialogue in order to promote an employment policy.
I believe that it is absolutely essential.
The second is Amendment No 7, and I urge some Member States to examine this closely when they come to cut taxes, as we can only contemplate reducing taxes if there is a harmonious balance involving the lowering of debt and re-balancing in favour of public investment.
The third amendment will come as no surprise to you. It in fact relates to two amendments, Amendments Nos 16 and 18, which quite rightly stress the importance that we must give to services of general interest, in terms of their contribution to social and territorial cohesion of the Union, and their ability to create jobs.
Mr President, I shall try to reply and make some comments on both reports, as well as the speeches we have heard today in Parliament.
I shall start with a comment on Mr Trentin's report.
Firstly, I would like to highlight its innovative approach.
For the first time, a report has been presented that is not purely of a general nature, but which employs the technique of tabling amendments to the Commission's recommendation.
This appears to follow the line suggested by Mrs BerÃšs.
All the same, it is clear that the work we are currently doing has no bearing on the legislation currently in force, but it could be of enormous use in future developments in our debating system.
I would like to highlight a series of specific points from the Trentin report that I consider to be important.
As an initial comment with regard to this issue, I agree with the rapporteur's call for a global approach, which includes economic, social and environmental aspects amongst others, and, whilst we are on this subject, I would also like to refer to Mr Blokland's speech, in which he emphasised the need to devote more attention to environmental issues, when these are in fact fairly clearly defined in the conclusions adopted at the time on these points.
There are two points I would like to highlight from Mr Trentin's report - investment, and social and economic cohesion.
There have been various references made all day with regard to investment which I should like to discuss.
In our view, the most important factor in investment working - and this is included in the broad economic policy guidelines - is a sound macroeconomic policy.
This means price stability, reduction of risk premiums, reduction of interest rates, fully operative automatic stabilisers and, in short, better investment opportunities in terms of investor confidence.
However, the broad economic policy guidelines include some more specific aspects that can be relevant from this point of view: to improve the quality of public finances, with accumulation of physical and human capital referred to in the document.
We also talk about the further development of integrated networks and how they can be used efficiently. I shall make another comment on Mr Goebbels' suggestions on energy, transport and communications later.
We also favour the promotion of investment in knowledge, in line with what was laid down in Lisbon and Barcelona, and we believe that we should not only invest in people, in education, in professional training and in apprenticeships, but also that we should propose a specific objective for research and development of up to 3% of GDP, a figure that should be reached by 2010.
I also said that when we analyse the broad economic policy guidelines, we can see some specific references to investments in large networks and the possibility of more efficient functioning, for example.
Whilst we are on this subject, and with regard to energy networks and infrastructure, I should point out that in December the Commission proposed to improve the European Investment Bank cofinancing systems and also the possibility of eliminating some of the bottlenecks in service transfers from one country to another, in both electricity and gas, which will allow us to improve interconnections and, in short, to reach our objective to improve our competitiveness in the energy sector for the year 2005.
We are doing something very similar with regard to the interoperability of railways, with the objective - as I said before - of improving the efficiency of our system.
Therefore, it is highly important - and Mr Goebbels made a reference to this point - that investments should be sound and should not cause problems related to the poor use of public money.
Mrs Randzio-Plath also referred to the problem of investment, suggesting the idea, which to me seems ambitious, to try to achieve an EU public investment level of 3%, the same as the United States, according to her.
This is a point that we as the Commission, however, do not see in quantitative, but in qualitative terms, and we focus on our broad economic policy guidelines to highlight the importance of these issues.
In his report, Mr Marinos emphasises the importance of the Stability and Growth Pact more directly and, throughout the debate this morning and afternoon, there have been some proposals that seem important.
Mr Marinos focuses - and I can only thank him for this - on the importance of maintaining the Stability and Growth Pact in its present form.
He mentioned not making political concessions, particularly to large Member States.
This has never been the Commission's vision, which is, in fact, that we should give equal treatment to all Member States, and we have always acted with this in mind.
Our actions have even included the use of certain instruments that have sparked a certain amount of public debate. I am, of course, referring to the early warning system applied in Germany and Portugal, where I feel that, although we are not happy with the procedure - and as a member of the Commission I have stated this on more than one occasion - we are satisfied with the proposed objective.
A second issue raised by Mr Marinos, which was also highlighted by some other speakers, is whether the broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability and Growth Pact are complementary or, to some extent, contradictory instruments.
From the Commission's point of view, the broad economic policy guidelines are the general framework and the Stability and Growth Pact the instrument we have with which to implement coordination in the specific field of budget deficit.
These are very important for us to be able to achieve our two objectives through the coordination of economic policy: that fiscal policy should not hinder monetary policy and cause no externalities or spin off effects that would have negative effects on other countries.
In our opinion, it is vital that we should maintain the Stability and Growth Pact in its current form and we believe that deficits are growth's worst enemy, as experience has taught us over the last few years.
Therefore, we must have sound macroeconomic policies to be able to increase growth and, consequently, to increase employment.
This means that the Stability Pact should not be so rigid that it cannot be adapted to match new situations.
We believe that the experience gained over the past two years, clearly set out in our proposals, proves that the Stability Pact can also function in situations of economic slowdown.
Mr Jonckheer expressed this concern this morning.
I would say that the pact has worked well, that the automatic stabilisers have allowed us to adopt an expansionary fiscal stance.
It is true that this has not been a discretionary policy, but we believe that the Pact has been as important - in relative terms and given the importance of automatic stabilisers - in Europe, as certain discretionary policies may have been in the United States.
We believe that the advantage of our proposed system is not only its automatic operation, but also its capacity to avoid potential problems in future, especially when we have to deal with new situations of economic recovery in which we start from relatively comfortable positions in terms of budgetary balance.
Some other issues were raised this morning and this afternoon.
Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil this evening referred, in terms possibly close to his and my own, to the situation of dogmas and ecclesiastic definitions of the guardian of the dogma.
Obviously, no one is claiming to be the guardian of any dogma, but it is clear that, as the Commission, we have the role of guardian of the Treaties, which means that we are obliged to apply the commitments as proposed.
In this regard, we think that it is vitally important that the Stability Pact continues to be applied to all countries under the same conditions it has been applied up to now.
I have two further comments on what was said this morning.
The issue of enlargement, as some of you have suggested, is not the objective of the broad economic policy guidelines.
There are specific documents that deal with this issue and we are working on a system that allows us gradually to come closer to the broad guidelines so that we can apply them after enlargement has taken place.
My second comment is directed to Mrs BerÃšs. I have noted with great interest the references to the proposals for specific amendments and we will gratefully pass these on to the Council, which is now responsible for taking decisions on broad economic policy guidelines, given that this function is now out of the Commission's hands.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote on the Trentin report will be taken on Thursday and the vote on the Marinos report will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on three reports:
A5-0129/2002 by Horst Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs (COM(2000) 438 - C5-0376/2000 - 2000/0178(COD));
A5-0131/2002 by Horst Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (COM(2000) 438 - C5-0377/2000 - 2000/0179(COD));
A5-0452/2001 by Heinz Kindermann, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down the animal-health rules governing the production, placing on the market and importation of products of animal origin intended for human consumption (COM(2000) 438 - C5-0382/2000 - 2000/181(CNS)).
. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Commission and my fellow Members here in Parliament very sincerely for their highly constructive and expert cooperation.
The reports before us reflect that cooperation, and they represent part of the framework needed for safe food production, especially in health terms.
While we are sitting here today at this hour discussing measures for greater food safety, people throughout the European Union are sitting in restaurants or at home and enjoying their food, and are unlikely to be asking if their food is safe.
In fact our food is safe, safer than in many other places in the world.
The Commissioner has seized the opportunity given to us by the crises we have experienced recently - and we have indeed been through a great deal over the last few years - to develop a new strategy.
Quite rightly so, but these crises alone should not be the reason for us to adopt new food legislation, because they are history now and virtually no one is writing about them any more.
What is far more important is that changes in food production and also changes in consumer behaviour are forcing us to consider how we can make food production safer, as the public has different requirements and increasing demands are being made for greater safety.
In spite of the many rules already in place, it has to be said that there are many shortcomings in the way the Community has shaped food law up to now.
The individual rules are each limited to a specific sector, but there is no overall plan.
Community food law is especially notable for its significant deficiencies as regards coherence and legal certainty.
These deficiencies are not just a matter of drafting, they are really substantial and they put at risk the efficiency and implementation of food law.
That is all the more reason for welcoming the radical new concept proposed by the Commission in its White Paper, which on closer inspection turns out to be not so much a new safety concept as a new legislative concept.
For the first time, general food law is being proposed at Community level, with uniform definitions and principles and without any ifs and buts.
This food law is based on a comprehensive and uniform concept ranging from the producer to the consumer and it creates a coherent and transparent set of food law provisions.
The consolidation process has also been used to make fundamental improvements in the quality of a great deal of the legislation up to now.
I regard this consolidation of the hitherto incoherent body of rules and regulations to create consistent food law as being essential.
In the context of food hygiene, we need legal bases that can easily be applied by food business operators, that permit an exchange of information between individual production levels, that correspond to the conditions of the internal market, and which are accordingly valid in all Member States, which increase the responsibility of food business operators, and which facilitate the official control activities of the authorities and guarantee the implementation of administrative measures.
The regulation reforming the law is essential to achieve all this.
Parliament will not agree to any change here.
Encompassing the existing 17 directives in just four regulations will result in a sharper definition of the borders between food hygiene, animal health law, official food controls and thus user-friendly legal bases.
This also reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of the economic sectors affected.
Most producers nowadays operate on an international basis.
A regulation provides a uniform framework for action with the same provisions governing all the EU Member States and accordingly, more than a directive can do, establishes fair conditions throughout the European internal market.
The new food law can only take account of special national and regional situations in exceptional cases, which is something I would particularly like to emphasise.
The Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs was significantly modified by the committee, with almost 200 amendments, and I believe that this regulation now provides a better legal basis.
Many of the amendments are based on the text of the Regulation laying down general principles on food hygiene which has already been adopted, and were accordingly chiefly amendments needed for drafting reasons.
There is a common thread running through all the proposals for regulations, and that is the emphasis on the primary responsibility of food producers for the safety of the foodstuffs they place on the market.
The BSE crisis in particular did a great deal to demonstrate that we have failed to impose the same responsibility on those involved in primary agricultural production that we have long since expected of food producers elsewhere in the production chain.
I believe that the HACCP principle is also relevant here.
I am of course aware that the HACCP principle can only be applied to primary production in a few areas.
However, in farms with significant numbers of animals it is possible to identify the critical points that need constant monitoring.
If we apply the 'from farm to table' principle, we would also ensure that the scope for self-regulation is also fully used in primary production.
The Commission's proposals suggest that HACCP should not be applied to primary production, whereas the regulations before us contain general provisions on hygiene for primary production.
This implies a totally new chapter in the legislation on food hygiene.
For example, if a farmer has to keep a record of measures for containing risks, that amounts in certain areas to the first step towards the application of the HACCP principle.
Despite the high level of safety standards and seamless controls, production errors cannot be totally avoided.
If the causes are to be established, the traceability of products must be guaranteed.
The committee considers that additional labelling such as that proposed in the Commission proposal is not necessary.
Although systems of labelling for traceability may vary from one EU Member State to another, they all guarantee a seamless picture of the production chain.
I gathered from Commissioner Byrne's statement on Monday that product labelling is to be simplified, which suggests that the committee's proposal is actually to be adopted.
In order to support production processes, the regulation provides for guidelines for good practice.
As a rule these will be sectoral and national guidelines which are to be drawn up by many interested parties.
The application of these guidelines is of course voluntary, and this House supports that.
However, if European guidelines are drawn up for a specific sector or a specific area of production, then those guidelines would have to emerge from a general consensus and would have to reflect best available practice in Europe.
That is why sectoral, national or regional guidelines should be replaced by European guidelines, because in that way we can compel food producers to apply precisely this best practice and to introduce these methods.
Food production in Europe is very diverse, and it is therefore necessary for the regulations to permit a certain degree of flexibility.
That is why it would be possible for there to be exceptions from the provisions of these regulations.
Parliament wishes to limit these exceptions to regions with geographically difficult situations and to regions with supply difficulties, and also to traditional production methods and to supplies for local markets.
The procedure for approving exceptions should be a simple one.
However, Parliament cannot agree to uncontrollably broad powers for the Commission to amend the appendices of this regulation on food hygiene which define the basic framework of hygiene conditions by following the comitology route.
In theory it would possible be to amend the appendices again only one day after the regulations were adopted.
An arrangement of this kind would certainly not be in the spirit of good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.
However, the procedure needs to be different for the regulation on specific hygiene rules.
These annexes cover detailed issues regarding hygienic trade in food, and in this case rapid implementation has to be achieved by means of amendment through the committee procedure.
We have therefore taken various areas - definitions, approval of plants, labelling and so on - out of the annexes and incorporated them into the articles of the regulation, so that if any amendments are needed this can only be done by means of legislation.
But I am content for other rules to be dealt with through the committee procedure.
One of the main points with regard to the regulation on specific hygiene rules is the chapter on hunting.
The debate on this in Parliament was very lively.
We have now presented a proposal that the Commission also finds acceptable.
We must of course accept that there are national peculiarities regarding the development of hunting traditions, and these have now been included in the proposals, so that we can work on the assumption that we can still guarantee game meat to be safe in health terms.
This means in particular that existing traditions should be maintained.
I believe that with these proposals, and with the proposed regulation on animal-health rules governing the production, placing on the market and importation of products of animal origin, we have created an important basis for improving rules governing foodstuffs.
I specially want to thank Mr Kindermann for having produced such an excellent report.
The provisions regarding the importation of foodstuffs are so well presented in his report that I do not need to explain any further.
I consider that the regulations before us provide a good basis for extending the Regulation on official controls of foodstuffs.
I am very anxious to see that because we want to deal with it as quickly as possible.
. (DE) Mr President, the package of proposals for regulations we have before us aims to reformulate and simplify the entire body of EU food law.
The draft regulation for which I am rapporteur lays down specific animal-health rules governing the production, placing on the market and importation from third countries of products of animal origin, with the objective of preventing the spread of animal diseases in connection with the marketing of these products.
At present, this area is governed by seven different directives.
The proposal for a regulation under consideration is intended to make the animal-health rules more transparent and encompass the existing directives within a single text.
I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission has deliberately chosen a regulation as the legal instrument so as to ensure that the rules will in future be enforced in the same way in the EU as a whole and in third countries.
Overall, I support the proposal, even if I have one fundamental criticism of it.
In many places the Commission has used the procedure referred to in Article 11, that is to say the committee procedure.
This is neither unusual nor anything special.
Particularly in the field of animal disease prevention it is right and important for the Commission to be able to react more quickly and effectively to new scientific developments and unforeseen situations, without having to embark on a cumbersome legislative procedure every time.
However, in this case I believe that rather too much use is made of the committee procedure.
In some places I have therefore introduced either additions or refinements to the text of the regulation establishing certain criteria.
The first of these is that exceptions should only be granted if the animal disease situation does not prevent it and if it would in no way adversely affect the level of protection against animal diseases.
Secondly, unannounced checks should be carried out at irregular intervals.
Thirdly, when lists of third countries are being drawn up, all additional factors such as the adequacy of staffing levels in the control authorities and the reliability of the information provided by authorities in third countries must be taken into account.
In addition, I have included two new proposals in my report.
Member States and the authorities of third countries shall, where so requested, submit a report to the Commission on the controls carried out, specifying in particular the frequency of controls, the nature of the failings and infringements found to exist, and the nature of the steps taken by the competent authorities to punish them.
We all know that the effectiveness of the legal framework depends to a large extent on controls carried out, and detailed control reports of this kind are essential if the effective application of controls in Member States is to be guaranteed.
They also allow the Commission to react immediately to any weak points identified.
The Commission should also draw up a list of categories of possible infringements of this regulation, its implementing rules or safeguard measures and should determine in each instance whether the infringements are punishable by the competent national authorities under criminal or administrative law.
If the provisions of the regulation are infringed, uniform sanctions should as far as possible be established for all Member States.
It is not acceptable for the same act to have different consequences in Member State No 1 as compared with Member State No 2. This problem, which is certainly even more urgent in other areas than in the case before us today, needs to be fundamentally addressed.
It was my intention to make a start here with my proposal, even if the Commission has indicated to the committee that this kind of approach may not be practicable at the moment for legal reasons.
Nevertheless, I am convinced of the need for this and my fellow members of the committee supported me in this.
I would lastly like to thank the Commission for its constructive cooperation and I hope that will continue.
Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should like to congratulate both Mr Schnellhardt and Mr Kindermann for their work.
The opinion from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Schnellhardt report, for which I was the draftsperson, focuses in particular on the need for consistency between food safety practices, which are deemed essential for the domestic sale or supply of foodstuffs, and those practices which cover the sale of such foodstuffs internationally.
The committee has therefore sought to make it explicit that the scope of any regulation needs to apply equally to exports, as well as to domestic sale and consumption.
We also wanted to broaden the membership of the proposed standing committee for foodstuffs to include experts representing public authorities and consumer groups.
It is quite wrong that the Commission Decision of 18 May 2000, which defines the composition of standing committees, specifically exempts consumer groups from representation on these committees.
It is clearly of great importance that such committees gain the trust of consumers and are genuinely stakeholder committees.
It therefore seems quite essential that consumer groups be represented on them.
With respect to the specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy wanted to build in greater flexibility, particularly with regard to slaughterhouses.
We therefore proposed that measures should be introduced to allow flexibility in application of the so-called HACCP system to regional slaughterhouses which are in peripheral or remote regions.
Strict rules in the past have caused unnecessary difficulties to slaughterhouses in the more remote areas of the EU, often because geographical restraints can lead to unfair competitive conditions which tend to favour larger enterprises.
Yet, as we begin to learn the lessons of, say, the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the UK, it is quite clear that one of the reasons that disease spread so far and so fast was precisely because of the closure of local slaughterhouses.
We must not induce, however unintentionally, any more closures in that vital area.
Finally, on a personal note, an existing concern I have with this whole regulation is that it is insufficiently flexible for the small enterprise in particular.
We must be mindful of the extra burden which can be placed on small enterprises and ensure that we are not adopting any sort of regulation which risks undermining their livelihoods.
Mr President, my task is the ordinarily rather boring one of reporting that the Legal Affairs Committee considered this matter and found it not to be wanting.
In fact, here we have a proposal under Article 37 which is fully justified as a common agricultural policy issue, and, therefore, the procedures are appropriate.
Of course, it is important that we should check that there is an adequate legal base.
We are now discussing in the Convention and elsewhere, the question of holding the Community organs to their proper competences and I am delighted that this regulation passes muster in that respect.
It is also, as Mr Kindermann has said, a good thing to take this complex body of law and consolidate it into a single regulation that will give us a community of approach throughout the Community.
I am not sure if I would have felt that I was justified in taking up the time of the House, had that been all that there was to the matter, but I want to add to the point we are discussing today.
The importation of animal products for human consumption is intimately connected, as Mrs Lucas has just said, with the disastrous outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that we suffered in the United Kingdom.
In my own constituency, Dumfries and Galloway, we were as you know particularly afflicted in that case.
If we were to move more and more strongly towards local production for local consumption, just as Mrs Lucas said a moment ago, we would avoid some of these dangers.
It is vitally important that, in introducing these very necessary laws, we are careful to ensure that we do not create circumstances which themselves increase the pressure for excessive animal movement.
I hope that will be taken into account.
If I have strayed beyond the limits of the Legal Affairs Committee, at least I have not strayed beyond my time.
With regard to the Kindermann report, we believe that it is vitally important and a matter of regret that this regulation is not included, like the four other proposals by the Commission, within the co-decision framework.
The proposal for a regulation is based on Article 37, relating to the common agricultural policy and aims to put in place more rational legislation to avoid the contamination of farm animals by products of animal origin containing pathogenic agents.
We all remember the food-and-mouth epidemic which recently struck Europe and the ensuing crisis within the agricultural industry, primarily in the United Kingdom.
Initial enquiries confirm that the contamination was caused by food of animal origin from third countries, which was used for pig feed.
As far as animal-health conditions governing the production and sale of Community products are concerned, we must carry out careful and regular monitoring of the health state of producing regions.
Official controls and Community inspections must be carried out without prior warning.
So that we have the resources required, we must consider - as Mr Kindermann said - how many vets are needed in the Member States, as well as at the European Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin.
In addition, our legal mechanism must take into account the candidate countries and we must make penalties uniform.
As regards imports from third countries, we must have the same provisions as for Member States.
However, overly strict hygiene measures must not be perceived as barriers to trade.
If that is the case, we should make adjustments but continue to bear in mind the original aim of the regulation.
We support Mr Kindermann's report, which provides the necessary clarifications to the Commission proposal.
Mr President, I think it would be unfair not to praise the work carried out by the Commission to comply with the objective of the White Paper to simplify and clarify legislation, eliminating all of the disadvantages of legislation which is spread out over seventeen directives.
Additionally, the proposals that have been put forward are reasonably good and very detailed, and I believe that all sectors involved have recognised this.
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the two rapporteurs, because the food chain is long and consequently the subject area is very large and complex and they had to study and come to an agreement on many amendments which - I am sure - will improve the project.
These legislative requirements are based on the control of food safety from farm to table in order to provide the best possible guarantees to consumers.
I support everything that the two rapporteurs have said.
One of the key points of future legislation is the mandatory application of HACCP in all food companies including those in the primary sector.
The analysis of risk and the control of critical points were formulated to be applied in the food industry and have, without doubt, represented a great step forward in the area of food hygiene.
However, in reality, many small companies have still not been able to put this into practice.
Precisely because it is not yet being applied throughout the processing sector, and because this system has been designed solely for industry, it should not be extended to the primary sector just yet.
The primary sector is already obliged to respect the 'good practice guides', a set of rules with similar aims to the HACCP but better adapted to the characteristics of this particular economic sector.
If there have been problems, these have not been due to the lack of standards, but to the lack of compliance with these standards.
I am not saying that in future the primary sector should be required to meet HACCP standards, rather that these should be adapted to the real requirements of agriculture and livestock farming.
The application of these standards should be considered to be an essential food safety practice, but it should never replace controls.
I believe we should concentrate on these and that they should be standardised for all countries.
Economic agents must take responsibility for the safety of food products, guarantee their viability and that of their ingredients and establish product withdrawal procedures in the event of an emergency.
Lastly, I would like to point out that exports, and, more importantly, imports must meet hygiene standards, because, otherwise, problems could creep up on us from abroad, whilst our companies will become less competitive compared with those that do not fulfil the same requirements.
Mr President, I salute the rapporteurs, who have done a very good job: skilled, knowledgeable and well thought through.
I am very pleased that primary production has been included and that we now finally cover the whole of the food chain.
I am also very pleased that individual producer liability has been specified again in the food legislation.
We shall not get anywhere merely with 'policing' power if people themselves do not take responsibility for their companies, work and own actions.
I personally am incredibly pleased about Mr Schnellhardt's willingness to compromise, so that we now have Article 4.4 (Amendment No 31) through which Europe's endlessly rich and varied stock of traditional food can remain on the market without individual Member States thereby being given the opportunity to ignore the regulations and label all their products as traditional.
By means of this wording, we have also ensured that we are not concerned here only with small-scale production. Some of Europe's most important food exports in fact consist of traditional cheeses and hams and so on which require special production methods without, however, being hazardous as a result.
I am very pleased that we have got this section through, for it would have been terrible if we had obtained food legislation in Europe which only suited NestlÃ© and McDonald's.
Finally, I want to point out that I too am very pleased that we have arrived at sensible and sustainable compromises where hunting is concerned.
I live in the middle of the forest in Sweden and should scarcely dare come home at all if some elk hunter had got the idea that I had banned elk hunting.
That is an extremely emotive issue, and I think we have arrived at a good compromise which both pheasant and elk hunters will be able to live with.
Mr President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for his work on an incredibly wide-ranging and complicated area.
The large number of amendments also show, of course, that the final product will look different to what the Commission had initially proposed.
In one area - namely, that of the way in which game is dealt with - the Commission's proposal would have created major problems if had been put into effect.
The Commission's proposal was in danger of having an extremely negative effect upon hunting and the sale of game in shops.
I believe that, by means of the amendments now adopted by the committees, we have avoided the risks that existed.
It is also important to see that a variety of national supervision models can be used to achieve the common objective of good food hygiene.
I am therefore especially grateful that account has been taken of the fact that game can be monitored in different ways, that we have different climatic conditions and therefore need different refrigeration periods and that we can also organise training in different ways.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in order to reform Community legislation on food hygiene rules - which involves 17 directives - the Commission is applying the principle of the liability of food operators.
I fully support the idea that this principle should apply to the food industry, which supplies food to millions of consumers.
But the directive attacks every aspect of primary production - in other words, products of the soil, of stockfarming, of hunting and of fisheries - upon which it is seeking to impose a restrictive traceability system.
How can we hold individuals personally liable for a mushroom picked in a forest or for a fish caught from a river?
This seems utterly unrealistic.
The first article, or the 'Scope', of the regulation specifies that these provisions shall not apply to the primary production of food for private domestic use or the domestic preparation of foodstuffs for private consumption.
We must extend this measure to include the supply of local markets and to the sale of natural products from primary production.
Local produce, such as berries and mushrooms, can contribute to a region's trademark image, strengthen its identity, its gastronomic reputation and encourage green tourism, which is essential to the rural economy.
Jobs and traditional methods are at stake.
As for game and game meat, delivered directly by the hunter to the consumer or retailer, these must be considered as traditional food products, which must benefit from specific marketing methods.
We believe that Amendment No 92 relating to Spiralis goes too far, since freezing or cooking at temperatures of above 65Â° will destroy any parasites.
The relevant authorities of each Member State are the best placed to weigh up the situation and to draw up guidelines which will provide the consumer with adequate protection.
We must see reason, by attaching priority to flexibility, given the diversity of geographic and climatic situations, rather than encasing ourselves in rigid regulations, which can only result in a dead-end situation and considerable dissatisfaction.
Mr President, food safety scandals have, in recent years, pointed up all too clearly the shortcomings related to the lack of defined responsibility.
That is why it is important to reintroduce clear, precise rules in this area, as well as to simplify the texts. Simplifying the texts does not mean, however, that we can relax requirements.
Very much the opposite in fact.
We must, therefore, define the responsibilities to be shouldered by manufacturers, such as the respect for rules, product traceability and the prior analysis of risks.
Manufacturers are the guarantors of high-quality food, in which consumers can have confidence.
Yes, the requirements are considerable, but these requirements can only help to improve the image of their products.
Consumers must also shoulder some responsibility: they must be able to have the freedom of choice, hence the important role of information and consumers' associations in this respect.
In addition to these texts which are before us, I would sincerely hope that the European Union decides to launch an information campaign to spread awareness regarding the essential hygiene measures that must be observed in the home.
These are the little things that we can do on an ongoing basis to help reduce the risks, such as the importance, for example, of cleaning the refrigerator, of storing products properly and at the appropriate temperature.
The authorities are also responsible for putting in place rigorous controls during manufacturing, production and sale, and for imposing effective sanctions, in the event of these controls being flouted, not only on the parties concerned, but also on the Member States which do not respect Community legislation. In other words, we must be seen to be very firm.
Lastly, we have had numerous discussions concerning game meat.
We must, of course, ensure the quality of this product and we know that procedures vary from one Member State to another.
We must place our trust in the professionals, in other words, the hunting community, who are perfectly capable of judging the state of hunted game.
I shall sum up, Mr President, by saying that we must reiterate that Europe has one of the safest food chains in the world and that we must quite simply respond to the expectations of our fellow citizens.
Mr President, I want to deal briefly with a number of amendments about which concern has been raised.
Amendment No 31 deals with products using traditional methods or sited in remote locations.
All of us have some examples of this kind.
I have seen this in the UK, with people trying to operate our beef assurance scheme.
We should defend this amendment because it specifically states that such products should have no demonstrable adverse effect on food hygiene.
Similarly the references to HACCP in Amendment No 9 are permissive and not mandatory, and the small business sector can live with that.
I now turn to the Goodwill/Bernier Amendment No 18, as Mr Goodwill would expect me to, exempting hunters from these regulations.
We accept this for the individual hunter consuming or passing on the game he has shot or caught.
But there is a difference between the noble Nordic hunter scaling the utmost peak in pursuit of an individual elk, the picture that Mr SjÃ¶stedt would commend to us, and the syndicates of flabby businessmen turning out on English landed estates, as they turn in a large quota of inexpertly shot birds and animals for the market.
In these circumstances, I believe that, if such products go to a retail outlet or a restaurant, there is a difference.
The great wit, Oscar Wilde, described the English hunting fraternity as the 'unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable'.
I do not mind that but when the 'unspeakable' begin to peddle the 'eatable', they should be open to the hygiene rules, as set down in this regulation.
I see no reason whatsoever why we should make an exemption where, what starts off as a little outlet doing no harm, a brace or two of birds here or there, ends up as another supply route.
We should protect the hunter's right to hunt but we should not guarantee him an unprotected route into retail outlets.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to briefly address the issue of hunting.
My view is that in certain Member States hunting brings an important extra source of food to the dining table.
For example, in my country two million small and 100 000 large wild game animals are hunted every year and there are 300 000 hunters.
It is therefore important.
Game animals are naturally also for sale on shop shelves or they are given or sold to neighbours and relatives.
Now the issue is whether it is reasonable for the EU to start regulating this sort of activity, which is often based on trust and close acquaintanceship.
It is as if social control were a guarantee of quality when a local shopkeeper buys meet from a hunter to sell.
A sense of moderation should be kept in these matters.
I am also wholeheartedly in favour of accepting Amendment No 82 in this report by Mr Schnellhardt.
Mr President, I believe that the proposal we have before us for a Council regulation in which animal-health rules are to be made more transparent and the existing directives brought together in a single text represents a further step towards simplifying agriculture policy in this area and above all towards creating a legal basis for controls on various activities.
I certainly hope it will work out that way.
However, I would also like to make a special plea for scientific research into products of animal origin to be continued on living animals in the case of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease for example, and that this should then be applied in an affordable way.
High new technical and organisational standards need to be practical, and by that I also mean affordable.
I also particularly have in mind food imports from third countries.
At the same time - and I am just finishing now - we need to provide sufficiently serious support for the many consumer protection organisations.
Mr President, though a flabby pinstriped businessman who enjoys shooting driven game, I want to concentrate on the aspect that we have 17 hygiene directives here being deregulated into one.
This regulation goes way beyond the directives that it replaces.
In particular, it extends Article 3 of Directive 93/43 which introduces what are know as the HACCP principles.
The hazard analysis and critical control points were developed in the 1960s for NASA to guarantee high purity food for astronauts.
Uncontrolled bodily functions in a space suit can be rather inconvenient!
But HACCP is a food safety management system devised for highly sophisticated food-processing operations.
This space-age system is to be made compulsory throughout the EU.
In the UK alone it is going to effect 300 000 businesses, costing an estimated GBP 2 billion a year for SMEs alone.
Something that has been developed for a sophisticated technology-based organisation is not appropriate for Joe's Cafe in Lewisham High Street or Jean Dupont's bistro in the rue de la RÃ©volution in Marseilles.
Earlier this year, in the very shadow of this building, I toured the local food markets with a food safety expert.
I found dozens of basic food hygiene failings.
There, and everywhere else, the basic provisions of Directive 93/43 have yet to be complied with.
So why is the Commission creating even more laws?
These technocrats are totally out of touch with reality.
They have gone into orbit and landed on another planet like the astronauts for which the HACCP system was devised.
For this reason alone the Commission should not be putting forward more law.
We do not need more complexity.
If Parliament endorses it, it proves that it too is living on another planet.
Mr President, I fully support the Commission's endeavours to simplify the legislative framework from 17 directives to a single regulation.
However, Commissioner, precisely because this is a regulation, you know better than I do that prudence must be exercised, for the regulation will be implemented immediately and, by its nature, harmonises, or rather, I would say, as good as standardises all the procedures throughout the vast area of the Union in the food and gastronomy sector, which, we must never forget, is a major part of the culture and civilisation of our continent.
I therefore agree that there is a need for harmonisation, but we must remember to exercise caution.
I would like to focus on three points, in particular.
The first, which has been fully addressed in the report and by the rapporteur, is the question of traditional products, products which have a history not just as products but in terms of their production processes too.
Restricting these products to geographical areas or local markets is not enough: they are genuine products which need to be dealt with separately.
Secondly, the question of the primary sector, which is certainly not fully covered by the regulation but which is regulated to some extent.
The situation is different for the primary sector, particularly where small and medium-sized businesses are concerned.
I have tabled an amendment which I urge you to support, which seeks, at least, to reduce the bureaucratic, administrative impact as regards keeping documents - it makes no sense for records relating to vegetables to have to be kept for five years.
Thirdly - apart from the question of game, which I will mention briefly in passing, with regard to which a balanced solution appears to have been found - there is training.
It is right to ensure that our food chain operators are always trained.
With regard to this aspect too, we must avoid enlarging the scope of the debate to include quality, which is a separate issue: there must be training on hygiene and hygiene alone.
Mr President, it would, to say the least, be naÃ¯ve to maintain that the food industry is in a parlous state due to a lack of updated directives, given that what directives exist are blatantly disregarded.
Before any legislative intervention or questions of a technical nature, we need to identify why not just food products but the entire food chain has been downgraded, distorted and adulterated.
It is mainly because the food chain is managed solely on the basis of the laws of profit and speculation that the quality of food is so poor.
The more intensively we farm, the more the food chain is run and controlled by the huge multinationals in the industry, which decide the method of production and the quality of our food, the less chance we have of any effective consumer health guarantees.
This problem is first and foremost a political problem.
Only by wiping out capitalist profit as the ultimate purpose of the production process will we be able to stop illegal and dangerous production, processing and marketing methods.
Otherwise, we shall strain at a gnat and swallow a camel and public health will suffer as a result.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schnellhardt has presented two expert and in-depth reports which clearly improve the Commission's proposals on food hygiene.
In future, food producers and processors will have to document all steps in the production and processing chain.
This obligation also extends to the feedstuffs used and the state of health of animals.
This means that in future consumers in the EU will be able to trace food and food ingredients from the shop counter back to the producer.
A transparent production chain will thus be guaranteed both for major companies and for SMEs.
At this point I would like to make a particular point about SMEs in the meat processing business.
In the European Union, there are around 150 000 small-scale butchery workshops with a total of over 1 million employees and an annual turnover of around EUR 60 billion.
It is these small workshops that ensure local supplies and maintain a variety of products in rural areas.
They use their special skills to produce local specialities and make an important contribution to Europe's delicatessens.
The close contact between them and the consumer creates confidence in the quality and safety of their products.
That is why we need to pay special attention to the needs of small businesses and to come up with suitable and practical legal arrangements for these companies, which offer people in Europe so many jobs and training opportunities.
I have tabled an amendment jointly with the rapporteur which relates specially to single-place slaughter in butcher's workshops because in addition to rules governing slaughter lines in large slaughterhouses we also need to take account of the conditions that prevail in small-scale slaughter operations.
If sufficient care and expertise is applied, single-place slaughter can be carried out in perfectly hygienic conditions.
That is why I urge you to support Amendment No 133.
Mr President, I am an elk hunter in Lapland in northern Sweden.
If we do not hunt elk every year, the elk population grows rapidly, the number of people killed in road accidents rises and there is a considerable increase in damage to the forests.
When, in September, we begin hunting in the morning, it is often freezing, and the climate at that time of the year corresponds to the temperature in a refrigerator.
Sometimes, it even corresponds to the temperature in a freezer.
In my part of the country, there is, from the environmental point of view, no better refrigerator for the hunter than nature's own cold-storage room.
The bigger the EU becomes, the more difficult it becomes to regulate in detail using EU provisions.
The EU directives must hold good in all parts of the EU.
They must provide scope for adjusting the provisions according to different circumstances.
Member States with up-and-running procedures governing the inspection of game before it is released onto the market must be able to retain their rules.
In Sweden, politicians who want to influence opinion against European cooperation have exploited this proposal for a directive to cast suspicion on the EU as a threat to traditional hunting.
It is important to emphasise that they are mistaken, for the EU has no legal powers to regulate hunting for household requirements and the use of game for private consumption.
This also emphasises the need for general provisions governing hunting to be decided upon in accordance with the subsidiarity principle.
Through Mr Schnellhardt's efforts, the section on game in this directive has become really commendable.
Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament will deliver its opinion tomorrow on a package of regulations that aim to guarantee the hygiene of foodstuffs in general and to establish specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin in particular.
This new legislation is based on the fundamental need to guarantee food safety from farm to table, along the lines of the initiatives that have been adopted over the past months in order to provide the consumer with the best possible guarantees.
At this point, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has made a great effort in trying to achieve consensus between all the groups. I think he has written an excellent report.
I should also like to congratulate the Commission on having also presented a reasonably well-balanced proposal.
One of the key points of the future regulation, however, is the mandatory application of the HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) for all food establishments.
The application of the HACCP standard should, however, be considered as an additional safety measure, which cannot replace official controls.
The HACCP system cannot be extended, for the moment, to the primary sector, given that this system has been designed exclusively for industry.
The primary sector is already obliged to respect the 'good practice guides', a set of rules with similar aims to the HACCP but better adapted to the characteristics of this particular economic sector, and which we should not aim to duplicate.
The various food crises that have taken place make it necessary to strengthen hygiene regulations in order to regain consumer confidence, an objective that the European Commission has duly included in its proposal and which will no doubt be improved by the European Parliament with the approval of its amendments on the basis of traditional products, game, and so on, listed by the Members of this House who have spoken before me.
Economic agents must continue to shoulder responsibility for food safety, ensure traceability of food and food ingredients and must put in place product withdrawal procedures in case of food emergencies.
Codes of good practice should be established by the various food sectors in order to give guidance to food business operators on food safety.
Also, imports from and imports to third countries must comply with Community hygiene standards.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
A5-0119/2002 by Marit Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Council Directive 92/117/EEC (COM(2001) 452 - C5-0372/2001 - 2001/0176(COD));
A5-0120/2002 by Marit Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the control of salmonella and other food-borne zoonotic agents and amending Council Directives 64/432/EEC, 72/462/EEC and 90/539/EEC (COM(2001) 452 - C5-0373/2001 - 2001/0177(COD)).
. (SV) Mr President, I wish first of all to thank the shadow rapporteurs and others in the informal food safety group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for cooperating so well.
Naturally, the Commission's initiative in both reports was also welcome.
I shall talk first of all about the monitoring directive.
It is necessary to obtain a clear and unambiguous picture of the zoonoses situation in Europe.
Of course, we are talking about the food scandals that have affected us, most recently an acrylamide alert in Sweden.
We must remember, however, that, even if all these warning reports are serious in themselves, they are in actual fact more serious from a psychological than from a public health point of view.
The big threat for the future is the old familiar one which people have lived with for millions of years and which the developing world still lives with.
Even in our own time, the most common causes of mortality among infants are in actual fact infectious illnesses and diarrhoea.
For us in the rich part of the world, it is resistance to antibiotics which will be the big problem.
More and more of our simple infections are tending to become serious again.
We should have put the brakes on twenty years ago, so it is already late and perhaps even too late, but there is a danger that, if we cannot radically and quickly reduce the number of infections and antibiotic treatments, we shall soon be back to where we were in our great-grandmothers' time when almost every woman had to give birth to four children if two were to reach adulthood.
The problem is greatest for children and young people.
I am therefore very grateful that we are now to chart antibiotic resistance to the zoonoses we discover in Europe.
Statistics now indicate that salmonella infection and other animal food-borne infections are tending to decline slowly, while vegetable-borne infection is on the increase.
I am therefore very concerned that vegetable food be included in investigations for the purpose of, for example, tracing outbreaks.
The most important thing of all about the monitoring directive is that we should obtain common standards so that the information collected is comparable between the different countries.
We must have a standardisation of sampling, reporting and the way in which these matters are dealt with.
I should also like to draw attention to the fact that new technology should actually make good reporting simpler and quicker so that we do not have to wait two and a half years to be clear about the situation.
Greater speed is often required so that it will be possible to inform authorities, producers and citizens at a relatively early stage.
That is probably the most important feature of the monitoring directive.
The control regulation is perhaps more controversial.
The Commission's proposal was very cautious and restrained and seemed to take account of the fact that certain Member States imagine that salmonella is in something like the same category as a mild cold.
That is the kind of attitude that exists.
There are also Member States affected by salmonella panic of the kind that exists in my own country.
There is nothing strange about such panic.
Approximately 50 years ago, we were hit by the world's biggest salmonella disaster ever, or at least the biggest for which statistics were kept.
Subsequently, Sweden began to try to do something about the problem, as naturally happens as a consequence of disasters.
It took our country 25-30 years to put in place a system that worked.
Matters have proceeded more quickly for Norway and Finland, which have been able to copy the Swedish model.
The Swedish model provides us with experience but is presumably too distinctive and not applicable everywhere.
Sweden is a small, sparsely populated and open country, which perhaps made it simpler for us to attend to the problems.
I think that the proposal is extremely cautious.
There is a sense of 'pussyfooting' around the problem.
I had expected the Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection to be tougher in this case.
First of all, not all forms of salmonella of significance to public health are included.
It is strange that, in certain places, only two kinds are included, even though it is precisely these that account for 80% of illnesses among people today.
Or, more precisely, did account for that figure in the past.
What is happening with the remaining 20%?
Why not include all illnesses that affect, or are dangerous to, public health when efforts are being made to control salmonella?
How can the Commission know what type of salmonella will explode onto the scene tomorrow?
Will it be St. Paul, Hadar or some other form?
We have a vast number of invasive forms of salmonella affecting people's health.
I am therefore keen that the wording, 'of significance for public health' should be included, and account taken of all forms of salmonella.
Species of animal are also missing from the Commission's proposal.
I am conscious of the fact that, for safety's sake, I have included all types of animal, but I shall continue to fight on behalf of intensively reared pigs and veal calves, because we all know that the quantity of antibiotics used is very dangerous.
We also know that the feed concerned contains both zoonotic and other bacteria that are wholly resistant to antibiotics.
There are, moreover so many simple and practical circumstances that are of relevance that, even if we can ensure that the breeding animals and stalls are kept clean, that does not help one iota if the food is not clean.
We know, for example, that a very great source of infection with salmonella aruba is Brazilian soya.
We know the story about salmonella normally being killed off at 67 degrees.
For ten years, however, aruba has succeeded in surviving at 68 degrees.
We should probably not imagine that we shall one day become completely free from risk or that this battle will have been won once and for all.
It is, after all, life with which we are concerned here, life which is in some ways as intelligent as ourselves, even if the intelligence concerned is not perhaps to be found in the same place or does not express itself in the same way.
I would therefore appeal to the House to support my two reports, just as they were adopted by a broad majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the Commission on their balanced proposal, both in the directive and in the regulation on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, which we will be voting on in Parliament tomorrow.
These are matters of great importance for all EU States.
For some EU States these are not only matters of great importance, but of the utmost importance.
I would like to express my great concern at the result of the vote on the report presented in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, given that, in my opinion, it takes our concern for consumers' health to irrational extremes.
We are all worried about the health implications of salmonella - as Mrs Paulsen has just pointed out - even more so in countries such as Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal and France, that are particularly exposed to this danger due to the volume of livestock susceptible to infection as a result of average temperatures that favour its propagation and of another set of circumstances that are not worth going into now.
However, I do not understand that, on the pretext of protecting consumers' interests, some EU countries support the extension of control and surveillance measures to agents that cannot be transmitted to humans, in other words, non-zoonotic agents that do not fall within the scope of these regulations.
The only types of salmonella that affect humans are salmonella enteritiris and salmonella tifimurium, and to extend Community regulation to other types, more than twelve, in fact, will only, in my opinion, cause serious commercial consequences that would penalise the aforementioned EU countries and small producers.
Producers in northern Europe, where the incidence of salmonella is virtually zero due to the climatic conditions there, would not be affected by this move.
Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore call on you to support the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which includes the sentiments of many countries that have expressed their concern in this regard in all the debates that have been held, both in Council of Ministers and Commission's working groups.
This amendment guarantees consumer safety, given that it includes all the improvements proposed by the European Commission, yet penalises no one.
I regret that the report approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Heath and Consumer Policy has not taken the main countries affected into consideration and I hope that this situation will be resolved, if not in tomorrow's plenary, then in the negotiations in the next Progress Council and in the negotiations that will have to be undertaken as part of the codecision procedure, given that these measures will be hard to achieve.
I also regret that there are a series of gaps that have not been sufficiently analysed in Parliament, such as, for example, the loophole mentioned in Article 9 of the Regulation, which anticipates the paralysis of trade in those countries whose national control programmes are not approved.
This initiative could give rise to a situation of clear commercial discrimination.
The report approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in my opinion, has not been sufficiently tailored to the needs of each country and also falls into this trap.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, first of all, I would like to address my thanks to our rapporteur and congratulate her on the significance and the high quality of her work.
The two proposals take up some of the commitments given in the White Paper on Food Safety.
They aim to improve protection of European consumers against microbiological risks from food products.
We cannot underestimate the extent to which successive food crises, including those linked to salmonella, have undermined consumer confidence regarding food safety.
We can, therefore, only support the approval of the two texts which have been submitted to us today.
We must strengthen the monitoring and control system of zoonotic agents of animal origin in order to reduce their prevalence, whilst stressing that the effectiveness of the texts that are currently in force has been restricted by the fact that some Member States are failing to apply these texts properly.
Overall, the Commission's proposals are balanced.
It might have been better, however, to go further on certain points and consequently I, like the rapporteur, believe that it would be worthwhile providing for control programmes for all the salmonella serotypes that present a risk to public health.
I also wish to stress the need for strict coordination between the work of the European Food Authority and the work of the national authorities so that the early warning system functions effectively.
Regarding resistance to antibiotics, I believe, like the rapporteur, that we must treat this worrying phenomenon with due attention.
Careful use of antibiotics must be encouraged and the necessary studies on resistance to antibiotics must be carried out.
My group also supports the amendment seeking to allow the Member States that have achieved a high level of protection to prevent, for a limited period, the placing on the market of products imported from Member States which do not yet have an approved control programme within the stipulated timeframe.
This measure will act as a considerable incentive to introduce harmonisation of security levels within the internal market.
I welcome the fact that the applicable control measures are based on objectives that are set every three years.
This will enable us to set ambitious but realistic constraints.
We must ensure that we do not go too far and impose timetables on Member States that they will be unable to apply.
The Commission has, in this area, striven to achieve a balance.
Like the rapporteur I believe it is important for the monitoring of zoonoses and their agents to apply to all levels of the food chain, including animal foodstuffs.
My group also supports the principle of including vegetables within the scope of the directive.
Lastly, we must work to ensure that these provisions are swiftly adopted and implemented, which will, I am sure, contribute to restoring European consumer confidence in food.
Mr President, following the demise of Edwina Currie, the British health minister, who in 1988 said that most of the UK's egg production was infected with salmonella, it is a brave British politician who makes a speech on this subject.
Following that bombshell, egg consumption in the UK fell by 60% and the government embarked on what can only be described as knee-jerk reaction, when they slaughtered 2 million chickens.
Although some progress has been made in combating salmonella in the UK, there is still much work to be done.
There are still 15,000 or 16,000 cases per year of salmonella food poisoning in the UK, half the previous levels.
Of course, this is not just a problem in Europe.
In the United States in 1994, there was a case connected with contaminated ice cream where nearly a quarter of a million people became ill.
Sweden, as Mrs Paulsen has said, has led the way but there they have looked at, for example, heat treatment of feed rather than just looking at the blunt tool of slaughter of flocks.
Of course, we hear stories now of Swedes going to Spain on holiday and falling like flies from salmonella food poisoning because they are not used to the constant exposure.
It is certainly true that Member States need to make progress to establish more effective national control programmes and at the same time, we need to ensure that imported products meet our own high standards.
We must also concentrate on where the problem is, and that is poultry, and in particular eggs which are eaten raw.
Pork is less of a problem and, anyway, my grandmother would say that anyone eating raw pork deserves to be ill.
Infection in cattle and sheep is negligible so we can continue to eat our rare steak.
On the issue of antibiotic resistance, there is resistance building up.
However, we should not rush to ban prophylactic antibiotic use, as we could then see an explosion of disease prompting high levels of the resultant therapeutic use that could exacerbate the situation.
Lastly, on the issue of plant-based infection, maybe that has something to do with the increase in organic food consumption where I understand you are 30 times more likely to get e-coli infection.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Paulsen, my colleague on many food safety deliberations, for the work she has done on these complex regulations.
It is absolutely crucial that having set out the broad principles of a European food law and a food safety authority to act as the overall scrutineer of such proposals, the details are dealt with effectively and accurately.
The zoonoses regulations to which Mrs Paulsen has devoted so much time are in a way the building blocks of the provision of an effective and precautionary food law for the future.
It may seem rather over-elaborate to talk of them as building blocks, but they are an appropriate way to move forward.
Some of us have reservations, perhaps, about the extension of these provisions, as they stand, to products of plant origin.
An appropriate way to deal with them is through the hygiene regulations per se and not in these additional monitoring provisions.
There only I dissent slightly from what Mrs Patrie has said.
Otherwise, I applaud her remarks also.
I feel that, on the general detection and prevention of salmonella, the rapporteur is right to take us down this road as long as it can be implemented the length and breadth of the European Union.
It is as necessary for food producers as for the general public.
Without the restored confidence of the latter, there cannot be a secure future for the former.
We want to have the increasing antibiotic resistance, which is being demonstrated at the moment in zoonotic organisms, accurately mapped.
I do not agree with Mr Goodwill that there may be more harm than good in that.
It is not a question of preventive medicine - it is of the other applications to which antibiotics are put, and wrongly, in my view.
Mr President, I am delighted to respond to this debate on the two reports concerning zoonoses.
This is an example of the implementation of the farm-to-fork approach highlighted in the White Paper on Food Safety.
Our proposals are much more ambitious than the current directive.
To ensure their successful implementation we need to allow sufficient time for Member States to meet these objectives.
This dossier has progressed quickly.
First, may I offer my thanks to all those Members who have driven this dossier forward - in particular Mrs Paulsen and the Members of the Committee on the Environment, who have made such valuable contributions.
Public interest in food safety is immense, as we know.
Protection against zoonoses, disease transmission between animals and humans, is a growing concern not only in the European Union, but throughout the world.
The first proposal, on the monitoring of zoonotic agents, is the basis for improving knowledge of the sources and trends of these pathogens, supporting microbiological risk assessments, and adopting risk management measures.
The European Food Safety Authority will obviously play a key role in this exercise.
The second proposal, on the control of salmonella, aims to reduce the public health burden caused by this agent.
Over 150 000 human cases of salmonella are reported every year in the European Union.
The regulation will apply to primary production - a major source of contamination.
While some Member States have seen a reduction in human cases following stringent control measures, the situation varies considerably.
The Commission therefore favoured a progressive approach to reducing salmonella occurrence.
But the strategy is clear: to ensure high standards of food safety to European consumers, the prevalence of these pathogens must be reduced.
The primary target is salmonella, an important pathogen for which we know efficient control measures can be taken, starting at primary production.
Other pathogens may be added in the future, if measures in animal populations can be shown to be efficient in reducing human cases.
Many amendments were discussed in the Committee on the Environment, and I am grateful for the quality of the result, which is excellent.
The majority of the amendments are technical and improve the proposals.
I welcome these amendments, which represent important and rational suggestions.
Mr President, instead of dwelling on all the amendments that I am happy to accept, I will instead concentrate on those that cause the Commission some difficulty.
I will start with the first of Mrs Paulsen's reports, dealing with the directive on the monitoring of zoonotic agents.
I can accept most of the amendments on this proposal.
I will start with comitology.
I welcome the acceptance of our proposal on the adoption of implementing measures.
I can accept that, in addition to the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, the Commission may be assisted, where appropriate, by the Committee on the Human Communicable Diseases Network.
This may, however, lead to some delays in adopting implementing decisions.
I can also accept that certain basic criteria be transferred from the annexes to the articles.
However, I do not accept that systematic prior consultation with the European Food Safety Authority is required for any transitional measure or before amending the annexes.
Certain actions are administrative and do not require scientific expertise.
I cannot therefore accept Amendment No 22.
Shortening the deadline for Member States to report on their monitoring activities from five months to three months is overly ambitious, considering the time needed to collect and compile data.
Experience with the current reporting system shows that five months is already optimistic.
I therefore reject the relevant part of Amendment No 20.
Systematic microbiological studies during investigation of food-borne outbreaks may not always be possible if the suspected food is no longer available.
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 18.
I can support Amendments Nos 28 to 33, which enlarge the scope of the monitoring of anti-microbial resistance, and supersede Amendments Nos 15 and 21.
The other amendments are either wholly or partly acceptable, subject to editorial amendments.
I come now to the regulation on the control of salmonella and other zoonotic agents.
For the same reasons as on the proposed directive, I reject Amendment No 10 that shortens the deadline for Member States to report on the implementation of their control programmes.
I also reject Amendment No 27 that requires consultation of the European Food Safety Authority systematically before taking transitional or implementing measures or amending the annexes.
An overriding long-term objective to avoid completely the presence of zoonotic agents in the feed and food chain is unrealistic.
All reasonable efforts must be made to reduce the risk from zoonotic agents to a very low level.
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 7.
Amendments Nos 1 and 16 would introduce food of plant origin into this control regulation, but this should be tackled under the food hygiene package, as Mr Whitehead said.
I therefore reject Amendment Nos 1 and 16.
I would note that as I can accept Amendments Nos 1, 6 and 12 on the proposed directive the monitoring of zoonoses in products of plant origin would be covered.
Amendments Nos 2 and 22 provide for additional guarantees not only for salmonella, but possibly for other zoonotic agents.
Although additional guarantees may constitute an incentive for Member States, extending them to zoonotic agents other than salmonella would create additional barriers to trade.
Moreover, additional guarantees for food should be tackled under the food hygiene package.
I therefore reject Amendments Nos 2 and 22.
I come now to Amendment No 24, and the sanctions to be applied to Member States.
Sanctions are a horizontal issue, not only for zoonoses.
The Commission is finalising a draft regulation on official feed and food controls, in which the issue of sanctions will be tackled.
I therefore cannot accept Amendment No 24 for that reason.
An amendment to Article 8 on the prohibition on the use of antibiotics for preventive or growth promotion purposes was rejected in the Committee on the Environment, but not the recital to the same effect.
Amendment No 37 would restrict the use of antibiotics to therapeutic purposes only.
The Commission has already announced the total phasing-out of anti-microbials used for growth promotion.
The Commission will ask for a scientific opinion on the risks and benefits of the use of antibiotics in medicines to control salmonella.
For these reasons, and for consistency, I reject Amendments Nos 3 and 37.
Amendments Nos 36 and 38 and the relevant parts of Amendments Nos 29 and 32, on the targets and measures for laying hens and slaughter pigs are acceptable, subject to review of the sampling for pigs and, possibly, setting a different timetable for breeding pigs and for slaughter pigs.
We need a scientific opinion before setting additional targets for calves, other cattle and sheep.
Moreover, adding targets should be considered on the basis of the experience with the implementation of the new regulation.
I therefore reject the relevant parts of Amendments Nos 29 and 32.
On Amendment No 35 on targets, it is evident that these are needed for those zoonotic serotypes with public health significance.
However, this amendment goes much further, and it is not practicable.
I therefore reject the relevant part of Amendment No 35.
Amendment No 33 would require the eradication in poultry breeding flocks of all salmonella serotypes with public health significance, instead of just two serotypes.
Given the difficult experience with the current zoonoses directive, this objective is overly ambitious.
It would also contradict the principle of flexibility for Member States to set the necessary control measures.
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 33.
Shortening the deadline for laboratories to apply international standards for quality assurance schemes seems unrealistic, considering the time needed to prepare and reach accreditation.
I therefore reject that part of Amendment No 26.
Amendment No 25 requires the European Food Safety Authority and the Food and Veterinary Office to be closely involved in monitoring that equivalent control programmes exist in third countries.
Control programmes are essentially a management issue and do not fall within the remit of the EFSA.
I therefore reject that part of Amendment No 25.
The other amendments are either wholly or partly acceptable, subject to editorial amendments.
I hope that Parliament understands the reasoning behind the decisions to reject or accept in part some of the amendments put forward.
A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is being provided to Parliament.
I trust that this will be included in the Minutes of this session.
Finally, may I repeat my sincere thanks to all those who have participated in this huge effort.
Along with the food hygiene package, the zoonoses proposals mark another important step in our review of food legislation, in pursuit of our objective to ensure that European consumers have access to the safest possible food supply in the world.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0121/2002) by Alexander de Roo, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise (PE-CONS 3611/2002 - C5-0098/2002 - 2000/0194(COD)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, except that the ladies and gentlemen have all gone home, which is unfortunate as this is an important topic.
I should in any case like to thank the fellow MEPs of the other groups who have seen this issue through over the past two years: Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on behalf of the Christian-Democrats, Mr Maaten on behalf of the Liberals and Mrs Scheele on behalf of the Socialists.
I should also like to thank Mr Provan who chaired the delegation in the conciliation committee.
In addition, I should like to express thanks to the Commission for its fruitful cooperation, at first reading and second reading and during most of the conciliation phase.
Finally, also a word of thanks to the Spanish Presidency.
They were very constructive and have finished where the Belgian Presidency left off.
During the conciliation phase, there were, in fact, three important points on the agenda, which I will outline below.
Parliament has also asked for slightly lower noise levels, to be measured.
This is important, for experience has taught my country that if only the high, and highest levels, are measured, lower noise levels spread over much larger areas.
Parliament has achieved more or less half of what we set out to achieve: straightforward success.
My second point concerns the objective, which has been tightened up considerably.
The Council of Ministers only talks about controlling the adverse effects.
In plain terms, this translates into noise barriers along motorways.
However, experience, has taught us that this must be approached in a much more structured way.
Noise itself has to be tackled by means of low-noise tyres or road surfaces, for example.
Far greater progress can be made with these.
I am pleased that the Council has finally agreed that the objective should be to reduce noise and not only to control and reduce the negative effects.
I should like to finish off with the most important, and at the same time most controversial, point, namely the obligation to lay down directives concerning the most important sources of noise.
This particularly concerns road traffic, which is the most significant source of noise anyway, aircraft noise and noise generated by trains, but also noise from outdoor machinery and noise from machinery in factories that penetrates into the outside world.
Parliament - and it really was the whole of Parliament - has asked for directives to tackle these sources, and not only to measure them.
This was by no means an absurd request.
As early as in 1992, the Fifth Environmental Action Programme, written by Laurens Jan Brinkhorst as the highest environmental official at the time, stated that the Commission would present a proposal for measuring noise in 1994 - the proposal did not actually appear until 2000 - and that the Commission would present the directives in 1995.
Maybe the Commission could explain why, for some reason, these proposals never saw the light of day.
The only pledge Parliament has now made, and the Council has fortunately seconded this, is that the Commission will be proposing this daughter directive by no later than 2006, in other words eleven years later than it had announced itself.
In view of the importance of the topic of noise, which affects one third of European citizens in a very negative way, I will not make an issue of this, but I hope that the Commission, as we have agreed, will in fact be presenting a kind of Green Paper in eighteen months' time about the direction to take regarding these daughter directives.
I hope at any rate that in a number of areas, for example with regard to tyres, we will not need to wait for four years before the Commission presents new proposals.
This is where I shall leave my contribution, as time is getting on.
Mr President, I am very pleased that the Environmental Noise Directive, which the Commission proposed in July 2000, is now entering the final stage of its adoption.
Noise is an important environmental problem which we know concerns millions of EU citizens.
Thus the Commission is glad that this new legislation will soon enter into force and allow better protection of people exposed to environmental noise in Europe.
There is already a set of existing EU legislation relating to noise sources such as motor vehicles, aircraft, equipment used outdoors and so on.
I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr de Roo, as well as to all the members of the parliamentary delegation and the Conciliation Committee.
I appreciate the commitment that Mr de Roo has shown to this issue.
In particular, the Commission takes due note of the strong interest expressed by your institution for legislation relating to sources of noise.
However, while the Commission welcomes the agreement on a joint text, which was reached on 8 April 2002 by the Conciliation Committee, we have serious concerns with regard to the provisions of modified Article 1 of this directive.
For this reason the Commission has decided to make the following declaration:
The Commission takes note of the text agreed for Article 1 of the Environmental Noise Directive by the Members of the Conciliation Committee for the European Parliament and the Council.
The Commission considers that legislative proposals to reduce noise emissions from all major sources should be made on the basis of robust evidence supporting such proposals.
This is in line with the knowledge-based approach for policy making as proposed in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and approved by the European Parliament and the Council.
In this regard the reports required for Member States under the directive, on the basis of harmonised noise indicators, will be an essential element.
The provision of such data across the Community will allow the impact and benefits of possible measures to be properly assessed prior to presenting Community legislative proposals.
Therefore, and in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Commission will evaluate the need to come forward with new legislative proposals, reserving its right to decide as and when it would be appropriate to present any such proposals.
This is consistent with the Commission's right of initiative as laid out in the Treaty, while the requirements of Article 1(2) relating to the submission of new proposals within a fixed timeframe appear to be prejudicial to this right.
That is the statement the Commission wishes to make.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Preparation for the EU/Latin America Summit (Madrid, 17/18 May 2002)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation for the EU/Latin America Summit, which is to be held in Madrid on 17 and 18 May 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in June 1999 the first Summit of Heads of State and Government between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean took place in RÃ­o de Janeiro on the initiative of France and Spain.
During this Summit, Spain offered to host a second one which was agreed at the time, and which furthermore would coincide with the Spanish Presidency of the European Union.
Therefore, as planned, the Summit will take place in Madrid on the 17th and 18th of this month, that is, on Friday and Saturday of this week.
The profound changes which took place in European and in the Americas during the 90s and the mutual desire to establish a general framework for bi-regional relations were the prime motives for staging the RÃ­o Summit.
At the end of that Summit, the Heads of State and Government adopted two important documents: the RÃ­o Declaration, which established the general principles to be applied to relations between Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and a second document, designated as an Action Plan, which identified the 55 priority areas in the political, economic, cultural, educational and social fields, amongst others, which should form the basis for a strategic bi-regional partnership between the two sides of the Atlantic.
Through this Madrid Summit, the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean are committing themselves to deepening this partnership so that both regions can together confront the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities offered by the new 21st Century.
In Madrid, the Heads of State and Government propose to adopt three documents: an evaluation report recording what has been achieved since the Rio Summit, a document presenting the increasingly numerous common positions and values we share, and, finally, a political declaration which, as well as announcing the consolidation of our strategic bi-regional partnership, will list the firm commitments made at the highest level by both regions in the political, economic and cooperation fields and which go further than the measures adopted at the first Summit.
Until 1999, relations between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean had been based on a mainly sub-regional approach.
Political dialogue and cooperation were designed for the various sub-regional realities, in other words, dialogue was subdivided.
We established the San JosÃ© dialogue for Central America, the dialogue with the Andean Community, Mercosur, Icaricom, and apart from certain exceptions, such as Mexico and Chile, which had a particular specific relationship, practically all the dialogue centred on differing sub-regional units.
The Rio Summit had the merit of introducing this new bi-regional approach, which has undoubtedly added weight to relations between the European Union and the sub-regions and individual countries.
With a view to this second Summit, the Spanish Presidency has worked intensively to make substantial progress on the three strategic dimensions I have mentioned.
Furthermore, we must stress that we have wanted this strategic relationship between the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean from now on to be the framework or benchmark on which the European Union's relations with each of the subregional areas or individual countries of Latin America and the Caribbean will be built.
From the point of view of political dialogue, the European Union's priorities in relation to Latin America and the Caribbean, during the short period between the Rio Summit and today, have essentially been the strengthening of democracy and the Rule of Law, the defence of human rights, the fight against drug-trafficking, as well as the promotion of regional integration and coordination between the different positions of both regions in relation to the international agenda within the framework of international organisations and conferences.
At the Madrid Summit, both regions wish to take a further step, in not only a quantitative but also a qualitative sense, which would consist of a better structuring of political dialogue and a broader range of issues for discussion, which would also cover those not relating to regional problems.
We hope that this step forward will lead to the development of a common approach to world issues.
From an economic point of view we should begin by stressing that the European Union is very different from Latin America and the Caribbean in economic and social terms.
The population of Latin America and the Caribbean is greater than that of the Europe of the Fifteen - I am not talking about the enlarged Europe, since that will clearly have a larger population - and on the whole it is very young, that is to say it comprises very low age ranges.
Average per capita income in Latin America and the Caribbean is little over EUR 3 000 per year, while the average in the Union is seven times greater.
The bi-regional market continues to offer many opportunities for trade.
Between 1990 and 2000 European exports have increased from approximately EUR 17 billion to EUR 54 billion, in other words they have almost trebled.
European imports from Latin American and Caribbean countries during that same period have increased from approximately EUR 27 billion to EUR 58 billion. In other words, they have doubled.
Despite this spectacular increase in volume, imports originating from Latin America and the Caribbean have gone from 24% of the total in 1990 to just 12% of the total in 2000.
In relative terms, trade between the two sides of the Atlantic is decreasing, but it is increasing within the American continent.
There has also been a considerable increase in direct European investment in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The European Union is currently the biggest investor in the region.
Investments have risen from EUR 66 billion in 1997 to EUR 122 billion in 1999, which represents almost 11% of all European foreign investment and almost two-thirds of European investments in non-OECD countries.
This investment, Mr President, is a great reflection of the European Union's confidence in and commitment to the whole Latin American and Caribbean region and without doubt makes a great contribution to the growth of economic activity and the creation of employment in that region.
Furthermore, and above all, the Europe of the Fifteen shares deep historical, political and cultural roots with Latin America and the Caribbean, which help in the development of a genuine identity and a genuine strategic partnership.
These common positions and values are creating important ties in terms of identity and solidarity and are encouraging both regions to exchange more and more of their own experiences and to combine their resources in order to resolve common problems.
Amongst the challenges which the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean must face is the need to modernise education systems, to create an economic and social climate favourable to sustainable development and to establish mechanisms for good governance.
The promotion of a strategic partnership cannot be based purely on a common identity, whether this be historical, cultural or political, but must be the result of a shared interest in order to turn principles, values and objectives into practical mechanisms for dialogue and cooperation, so that the two regions can confront all the great challenges of this new millennium in a united fashion.
On the 17th and 18th in Madrid, the Heads of State and Government of the 48 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean and the European Union who will attend the Summit - let us remember that this Summit of Heads of State and Government is the largest and broadest to be held in the Union, since we are talking about 48 Heads of State and Government - are going to try to give significant impetus to the strategic bi-regional partnership, which, as I said earlier, began in RÃ­o de Janeiro in 1999.
In each of the strategic pillars on which this partnership is based, the political, the economic and cooperation in the social, educational and cultural fields, both regions have wanted to take a significant step forward.
I would like to make a special mention of the joint fight against terrorism, through compliance with all the international conventions in this field, as well as the application of all the relevant United Nations resolutions.
Efforts will continue to strengthen democratic institutions and the Rule of Law, paying particular attention to human rights and the strengthening of judicial systems, with a view to guaranteeing the equal treatment of all people before the law.
Equally, account will be taken of the entry into force of the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court which, as the honourable Members are aware, has been ratified by many Latin American and Caribbean countries.
The intention is to strengthen political dialogue and consultation within the United Nations system, as well as other international fora, on the most important issues on the international agenda.
In terms of economic and commercial issues we must stress that on 25 April we were able to successfully complete the process of negotiating an association agreement between the European Union and Chile. This is a free trade agreement between the two parties.
It is truly innovative in economic terms, unquestionably the most advanced of all those reached between the European Union and other third countries and there has been no hesitation in describing it as a fourth-generation agreement.
It is perhaps the free trade agreement that has dealt with the highest number of issues and included the highest number of considerations and there is no doubt that this opens the way for other agreements of this type, both in that region and in other parts of the world.
We should remember, however, that in that region we are trying to establish a free trade agreement between two regions of economic integration - the European Union and Mercosur - and therefore the agreement reached with Chile sets a precedent for something truly historic; the establishment of a free trade agreement between two common markets or between two regions of economic integration.
Since it is relevant here, I would also like to mention the recent approval by the General Affairs Council of a proposal for future European Union relations with the Andean Community and with Central America which opens the way for the consideration of the creation of free trade areas between the European Union and both regions and in order to intensify not only cooperation but also political dialogue, which is an added value which did not exist previously in the agreements with these countries.
We all know that the difficult internal situation being experienced by certain South American countries is hindering the complex negotiations for a partnership agreement between the European Union and Mercosur which I referred to earlier.
The truth is that the Summit wishes to acknowledge the results of the negotiation, in which the political, institutional and cooperation chapters have been completed and the small amount of progress which has been made in the fields of commerce and the measures for facilitating commerce so that we do not abandon this important project of a future free trade agreement between Mercosur and the European Union.
Both regions - I am referring to the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean in general - have committed themselves to working together to ensure the success of the World Conference on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in August, as well as adopting a mutual commitment to succeed in something very important on which the Latin American countries have a great deal to say, that is the Millennium Round, with the commercial issues recently launched in Doha.
Education, culture and access to knowledge are undoubtedly important keys to success in the 21st Century.
I would like to highlight the launch of the @lis Programme for cooperation with Latin America in relation to the information society, recently approved at the meeting of science and technology Ministers in Seville and the ALCUE programme in the field of scientific and technological cooperation and a new programme of post-graduate grants intended to help 4 000 students from the other side of the Atlantic to benefit from the advantages of studying at European universities.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to repeat that at this Madrid Summit, which, as I have said, we expect to be attended by 48 Heads of State and Government, a bi-regional process based on a strategic partnership will be consolidated.
I am convinced that at the end of the Summit we will be able to celebrate the progress made on a process which begun just three years ago.
Mr President, the day after tomorrow, as the presidency has just pointed out, the second Summit between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean will take place in Madrid.
The fundamental aims of this Summit are: to reinforce the bi-regional strategic partnership that was launched nearly three years ago at the first Summit in RÃ­o de Janeiro, and to set out new objectives for the next two years.
I will not repeat all the reasons for the importance of this relationship, which was set out so cogently by the presidency - economic, political and cultural - but we all know how important it is.
Rather than repeat what has been said so eloquently already, I would like to address two main questions regarding the Summit.
Firstly, what has the Commission done to ensure the success of Madrid?
And secondly, what results do we expect from the Summit?
It goes without saying that the Commission is strongly committed to ensuring the success of the meeting in Madrid.
And, we are equally committed to ensuring that the bi-regional process initiated at Rio succeeds.
Indeed, what is at stake in Madrid is the fundamental credibility of this whole process.
As Parliament knows, public opinion has been increasingly critical of summits in recent years.
We look back to the controversy surrounding the G8 meetings last year.
These summits are frequently derided as high-level talking shops that too often produce little more than hot air.
The summits' grandiloquent final declarations are frequently, and perhaps rather embarrassingly, contrasted with the paucity of the results they actually achieved.
As the Commission has repeatedly emphasised, we are determined that Madrid will not just be a talking shop like that.
It has to be credible, and in order for it to be so, we need to demonstrate clearly that the ambitious objectives defined at Rio have been achieved.
I do not want to launch into a long-winded overview of everything that has stemmed from Rio.
Nor am I the right person to outline everything that others have achieved since then.
Instead, I shall concentrate on the Commission's accomplishments in the priority areas of cooperation that it committed itself to work on.
I firmly believe that we have fulfilled our part of the bargain and we can go to Madrid with our heads held high.
Firstly, the Commission has launched several programmes aimed at supporting and strengthening those institutions that explicitly defend human rights.
These include a regional programme in support of ombudsmen in Latin America and two multi-annual programmes on democracy and human rights.
In addition, the Commission has co-financed a bi-regional conference on the work and cooperation of ombudsmen and national human rights institutions, as well as an inter-continental conference on human rights protection.
Moving on to information society, which the presidency referred to, our most notable achievement has been the adoption of the @LIS programme.
Aimed at reinforcing cooperation between the European Union and Latin America, it was officially launched at the EU-Latin America and Caribbean ministerial meeting in Seville a few weeks ago.
In the social sphere, the Commission also goes to Madrid with a positive balance sheet.
We have promoted the participation of different civil society groups and have financed a series of meetings that will submit their conclusions to the Summit.
We have co-financed an academic seminar on social equity, an NGOs forum as well as a civil society meeting.
This is on top of the recent business forum held last month in Mexico.
As evidence of our ongoing commitment in this area, it is worth noting that in programming cooperation for the period 2000-2006 the Commission has allocated a substantial part of its existing financial resources to the social area.
In addition, the Commission is currently working on all initiatives aimed at increasing public administration capacity in social policies, through exchanges of experience, best practice and know-how.
Finally, in the field of education, the Commission has approved an ambitious scholarship programme under the name of ALBAN.
Over a period of nine years, 4 000 scholarships will be awarded to Latin American graduates wishing to complete their studies at European universities.
I want to emphasise to Parliament how much importance I personally attach to this programme.
As we all know, too often Latin American students feel that they have no choice other than to head directly north to continue their studies.
We have to give them another option: the option of coming to study at European universities.
That would be good for us, and I hope it would be good for the next generation of leaders in Latin America.
These are scholarships which will be generous - worth about EUR 19 000 each year.
They will be managed by, I hope, a network of higher education institutions.
If we can make a success of this scholarship scheme, we can look at developing similar schemes in other areas, because I believe profoundly - a point made by Mr Iglesias on a number of occasions - that one of the most important ways in which we can help our partners around the world is by opening our own universities to as many of them as possible.
Let me move on to my second main question: what does the Commission expect from the Summit?
First of all, Madrid should be an opportunity to enhance the political dimension of our bi-regional strategic partnership.
This partnership is about more than just developing cooperation projects: indeed, 48 heads of state and government have not come together simply to endorse a new list of projects.
I am convinced that what is really important is the opportunity that Madrid presents us with to give political weight to fresh and bold initiatives.
In particular, we need to bring our political dialogue into sharper focus.
By doing so, we will come closer together on issues of common concern, such as climate change, the development agenda agreed at Doha, the International Criminal Court and human rights.
We must also commit ourselves increasingly to assert these convergent positions in international fora.
This will result in the strengthening of the multilateral system.
Europe has a particular responsibility, through our actions and cooperation with others, to make it clear that, in our judgment, the only way in which we can tackle international problems is through international cooperation.
We should look in particular for partners in making multilateralism work in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Secondly, the Commission expects the Summit to address what is one of the most important questions for the people of Latin America and the Caribbean: the fight against social inequities and the search for social cohesion.
We know - some of the figures were given by the presidency - that Latin America faces a potential problem of political instability because of social inequity.
This issue needs to be addressed, and the Summit should concentrate on the search for solutions to this problem.
Lastly, we expect Madrid to represent a milestone in a number of sub-regional negotiation processes - again, as the presidency pointed out.
Perhaps most significantly, the Summit will mark the conclusions of our negotiations with Chile.
This is indeed a considerable achievement.
It constitutes a major strengthening of bilateral relations and I endorse everything that the presidency said about the extraordinary depth and breadth of the agreement we have concluded with Chile.
It is one of the most important agreements we have ever concluded with any country.
Elsewhere, the Summit should welcome the fact that the negotiation of the political, institutional and cooperation chapters with Mercosur is practically finished.
I hope it also encourages the efforts being made to conclude the outstanding negotiations in due course.
With regard to Central America and the Andean Community, the European Union has been particularly sensitive to the requests of these two regions significantly to enhance their relations with us.
The General Affairs Council conclusions of 15 April have paved the way for the negotiation of a political dialogue and cooperation agreement with both regions.
These negotiated agreements will seek to enhance our trade and investment relations and prepare the ground for still closer cooperation in the future.
By doing this, the European Union has satisfactorily responded to the legitimate aspirations of these countries, and I hope the Madrid Summit will wholeheartedly support this move.
Before concluding, I would like to extend my congratulations to the Spanish presidency for the excellent work it has carried out regarding the preparation of the Summit.
I would also like to pay tribute to the European Parliament's extraordinary commitment to the future of our relations with Latin America, and to one or two individual Members who have played a particularly constructive role, one of whom is going to speak as soon as I have sat down.
I should like to congratulate Parliament in particular on the ambitious and far-reaching initiatives contained in the resolution of 15 November 2001.
We in the Commission have been working hard with the Spanish government and others to make this Summit a success.
We have been working for almost 18 months with that objective in mind.
We have been able, not without some difficulty, to bring to fruition schemes like the scholarship programme and the programme on the information society.
We have concluded negotiations with Chile on an extremely wide-ranging agreement, as we said, which many faint hearts thought impossible.
We have made more progress with Mercosur than most would have predicted.
Now we want to raise the level of our relations with the other subregional groupings as well.
This provides the basis for a good Summit, which will further strengthen our bi-regional relationship and prepare us to take things forward even further when we next meet - probably in two years' time - almost certainly with a larger European Union.
Mr President, by including this item on the agenda within a very difficult international context and coinciding with the visit of President Fox and a large delegation of Mexican parliamentarians, we have wanted to stress this Parliament's interest in relations with the countries of Latin America on the eve of the Summit.
I agree with Mr Patten's view that this type of meeting has been criticised because the great declarations they lead to are often not turned into concrete objectives, and I believe that in reality summits should be the ritualistic embodiment of an underlying political will which will generate the political energy necessary for the machinery to function.
Our task now is to give substance to this ambitious objective of the strategic and regional partnership which the Heads of State and Government drew up in RÃ­o de Janeiro.
And I agree with Mr Patten that the European Union is approaching this Summit with a series of very positive messages.
Firstly - and I believe this does credit to all the political groups in this Parliament - it has a clear and ambitious report aimed at the constitution of a bi-regional partnership which attempts to create a common European Union strategy for Latin America.
Secondly, it has a will which is reflected in budgetary terms, which will allow the European Union to go to Madrid with respectable sums within the 2002 budget.
And thirdly, the EU has an ambitious association agreement, negotiated with Chile - for which we must thank the European Commission for its negotiation efforts and the Presidency-in-Office for its support - and is holding negotiations with Mercosur which must also be given new impetus, because it is at moments of crisis that this type of agreement can be more necessary than ever.
The European Community must also present, through the Commission, guidelines for negotiation, for new agreements with the Andean Community and Central America which, in the opinion of this House, must provide - I am not saying at this moment - the prospect of a partnership, as the President of the European Parliament has said in a recent letter to the President of the Commission; and also an ambitious Commission programme which includes a whole series of initiatives which, although they do not imply a single euro more, are very important in relation to the creation of this bi-regional association.
Amongst all this praise, Commissioner, please allow me to make a small critical point: you will understand that we consider the reduction of EUR 30 million which the Commission has proposed in its preliminary draft budget for 2003 not to be the best calling card to present to the Summit at the moment.
Having said this, I believe it is important that the Summit should take account of the fact that the great and profound social inequalities in Latin America may jeopardise the progress made through so much effort in the fields of co-existence and democratisation and that therefore we must send a very clear message of support for normalisation and democratic consolidation in countries such as Venezuela and Argentina, the inclusion of FARC and the LN on the list of terrorist organisations, also the will to normalise relations with Cuba, on the basis of the principles of the democratic clause, and its gradual incorporation into the Cotonou Agreement.
And I believe it is essential for the European Union enthusiastically to create an ambitious global relationship with Latin America so that the United States is not the only protagonist, since they do not ask too many questions about the degree of regional integration in Latin America.
Therefore, Mr President, I hope that this Summit will send a clear message, at a clearly-defined level, that we want to create a common area which will take the form of a great transatlantic axis to provide a direction for relations between the European Union and Latin America for the coming millennium.
Mr President, Madrid is a summit of Heads of State and Government.
But may I take this opportunity to point out in all modesty that the European Parliament has cultivated very close relations with Latin American parliamentarians for years now; in fact, the longest-standing relations between the European Parliament and other parliaments are with Latin America and date back to the early 1970s.
How Latin America develops over the coming years and decades will also depend to a very considerable degree on its relations with Europe.
I think that we underestimate our potential.
I should like to make the point here that relations with Latin America must, above all, include a scientific and technical dimension, an industrial dimension, as we have with the United States -why not with Latin America as well?
May I remind you that Europe's two biggest scientific institutes are in Latin America: the ESO or European Southern Observatory in Chile, which has done a great deal for astrophysics in Chile, and our space centre in Kourou, because French Guyana is also on Latin American soil.
I also advocate intensive dialogue involving industry in Europe and Latin America.
Something along these lines began with Mercosur and could be extended to the whole of Latin America.
Mr Patten rightly referred to Kyoto and climate policy.
If I had the time, I could work out what emissions trading might mean in the future for Latin America.
The President has signalled to me that I do not have the time.
If I did, I would work it out for you and you would be astounded at the possibilities it encompasses.
In short, we have a great many opportunities for relations with Latin America.
We must use them, not just talk about them!
Mr President, we must remember that the world is in disarray, and not only as a result of globalisation or the new international situation following 11 September, but also as a result of exclusion, privilege, corruption and favouritism.
This situation affects Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean.
We must therefore take advantage of this Summit in Madrid to consider the situation frankly and achieve pragmatic conclusions and convince ourselves of the need amongst all of us to ensure that the whole of society functions correctly and its quality of life is improved, and we must seek a road towards peace and stability on the planet, particularly in these two geographical blocks - the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean - which are united by history.
In this regard, respect for human rights and the rejection of political impunity and intolerance, as well as the strengthening of democracy and the incorporation of civil society into political decision making must be the key priorities of our future joint action, within the framework of respect for the sovereignty and independence of peoples.
In Madrid we must, therefore, strengthen interinstitutional political dialogue in order to ensure a climate of trust and achieve suitable relations.
Mr President, the first Summit in RÃ­o de Janeiro in June 1999 ended with the decision to establish a strategic bi-regional partnership, but the 54 priorities of the action plan decided on at the end of the Summit have largely not been complied with yet.
Moving beyond words, for us the challenge of the Madrid Summit and the initiative of a global strategic partnership consists of offering an option which is fundamentally different to that of the United States.
I believe we will have been too unambitious if all we do is repeat that our priority is the establishment of free trade areas in countries such as Mexico or Chile. Or if we say how good the policies of the International Monetary Fund in Argentina are, while ignoring the data indicating that 41% if the population in Latin America is still living in poverty, that 56% of the income they derive from exports is used to pay debts, and that in countries with which Europe has agreements that are seen as models - such as Mexico -extremely serious violations of human rights are still taking place.
We will also have been too unambitious if we allow our multinationals to treat their workers in a way which would be considered unacceptable in Europe, as is the case with the German company Continental Tyres in Mexico, or if we intend to intervene in the Colombian conflict simply by producing prescription lists to try to define who is a terrorist and who is not.
Finally, Mr President, we do not want to forget that the Spanish Presidency was very careful about accepting the attempted coup d'Ã©tat in Venezuela - I do not know how else to describe this acceptance - and that this had a very negative effect in Latin America, whose governments, in contrast, recognised the democratic value of the ChÃ¡vez Government.
With regard to the resolution, we ask - and I will end here, Mr President - that we stick to the compromise agreed by the groups and that we do not vote for an amendment which could seriously complicate the situation of the hostages in Colombia, by introducing the idea that we have to close the door to all types of dialogue.
We therefore sincerely hope that this House will not approve the amendment proposed by the European People's Party.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr de Miguel and Commissioner Patten for their speeches, which have been very illuminating, but I believe we are missing the opportunity to analyse what is happening in Latin America and the role Europe can play.
It is essential that we see the FTAA project as a counter-offensive by the United States to reduce the European Union's influence - which, although in principle it is contradictory, can also be described as beneficial - in relation to Latin America.
I believe that is the most important issue which should be dealt with at the European Union/Latin American Summit of Heads of State.
And we are therefore obliged to analyse the consequences of both the FTAA project and of 11 September and the change that has taken place throughout Latin America.
We must take into account the violations of human rights in Guatemala and the impunity relating to them.
We must consider the breakdown of negotiations in Colombia, which have failed, and we, who are committed to promoting dialogue and negotiation, should insist on this policy of dialogue and negotiation in order to restore common sense.
We cannot pursue the aggressive militarist policy of the United States because that would cause us to lose all credibility in the eyes of the world and of Latin America.
The same can be said with regard to Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil, where, incredibly, democratic candidates from the Workers' Party and trade unionists are being eliminated before the elections, and all with the usual impunity.
Therefore, our influence in Latin America, in view of the Summit, should be decisive, in order - just as Mr de Miguel and Commissioner Patten have said - to strengthen human rights, peaceful co-existence and democracy through the influence which the European Union can exert and which the United States is failing to exert.
I therefore believe that it is worth taking full advantage of this opportunity and that we must not turn our backs on the situation.
Mr President, with the second summit between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean taking place in Madrid this weekend, it is quite right that the European Parliament should today be reviewing its position on relations with these two regions.
