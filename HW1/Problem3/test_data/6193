That is why I agree with the conclusion reached by the committee.
However, the committee overshot the mark on a couple of points, so that information that the pharmaceutical industry is allowed to provide now would in future no longer be permissible.
We need to sort that out in tomorrow's vote.
In conclusion I wish to call on the Commission to bring forward a proposal on medical product safety for children as soon as possible.
I know that the Commission officials here today and the Commissioner himself regard this as a very important subject, but we have already been waiting too long for a definite legislative proposal.
I urge you to present one before the year is out.
Mr President, Commissioner, allow me, after having listened to my fellow Members this morning, to draw their attention to a point that I believe to be crucial, which is that of new active substances.
I hope, along with the Commission, that marketing authorisations for new active substances are issued by means of the centralised procedure, and I would like to reiterate to my fellow Members, particularly to those from Germany, the example of orphan medicinal products.
You will, without doubt, remember that at the beginning of our mandate, we voted in favour of a regulation on orphan medicinal products, which allow us to treat rare conditions.
The policy on orphan medicinal products, which is a genuine success at European level, stipulates that all market authorisation applications for these medicinal products shall be issued through the centralised procedure.
Given that research in the area of orphan medicinal products is carried out by small and medium-sized companies, it follows that all SMEs can use the marketing authorisation application, under the centralised procedure, managed by the European Agency in London.
Your argument in favour of the decentralised procedure in the area of new active substances is therefore unfounded, and has no bearing on our discussion today.
Think about that.
At tomorrow's vote, think about what you will say to any of your fellow citizens who asks you what you have done.
Have I really voted to provide better health protection?
Have I really tried to achieve the essential objective, namely to improve public health?
Have I done everything I can and voted in such a way as to achieve this goal?
Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore urge you to think carefully about the vote you will take tomorrow.
We simply must encourage improvements in the area of health and promote equality amongst citizens in healthcare.
Mr President, today's debate has been very instructive and shows the great commitment of many honourable Members of this House to these issues.
A number of interesting issues have been raised.
I want to tackle those raised by Members who are still here in the Chamber.
It is unfortunate that often Members have disappeared when it is time for me to reply - I hope this is not an improper comment.
I will comment on six groups of amendments.
Firstly, on the extension of the scope of the centralised procedure.
Mrs GrossetÃªte put the whole case very well.
The whole idea behind this procedure is to guarantee that goods are delivered quickly, equitably and in the interest of all patients in Europe.
If we do not have a centralised procedure by the time the ten new Member States join, there will be enormous inequality.
We take the comment on the SMEs very seriously and, for that reason, we are ready to seek concrete measures that would alleviate the burden on SMEs, for instance, a reduction in fees, direct scientific advice from the agency in London or administrative support.
The Commission is also convinced that extended scope for the centralised procedure for human and veterinary medicine would benefit European citizens and businesses alike.
For that reason, the Commission cannot accept amendments which reduce the scope of the centralised procedure.
The second question is the balance between innovation and competition from generics.
That is a very sensitive issue.
I would be happy to discuss that in depth.
In regard to the American system, as Mrs Corbey mentioned, we must remember that we cannot take just one point of comparison.
In America, the drugs market is totally deregulated and there is direct consumer advertising.
We are not proposing that.
It is through data protection that we are trying to strike a balance.
We are proposing something that the Commission refused to propose for years - namely the Bola system for generics which, of course, means more competition in the sector after the expiry of a patent and, at the same time, lower prices and lost revenue for those who originated the medicine.
It is clearly better for the consumer.
It is extremely important that we stick to that.
Secondly, at the same time, to counterbalance it, we want to propose a solution for exclusivity involving a ten-year period and, if there are indications needing to be researched into later, ten plus one.
I do not believe that European industries have been losing market share, that there are less innovative medicines and research in this field, and that this is in the interests of European patients.
I just do not believe it.
I am sure that we must try to accept that there are two or three public goods we can defend at the same time.
Public health takes top priority but we must also support research innovation in Europe.
If we do not support it we are going to be in permanent decline in all sectors.
Research-intensive areas are those which create jobs, development and wealth and make it possible to assume our global responsibilities.
So both are issues we must try to tackle at the same time.
The balance is not always easy.
We have done this after very careful consideration.
There are a few amendments seeking to change this and we will oppose them.
For instance, Amendment No 34 wants to go further in favour of generics and weaken the position of innovation.
To keep the balance, we cannot support it.
On the other hand, Amendments Nos 40 and 92 call for additional data protection of three years in two situations.
Firstly, when a new indication is developed for an old medicine, and secondly, when a company submits documentation for switching a product from prescription to non-prescription status.
These amendments must be seen in the whole context of the data-protection scheme.
As regards the additional data protection on switching, we agree that this request is not unjustified.
This could increase the availability of over-the-counter medicines.
We can therefore accept Amendment No 92 in principle, but we still retain our right to look at the duration of that additional protection.
As far as the additional data protection for old products is concerned, this entails a proposal that could extend data protection far beyond ten years - up to 14 years, to be precise.
That is why we cannot support Amendment No 40.
The third issue concerns improving information for patients.
I feel a little uncomfortable with this debate because I am also against the proposal that many Members oppose, namely the American model.
For instance, one Member said that in America the ten most used pharmaceuticals are the ones that are the most advertised.
Among the five most advertised medicines at least, no one would have a right to take part in even the pilot project.
A pilot project does not mean direct advertising.
It is only information validated by the competent authorities which can be given at the request of the patient or patients' organisations.
It is right that people are against the American direct-to-consumer advertising.
That is not what we are proposing.
We have a situation where abundant information is available on the web, which is not validated and makes the consumer extremely unsure, which concentrates on products which are not on the market and which confuses many citizens when they visit their doctors.
Because we cannot stop it, we want to offer the possibility of access to information validated by clear guidelines, accepted by the Community and monitored, observed and controlled by the Medicines Evaluation agency.
I understand that people are against the American system, but we have never proposed it.
That is why we cannot support Amendment No 101 and others aiming at the same objective.
The fourth issue concerns relative effectiveness.
Some amendments relate to relative effectiveness.
They suggest that the added therapeutic value should be considered as a criterion for the authorisation of a medicinal product - alongside quality, safety and efficacy.
The Commission agrees that the issue of relative effectiveness is of great importance because it can help the kind of innovation that brings important benefits to patients.
An authorisation depends on a positive benefit/risk ratio, on the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine itself, on its own merit.
Relative effectiveness is not a reason to deny access to the market.
The Commission can support the idea that relative effectiveness should be considered at EU level, and can accept in principle some related amendments, like Amendments Nos 4 and 100.
The Commission cannot, however, accept amendments that establish relative effectiveness as a fourth hurdle for marketing authorisation.
The fifth group of amendments concerns legal status.
The Commission proposes that the conditions of supply - over-the-counter or prescription-only - should be determined under the mutual recognition procedure.
This would obviously lead to a harmonised EU legal status for all products authorised accordingly.
The Commission continues to believe that it is appropriate to include legal status in the mutual recognition procedure.
But the Commission understands the concerns that this might lead to a situation where too many products are classified as prescription-only medicines because of a 'lowest common denominator' effect among the Member States.
Finally, on the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, our proposal follows the lines which were provided for the European Food Safety Authority at the time of our proposal.
Amendment No 16 aligns the EMEA Management Board with the model finally adopted for the Food Safety Authority, and the Commission can support this amendment.
Finally, let me just briefly reiterate that Parliament is provided in writing with a full list of the Commission's positions on each of the amendments
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
It is a fact, the policy on medical products is now defined at European level.
This development must be supported without jeopardising the operation of the national health systems and whilst respecting the need for maximum safety.
With regard to medicinal products for human use, Amendment No 71, which I tabled, fully supports this approach.
It aims to learn lessons from the tragic 'Bayer affair' at the very time when the problems posed by the molecule cerivastatin have been raised once again in the United States.
We must reflect on the need to standardise the procedures that apply to clinical and pre-clinical trials.
If the traceability of the marketing procedure were better assured, the safety of European patients would become more reliable.
A credible application of the centralised procedure for marketing medicinal products cannot work without this sort of approach.
I am opposed, however, to the full withdrawal of the decentralised procedure to the exclusive benefit of the centralised marketing procedure.
The choice between these two systems must be maintained so that the European Agency does not remove the prerogatives of our national agencies.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0327/2002) by Mrs Evans, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the animal-health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals.
Mr President, the aim of this regulation is to ensure consistency in the rules for travelling with pet animals, commonly known as the pet passport scheme.
It is a very welcome development and very important to the lives of many EU citizens who have, in the past, been prevented from travelling because they could not take their pet animals with them.
The fact that the Commission has been able to bring forward such a proposal reflects the incredible success of the steps taken over recent years to control rabies.
It is worth repeating the figures: cases among cats and dogs have fallen from nearly 500 in 1991 to just 5 in 1998.
As the Member States started to adopt their own rules for the increased movement of pet animals, it became clear that a European system was needed to make it easier for pet owners and avoid confusion.
I am pleased that Parliament's amendments, adopted in the common position, called for detailed information for consumers so that they can make the necessary preparations before travelling.
I would like to draw attention to some of the key issues.
First, the legal base.
Members will recall that this was one of the main issues at first reading.
The Commission proposed a double legal base, whereas Parliament's view was that, since the main aim of this regulation was to protect public health, a single legal base should apply.
However, following the receipt of the common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has accepted the double legal base.
Secondly, trade.
Once the Council has included measures on trade within the regulation, as requested by Parliament, the distinction between commercial and non-commercial movement is still not defined clearly enough.
Under the Council proposal, the maximum number of five animals that can be moved under this regulation is fine.
But if the purpose of the regulation is primarily to protect public health, then the number of animals being transported is not relevant.
We have therefore tabled amendments deleting the maximum number.
Thirdly, identification.
Parliament previously called for ISO standard transponders to be used and for the owner's name and address to be included.
The Commission and the Council proposals allowed for other types of transponders to be used, as long as the owner carried the means to read the information.
As ISO chips are not available in all countries, the Committee on the Environment has agreed to remove the requirement for ISO standard equipment, but still wants the owner's details to be included.
This would help combat trafficking in pet animals.
We strongly believe that electronic identification is more effective, humane and reliable than tattoos and that, after the transitional eight-year period, only microchips would be acceptable.
The fourth point relates to young animals.
The Committee has re-tabled the amendments preventing the movement of animals under three months old without the requirements of this scheme.
This would not be applicable to the United Kingdom, Ireland or Sweden, but it would apply to the other Member States.
I do not believe that it is possible for the authorities to carry out proper checks on young animals, for instance ensuring that they have remained at the place of birth or have not had any contact with wild animals.
This therefore leaves a loophole for trade in puppies and kittens particularly.
The fifth point concerns the involvement of Parliament.
Several of our amendments relate to Parliament's involvement in decisions such as the extension of the transitional measures for the three sensitive Member States and to comitology -retaining Parliament's right to be consulted.
Finally, the OIE International Animal Health Code.
The committee has retained the requirement to take into account the OIE Code when deciding on the health status of third countries in the scheme.
This has been a subject of some debate.
I am aware that the Council felt that the OIE Code would exclude large parts of the EU from free movement of animals, especially after enlargement.
I also know that countries such as the United Kingdom are moving away from rabies-free status because it would exclude, for example, Canada and the USA, but the committee has decided to adopt a cautious approach.
I believe that each of these issues can be resolved without too much difficulty and I ask Parliament to support the position of the Committee on the Environment.
I must say that I am disappointed that, despite my best efforts, an agreement could not be reached with the Council before the second reading and I am very grateful to the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, the representatives of the presidency and the Commission for their cooperation in our discussions over the past three weeks.
I believe that Parliament has taken a very constructive approach and we will continue to do so in order to reach agreement as soon as possible.
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Evans, and the Committee on the Environment, for the report on the Council's common position.
I am satisfied that the report reflects a general agreement on the safety of the technical provisions relating to the management of the rabies risk, even if a few points of disagreement remain and may need some further clarification.
The main differences between the original proposal submitted to Parliament at first reading and the common position we have before us today fall into three categories.
First, we have the provision facilitating movements of young animals between Member States of equivalent status.
Second, the provisions for reassessment within a period of five years of the specific conditions for movements to Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
Third, provisions amending the conditions applying to trade to align them with the conditions applying to non-commercial movements - to accommodate the wish expressed by Parliament at first reading.
Allow me now to address in detail the amendments proposed in the report.
They can be split into two categories - technical amendments and institutional amendments.
I will begin with the nine technical amendments.
Amendments Nos 1 and 6 may be the result of a misunderstanding.
The setting of a maximum number of animals aims only to distinguish commercial movements from other non-commercial movements.
It is not intended to be a dividing line between two different types of rules - the same rules would apply to commercial and non-commercial movements.
So it would be incorrect to say that setting a maximum of, say, five would be any threat to public health.
In effect, it means that once you go above five, the commercial rules apply but below five the rules set out in this draft legislation apply.
Amendments Nos 3 and 4 would result in a prohibition of movements of young animals under the age of vaccination between Member States other than the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden, for which specific provisions exist.
The conclusion of the discussion with the Council was that those movements of young animals have always been allowed, that they represent a negligible risk and that this flexibility must be maintained.
Otherwise, the movement of these animals would be seriously undermined.
Therefore, Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 and 6 cannot be accepted.
Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9 suggest the adoption of import conditions equivalent to those that apply to movements inside the Community for third countries free of rabies as defined in the OIE Code.
As already stated at first reading, this is not in line with the risk analysis approach that we need to adopt, so these amendments cannot be accepted.
In fact, this would not be consistent with the conditions applicable to movements inside the Union, as some Member States are not 'rabies free' under the OIE Code definition, even if rabies in domestic animals is under control on their territory, as Ms Evans mentioned.
We therefore need to take a similar approach to third countries with similar circumstances.
Finally, on the technical amendments, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2 and 13.
Almost all Member States consider microchipping to be a reliable method of identification, and I look favourably on automatic harmonisation after a transitional period of eight years.
Let me now turn to the seven institutional amendments.
In a spirit of compromise, the Commission could consider favourably Amendment No 5, which aims to introduce a codecision procedure for the extension of specific provisions applicable to the UK, Ireland and Sweden.
The Commission could also have accepted Amendment No 16 as an alternative to Amendment No 12, and I regret therefore that Amendment No 16 has been withdrawn.
Amendment No 12 unreasonably deprives the Commission of any possibility to propose temporary measures, whereas Amendment No 16 would have allowed this in a reasonable way.
I cannot therefore accept Amendment No 12.
Nor can I accept the other four amendments.
Amendments Nos 10 and 11 would limit the executive competence of the Commission to 'technical' aspects.
This wording would very likely give rise to legal arguments on the interpretation of the word 'technical', which is not defined in the legislation.
This would jeopardise the sound management and efficient implementation of the regulation.
Amendments Nos 14 and 15 cannot be accepted because they go beyond the institutional agreement.
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that they are not consistent with the dual legal base of the regulation.
I hope I have adequately explained the reasoning behind the positions I have taken on the amendments.
Mr President, provisions for animal health when transporting pets are particularly important for Member States which are currently entirely free of rabies.
In spite of this, I believe that it is vital for moves and travel across borders within the EU to be made easier for families and individuals who are travelling with a pet.
I am pleased that the Council's proposal has taken into account the views put forward in Parliament's first consideration of the matter.
I find it incomprehensible that there are currently different provisions relating to animal health when transporting pets for commercial purposes in the EU.
The risk of rabies infection cannot be significantly different simply because the purpose of the pet's journey is different.
Therefore, it is necessary to adapt the health rules for transporting pets for commercial purposes to this directive.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Evans for her excellent work on this issue.
Mr President, this measure is of great significance in those countries - the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden - which are now bringing their rules on the movement of pet animals into line with practices elsewhere in the Community.
Like the rapporteur, I believe it is a pity that we could not reach agreement before the conciliation stage, but I understand the differences.
Some of those differences will be reflected in this debate, and I still have some minor differences with the rapporteur, which she has already acknowledged.
For those countries which have prevented the entry of animals that may be at risk of rabies without a long period of quarantine, this is, in a way, an act of faith.
It is made possible by the fact that we now have effective vaccination methods which can be indicated by the transponder chip.
We have recently had representations from some members of the veterinary profession arguing for an extension of the tattooing principle and claiming that the transponder chip can be surgically removed or otherwise nullified.
I cannot accept those arguments.
There is broad agreement between the Commission and all Members of this House that we should move toward alignment.
I share the rapporteur's concern that the movement of young animals, which must present at least some element of risk, should be subject to the same constraints as that of other categories.
I have not been able to follow the arguments against that, other than that it may, somewhere along the line, affect the trade in animals.
But, as the Commissioner well knows, trade in animals, if it is not effectively handled, has led to the perpetuation of some serious abuses in the Community in recent years.
I do not believe this is a persuasive argument.
I agree, however, with the Commission and not the rapporteur on Amendments Nos 7, 8, and 9.
It is counterproductive to introduce amendments which will effectively constrain the movement of animals between some existing Member States, as well as extending the scheme - as the United Kingdom and other countries with the current constraints would like - to countries that are not rabies-free.
For the United States and Canada, for example, we see no reason why there should be the further impediments set out in Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9.
We agree with the rapporteur, however, on the question of comitology.
I welcome the Commissioner's assurance that a suitable amendment allowing for reference to Parliament at any process of review will be introduced.
In conclusion, although this is a small measure to many and will not mean much to those countries where animals routinely cross internal EU borders, for those who cherish pets as lifelong companions it is a measure that will be greatly welcomed.
Mr President, this regulation raises a problem insofar as it enforces, in the area of identification of pet animals, the use of the electronic microchip - reputed to be tamper-proof - and spells the end of the use of tattoos, since microchips represent an effective, modern method that is more humane for the animal.
Doctor Mouthon, however, a professor at the Maison-Alfort vet school in France, cast considerable doubt upon the reliability of the method.
On 21 March 2002, he demonstrated, before a witness, how easy it was to deactivate the microchips so as to render them unreadable using a simple electric device producing magnetic radiation.
He did this without leaving any marks and without causing any pain.
I have provided you with the witness report.
He also states that the microchip can move around the animal's body, as shown in x-rays, medical reports and surgical studies; that the microchip can be removed using nothing more than a Stanley knife, as has come to light, when trafficking rings in pet animals have been broken up.
In addition, this rather unreliable procedure will triple the cost of identification. It costs approximately EUR 22 for a traditional tattoo, almost EUR 70 for a microchip, involving a mandatory visit to the vet, who from now on has the monopoly on identification.
This excessive cost will penalise millions of dog and cat owners - particularly the least well-off, for whom a pet animal is a source of comfort - whereas in France, as the rapporteur points out, we have a cheap and reliable centralised register, which has been working well for some time now and which makes it easy to firmly identify and, therefore, to find stray animals.
This is, in my view, the objective we are seeking.
So why try to harmonise everything, especially if it is to align the system against the least reliable method?
Let us, on an issue of such little strategic importance, allow subsidiarity to have a completely free reign and allow the two systems to work side by side.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.20 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.)
The three reports that bear my name are closely linked.
That is why, before talking about the report that is to be voted on by the plenary, I shall begin by briefly summarising the situation.
These three reports are a direct response to the adoption of the new Financial Regulation due to enter into force on 1 January 2003, which requires the simultaneous adoption of the framework financial regulations on decentralised agencies.
There are sixteen such regulations: four concerning codecision and twelve on the consultation procedure.
The new Financial Regulation establishes an in-depth reform of the budgetary and financial rules relating to the European institutions.
The objective pursued by the Committee on Budgets has so far been to ensure that this new legislation also applies to Community agencies.
The same amendments are therefore proposed for each agency, in all three reports.
These amendments simply introduce the principle of transparency, which has traditionally been upheld by Parliament, prior notification of the budgetary authority and the obligation to draw up a budget distinguishing between operating appropriations and administrative appropriations.
We are now going to vote on the four reports concerning codecision.
We have also introduced an amendment seeking to link the adoption of the regulation to a prior decision by the Council on the matter.
I wanted to make a point of saying this because later on I will propose, on the contrary, that we do not vote on a legislative resolution.
Mr President, we can vote on this next report.
I simply wanted to add that, in the text of the resolution, we took due account of the concerns expressed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs with regard to the future regulation of the European Police College.
This is the last time I shall take the floor, Mr President.
I merely wanted to draw the attention of the House to this point, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets.
I propose that we proceed as we have done on other occasions with regard to the Financial Regulation, in other words that we vote on the text of the amendments but postpone the vote on the legislative proposal.
Codecision procedures are underway.
We are awaiting the Council's response.
We consider it preferable to propose this procedure, which we have already followed many times, which consists of voting on the amendments and postponing the vote on the proposal.
Mr President, given that the House has just rejected the initiative and that the Council is not present, I think we should now vote on the legislative resolution, and vote in favour of it.
I am happy to inform you that a delegation from the Senate of Puerto Rico have taken their seats in the visitors' gallery.
The delegation is headed by Mr Antonio Fas Alzamora, the President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, and is made up of three members of the Senate.
President Fas Alzamora, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to you and your delegation.
I have been informed that you are going to have a number of important meetings with Members of Parliament here in Strasbourg.
On behalf of the entire Parliament, I wish you a very enjoyable visit.
Thank you for coming to visit Parliament.
President.
Voting time is now suspended. It will be resumed after the formal sitting.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.56 a.m. and resumed at 12.36 a.m.)
We had no objection to voting in favour of the report (which concerns Portugal), but would like to take this opportunity of pointing out that Greece has been outrageously wronged in the distribution of milk quotas and the Commission should quickly table a proposal righting that wrong by doubling Greece's quota for cow's milk.
The production quota of around 700 000 tonnes set for Greece does not even meet domestic demand, which totals over 1 100 000 tonnes and, when it is exceeded, it costs livestock farmers a fortune in co-responsibility levies.
At the same time, certain dairy companies are known to have made a killing by raking in huge profits at the expense of livestock farmers - who are forced to supply their milk at ever lower prices - and increasing the price of products to the consumer.
Livestock farming in Greece is on death row and Greek consumers are forced to buy imported long-life products because it takes too long to get fresh milk to Greece from the Member States of the EU; and yet Greece has the potential to increase its output to meet the demand for fresh milk.
We are calling for a fair distribution of quotas based on population figures, consumer demand and production potential.
The Fiori Report has not received my support.
I have abstained for two reasons.
First of all, it is unwise to reduce the excise duty on biofuels before we have a complete picture of the environmental impact of the introduction of these fuels on road transportation.
Moreover, several statements have been made about tax policy, an outstanding example of a policy that should take shape close to the people, that is to say in the Member States.
A European initiative can only be justified in the event of demonstrable harmful competitive distortion.
Secondly, I object to LPG being classified as an alternative fuel.
It is, after all, a petroleum product.
Although fewer polluting substances are released as a whole during combustion, there is no doubt that harmful substances are emitted.
An alternative fuel is fundamentally different from the so-called traditional fuels because it is both a renewable and emission-free source of energy.
As such, LPG certainly cannot be labelled an alternative fuel.
In conclusion, these two elements have prevented me from supporting the report.
I certainly welcome a shift to fuels that are less environmentally harmful, but not in the way proposed in the report.
At the Johannesburg Summit a 15% increase in the production of alternative energy sources by 2010 was proposed.
Increasing the productivity of renewables is the only long-term alternative to traditional energy sources.
Research and development need to be stepped up with a view to achieving this.
The positive effects flowing from this are self-evident.
Research creates jobs; increased use of biofuels provides an additional product alternative for the agricultural sector; and, last but not least, negative environmental impacts are reduced.
For all these reasons we have voted for the Fiori Report.
Mr President, Mrs Evans' document concerns the movement of pet animals.
The report appears to represent progress for the free movement of pet animals in Europe too.
Indeed, the report lists dogs, cats, ornamental tropical fish, amphibia, reptiles, birds and mammals.
Yes, you did hear me say ornamental tropical fish, amongst other things. As you know, Mr President, I have a direct line to the fish.
The sardines in the sea complained: 'We too have free movement, but only to end up in restaurant kitchens, to be thrown straight into the frying pan, while ornamental tropical fish can just enjoy themselves swimming round tanks thanks to your directive.
Why is it that you at the European Parliament do not do something to allow us too to become pensioner fish at last rather than persisting in wanting to fry us for your dinner?'
Ahead of their time, our cats and dogs will be able to move freely within the territory of the Union, provided they are fitted with an electronic microchip.
In eight years' time, tattoos will become illegal and our hamsters and guinea pigs will be welcome in all the Member States, and it will not be long before we have a budget heading for asylum-seeking animals.
It makes you wonder ...
The main question remains unanswered: what category does the ferret go in?
The suspense is excruciating.
It is enough to make you forget the moratorium on GMOs and the threat of war in Iraq!
This report is definitely vital for European integration, hovering as we are on the brink of enlargement following the Irish 'yes'.
It is easy to mock, but, as always where this kind of rather bizarre text is concerned, there are serious issues just beneath the surface.
In this case, we have to establish a quarantine period for rabies.
This fable reflects the Commission's desire to make the Member States live happily ever after in sanitary bliss whether they like it or not, preventing them from protecting their citizens as they see fit.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to speak not about fish and frying pans, like Mr Fatuzzo, but about a very serious issue in connection with the Lambert Report.
The SPD Members of this Parliament have voted for this report although we can understand the difficulty that a number of our fellow Members had in supporting it.
I would like to mention one key point that persuaded us to give this report our support, although we would have liked it to be structured differently.
I have in mind here the fact that Mrs Lambert's directive makes no legal distinction between refugees, that is people who are victims of political persecution, and people who require the European Union to offer them temporary protection.
When the question is what care and benefits these groups of persons should receive in the EU Member States, this is quite justifiable.
Indeed, we do not want people who have fled from a country to be treated differently.
What is, however, at stake here is that a qualifying distinction needs to be drawn between someone who is a victim of political persecution, such as a member of a resistance movement against a dictatorship who goes into exile and needs protection, and on the other hand people fleeing from a temporary situation such as, for example, a civil war, who therefore only need temporary protection, or, as defined in the Geneva convention on refugees, subsidiary protection.
Mrs Lambert's directive covers all these groups of persons.
Our view is that a distinction ought to have been made.
We also make this distinction in German constitutional law as a matter of principle, because Article 16 of the German constitution defines a legally obtainable right to protection against political persecution, but not a legally obtainable right to subsidiary protection.
We German Social Democrats have therefore voted in favour of this report despite all these misgivings, partly because it would not have got through otherwise and this House cannot fail to deliver an opinion when consulted by the Council.
Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I voted for this proposal for a directive because, like many of the Members, I feel that our States have a duty to receive refugees and to do so properly.
I would stress, Mr President, that, as I see it, it is important to address the issue of where the refugees should be received and which States should pay for this when - as, I am afraid to say, sometimes happens - large numbers of citizens of other States flee to our European States.
The burden of receiving refugees should be spread equally among all our States of Europe.
The Moderate Party delegation to the European Parliament has today voted in favour of the Council directive on minimum standards for when citizens of third countries and stateless persons will be considered refugees or as persons who, for other reasons, require international protection and on the legal status of these persons.
However, we have voted against Parliament's amended proposal.
We believe in the clear right of refugees to find sanctuary from persecution and other oppression by entering the EU.
Establishing minimum standards is an important first step on the road towards a common asylum policy in the EU.
However, it is important to emphasise that, over and above the minimum standards proposed by the EU, it should be possible for Member States to provide people with protection for other reasons.
Transparency must lie at the heart of creating a common stance within the EU on immigration and migration.
Designing an immigration policy, in other words rules for being able to move to a country, is always a balancing act.
Open borders could easily lead to us closing the door on dynamism and improvements.
Immigration is an asset.
The opportunity for foreign citizens who are not refugees to immigrate to Europe as migrant workers should be expanded.
. (FR) The European Parliament has just, by a fairly wide majority, adopted the Lambert Report, which endorses and extends the Commission's extremely poor proposal on refugees.
We opposed this, as did most of the right.
This vote, which is fortunately for consultation purposes only under current rules, could nevertheless politically weaken the position of the Council, which has for some time been trying to stem the tide of overliberal Commission proposals.
Following yesterday's debate, Commissioner Vitorino, without contesting all my arguments on this subject, confined himself to claiming that the Commission was not proposing to establish all the elements of the subsidiary protection system.
There is indeed already supplementary protection, in addition to the Geneva Convention, in some countries, for example territorial asylum in France.
The scope of these extensions, however, is small.
What I would reproach the Commission for is introducing this system at Community level and, what is more, establishing all the necessary conditions for it to be extended.
Once again, the Commission is playing a destructive role, which should lead us to consider the relationship between the European institutions in general.
- (DA) We have today voted in favour of Mrs Lambert's report because, in many areas, it improves upon the minimum standards that, under the auspices of the EU, an attempt is now unfortunately being made to establish when it comes to refugees and persons with subsidiary refugee status.
The report seeks to broaden the range of people to whom the standards would apply and to improve conditions and rights.
For example, the Commission's proposal relates exclusively to third country nationals and stateless persons, while EU citizens are not covered by it.
The report attempts to correct this state of affairs, for it would be an odd and dangerous signal to send to the international community that the EU countries, which have each individually signed the Geneva Convention, are able to decide mutually to exempt themselves from the scope of the international agreement, believing as they do that the Convention cannot be applied to their own citizens.
Moreover, the Commission proposes that persons with refugee status must have more extensive rights.
That is naturally a good thing, but it should also apply to persons with subsidiary refugee status, as recommended by the rapporteur.
The June Movement is in favour of a humane refugee policy. We support every human being's right to a life of dignity, but we believe as a matter of principle that this aim is not best served by developing a common European refugee policy based on the supranational first pillar of which the proposal in the report is a part.
I wish to place on the record the fact that I did not participate in the vote on the Lambert report (A5-0333/02).
My non-participation should not be seen as opposition to the principle of the proposed directive but rather to the inclusion of certain elements in the report which I feel are inappropriate and would lead to a diminution of the underlying beliefs in the protection of those most in need of our support.
The following are some of the different elements with which I disagree.
The definition of the family goes far beyond the accepted norm in most Member States and other countries; this issue should have been addressed more sensitively and the report fails badly in this respect.
The deadlines set under various articles are too short.
The reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is used inappropriately in the report.
Extending the scope of the directive beyond those who are suffering persecution will ultimately reduce the legitimate opportunity for protecting those in greatest need.
For these and other reasons I felt it inappropriate to participate in the vote.
British Labour members of the PES have voted in support of the Lambert report.
We are convinced that the way forward for the European Union is to move towards a common EU policy on asylum.
This report on minimum standards is one important part of the evolution of this common policy.
We reject the hard right-wing view of those conservatives in the EPP who seek to restrict the right to asylum and protection.
As socialists, we believe that it is essential to be compassionate and sympathetic in our approach.
In working towards a common policy for fifteen countries and ultimately twenty-five, there will always be some variations in detail.
We believe these differences should not be used to divide us in our efforts to find compromises, instead we should be proud enough to build on the common ground that unites us.
Therefore, whilst there are some aspects of the Lambert report which we as Labour MEPs might question, the overall direction of the report is undoubtedly sound, hence our vote in favour.
Europe is one of the world's most prosperous, democratic and stable continents.
It therefore comes as no surprise that many people who are persecuted, threatened or harassed in other countries seek refuge over here.
With them come others who are not being persecuted but who are attracted by the level of prosperity in Europe.
If these people have been trained in a specialist field in which there is a shortage of manpower over here, they are even actively recruited, often at the expense of facilities in their countries of origin.
Real refugees, on the other hand, are increasingly less welcome.
Some EU Member State governments are now considering nothing but the numbers.
Restricting the number of refugees, therefore, is seen as preferable to a sound assessment of the reasons why people flee and the extent to which they are in danger.
It is time we stopped this practice and took the need of the refugees themselves as a guiding principle.
We should stop extraditing people to states that are unsafe for them, refusing to reunite families or refusing to recognise persecution on the basis of intolerance or sex discrimination.
On 24 September, the Evans Report on asylum and security was a step in the right direction, even though my group took the view that these proposals did not go far enough.
These proposals, however, ultimately attracted more no-votes than yes-votes.
The European Parliament's contribution would be very useful and positive, if, whilst maintaining the scope and the limits of the proposals for a directive, it contributed to the legal clarification of concepts that could raise doubts or controversy in the transposition of the future directive and in its implementation.
Unfortunately, however, the rapporteur and the majority of the specialised Parliamentary committee have not given this clarification and have instead taken the matter, in a way that is inexplicable in the context of a minimum common status for all Member States, along a route of successive extensions to the legislative provision, which, in a counterproductive way, can only create more difficulties and new obstacles that are unnecessary for its adoption.
Hence our votes on the specific issues and in the final vote: most of the amendments tabled have not been useful and, on the contrary, frequently go beyond what is necessary and reasonable when it comes to setting minimum standards for all Member States.
Nevertheless, I am in favour of the original initiative received in Parliament, because, in line with the Tampere European Council, we advocate the approximation of rules in the field of refugee status, and of other subsidiary measures, with regard to those persons who, although denied the aforementioned refugee status, are in need of identical protection.
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Lambert's report (A5 - 0333/2002).
We agree that the EU should lay down minimum standards for the recognition of third country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection.
We are nonetheless aware of the fact that the directive is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark's position.
Mr President, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld's report, which we have just adopted in this Chamber, concerns a Council framework decision seeking to protect us from what is known as hacking into information systems.
When my friend, Mr Maurizio Infissi from Capriate San Gervasio - a beautiful place near Bergamo - who, although a pensioner, is a computer expert, heard that we were going to discuss this matter, he said: 'You are doing the right thing in protecting yourselves against hacking into information systems, but would it not be a good idea to protect pensioners too against the attacks of governments, Prime Ministers and Budget Ministers, who sometimes carry out violent attacks on our incomes, providing pensions which are all too often miserly and prevent us from living dignified lives?
When will you adopt measures and hold debates to protect pensioners against attacks by the state?'
'I am sure it will be soon,' I replied, and I certainly hope so, Mr President!
. (PT) The report voted on in Parliament improves the text proposed by the Commission, by increasing references to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as privacy.
In some aspects, however, it upholds the line taken by the Commission, as well as suggesting the communitarisation of policies.
It should be noted that the Commission proposal falls in line with the approach of taking advantage of the events of 11 September 2001 by restricting certain fundamental rights, which has not led to much protest, specifically rights pertaining to the area of freedom, security and justice.
Furthermore, the Commission proposal betrays an obsession with regulation, an attempt to harmonise criminal law and a suppressive rather than preventive viewpoint, with which we cannot agree.
Hence our vote against the report.
People can become involved in computer hacking for very different reasons.
It is not simply a question of resourceful young people exploring the possibilities technology has to offer, or of 'nerds' who enjoy wreaking havoc in other people's work; it is also about critical investigators who are looking for information that is important to many but that is kept secret unfairly.
The latter group helps reduce opportunities for environmental scandals, corruption, financial fraud, warmongering and dictatorial acts.
In all cases, incidents of computer hacking interfere with the smooth operation of organisations in both the private and public sector, but when these incidents are assessed, what ultimately counts is the positive or negative impact these disruptive activities have.
I fully agree with the rapporteur, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, that this framework decision and the relevant national implementing measures should not be used to suppress freedom of expression, demonstration and association.
Minor disruptions that are viewed as unimportant in the individual Member States need not be made punishable by the EU.
The application of Article 12, in which contact points are set up for the mutual exchange of experiences, can also have adverse effects.
I therefore support the proposal to postpone this section.
. (PT) I have supported this report because it highlights our awareness of the importance of fighting computer crime and because it demonstrates essential concerns about limiting criminal, preventive and punitive action in a way that respects the freedoms of opinion and of association and the freedom to demonstrate.
I have also supported two other proposals by the rapporteur, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld: the first is her call for the EU to ensure, whenever it addresses issues concerning the transmission of information, that corresponding provisions exist in the field of data protection, in order to deal with the risks associated with their transmission; the second is her less severe evaluation in the case of the first offence of illegal access by a minor.
In short, I think that Parliament has contributed to improving the proposal for a framework decision intended to provide a response to cybercrime by seeking to approximate the legal provisions of the Member States in order to guarantee that all attacks against information systems become a criminal offence and by promoting police and judicial cooperation.
Lastly, I believe that the creation of a network of contact points that can be consulted around the clock in the fight against crime that uses these highly advanced technologies is extremely important.
Mr President, the report concerns the importance and dynamics of the theatre and the performing arts in an enlarged Europe.
I have had another dream, Mr President: I dreamt I was watching a play in which the enlarged Europe was taking part.
What did I see in this play?
I saw yours truly having lunch in a restaurant in a place called Vercelli in Italy with Mr MÃ¡dl, whom we applauded just now, and the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, the former King Simeon II.
We were savouring saffron risotto, mushroom risotto and black risotto with cuttlefish, as is appropriate in a place such as Vercelli where rice is grown.
We were all thoroughly enjoying our meal, but the chef said to us: 'Soon, you will no longer be able to enjoy rice if you Members of the European Parliament do not do something to help agriculture in the reform of the common agricultural policy that is currently being carried out in the European Parliament and the European Community, for the agricultural activities of rice-growing areas such as Vercelli, Novara, Pavia, Milan and other areas of Europe must be safeguarded too.'
Our position on culture depends on the type of policy it promotes and the values, principles and aesthetic standards it puts forward.
The prime question is whether cultural activities function for the benefit of the workers and contribute to social progress or whether they function for the benefit of big business, extending its control and increasing its profits.
The report expresses the need for cultural processes relating to the performing arts to be incorporated - ideologically, politically and socially - into EU policy.
It wants the theatre to serve the 'European ideal' and to apply policies such as mobility and lifelong learning.
And it targets Mediterranean countries and the Central and Eastern European countries in particular.
What, however, is this 'ideal' we are being called on to support?
If it is not clear, how can we be expected to aid and abet contradictory procedures, which resolve a few temporary problems (intellectual property rights, movement, education), but which also expose the fact that these problems were caused by the intervention of big business in each country's culture?
Similarly, we disagree with the dominant role of private companies and patrons and with the hazy outline of the nascent 'European cultural identity' and the methods being developed to impose it.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from voting.
. (FR) In a world in which money rules, neither culture in general nor the performing arts in particular escape this domination.
Private investors, bent on making a profit, will only become involved to the extent that they can make money, either directly or in the form of tax relief.
At a time when the Member States and public institutions have but one word on their lips, 'savings', this means that culture is demoted still further, receiving the meanest share.
And the first to suffer are the people at the bottom of the pile, the people on the lowest rung of the industry such as those who work in the entertainment industry without steady employment, who are currently on strike in France in protest against what is threatening to exacerbate their already precarious situation.
We are against giving public money to companies and to the wealthy, including money given in the form of tax benefits for patronage or sponsorship which benefit those who present themselves as patrons while taking more than their due, without essentially changing anything about the situation of the vast majority of artists and workers in the performing arts.
It is therefore despite this measure, advocated by the rapporteur, that we voted for a report which, as a whole, if it were followed up by practical action, would improve the living and working conditions of workers in the performing arts sector.
We have abstained from voting on Mrs Fraisse's report on the importance and dynamics of the theatre and the performing arts in an enlarged Europe.
We have a positive basic attitude to the European Union.
As Swedish liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to solve cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.
Here the democracies of Europe have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity.
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, that is that a decision should be taken as close to those whom it concerns as possible.
This is why we actively promote the issue of a constitution for the European Union which makes the division of responsibility clear for everyone.
It must be clear to all citizens that the EU will only tackle issues about which it is most expert, that is cross-border issues.
All other issues should be handled at local, regional or national level.
Theatre and dramatic art are important and we support people's opportunity for increased freedom of movement.
We wish to make it easier for foreign workers to get visas and residence permits, but we believe that all occupational groups should be allowed to move across borders on the same terms.
The proposals should not just apply to actors and dramatic artists but to all occupational groups.
We also support cultural diversity, aid for artistic creativity, artistic freedom and access to culture for all our citizens, but we do not believe that they should be enshrined in any future European constitution.
We wholeheartedly support several of the ideas presented in Mrs Fraisse's report at national level.
. (FR) This report will delight the bleeding-heart intelligentsia who ostentatiously show off their pro-European stance.
Apart from that, however, I cannot see the interest of such a text.
I would even go so far as to say that this report worries me.
First of all, it concerns an area of competence reserved for the Member States alone.
It is therefore unacceptable for Parliament to call on the Member States to make their cultural policies coherent at European level.
That has nothing to do with this House.
Second, I am convinced that this report constitutes the reward given by federalist Europe to the political and cultural establishment, which does not spare any effort in 'advancing' the pro-European cause.
This report, which grants subsidised 'artists' an incredible number of privileges and grants, is intended to benefit solely the heavily-subsidised cosmopolitan elite, by way of thanks for services rendered to the 'European ideal'.
Lastly, this report actually reflects a perverse and dangerous course of action which consists of using the theatre and the performing arts as a means to promote pro-European ideology.
Rather than just promoting art, some aspects of this report tend more towards mixing culture and propaganda.
I am concerned to preserve the creative freedom of true artists and I shall therefore vote against this report.
. (PT) I have voted in favour of this report, which seeks to draw attention to the effective promotion of the conditions needed to ensure that the performing arts have, on the one hand, an increasingly large audience and, on the other, are continually more attractive and accessible, specifically through the promotion and protection of the mobility of artists and their work, of support for translation and subtitling as a tool for harmonisation and mutual cultural comprehension and of incentives for training and for dissemination actions.
The protection of the performing arts is also a prerequisite if we are to ensure the preservation of the values of cultural diversity that characterises the European spirit, and so I agree with the importance that the rapporteur attaches to taking a close look at the performing arts in countries preparing to join the EU - a decisive element in the construction of a Europe based on the sharing of values and whose greatest asset is its diversity.
Lastly, to follow this train of thought, I think that we must attach particular value to private initiatives - because these are the spontaneous expression of the Community's cultural heartbeat - instead of devoting our energies to direct action by the State or by public authorities.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on the 2003 General Budget on behalf of the Committee on Budgets:
by Mr GÃ¶ran FÃ€rm (A5-0350/2002) on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2003 [11138/2002 - C5-0300/2002 - 2002/2004(BUD)] and Letter of amendment No 1/2003 to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2003 [12640/2002 - C5-0480/2002]
Section III - Commission
by Mr Per Stenmarck (A5-0351/2002) on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2003 [C5-0300/2002 - 2002/2005(BUD)]
Section I - European Parliament
Section II - Council
Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors

Section VII - Committee of the Regions
Section VIII (A) - European Ombudsman
Section VIII (B) - European Data Protection Supervisor
Mr President, let me start by thanking my colleagues, particularly those on the Committee on Budgets, and the Committee on Budgets' secretariat.
They have done a fantastic job with this budget and I think this is an excellent opportunity to draw attention to the incredibly hard work carried out by staff in this context.
I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council, who through a long line of trialogues, conciliation, working groups and other contacts have helped to ensure that we now have a good draft budget for 2003 to vote on.
I would also like to emphasise that on the vast majority of points we in the Committee on Budgets have reached broad agreement, which is naturally also an enormous strength for Parliament.
I would like to begin with some fundamental reflections on the EU's budgetary system.
I have to say that after having worked on this budget for approximately ten months, I am of the firm opinion that the EU's budgetary system is in great need of major reform.
We will gain a number of improvements in the form of the new Financial Regulation. There will also be a number of improvements in the form of the ABB system, the system of activity-based budgeting.
We have been able to tackle a number of points ourselves by improving the internal work of Parliament itself.
I have put a great deal of effort into obtaining a better dialogue with the committees.
Now, dialogue between, on the one hand, the Committee on Budgets and, on the other hand, the committees and their rapporteurs for the budget takes place as a practically permanent process, beginning with the guidelines in the spring, including the new work carried out this year with special working groups to monitor this year's budget and extending to the amendments ahead of the first reading.
I therefore believe that we have reduced the traditional conflict where the various committees do not think that the Committee on Budgets is paying sufficient attention to their political priorities and where the Committee on Budgets in turn has often considered that the committees are fighting for unrealistic budgetary demands.
This year we have come further than before, not least when it comes to the traditionally problematic section on what are known as the A30 grants to various European organisations.
This year through close cooperation with the committees and the political groups we have been able to submit a unanimous proposal from the Committee on Budgets.
As you know, we have also reformed the budget debate and have already held the major budget debate at the September sitting.
This was an experiment which I think worked well but there is no doubt that it can be improved further.
Despite these improvements I am still not satisfied.
Here I would like to send a signal to our colleagues in the Convention.
I think that it is unreasonable to make permanent a system involving a long-term budget plan which has such rigid principles for sectoral budget ceilings as those we are living with at the moment.
Now, only halfway through the budget planning period, they are giving rise to an increasing number of ad hoc systems which risk making the budgeting methodology completely confusing.
During this year's budget process we have already received proposals from the Commission on use of the flexibility instrument in three cases.
In the July conciliation we agreed on more planned use of something which should really be an emergency reserve.
We have solved the Commission's problem of obtaining sufficient personnel resources ahead of enlargement by means of a complicated model of frontloading, which means that we hunt down unused resources for the current year and use them for costs which would otherwise have fallen in 2003.
Just today in conciliation with the Council we agreed on another new flexibility instrument, the EU Solidarity Fund, to deal with the effects of natural disasters, etc.
Now, however, we have to ask ourselves how many such flexibility instruments and how many ad hoc solutions we will need before we realise on a wide front that the entire budgeting methodology needs reforming and to become more flexible.
The Committee on Budgets has also chosen which side it is on.
We have chosen to consciously exceed the ceilings within three budget categories, partly to demonstrate the absurdity of the current locked system.
I will return to this when giving more detailed reasons.
Note that I am not looking to abolish the budget ceilings.
I am not arguing that we should abandon the demand for budgetary restrictions.
However, there must be something in between total abandonment and what we are living with at the moment, a rigid planned economy locked for seven years.
I hope that in the future it will also go without saying that the codecision model must apply to the entire budget, including agricultural policy, and that all the EU's expenses must be included in the budget, including the European Development Fund.
This is an important area which I hope we can continue to discuss in the years ahead.
I would now like to mention a more general problem before going into the various budget headings, namely the implementation of the EU's budget.
This is becoming a serious problem.
We cannot go back to the citizens, the taxpayers, year after year and tell them that every year we take EUR 15 billion from them unnecessarily, which we then pay back to their grateful ministers of finance.
I believe that major work is needed on this issue if the Union is to gain credibility for its policies and its budget and if we are to be able to live up to all the promises we make through the budget.
We must quite simply simplify the administration of the structural funds, which we can start doing right now in the current period.
We have Commissioner Barnier's word on this, while of course we can be even more radical ahead of the coming programme period.
I also believe that we must improve the entire process when starting new multi-annual programmes.
Time after time we are told that when multi-annual programmes are starting their third or fourth programme period we are now in the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the third LIFE programme, etc. a whole year is often needed in order to start up activities at the beginning of a new period.
This is completely preposterous.
It sometimes means having to compress work intended to take five years into four years in practice.
A third area where I think we have to achieve an improvement in implementation and simplification is staff issues.
This year we decided not to use flexibility for new posts in the Commission.
This does not mean that these posts are not needed.
In the long term I believe there will be a demand for more posts, partly to operate the new, more decentralised organisation in the external service, but of course this means that the Commission must thoroughly demonstrate that it is working effectively, that reform of the Commission is being carried out, that more efficient management is having an impact, and that, for example, the second step in what is known as the RELEX reform is really being carried out.
Without these efforts it will be hopeless to argue for more Commission posts, even if we are convinced that they really are necessary in the long term.
I would now briefly like to address some of the actual problems in each budget area.
When it comes to agricultural policy, heading 1, the committee has for many years argued for a fundamental change, the development of agricultural policy.
As a demonstration we have even decided to exceed the budget ceiling by EUR 20 million for sub-heading 1b, rural development, to indicate our position in this respect.
We consider namely that in the future, money, especially the excess money under heading 1, should be switched to the more proactive rural development policy.
We also propose that subsidies for the export of live animals should be reduced and accounted for separately.
This will clearly show how much money is actually being spent on live animal exports.
By the way, it will be very interesting to see whether the governments which have criticised animal transport, etc. now really seize the opportunity to follow Parliament's line.
Everything we are proposing is in line with the Commission's proposal for a mid-term review, even if in the resolution we have chosen to call it development of agricultural policy rather than reform.
Heading 2: the Structural Funds.
I have already mentioned the problem with implementation.
Therefore I will now only briefly take up the fisheries question.
I fully understand that in the current situation the Danish Presidency is prioritising enlargement.
This is the most important political question but nevertheless, fisheries policy must also be reformed.
The EU must create sustainable fishing which can survive in the long term.
While awaiting concrete proposals we have chosen to do two things.
Firstly we maintain that last year's promise of a further EUR 27 million to convert the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets will be met.
At the same time we have chosen not to adopt a position on how this is to be funded in detail, we will return to that at a later date.
When it comes to the budget item for fisheries reform we have chosen to set up such a budget item but not to allocate concrete amounts to it.
It will be a 'memorandum item'.
In heading 3, internal policies, I would mainly like to mention information policy.
We do not accept the Council's and the Commission's proposal for comprehensive slimming down of information policy.
On the contrary, we think that the union needs better support among its citizens.
Here information is a necessary lubricant.
Despite this, however, we are moving the money and our priority is clear, what matters is enlargement and the future of the EU.
I would also like to point to the external authorities, the agencies.
Here we have taken a more restrictive line.
We have followed the Council's draft budget in the vast majority of cases.
This is because the Member States are on the boards of these agencies and should therefore reasonably take the consequences of these agencies' needs into account in the Council's own budget proposal.
Unfortunately we have to say that this is not always the case.
Therefore I believe that this is a matter we will need to discuss somewhat in the future.
When it comes to pilot projects and preparatory measures, I think we have achieved a very good dialogue with the Commission on their implementation.
We are now launching some new ideas, including an idea for a pilot project for co-operation between small and medium-sized companies in the EU, not only with the candidate countries but also with countries such as Russia, countries in the Balkans and in North Africa, which I believe will be very important.
Finally, I would like to concentrate on heading 4, external policies.
Ever since I entered Parliament in 1999 we have been forced to fight the same battle in this area every year.
The Council and the Commission propose major new initiatives.
This has concerned the Balkans and Serbia.
This year it is Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund, support to the fight against AIDS and other poverty-related illnesses in the developing world.
No one takes responsibility, however, for allocating the resources needed.
I think this is absurd.
The budget ceiling is simply too low.
Costs have increased every year without any new resources being allocated.
This year we have chosen to exceed the ceiling but to do it openly by means of an asterisk amendment, where we demand EUR 72 million more for heading 4 with direct reference to Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund.
We have built this proposal as far as possible on a combination of priorities from our two committees here, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
I believe this is what will be the main point in negotiations with the Council between the first and the second reading.
It must be resolved if we are to achieve an acceptable role for the EU's external actions.
This also applies to the common foreign and security policy.
It is unacceptable that this work is increasingly sliding over more and more from administrative expenses to operational activities but without the influence on the budget which the European Parliament must have in ordinary external relations.
For this reason we have chosen to set the CFSP grant at the minimum level, 30 million, plus 10 million but we have allocated this through the Cards programme in order to be able to establish the European police task force in Bosnia.
I believe this is an issue which we must discuss very carefully between the first and the second readings.
To conclude, I would like to say that this is the last budget for an EU with 15 Member States.
Therefore, of course, starting to prepare for enlargement has clearly been the utmost priority even in this budget.
I am particularly pleased to be able to say that we have resolved the majority of the problems with enlargement.
We have resolved them in broad agreement.
All the political groups have played their part, as have members from all the national delegations.
I think this feels like possibly the greatest success of this work this year.
Mr President, I would also like to thank those who worked together to help produce the budget for 2003.
I would like to thank all my fellow members of the Committee on Budgets, the highly competent budget secretariat, the Presidium, above all today's President and, finally, the Commission, the Council and, especially, a very pragmatic and proactive Danish Presidency.
Throughout this year, the EU's administrative budget, what we term heading 5, has been the budget's major problem.
We started the year with a large predicted deficit in the 2003 budget.
This was said to be in the region of EUR 140 million.
Although this was reduced in various stages during the spring, the Commission in its preliminary draft budget proposed that the flexibility instrument be used to the tune of EUR 66 million, primarily to cover the Commission's costs in completing the preparations for enlargement.
Both the Council and Parliament opposed such a solution for different reasons.
Firstly, because it is hard to see an administrative budget as the kind of issue where the flexibility instrument should be used.
It can hardly be claimed that it is a case of unforeseen expenses or that enlargement is something that has suddenly come upon us.
The second reason was because, together with other areas where the flexibility instrument has already been earmarked, this would use up half the instrument and thus make it impossible for it to be used in areas where significantly better use could presumably be made of it.
The third reason, which is not least important for politicians who feel a sense of responsibility, is that the budget limits are actually there to be complied with, even if it can be claimed with a certain amount of justification that the EU's budget is far too rigid.
When we entered into this agreement between the Council and Parliament at a uniquely early point in Brussels on 19 July, we achieved at least three things. We read the whole budget and respected the given ceiling for heading 5, we knew how large the Council's budget was to be and we had limited the European Parliament's own budget.
Within this framework, the priorities which Parliament had supported even in the guidelines were entirely feasible, these being primarily two things.
The main and obvious priority was enlargement.
In view of the decisions subsequently taken, we know that if the Member States comply with their undertakings on ten new Member States at the Council meeting in Copenhagen in December and if the agreements are signed in March, we will be able to have 147 observers from all these countries here at the European Parliament as early as April next year.
The necessary decisions will be made in terms of property, premises, etc.
The second priority was implementing necessary reforms.
These will be required with or without enlargement, especially when it comes to Parliament.
Here, the issues are primarily those key areas where every parliament, whether national or European, has to be strong.
As far as the European Parliament is concerned, the issue is one of reinforcing the budget structure, not only of the Committee on Budgets but also of all the other committees in their important work on the budget.
Furthermore, it is about strengthening Parliament's legislative function.
In a very short time, this has become a parliament with considerable legislative power.
As such, the conditions under which this power is exercised must also be improved.
Once all this was done, there remained two important issues to resolve within the framework of the 2003 budget.
It was a question of distribution across all the institutions, with approaching enlargement as the main priority in this context too.
It was also a question of finding a solution for the Commission's unresolved problems regarding financing the preparations for enlargement.
The latter is particularly important as, following conciliation, one party was clearly the loser, namely the Commission.
As early as at the conciliation stage, both the Council and Parliament specifically promised to help attempt to solve the Commission's problems ahead of enlargement.
This promise has subsequently been repeated on numerous occasions both by me and other representatives of both the Council and Parliament.
It is in this context that the concept of frontloading enters the picture as the instrument we came to use.
The initial step involved obtaining a figure from all the institutions for the amount of money remaining in the annual budget, that is, the budget for 2002.
It is these funds which we can use in a second step to reduce pressure on the 2003 budget and which can be transferred to the Commission to ensure that we are able to meet the costs of preparations for enlargement.
At a meeting attended by the secretaries-general of all the institutions, we thus produced a total sum of approximately EUR 77 million remaining unused by all the institutions in total.
The maximum amount the Commission can spend on preparing for enlargement amounts to approximately EUR 72 million.
I would like to say a few words on Parliament's own share of this frontloading.
According to the proposal which both the Committee on Budgets and Parliament's own Presidium supported last night, this amounted to EUR 43 million for the current year.
This is money which in fact, in line with the far-sighted way of handling money which Parliament has used hitherto, we should have spent on early repayments on Parliament's own properties.
We will now postpone this by one year.
This also means that we will receive some of this money back one year later.
Of the EUR 43 million which will thus instead be transferred to the Commission, we shall, still in line with the proposal we have to reach an opinion on today, receive EUR 35 million back in 2003.
In this context, let me mention that the original proposal was for EUR 40 million.
We are thus now proposing that this be changed to EUR 35 million.
This means that Parliament's share of this frontloading, seen over two budget years, will be EUR 8 million, a figure which I consider to be well balanced.
It is generous but, at the same time, well balanced seen in comparison with all the other institutions.
This shows that this frontloading, as I see it, is developing into a considerable success and could also be used in other contexts in the future.
It creates the opportunity to use a budget over several years to make the best possible use of resources.
Earlier, I mentioned that we promised the Commission that we would contribute to attempting to solve the problems of the costs of preparing for enlargement.
A promise is a promise and, as we know, it must be kept.
We now stand here having implemented frontloading which gives us the opportunity to comply with what we promised.
This is an excellent feeling.
For me, all this is also about a kind of investment in good relations.
Enlargement will only succeed if we realise that it actually is something we must work on together.
It is a joint undertaking.
As the rapporteur, I am very grateful for the way in which all the institutions, large and small, have played their part in attempting to resolve this very difficult situation.
Mr President, Mr FÃ€rm, Mr Stenmarck, ladies and gentlemen, we have taken a massive step towards the enlargement of the European Union with the positive result of the referendum in Ireland.
It is now up to the Council to agree on a common negotiating position for financing issues at the summit this week in Brussels, that is to say how much in the way of resources can be included in the European Union Budget for the new Member States as from 2004.
This once again clearly signals that the 2003 Budget will very probably be the last budget for a Union of 15 Member States.
So we are pretty much on the eve of enlargement.
That means that the 2003 financial year will not only present further challenges for the candidate countries, but also for the European institutions that need to make preparations.
There have been some serious differences here between the Council and the Commission, because the Council only approved additional posts for itself for 2003 in the run-up to enlargement, but rejected additional posts for the Commission.
So it is all the more incomprehensible that, in its own preparations for the Brussels Summit, the Council repeatedly highlights its expectations of the Commission for 2003 in terms of preparation for enlargement, for example in relation to the Structural Funds.
But that requires staff too, of course.
So the Commission has all the more reason to appreciate the fact that the European Parliament has taken the initiative to ensure that the Commission's requests are met.
I would like to express my respect for all the rapporteurs, and in particular Mr Stenmarck and Mr FÃ€rm, for the way in which they have not only gained support for frontloading, but have also vehemently fought, every step of the way, for it to be implemented.
I would like to thank you for your comments, Mr Stenmarck.
You made a promise and you have kept it, which we really appreciate.
Once again, I would like to express my very sincere thanks, on behalf of the Commission, to the rapporteurs and to the Committee on Budgets.
This idea will now be implemented by means of an interinstitutional rectifying budget, and the very fact that there is an interinstitutional rectifying budget is an achievement in itself.
So thank you for your support.
Let me turn now to expenditure on the common agricultural policy.
As you know, the Commission has pursued the same line as the European Parliament, that is a restructuring of market-related expenditure and market organisation so as to strengthen support for rural areas.
The Commission made this subject a key element of its mid-term review proposals.
We cannot, however, agree to these proposals being implemented now, as the rules still prevent this and an increase in resources for the rural development programme go beyond the current provision in the Financial Perspective.
You have, however, also proposed another amendment, and you, Mr FÃ€rm, stressed this again just now, to the effect that the budget headings for export refunds for animals should be subdivided so that refunds for live animals can be identified separately.
I think that this could be considered, as long as the relevant legal bases allow it.
I share your concern about the need for enhanced animal protection and it is also very much shared by the Commission as a whole.
A third of the Budget will once again be devoted to structural policy next year.
There was a debate in plenary in September about the implementation of the Structural Fund programmes, and Mr FÃ€rm has one again spoken very clearly about this.
You very emphatically call for the procedures to be simplified, to allow Member States to draw down funds more quickly and more simply.
My colleague responsible for this, Mr Barnier, held a seminar on this in order to establish what scope there is here.
This was a further indication of the fact that the Commission is very committed to this issue.
However, we also need the Member States' cooperation, and it simply is not good enough if the Member States' estimates of the level of Structural Fund appropriations they implement in a year, that is how much they can actually use, are as wide of the mark as they have been in recent years.
As far as this is concerned, I have to say that we have of course to jointly check whether the increased budget appropriations proposed here by Parliament are necessary for the Structural Funds next year.
The Commission is largely able to support the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets as regards appropriations for internal policies, for example in the case of measures in favour of immigration and asylum policy, measures in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the proposal in the area of information policy.
As regards the budget for external policies, however, I am not in complete agreement at present. One example here is the Global Health Fund to fight diseases such as AIDS.
Of course there is no denying that the Commission rates the importance of this global fund very highly.
But the issue now is what level of appropriations is needed for 2003, and also what the source of the funding is to be.
The Commission has once again proposed that half of the appropriations should be financed from the European Development Fund.
I would like to emphasise once again that by far the greatest proportion of appropriations for this global fund has up to now been financed by the European Union, that is to say partly from Community resources and partly from the Member States' bilateral resources.
One priority area in the budget for external policies is aid for the Balkan states.
A new feature of the 2003 budget is the addition of appropriations for joint police missions to Bosnia.
The Commission has already for this reason added a further EUR 10 million to the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget.
Parliament's proposal is that this additional sum should be removed again, or rather not inserted in the first place.
I am, however, sure that by the time we get to the second reading of the Budget we will have been able to find a way to finance this important area of external policy.
In relation to the new challenge for the EU Budget of providing appropriate aid for Afghanistan, the Commission welcomes the fact that the Committee on Budgets has agreed to insert a special budget heading.
We also welcome this because the task of providing financial assistance to Afghanistan will of course recur in the budget over the next few years.
It is, however, precisely because of this that we believe this financing should have a regular place in the budget, and should not be provided by calling on the flexibility reserve.
Nevertheless, the Commission believes that there is a continuing need to use the flexibility reserve, not least to find a financial solution in the coming year for the issue of fisheries reform and to provide Portugal and Spain with the remaining resources needed to restructure their fishing fleets.
If Parliament's proposal is adopted, the 2003 Budget will represent 1.05% of the combined economic output of all the Member States, that is to say the same level as this year.
I am mentioning this because there are still some very contentious debates going on about the Brussels Summit.
However, if the proposal on the table for the financing of enlargement in 2004, 2005 and 2006 is adopted, this ratio between the EU budget and European economic output, even with another ten members, will not again reach the level it stood at in the mid-1990s.
If we consider once again the size of the EU Budget and how small the increase currently envisaged is in view of enlargement, then I must say I do not really consider that the debate currently raging is actually justified. If anything, there is a danger that discussions on financing will focus too much on individual issues and perhaps get bogged down in them.
We should, however, bear in mind that the enlargement of the EU is a very good investment in the future, an excellent investment.
In view of this I wish at this point to appeal to the Heads of State and Government to agree on a common position in Brussels so that, following the yes vote in Ireland, we can stick to the timetable for the enlargement of Europe.
Mr President, I wish to join with the others in thanking our redoubtable duo, Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck, for their excellent work on behalf of Parliament during this budget procedure.
They have both outlined that we are now thinking of a Union which will be extended to at least 25 countries.
For both Parliament and the Commission, enlargement is the main emphasis of this budget.
I would like to express a personal view.
I hope that in future we will avoid too many referenda and too many votes being taken on particular subjects.
It might become contagious in this House and we might adopt a resolution and then consider voting again because we have reached the wrong conclusions.
That said, I should like to refer to Parliament's and the Commission's budget.
Our group has strategies for both these budgets, and they have by and large been implemented as we reach the current stage of the budget procedure.
On Parliament's budget, we would like to emphasise the need for extended provision for freelance translation - because this is going to be an important factor in the years ahead.
We are pleased that early retirement has been extended to the political groups, and thank the Council for that - even if it is absent from this debate this afternoon.
We would like full transparency in the Council in future and for all its legislative discussions to be open to the public.
These are questions which all our group supports.
On the Commission budget, there are four relevant points.
Firstly, on payments and backlog, we would like to see a real effort being made to reduce the EUR 110 billion in commitments.
We are asking, as stated in the resolution, for a report from the Commission as to how it is going to achieve this objective of eliminating outstanding commitments.
Secondly, on internal policies, we are still looking for better value for money and for some of the monies for information policy to be retained in reserve, because we would like to see savings on administration and human resources.
We expect a report from the Commission on this subject by 30 April 2003.
Thirdly, on external policies, we would like improved accountability.
Therefore, we are supporting the appeal by our rapporteur for more information concerning the interinstitutional agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on the expenditure of money on foreign and security policy.
We would also like to know what kinds of expenditure the Council is expecting over the next five years, because we also agree with the rapporteur that it is unhealthy to think that the Council is going to be involved in large expenditure of funds which would not be subject to normal accountability and use.
Equally, we are asking the Commission to come forward with some form of thought process.
There seems to be some lethargy on the part of the Commission when it comes to thinking through what kind of priorities we should have for foreign and security policy in the future.
Lastly, my group would like me to say that we want to see this reform process completed and we need to look at how this whole process is being conducted.
We are convinced that progress has been made but we are not yet convinced that this whole programme of reform is going to be implemented.
We would like to know that you are out there selling it to the general public and that these reforms will be completed by the end of next year, as the most recent reform document from the Commission stated.
But, before we approve the new posts, we would very much like to see the reform elements in place and to know you are convinced that this whole reform process will be completed.
If this is not done so by the end of the current term of the Commission and Parliament, we will be in breach of the commitments we made to our electorate to ensure that real institutional reforms are carried out.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would of course like to thank our two rapporteurs.
Parliament has had what you might call a Swedish experience, and I think that it has been a good experience.
It has been very much geared towards consensus and has been imaginative and flexible in equal measure, and has for once closely examined structural aspects.
I am sure that this Budget procedure also has structural side effects that need to be very carefully examined.
From this perspective, I would also like to make the following comment: we have heard several times that this is the last Budget for just 15 Member States before enlargement.
But I hope that it is also one of the last Budgets before the convention secures full budget rights for this House, in the medium term at least, in relation to all types of expenditure policy and income policy.
That is a request that we have made.
You know that I have repeated this request during every Budget procedure; it has become a familiar refrain.
I think it is important that we should help to democratise the Budget procedure here.
The hallmark of the Budget as we draw it up at present is that heated debates rage during the budget-setting process around every million, sometimes even every thousand euros, yet during the year we often have to shift funds around and restructure the Budget.
This year alone we will probably draw up six supplementary and amending budgets.
We will have between 70 and 80 carry-overs, which means that a great many appropriations will have to be moved around.
Not only this year, but also in previous years, both during the budget procedure and right at the end of the year we have had to resort to frontloading in order to finance things that strictly speaking fall in the following year.
We also demonstrate by means of this pragmatic approach that we are prepared to finance essential aspects of European policy, and that although we set a Budget at the beginning of the year, there is so much flexibility and room for manoeuvre that at the end of the year the Budget is no longer as reliable as might have been wished and assumed at the outset, when we were discussing certain issues so forcefully.
That means that this form of budget setting at the very least needs reflecting upon.
We should take this into account in the coming weeks, months and years when we are further developing our budget policy.
As the Commissioner has said, the 2003 Budget is a thrifty one.
We will be spending just 1.05% of GNP to tackle all the tasks facing the European Union.
If you look at the position of those countries that are net contributors, which are so often the subject of debate, you will find that the biggest net contributors pay no more than 0.3 to 0.7% of their GNP.
That ranges from 0.3% for my own country and 0.7% of GNP, to finance this European policy.
0.3% for Germany!
So much for the heated debates that we are always having about how expensive this is all supposed to be!
In the context of the Budget, we try to husband our resources carefully.
We try to ensure that balances are maintained.
That will be a job for the future - starting with balances in this continent.
We need a financially balanced Europe in the long term.
We need to make sure that our institutions are capable of functioning, not forgetting the prospect of enlargement, and also bearing in mind the maturing process that our institutions and the European Union as a whole are going through.
These are long-term tasks.
We need to ensure that people in Europe who place their trust in us can rely on financial balance and are not taken unawares by short-term changes.
I would like to make this point very specifically in the case of agriculture, but it also applies to regional policy.
We are also interested in seeing reform of our regional policy and in unblocking the backlog of appropriations still to be executed.
I would, however, like to say this, Commissioner: it is not enough for Commissioner Barnier to examine how Structural Fund bureaucracy can be dismantled.
That is something that applies to all the EU support programmes.
I would be pleased if the other Commissioners affected were to behave in the same way.
We therefore need to strike a balance in our continent.
But we as Europeans also need a balance between continents, because we are not just a fortunate island; we also have to think about relations between the continents.
In the past we have repeatedly used our external policy to help other regions of the world.
This has become ever more difficult, because new tasks have been added to the ones we originally embarked upon: financing, reconstruction, the Balkans, financing reconstruction in Afghanistan, and also the enormous task of improving world health, not least the battle against AIDS.
That is not just an issue in Africa, it affects the whole world and that includes our own continent.
Money needs to be earmarked for that.
There is a lot we could say about financing, Mrs Schreyer, but there is no denying that we have a responsibility here that we need to shoulder.
It is hard to do all this.
Category 4 has caused us major headaches this year, just as in previous years.
We have to be flexible if we want to solve all the world's problems.
But there is one thing we need to be clear about: Europe's citizens can rest assured that we will protect their interests in this continent.
However, we are also keen to ensure that our continent occupies an appropriate position in the world as a whole.
We intend to set budgets in conjunction with you in a thrifty and sound way but at the same time with an eye to the future.
Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the budget, GÃ¶ran FÃ€rm and Per Stenmarck, for their thorough and constructive work.
I should likewise like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terence Wynn.
I also want to thank Denmark, as the country holding the presidency, for its excellent levels of cooperation, as well as Commissioner Michaele Schreyer.
The draft budget meets most of the demands of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
It is thrifty and rigorous, and the payment appropriations account for just 1.04% of GNP, while 1.08% has been provided in the financial perspective for expenditure.
There is therefore a margin of more than EUR 3 billion in the budget.
The draft budget now before us is also available in the form of an activity-based budget.
This has to do with the Commission's administrative reform.
The Financial Regulation has been undergoing reforms that will come into effect from the start of next year.
This entails a revision of the staff regulations, which Parliament is now debating.
This is a complete package of reforms intended to boost administrative efficiency, promote the downward delegation of authority, and clarify personal accountability.
These are objectives our group wholeheartedly supports.
The undoubted focus of the budget is enlargement.
This budget will probably be the last to be drafted for a Union of 15 Member States.
There is provision in it for some very important appropriations.
The Committee on Budgets is proposing an extra EUR 699 million in pre-accession aid for the candidate countries to make it easier for them to face the challenges of membership.
The problem regarding administrative appropriations is insufficient margin for manoeuvre under heading 5.
For that reason, the different institutions have started gathering funds out of this year's budget to be able to pay the costs of accession in advance.
For example, Parliament intends to lend the Commission EUR 43 million and the Council EUR 18 million.
In other words, levels of cooperation have been exemplary, and my sincerest thanks for that go especially to the rapporteur for the budget, Per Stenmarck.
The most serious problem in administering the EU budget is outstanding commitments and unused payment appropriations.
Outstanding commitments now amount to around EUR 107 billion, or more than the EU's total budget for one year.
The reason for this is the under-utilisation of payment appropriations.
This particularly concerns the Structural Funds and external actions.
Last year EUR 18 billion in payment appropriations remained unspent and the figure for the previous year was EUR 11 billion.
Under-utilisation on this scale seriously undermines the entire administrative process with regard to the EU budget.
In the spring outstanding commitments under the Structural Funds reached EUR 80 billion.
Despite this, though, the Council reduced the amount in payment appropriations that was proposed by the Commission.
That is why the Committee on Budgets increased payments by more than a billion euros.
Our group is calling for a dramatic simplification in the administration of the Structural Funds.
With these comments we are prepared to give the draft budget our support.
Mr President, there are some agreements that are stupid because they are inflexible.
That is the reason why someone in a very authoritative position said the Stability and Growth Pact was stupid.
Some of the representatives from France, Germany and Portugal in our group might agree, as might some Italians also.
Stupid too is the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline, which was concluded in May 1999.
That was the last job of the previous Parliament carried out for the present one.
It is on account of this stupid agreement that the European Parliament is virtually powerless when it comes to budgetary policy.
All we can do is sit around counting paper clips and spend our time in petty administrative tasks.
Mr Prodi said of the Growth and Stability Pact that the reality that lies behind it is multi-layered and that the institutions should take this into consideration and act flexibly.
The same has to be said about the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline.
Heading 4, the section that deals with external actions, is especially stupid in terms of its inflexibility.
We all know, everyone in this House knows, that the budget is in that respect 'quasi-rigid'.
A ceiling was fixed in the Interinstitutional Agreement, regarding which the Council is unwilling to be flexible.
Parliament has had the onerous task of trying to fit new priorities that both Parliament and the Council think important under the 1999 ceiling.
A few million has been discussed, and at the same time there might possibly be a billion in appropriations in heading 4 still not forwarded for payment.
Thus, there is money in this heading which everybody knows is not being spent.
One of the biggest problems with the budgetary procedure is how to include as an extension to the unpaid appropriations in this heading the new appropriations we want to pay, and which we need to pay, in order to fulfil the wishes of the budgetary authorities.
As the Interinstitutional Agreement is terrorising the drafting of the budget, it must come as no surprise to anyone that if EUR 10 billion remains unused from this budget it will go back to the Member States.
I call the Interinstitutional Agreement stupid because of its inflexibility, and the same goes for the Council that is perpetuating this inflexibility.
I cannot, however, agree with the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, regarding the stupidity of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Well done, Sweden!
The Swedish rapporteurs have done an excellent job.
Not being given the floor until after the GUE/NGL Group has spoken still requires a psychological adjustment on my part, but I am afraid I will have to get used to it.
Mr President, it is customary for us MEPs to initially react a little critically to the Council's absence from our plenary.
However, during our previous budgetary debate, the Council made a huge effort to sit here for four hours solidly, so I do not think we will take offence on this occasion.
I should, however, like to make a suggestion to the Council.
This morning, a video conference conciliation meeting took place with the Council for the first time, and we managed to reach agreement on the Solidarity Fund live on screen.
Next time there is a debate in the plenary that coincides with its own meetings, the Council could perhaps follow it on screen, and it could submit its comments virtually.
In fact, the Dutch Government could easily have done the honours.
Since the Dutch Government has resigned and parliament still has not adopted a position on enlargement, it has been agreed that the Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister will be present in Luxembourg over the next few days but will certainly not be saying anything.
Since this is not a first for us in Parliament, the Dutch minister could have easily kept his mouth shut here in Strasbourg.
But anyway, we are here to discuss the 2003 Budget.
I should first of all like to thank my fellow MEPs, Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck, for the work they have done, which has culminated in the first reading of the Budget that is now before us.
In my view, they have acquitted themselves of their tasks as rapporteurs expertly, and they were, and still are, very approachable for all the groups.
They are really not to blame, therefore, but I should nevertheless like to share with you the fact that I cannot muster any real enthusiasm for this budgetary debate or for the 2003 Budget that is before us.
When I explain to people why I have chosen to sit on the Committee on Budgets, then I always use the argument that the EU's Budget covers all areas.
As such, it pertains to structural funds, agriculture, environmental policy, research, social exclusion measures and the reconstruction of war-torn areas, and we are not talking peanuts, but about an amount in the region of EUR 100 billion.
Of course, what I am saying is true, but it is only half the story.
After all, the political battle we are fighting here today in the plenary is really not about shifting billions or about the overall picture, but about millions and about shifting the accents.
This is due to both the rigid financial perspectives and the various pieces of legislation that have already been laid down and as a result of which our hands are tied.
Take agricultural policy, for example.
When my group suggests bringing up the export subsidies for discussion because many farmers in developing countries are seriously hampered in their economic potential, then the argument of administrative assurance is used.
The export subsidies form part of existing policy, and we in Parliament cannot simply change this in a budgetary debate. Which is right, of course.
It is, however, also important for us to send out a political signal. We are a political forum, after all.
As it happens, no substantive arguments have been put forward against our proposal to scrap export subsidies. Instead, that three billion has simply been approved, as have the enormous amounts for the production of European tobacco, which we happen to think is extremely harmful to public health.
My group is also very critical about the amounts set aside for the Trans-European Networks.
After eight years, most of the projects are still in their infancy.
Yet still nobody dares say in public that the EU subsidies may, to some extent, be money down the drain.
We simply carry on undeterred, not always taking the best projects forward.
The Member States themselves grant priority to national projects, while the value-added of European funding is surely the fact that they must be cross-border projects.
The Commission is now having to come up with all kinds of emergency measures to support the real cross-border projects, although this is, of course, a somewhat bizarre situation.
Similarly, with regards to structural funding, Member States pursue double and often conflicting priorities, which partly explain the enormous delays in implementation.
On the one hand, they are all out for getting as much out of the Brussels money coffers as possible, but at the same time they struggle to find national co-financing because those projects are not always a national priority.
My conclusion is therefore that the Member States feel less responsible for European money or for the fact that it should be spent carefully and fairly, than they do for national funds.
This is quite remarkable when you think that it is all money originating from the same tax payer.
Another area of doubt concerning correct spending is of a wholly different nature.
I hope that Parliament will support me in this. It concerns the funding for Kedo.
We touched upon this briefly last night.
The European taxpayer is financing a nuclear energy plant in North Korea.
My group is opposed to this as a matter of principle in any case, because we prefer to support sustainable energy.
But anyway, this is the way things are, and I know that a majority in Parliament is in favour of it.
However, it now turns out that North Korea is probably also developing nuclear weapons.
It is clear to me that we should examine this carefully, and it also seems to make sense to me to place this money in the reserve and not to release it until we have clarity about the programmes pertaining to this plant.
I should also like to ask the European Commissioner for her opinion and whether she is already intending to place this money in the reserve at second reading.
These are all examples of money that is being spent but against which I would place question marks as to their judiciousness.
Then there is also a category of credits which I think should be spent, or even more should be spent.
One such example is enlargement.
There is a fine Dutch expression that says 'goedkoop is duurkoop' [you get what you pay for], and I am leaving it up to the interpreters to find a sound translation for this.
I am not in favour of wasting money, but I do believe in delivering on our promises and seizing historical opportunities.
The situation happens to be different from the one we anticipated in 1999 when the financial perspectives were laid down in Berlin.
Not six, but probably ten countries, will be joining, and not in 2002, but in 2004.
The financial plan should therefore be adjusted accordingly.
However, because of their 'accountant' attitude, the net payers are not interested.
My group will in any event be endorsing the amendments which will enable this to be adjusted, as I am convinced that we will ultimately be paying a hefty price.
The situation in category four has also changed.
Regarding the reconstruction of the Balkans and Afghanistan, it has often been said that it is impossible to deliver on all promises in category four, unless cutbacks are made in various other priorities.
For example, a downward adjustment was made to the multiannual programme for the other western Balkan countries due to the situation in post-Milosevic Serbia.
What will we do if peace is established in the Middle East?
What programmes will we be offering then?
I have already listed the areas where I am quite happy to cut back by a few billion, but I should like to see a few million added here.
Another area where an extra few million would not go amiss is category five, administrative expenditure.
It is no secret that I was unhappy with the deal concluded during July's conciliation.
According to this deal, Parliament and the Council look after each other's needs, and it was agreed that the Commission would be served via a frontloading operation.
This worked out well.
The 500 additional positions for enlargement will probably be created.
However, the political signal is rather unpleasant, in my view.
The Commission is not a closing entry; it is necessary for a smooth enlargement process.
Ironically, the people who are most critical of enlargement and of the capacity of the candidate countries to implement the acquis communautaire are often the very people who refuse to allow the Commission to have sufficient staffing levels to implement and monitor the implementation of the acquis communautaire.
In my opinion, the frontloading method is not particularly attractive, nor terribly transparent, as Mr Walter has already stated.
Despite this, I should like to extend warm congratulations to the rapporteurs on the result, because in the final analysis, it is the result that counts.
Mrs Buitenweg, I understand how you feel when you say that you are not used to speaking after the GUE/NGL Group, but it may be of some comfort to know that you were allowed to speak for three times as long.
That too is a fine thing!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this debate on the first reading of the budget for the financial year 2003, I do not wish to focus on the technical aspects. Indeed, I have taken the floor on several occasions in recent months to condemn what I consider to be the shortcomings and historic inconsistencies of the Community budget such as the RALs or the financing of internal policies and external actions, and also to draw your attention to the specific problems which have only come to light in recent months such as, for example, the ceiling for the administrative expenditure heading, which is too low, and, more generally, the inadequacy of the Financial Perspective agreed in Berlin in 1999.
Today, I want to try and address the situation from a political perspective - if it can be described as such - rather than a technical perspective.
At a historic time such as that we are currently experiencing, when the international system is continually changing, on the one hand, and with enlargement and the debate on the future of Europe taking place, on the other, I feel that we too, who are experts in financial matters, should start to think about the role we want the European Parliament to play.
The question is as follows: should we agree to be mere implementors of rules, rules for the most part written by others, or do we want to be able to change things?
For example, how do we feel about the fact that the Council was able to obtain a legal basis from the Commission regarding the issue of natural disasters, for instance, which is an extremely important matter? Would we not also like to be in a position where we can contribute to the Commission's work?
Ladies and gentlemen, very often, we hide - and I am talking about us as a whole political class, of course - behind respect for rules and procedures without even attempting to make genuine changes to them or to the way they are applied. Changes that would be for the better, of course.
This is the message I want to be conveyed as an addendum to this debate.
The 2003 budget is proving to be a good one, and I congratulate the rapporteurs on their commitment, all the effort they have put in and the results achieved, thanks, not least, to Commissioner Schreyer, the entire Commission structure, the secretariat and the draftsmen, but I can only emphasise that this is a technical budget in which our role has been primarily that of making the figures add up, lacking as we do the strength, the courage and the will to introduce genuine political measures.
It may be that we younger Members want to change the world sometimes, but, this time, I would be content just to change a few tiny elements of our European budget.
Mr President, we would like to add three comments concerning the Budget at this reading.
First of all, at the Commission's proposal, Parliament decided to set up a Solidarity Fund within the budget lines B2-400 and B7-090 during the previous sitting.
I expressed our doubts surrounding this fund at the time, and I shall now confine myself to the budgetary aspects.
This fund is, to all intents and purposes, virtual, for it is still empty.
When a major disaster does strike, we will need to find resources in the Budget for this Fund retrospectively.
This strikes us as highly improbable.
Furthermore, if more than one disaster strikes in any one calendar year, the Fund's upper limit (EUR 1 billion) may also create a problem.
Imagine that a major disaster strikes in the spring, to which the Commission assigns EUR 700 million from this Fund.
What would happen if another disaster on a similar scale were to strike in the autumn?
There is the risk that the resources allocated for the following year would be released prematurely.
This could be the thin end of the wedge.
Given the uncertain origin of the Fund's resources, we are faced with the undesirable situation whereby there is a Fund for which no provisions have been made in the 2003 Budget.
This means that after a number of years, considerable pressure could be brought to bear on the Member States to make additional contributions.
Given the current economic situation and the freedom in budgetary policy that some Member States allow themselves, I can foresee major problems.
I should now like to make a critical comment on the Budget for the Sixth Framework Programme on research and development. The funding of research from the EU budget brings with it ethical dilemmas, as is the case, for example, in research on embryos.
In the fanatical fight to fund research of this kind, the entire framework programme will soon be in the balance because at second reading Parliament refused to make any more guideline statements about the funding of controversial areas.
Moreover, the Council would have been better to start the debate on ethics sooner and postpone the ethical guidelines until after the programme had been accepted.
This controversy demonstrates that the framework programme should have been restricted to facilitating cross-border cooperation.
Active financial support is undesirable and superfluous.
Why should we co-finance research that is likely to take place anyway?
My third and final comment concerns fisheries.
The Commission and Parliament devote much attention to the Spanish and Portuguese fishermen who, together with their regions, are let down by the lack of an agreement with Morocco.
Millions of euros have been spent on compensation, reducing the numbers of fishermen and re-training them in those regions.
Other fishing regions are also starting to feel the pinch now.
Apparently, biologists are now advising the Commission to ban cod fishing and to reduce other quotas.
This would have a major financial impact in the Netherlands, among others.
Would it not make sense, therefore, to shift the budget's attention to fishing regions that have been self-sufficient to date?
Financial support for those regions in the form of socio-economic programmes is desirable.
This aspect, however, is still missing from this budget which spends millions on fisheries agreements with third countries, from which only a minority of countries and shipowners benefit.
Speaking of solidarity, it would not hurt for the EU to devote more attention financially to a fishing industry that has not been able to make use of subsidies for the renovation and building of ships for years.
This has caused unfair competition for many years.
A fisheries sector that keeps to the quotas should be able to expect more from Brussels.
Mr President, much has already been said by previous speakers.
We distribute some of our funds indiscriminately, we set too few priorities, and we also finance ineffective actions, if you consider that we still allow ourselves the luxury of two parliamentary places of work and are therefore also paying for very questionable tourism for Members as well as a Convention that is costing millions.
Europe needs new impetus.
We need an offensive on the economy, including measures to make cheap capital - I mean venture capital - available above all to small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is precisely here that effective initiatives are lacking in the 2003 Budget.
There is an urgent need for action when it comes to introducing the Basle II provisions, above all when we consider that 45% of European small and medium-sized enterprises have little or no own resources.
As well as changing the way in which aid is allocated in agriculture, in the future we will also have to change the distribution criteria in the Structural Funds.
The standard of living in a region should not be used to assess the situation or be a factor in the amount of aid allocated.
Companies or sectors that need support should all receive these funds, regardless of whether the company is located in the north, south or east.
We must use the funds entrusted to us more efficiently and more carefully, if we also wish to co-finance enlargement.
Mr President, Commissioner, absent representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today the budget has a Swedish accent and I believe Swedish is a language of consensus and agreement between everybody.
In view of their spirit of openness and their quest for common positions, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr GÃ¶ran FÃ€rm and Mr Per Stenmarck, for the work they have done.
GÃ¶ran FÃ€rm is one more in a long list of rapporteurs who are faced with the fundamental dilemma of Category 4 of external actions, that is, whether the Council or the Commission should have the last word in terms of setting external political priorities, or whether Parliament should have its say.
Every single year we hold the same debate at first reading.
The Commission presents a preliminary draft that cuts the Union's traditional external priorities; the Commission cuts the appropriations approved by this Parliament the previous year and explains that the programmes in question have not been implemented satisfactorily.
Then comes the first reading in the Council and, taking advantage of the previous explanation by the Commission, it cuts the appropriations intended for external actions even further, using the pious moral justification of budgetary savings and the principles of sound financial management.
Next comes the stage we are at now, in which Parliament reinstates the lost appropriations, restates the external priorities and reminds the other two institutions that this is an exercise involving three of us.
I belong to the parliamentary majority that viewed the Berlin financial perspectives of 1999 as sufficient and correct.
I voted for them and campaigned for them.
I do not share the view of some Members that those financial perspectives should be revised.
Now, I recognise that we are in an increasingly complicated situation.
New external commitments arise, which are happily taken up either by the Council or by Mr Prodi, or by both in unison - although that hardly ever happens.
These commitments then have to be met within a very strict financial framework, made up of non-obligatory expenditure, which we MEPs are asked to respect.
Since not all commitments can be met, however, and not everything can be funded when money is scarce, we have to turn to the excuse of the poor implementation of certain geographical programmes.
I do not believe that excuse is any good anymore.
We MEPs vote for appropriations which originate from the money of the European citizens so that it can be spent to fund external aid programmes.
Commissioner, your task and that of the other Commissioners and the Council is to ensure that these programmes are implemented.
You are the Community's executive.
I do not know whether it is the fault of Latin America or the Mediterranean countries, for example, that their programmes have a low level of implementation, but I do know that their needs are real.
I know that the solution is not to reduce year after year the appropriations we approve, to reduce programmes, but, as we all know, to find new ways to improve implementation.
We hope that for next year - and this is a desire that we express every year at first reading - that the Commission, rather than cutting the money of the previous year, will even request more money in order to comply with the European Parliament's traditional external priorities.
I believe that, in terms of applying cuts, the efforts of the Council are quite sufficient, since it is a great specialist in that area.
Mr President, after 15 minutes from Mr FÃ€rm and 10 minutes from Mr Stenmarck and all the other contributions, there is not much left to say.
I was giving evidence recently to one of the subcommittees of the Convention, chaired by Mr Amato, on simplification.
I made the point that the language of the budget is probably the twelfth language in this institution.
Listening to this debate, where the words 'ramassage' and 'frontloading' are being used so often, it seems as though they have become part of the everyday lexicon of our budget language.
I also said that we need only one reading of the budget, and that would simplify the whole process.
Had that system applied today, I am sure we would not have voted for the budget that we now have.
I say that because a lot of people are concerned about the way in which this budget will be voted on Thursday.
I do not just mean the Commission and the Council, but colleagues from a variety of parliamentary committees.
I want to make one point absolutely clear to anyone who shares these worries: this is, after all, a first reading to show we have political priorities and to put some pressure on the Council, it is not the end of the story.
These concerns have arisen because of what the committee adopted.
We exceeded the ceilings in three categories - in category 1b we will have to see how Parliament votes on Thursday.
On category 2, we are duty-bound to find a solution with the Council.
On category 4, we also need to find a solution together with the Council.
That is why the decisions have been taken in category 4, to try to ensure that there will be real dialogue with the Council to solve some of the political problems in that area.
As others have said, the ceiling on category 4 has been a problem ever since we concluded the interinstitutional agreement.
Every year since then we have had to use the flexibility instrument.
Some may agree with Mr SeppÃ€nen that the agreement is stupid.
I am one of those who voted for it.
That might make me stupid, but the reality is that this Parliament agreed it, and we have to live with it and within its restrictions.
I hope that when it comes to the next interinstitutional agreement we will have learnt lessons from this one, especially in category 4.
However, this time the needs in category 4 - especially in the areas of Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund - have to be sorted out.
On the Global Health Fund, there are certainly big differences of opinion between the Commission, the Council and ourselves.
To make it worse, at least one Member State is asking us to find the extra EUR 65 million, which complicates matters when we know what the Council's position is already.
When I say it has to be sorted out, I mean we have to find a real solution with the Council, not going into a conciliation or trialogues and playing the usual games.
We have serious problems in these areas and we need a real sense of cooperation.
It must be said that we have had a good working relationship with the Danish presidency.
We should not condemn the Danish presidency for not being here.
They have apologised to me and explained that they have other commitments.
The fact that the President-in-Office sat for 4 Âœ hours at our last meeting showed his commitment.
They have been quite good in the way they have worked with Parliament.
They have respected Parliament and Parliament's will.
The Danish presidency has been good to work with.
As Mrs Buitenweg said, the presidency has also been good today, even in the videoconference on the European Solidarity Fund.
But let us hope that those good relationships can continue as we go into the next conciliation, prior to the second reading by the Council.
I also made the point at the Convention that, in contrast to the American War of Independence, where the cry was 'no taxation without representation', we in this Parliament have the luxury of having representation without taxation.
That makes the Council often think that we are profligate with taxpayers' money.
The message we need to give to the Council is that the budgets we vote here are serious and prudent, but they have political priorities.
I hope that, in December, we will have achieved some of those political priorities.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and the Commissioner.
As we have already stated, the Group of the Liberal Democrat and Reform Party is fairly satisfied with this budget, which would appear to be rigorous and transparent throughout.
This is part of our tradition.
I would, however, immediately add that, in my view, it is also an excessively technical budget with only a very limited political dimension.
We can accept the basic lines, particularly those relating to reform and enlargement, of course, which I feel is the greatest challenge facing us.
However, precisely because it is a challenge, we must take more decisive, political action, action which is, above all, more visible to all the European citizens.
I too, like the Committee Chairman, who spoke just now, feel that it is imperative that the procedure is reformed.
The technical elements of the procedure need to be revised, it needs to be simplified and, in particular, its cultural and political dimensions need to be developed, with the Council's powers defined in such a way that they are maximised, not reduced, to achieve a more effective, more focused and, above all, more topical debate.
There needs to be a basic philosophy underlying the European budget, a basic philosophy of shared, not concentrated, administrative responsibility - and I stress, shared: this is extremely important - and Parliament needs to have a greater political role, for it must discharge its mandate as effectively as possible. Parliament, like the Union as a whole, must be a visibly political institution and make political responses.
I will focus on just two technical aspects.
The first concerns the issue of category 4, which my colleague has already touched on.
I would add something further.
It may be that we pay little or rather too little attention to the Mediterranean question, it may be that we pay too little attention to the issue of the Middle East.
We go so far as to debate reconstruction, Afghanistan and issues concerning very distant countries, but there is a matter nearer to home which we will soon, all too soon, have to address more thoroughly and much more decisively.
I will mention one more issue: culture.
The funds committed for young people, training and information are utterly inadequate.
Mr President, in March 2002 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on guidelines for the 2003 Budget.
A series of issues were mentioned that are of the utmost significance for the future viability of our policies on agriculture and rural development.
These include the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, consumer protection and enlargement.
I hope that the Commission is sufficiently courageous and competent also to take account of these long-term objectives when it is implementing the budget and that it will not be distracted by more immediate political concerns.
I hope that sources of conflict, such as shortcomings in accounting procedures, fiddling and cooking of the books, are eliminated and that instead transparency and strict discipline are the order of the day when the budget is implemented.
Both nationally and internationally, interested members of the public are presented with a confused and contradictory picture of agricultural policy.
As they currently stand, Commissioner Fischler's proposals have not met with the approval of a majority.
More work therefore needs to be done on them.
Despite the fact that the applicant countries have made huge economic and social adjustments, the Berlin decisions provide that the funds to be transferred to the accession countries, in the form of pre-accession aid, and expenditure on enlargement are to be maintained as laid down and made public.
Several discussions in which I have participated have reinforced my view, in favour of the applicant countries, that the 25% rule for direct payments is politically unacceptable; in addition the applicant countries fear high losses and are demanding an accession rebate and a change in their quotas.
This will have a major impact on the funding of the agricultural policy and the current financial perspective will have to be revised.
How much will enlargement cost?
That is the question.
How we are to respond to this in the 2003 Budget remains unknown.
A vital question for the agricultural sector is 1.05% + X and for as long as it remains unanswered the implementation of the 2003 Budget will remain a dangerous business as far as agriculture is concerned.
Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck on their excellent work on the 2003 budget.
It is important to remember that the budget is there to support policy decisions taken either by the Council or by the Council and Parliament jointly.
It is inappropriate to seek to use budgetary procedure as a means of shaping that policy.
I am referring in particular to certain recommendations relating to agricultural and structural funds.
The proposal to reduce export subsidies is both misplaced and ill judged, especially since it is aimed at forcing a policy decision, mainly a reduction in the transport of live animals.
The budget is not the appropriate instrument for such policy decisions, regardless of how one might feel about the issue.
As far as the substance is concerned, we should remember that we live in a global economy, with strong competitors for agricultural trade.
In the current climate of depressed prices and policy uncertainty, we are going to place our farmers at a further disadvantage.
Let me assure you that, if the EU decided to ban live animal exports today, the Australians would step in and take over our markets straight away.
This is an important commercial consideration that must be borne in mind.
Staying with agriculture, I share the concern of many colleagues over the proposed across-the-board reduction of EUR 275 million in agricultural spending.
Clearly this proposal is out of touch with current agricultural realities.
My own group has tabled a number of amendments which seek to undo some of the potential damage.
Likewise, the proposed quota of EUR 525 million in structural fund payment appropriations.
