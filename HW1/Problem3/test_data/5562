[2004/2271(BUD)];
- the report (A6- /2005) by MrÂ Garriga Polledo, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on draft amending budget No 1/2005 of the European Union for the financial year 2005 [COM(2005)0025 C6- /2005 2005/2014(BUD)];
- the report (A6- /2005) by MrsÂ Jensen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of the European Parliament for an amending budget of the European Union for the financial year 2005 (salary adjustment) [2005/2034(BUD)].
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the guidelines of the budget for other European Union institutions for 2006 have set the following priorities.
The first is the successful completion of the 2004 round of enlargement, by fully integrating representatives of the new EU Member States into the EU institutions, as well as preparations for the next round of EU enlargement, when Bulgaria and Romania will join.
Nearly a year has already passed since the enlargement of the EU, but still many permanent positions which have been set aside for the new Member States remain vacant, and this is an unacceptable situation.
One of the problems to be emphasised in this connection is the excessive red-tape and slow procedures for taking on staff.
The second is effective and very targeted use of European Union budget resources.
This priority encompasses such matters as: focusing EU institutional expenditure on fundamental tasks; backing requests for new permanent positions from the budget only after having assessed the possibility of redistributing resources and staff within the framework of the existing budget; backing new initiatives only after having assessed their impact on the budget and interinstitutional cooperation with a view to economical and effective use of budget resources.
For example, in order to ensure more appropriate use of EU budget resources in relation to various EU institutionsâ needs for extra work space, chiefly in connection with EU enlargement, we invite all the EU institutions to work together and to allow their premises to be used for the requirements of other institutions.
This will make it possible to provide the work space necessary for various meetings and other events without unnecessary extra expense on building or renting premises.
Extra capacity in this sphere is huge.
As an example, we might mention the European Parliament plenary session halls in Brussels and Strasbourg, which lie empty most of the time.
The third is improving EU budget terminology, making it more complete and more transparent in order to show taxpayers more clearly how their resources are used.
In speaking about the European Parliament budget, I would firstly like to stress that a total expenditure ceiling will be set according to careful evaluation of justified needs.
Achieving a ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure is not an end in itself.
I would like to emphasise that a better explanation to citizens of the European Parliamentâs work in this connection, placing particular emphasis on the European Parliamentâs representative role for the EU Member States, is an important aspect of Parliamentâs work in 2006.
Preparations by the European Parliament to play a larger role in the legislative sphere, as set out in the EU Constitutional Treaty, are a second important aspect.
Finally, I should like to say a few words about the overall EU budget for 2006.
I would like to emphasise that 2006 is the last year of the existing Financial Perspectives.
It is, therefore, important that the total amount of 2006 budget commitment and payment appropriations should honour those commitments which the EU entered into, including those connected with the enlargement of the European Union.
Thus an attitude such as the EU Council adopted over the European Union budget for 2000, where it artificially blocked the amount of payment appropriations, is unacceptable.
If we want to see the European Union as a reliable partner, it is important that the European Union should fulfil its commitments, including the commitments which it entered into in connection with the enlargement of the EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 2005 is going to be an important year for all the European institutions, including the European Commission, of course.
I believe it is important to wish the European Commission a good start to its relations with Parliament, and the Committee on Budgets has found the best way of doing so by accepting yesterday amending budget No 1/2005 with very little internal discussion.
We have decided to do so without amendments, at a single reading, and with the urgency the European Commission wished to see.
We accept the changes of activity from one political area to another, because we believe that the new Commission and the new Commissioners require certain changes to the organisation of the Commissionâs services, because each Commissioner will have a very different portfolio to their predecessor and because it is necessary to make these small adjustments to the organisational structure.
The fact that the budgetary effect is neutral makes it easy for Parliament to adopt this amending budget without any problem.
In return, we hope that the organisation of the Commissionâs services will operate perfectly and that this small change we are introducing can lead to better execution of the budget by the various Directorates-General.
We are aware that further amending budgets that will arise during the year will cause rather more difficulty.
It may not be possible to approve them at a single reading.
I therefore believe, Commissioner, that this is a good opportunity to demonstrate perfect interinstitutional cooperation and for the three institutions to approve this amending budget with the urgency you had requested.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I shall also present an amending budget, which implies a response.
It is the amending budget for Parliamentâs financial year 2005, which must take account of the fact that staff salaries and pensions in 2004 were adjusted by a rate lower than had originally been expected.
The adjustment of salaries and pensions, adopted by the Council at the end of last year, only amounted to 0.7%, and, when we prepared the budget for this year, we anticipated a 2.6% increase in salaries.
Like the other EU institutions, Parliament can now, therefore, cut back the staff appropriations in the 2005 budget.
That is something about which we, of course, agreed in the budget conciliation.
When all is said and done, we are, then, concerned here with a EURÂ 7.98Â million reduction in the European Parliamentâs expenditure on, for example, salaries and that is something to be welcomed.
In the same connection, we are directing the Secretary-General of the European Parliament to examine Parliamentâs budget in July, to assess the situation and to see if we need another amending budget.
The background to this is that we envisage the real possibility of a budget surplus for Parliament this year, meaning that the appropriations will be discontinued at the end of the year.
This is because, for a number of years, Parliament has secured us future savings on rent by purchasing buildings â a very sensible policy, meaning that we can save some money.
In 2004, the âmopping-upâ transfers of EURÂ 190Â million made it possible to release a portion of the appropriations we have from the 2005 budget for buildings.
I am well aware that Parliamentâs services are engaged in negotiations about further purchases of buildings that we are at present renting, but these are at an early stage, so we do not know what position we shall ultimately be in.
The fact is, however, that the appropriations we have in 2005 following the reduction for salaries will make it possible to fund important areas we do not at the moment have in the budget, notably the preparations for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, and they will perhaps also make it possible for us to purchase further buildings housing Parliamentâs information offices in the Member States.
We shall return to this subject in July.
I also have a number of remarks to make concerning MrÂ Dombrovskisâ report on the 2006 budget, now that there is time for doing so.
This budget will, of course, also be characterised by the preparations for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania which, as MrÂ Dombrovskis pointed out, it is anticipated will take place in 2007.
It will also be characterised by the already completed enlargement to include ten new countries and by the continued need to recruit staff from the new Member States.
A huge effort has, of course, already been made to acquire the upwards of 1Â 200 new employees we have obtained in Parliament, an effort that has in many ways been a great success.
I think, however, that our rapporteur, MrÂ Dombrovskis, is right to demand that we investigate whether the resultant staffing situation is satisfactory in all respects.
We must ensure that recruitment does not take an unnecessarily long time and is not unduly bureaucratic.
It must be ensured that we have the translators and interpreters we need.
We must see to it that, as Members of Parliament, we have access to the necessary expertise so that we can do some serious legislative work.
The quantity of legislation has, of course, risen significantly in recent years in view of the new treaties, and the demand for better legislation, with which we of course all agree, means that we must have proper legal guidance.
Moreover, there must be resources for proper impact assessments in connection with the legislation, including assessments of the financial consequences for the public sector, the EU budget, the national treasuries and the business sector.
We therefore need more assistance.
Last but not least, I am delighted that, in Parliamentâs draft budget for 2006, we propose a significant strengthening of Parliamentâs information policy.
This involves a radical evaluation of information policy so that we ensure that we achieve the objectives of the effort to provide information.
It must become easier and simpler for journalists and people in general to follow the legislative process. It must become easier for people to find out how they can secure their civil liberties with Parliamentâs help.
We must ensure that the fine speechifying about transparency does, in actual fact, bear fruit.
My group and I are, therefore, also in favour of our giving more financial support to information policy, even if we always say that we must be economical.
It is also important for us to increase our efforts in favour of decentralisation by means of the information offices in the Member States where a better sense can be obtained of the practical needs that exist for information.
I would thank MrÂ Dombrovskis for his efforts.
We are able to support his report.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are three reports up for debate, and I should like to focus largely on two of them, because I fully agree with the content of my colleague MrÂ Garriga Polledoâs report, and indeed it probably requires the least discussion.
I should like to thank my colleague MrÂ Dombrovskis, in particular, for taking the trouble to tackle the budgets of the other institutions for 2006, because I think that 2006 will be a very important year as the financial negotiations with the Council unfold.
I should like to say very clearly â and here the rapporteur has my support â that if we are to be credible in our ongoing arguments with the Commission about how to make the best use of Europeâs scant resources, we must also look at how we and, in turn, the other institutions, can achieve the greatest possible effect with the minimum of resources.
At the same time, I am a little concerned that Parliament is being rather careless with the hard-earned dividends resulting from the speed with which we managed to fund the buildings here in Strasbourg and Brussels and, later, Luxembourg.
That is not right, in my view.
On the contrary, Parliament, too, should prove to itself that it is able to cope on the resources at its disposal.
I support our rapporteurâs approach of putting the spotlight clearly on the issue of working conditions in this regard.
There are now 25 Member States, with â if I remember rightly â 21Â languages.
It has become more difficult to work together at Group level and in working parties â even in small circles â without resources commensurate with the translation capacity necessitated.
This is a very important point if Parliamentâs efficiency and ability to work are to be guaranteed.
I do not believe that it would be helpful in this regard to consider equipping the Chamber with computers to enable us to read the amendments, however.
This is incompatible with our voting system.
Nor do I believe that it makes sense to wire the whole Parliament and install a wireless LAN in all the buildings; these are not our core tasks in this connection.
I would ask the Presidency of Parliament to proceed very carefully on these issues.
This brings me directly to MrsÂ Jensenâs report on supplementary budget NoÂ 1/2005.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has proposed a motion to make appropriate cuts in the buildings reserve already, within the framework of the budgetary procedure.
I find it most regrettable that, yesterday evening, the Presidency was not already able to release, within the framework of the supplementary budget, the resources that are likely to be surplus to requirements; in other words, to reduce the budget correspondingly.
It is unfortunate that that was not done.
This will no doubt come back to haunt us before too long.
This much must be stated very clearly here: if a âmopping-upâ transfer of EURÂ 142Â million was made inÂ 2004 â which amounts to almost 10% of Parliamentâs budget â I start asking myself whether there is any point in continuing to draw up a budget for this House if this budget ends up taking a completely different course, and thus what was put forward by the budgetary authority â which is what we are in the case of Parliamentâs budget, by virtue of the gentlemenâs agreement â ends up being disregarded.
This point needs serious attention.
I want no further part in such a performance.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as MrÂ Ferber has just said, Mr Garriga Polledoâs report does not really pose a problem as we knew that, given the changes that have taken place in the Commission, we would probably need a supplementary and amending budget.
I am going to start with a few comments on MrsÂ Jensenâs report on the SAB for the European Parliament.
It is irrefutable with regard to the estimates for Parliamentâs operating costs.
We can only be concerned that these estimates were distorted for items as important as estimates for appropriations for salaries for officials and estimates for property appropriations.
Our rapporteurâs recommendations calling on our administration to be more vigilant bear the mark of common sense.
Through this report, we are also respecting our commitment to budgetary dialogue, as it still leaves the expenditure envisaged in the 2005 budget available to be spent, and even allows for financing Bulgaria and Romaniaâs accession to the Union with the non-allocated appropriations.
There is, therefore, no reason to oppose this administrative action.
With regard to the report on the guidelines for the appropriations for the other institutions presented to us today by Mr Dombrovskis, first of all I must thank him for his excellent work, and for the speed with which he has enabled us to debate and vote on these guidelines in this March sitting.
Following in the tradition of our budgetary guidelines in this area, it is essential that all of the institutions continue the effort to complete enlargement with Bulgaria and Romania, which the 2006 budget must allow for.
We share our rapporteurâs concerns.
Only a last-minute controversy on the measures to be put in place in the Court of Justice will lead my group to better verify some solutions proposed in Mr Deprezâs report.
Mr Dombrovskisâ report, backed up by the previous report by Mrs Jensen, points out that Parliamentâs budget must enable it to equip itself with the additional resources to enable us to better respond to the scale of our task and the expectations of the citizens.
In our view, a reduction in Parliamentâs budget below the agreed 20% cannot be envisaged until such time as the policy of purchasing various premises for Parliament to have a presence and to carry out its work has come to an end.
Above all, this budget is essential in order for Parliament to increase the interpreting and translation resources available to the various committees.
I would also like to draw your attention to professional assistance for MEPs, which must be increased.
The amounts allocated to each MEP for staff are absolutely inadequate given the complexity of Parliamentâs new powers.
Moreover, the lack of a statute for our assistants is a situation that is entirely unworthy of a political institution that places an innovative society that respects human rights at the heart of its work.
Having a professional statute is a right for our assistants, but giving our assistants a statute is a duty for us as legislators.
Likewise, I think that we should think about the problem of the statute for MEPs.
When I hear some MEPs saying that it is difficult for them to join a pension scheme because of the cost of some of these schemes, I think that is entirely unworthy of the democratic institution that we are.
Also, like MrsÂ Jensen, I wish to draw your attention to the problems with Parliamentâs communication policy.
This policy needs to be improved and while new resources are essential, new techniques and a new approach to communication are now a priority in our view.
At a time when the draft constitutional treaty is being voted on by referendum or parliamentary vote, we know how essential this information for citizens is.
But we need to establish simple, daily and effective information to pass on and decentralise the interest among citizens in the work that we do here.
We see this as a priority that should not only be reflected in figures in the budget, but in good professional work by the ad hoc Parliament services.
It is therefore clear to us that the idea of lowering the Parliament budget below 20% is not acceptable given our commitments and, above all, the expansion of our powers.
As long as we lack the effective resources to fully carry out our task, we will not be able to get back to the principle that is essential to our role and therefore to European democracy.
Â Â  . Mr President, the report by MrÂ Dombrovskis under discussion on guidelines for the 2006 budget, which concern Sections other than the Commission, creates a basis for the forthcoming budget for these institutions.
I wish, even at this stage, to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Dombrovskis, for his excellent work.
I likewise wish to thank Mrs Jensen and Mr Garriga Polledo, who today are proposing mainly technical amendments to this yearâs budget, according to their own areas of responsibility.
The European Union is still going through a period of adjustment to the year 2006.
The integration of the new Member States has to be completed, just as the rapporteur said in his opening speech.
In particular, this means bringing the situation with regard to human resources up to date.
Furthermore, the demands of multilingualism must be met.
The interpreting facilities have to be up to date in all respects, and the translation service has to run smoothly.
Multilingualism is an important value in Europe, and one which needs to be fostered.
At the same time, it serves as a clear indication that the European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, are preserving basic democratic values.
Only complete multilingualism will guarantee that every EU citizen can stand as a candidate for, and furthermore get elected to, the European Parliament, regardless of nationality and cultural and educational background.
Recently the subject of posts in Parliament has arisen once again.
The current system is unwieldy, even if it does add to the multinational nature of the EU.
Travel connections to and from Strasbourg are poor, because it is not an international air traffic hub.
There should be a natural solution to this in the future with the various parties concerned working closely together.
Perhaps a good compromise could also be reached with France, the country concerned.
Parliamentâs policy on property has brought results to the extent that it can at present operate almost entirely in the buildings it owns.
This has partly come about through a policy of economy with regard to operating expenditure.
We must continue to ensure that economy is still the central objective in budgetary policy and financial administration in the future.
This is also what the report before us now aims at, stressing as it does the need for efficiency, reallocation of appropriations and interinstitutional cooperation.
That is why the report under discussion provides a good basis for discussion of the budget itself.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to confine my remarks to paragraph 28 of MrÂ Dombrovskisâ report, namely the paragraph applying to the costs that arise through Parliament being forced to work one week per month in Strasbourg, instead of concentrating its activities solely in Brussels.
The direct costs of this are estimated at EURÂ 200Â million per year.
They do not include the loss of efficiency or the additional costs incurred by Members of the European Parliament.
The total cost is probably closer to at least EURÂ 300 million per year.
Given that the EUâs objective in the Lisbon Process is to become the most competitive knowledge-based region of the world, the European Parliamentâs unwillingness and inability to close down its activities in Strasbourg seems completely absurd.
Voters cannot have respect for a political leadership that cannot even manage such an obvious changeover successfully, and one of a type that industry in general is always having to manage.
I do not think it sensible for the EUâs long-term financial perspectives to be wrapped up in an accumulated cost of EURÂ 2Â billion for maintaining two places of work.
These resources could instead be invested in technical research or something else that promotes growth.
It is not acceptable to argue in favour of a larger budget as long as this anachronism is maintained.
The long-term budget should therefore include this cost, and a decision should be taken to move operations to Brussels by no later than 2013.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should also like to thank MrÂ Dombrovskis for his knowledgeable and lucid report on the guidelines for the 2006 budget procedure with regard to the sections on the EU institutions.
The report quite correctly highlights the fact that the 2004 enlargement round needs to be concluded efficiently in the coming financial year.
In particular, the remaining positions for officials from the ten new Member States, most of which are for translators and interpreters, need to be filled.
It is indeed the case that the Members from the new Member States have noticed significant shortfalls in these areas, which make it difficult for us to carry out our jobs.
The rapporteur was also right to stress the importance of making preparations for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, which is due to take place in 2007.
We were glad to see that MrÂ Dombrovskisâ guidelines include a call to increase the efficiency of measures taken by EU institution by means of closer interinstitutional cooperation.
By way of an aside, it would be worth adding to this list something that was mentioned by previous speakers, namely improved communication from and to Strasbourg, and an increase in the efficiency of measures taken by the individual services of the EU institutions.
This could for example involve adherence to the principle whereby committee meetings are not held in Strasbourg, which might make it possible to avoid late-night sittings and sittings that do nothing to improve our mood or the efficiency of our actions.
I believe that greater attention should be paid to the fact that we are committed to providing reliable and neutral information, and it is particularly important that EU funding for information policy be spent accordingly.
Despite the fact that the majority of Members of the House subscribe to this principle, this is not always the case in practice.
In the report on the information campaign on the Constitutional Treaty, for example, it is clearly stated that the benefits citizens will derive from the Constitution should be explained.
Where is the impartiality in that?
Many thanks.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the draft budgetary process for the year 2006 and the budgetary corrections for the 2005 financial year are unquestionably reacting to the current situation and developments in the field of budgetary relations and are directed toward effectively upholding the functioning of the European Union.
In this regard, I appreciate the good work of the rapporteurs.
In this short space I would especially like to support Mr Ferber and add my voice to his and place a special emphasis on the effort to resolve the unresolved issue of the volume of translating and interpreting operations that create a bottleneck in the work of the European Parliament.
In addition to adequate funding, this involves increasing the number of qualified employees in this area, specific measures within the framework of specialised training in the area of translations and interpreting, and I would like to emphasise this also to improving the management and logistics of these operations, which is a matter not directly related to budgetary procedures.
All this is important for the European Parliament to fulfil its mandate as a multinational, multilingual institution that adopts essential European standards, rather than convey the impression of an agency for teaching English.
I thank you for your attention, and I thank the translators for their good work.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
Voting will be on Thursday, except for the report by MrÂ Dombrovskis, which will be put to the vote on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item on the agenda is the Commissionâs statement on planned egg cell trade.
Â Â  . Mr President, human tissues and cells have become an important part of healthcare.
Their therapeutic use continues to increase, not only in terms of the frequency of use of tissues and cells, but also in the range of ways in which they can be used.
Tissues and cells are often acquired through cross-border exchanges.
Over the past decade, the interchange of these human substances, both within Europe and between Europe and third countries, has increased.
The fact that the exchange of tissues and cells can result in the transmission of disease has focused attention on the need for increased safety measures.
The European institutions responded to this concern by adopting a directive in MarchÂ 2004 establishing quality and safety requirements for human tissues and cells.
The directive ensures that an increasing number of patients in Europe treated with human tissues and cells can trust that these substances are safe and of good quality.
That constitutes yet another step forward in fulfilling the mandate in Article 152 of the Treaty, which is to set high standards of quality and safety for substances of human origin.
The directive has to be transposed by 7 April 2006 in all Member States.
On that date, it must, therefore, be applied in all Member States, including the United Kingdom, and will also be part of the Community to be implemented by Romania under the enlargement process.
I would like to underline a key point.
Article 152, upon which the directive is based, aims to regulate public health issues.
As was made clear during the debate in Parliament leading up to the adoption of the directive, although fundamental ethical principles can be raised and endorsed, it is not possible to have binding Community regulations.
On the question of voluntary unpaid donations of tissues and cells, this was debated at length during the codecision procedure on the tissues and cells directive.
I know it was an important issue for the European Parliament and I believe that a good compromise solution was reached.
ArticleÂ 12 of the directive states that Member States shall endeavour to ensure voluntary and unpaid donations of tissues and cells.
Donors may receive compensation but this is strictly limited to making good expenses and inconveniences related to the donation.
In that case, Member States define the conditions under which compensation should be granted.
Both the Council and Parliament accepted this solution. It goes to the limit of what the Commission believes to be legally acceptable, given the provisions of ArticleÂ 152 of the Treaty.
This does not mean, however, that the directive is unclear on the conditions of exchange of tissues and cells.
On the contrary, ArticleÂ 12 conveys a very clear message as to the voluntary and unpaid character that such exchanges should have.
This, of course, refers back to values that go beyond safety issues.
Accordingly, the Commission considers that paying substantial fees to obtain human egg cells would go against the philosophy of the tissues and cells directive.
It could open the door to a trade where people in need could be drawn into acts that should instead be motivated by altruistic principles.
Both the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of the Council of Europe prohibit turning the human body and its parts into a source of financial gain.
The Commission will monitor carefully the implementation of the tissues and cells directive in the current and future Member States.
We will do so with regard to its banning provisions and also with regard to the overall spirit of the directive, such as the principle of voluntary unpaid donation, clearly expressed in ArticleÂ 12.
To ensure proper interpretation in the candidate countries, the Commission organised a peer review in Romania and Bulgaria in 2004.
This review analysed the situation in the two countries and identified future actions to be taken to ensure compliance with EU requirements in this field.
This process led to a number of recommendations.
The competent authorities of the two countries are willing to incorporate the principles of the directive into national legislation.
This will be followed up this year.
The Commission is conscious of the importance of encouraging the voluntary and unpaid donation of tissues and cells of high quality and safety.
That, in my opinion, is the best way to avoid illicit trade.
In this respect, the Commission also considers it very important to encourage Member States to incorporate the principle of voluntary and unpaid donation into their national legislation.
Tissue and cell donation programmes should be founded on that basis.
Â Â  . Mr President, authoritative media, such as the BBC and ARD, have featured stories about Romanian women receiving large sums of money for donating egg cells that are especially intended for fertility clinics in the United Kingdom.
Sums are being mentioned that are higher than half a yearâs salary for Romanian women.
If that is true, then that is in contravention of the European Directive establishing quality and safety requirements for human tissues and cells, as the Commissioner pointed out earlier.
After all, the directive provides only for the reimbursement of costs and compensation for any inconvenience, which the amounts quoted would considerably exceed.
Last Thursday, I issued a press release on this subject, and on Monday, I found an -mail in my office here from the Romanian embassy and a report from the British Government.
Romania informs, and I quote: âThe Global Art Clinic which was performing illegalâ â I repeat, illegal â âfertilisation and collection of egg cells was shut down by the Government. The situation is currently investigated by the Prosecutor's Officeâ.
The British Government reports that their organisation responsible for this, the HFEA (Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority), launched a full enquiry and was unable to prove that anything untoward is happening there.
The ban that applied during the enquiry has been lifted and the organisation has meanwhile reported an increase in the applications for egg cell imports.
Egg cell donation is not without risks, and women have to sign a declaration that they are aware of these.
Why would women donate with so many risks if they do not receive any remuneration?
When you open the Global Art Clinicâs website, you go from one surprise to the next.
It is a postal order company for babies.
You can get sperm flown in, with which an egg cell from a Romanian woman is fertilised.
You can select according to age, education, length, hair colour and such like. The embryo is then sent by courier to the future parents to be implanted.
I would like to ask the Commission the following questions.
Firstly, the reports from Romania and the United Kingdom are conflicting.
Is the Commission aware of what is happening there, on what scale, the level of remuneration involved and whether what is happening contravenes European legislation?
Secondly, according to the Global Art Clinicâs website, its largest market is the US, Israel and the United Kingdom.
Can the Commission find out whether there are also customers from other Member States or EU candidate countries and whether such practices exist in other candidate countries against payment?
Thirdly, the directive on the use of human tissues and cells must be transposed into national legislation by April 2006 at the latest.
What is the Commission doing to ensure that remunerations do not exceed the remuneration of expenses incurred and any compensation for the inconvenience?
Fourthly, could the Commission give an overview of the relevant regulations, including amounts, in the different Member States and candidate countries?
Â Â  . Mr President, we now know that the origin of our resolution was clearly unfounded, but we will use the opportunity to go back to the framework decision concerning the prevention of trafficking in human organs and tissues and combating this phenomenon.
We would like to point out that ArticleÂ 3 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain.
The removal of egg cells is not an insignificant procedure and requires major treatment that involves a great deal of pain.
Also, when a woman is forced by poverty to sell her eggs, she becomes easy prey for organised criminal networks.
Egg donation, like organ donation as a whole, needs to be tightly controlled and monitored in order to protect people in fragile situations and prevent human beings from being exploited for their eggs.
I regret that the Greek initiative framework decision concerning the prevention and control of trafficking in human organs and tissues has not yet been adopted by the Council.
This framework decision prohibits commercial transactions associated with organs and tissues of human origin and also clearly defines the offences so that trafficking in human organs can be punished.
The differences between national legislation create a favourable environment for criminal networks that exploit these differences.
We therefore ask the Commission what the existing measures are and what measures are envisaged to prevent a new form of exploitation of the female body.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, before I get to the heart of the matter, I would like to say that it is almost a miracle that all of the groups in this House have managed to produce a compromise text on this issue.
I am delighted about this on this International Womenâs Day.
So what exactly are we talking about?
Previous speakers have already mentioned that we are talking about the existence of a clinic in Bucharest, Romania, which specialises in the donation of egg cells to European Union citizens, in particular British citizens, in return for financial payment: an average of 150Â pounds sterling.
This is the crux of the problem, because, Commissioner, this evening you will hear this amount referred to as payment and as fair compensation.
This is not just a subtle difference, but in truth it is a philosophical conflict on this very sensitive issue of donation and that donation being free of charge.
This also applies to organs and to the two directives previously adopted by the Union concerning the quality and safety of blood and that of tissues and cells respectively.
So, in the case of this Romanian clinic, is there or is there not payment and therefore trade in egg cells?
The British national authority, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, following a detailed enquiry into this matter, concluded that there was no proof of payment.
We are therefore asking here today for the Commission to clarify this issue.
Does it, MrÂ Kyprianou, have new facts in its possession from Romania or other Member States of the European Union?
While I am on this subject, I think that it is important, before the entry into force of this directive concerning tissues and cells, for the Commission to present us with a report on the national legislation, on the donation of gametes and the payment systems in this area established by the Member States.
On these matters of research and ethics, the ALDE Group is very clear: it is not Europeâs job to harmonise ethics; subsidiarity must prevail and the countries that take a conservative position on this cannot prevent Europe from doing research on stem cells in order to respond to the hopes of millions of patients in genetic and cell therapy.
This is why, following our internal debate this evening, we will vote against paragraph 11.
Then, priority needs to be given to the common interests of donors and patients, in terms of access to these specific treatments, but also, of course, quality and safety at both ends of the chain.
Finally, the way to ensure safety and quality in gamete donation specifically, as in blood donation, is not only through it being free of charge but also through ensuring availability.
You just mentioned, Commissioner, the need for the Member States to include the issue of voluntary and free donation in their legislation.
This type of medical tourism would perhaps be avoided if the Member States of the European Union also agreed to deal transparently with the issue of the principle and the amount of this compensation.
I am referring, as you did, to the compromise that was reached following epic debates, which is in Article 12 of the directive: paragraph 5, a crucial point of our resolution.
Many Member States are perfectly aware of this and have already opened up the debate on this issue, like in Great Britain.
In a nutshell, Commissioner, the objective of this text is for us to fight unfailingly for solidarity and quality, and against shortages, trafficking, and all trafficking that women in particular can be victims of.
To conclude, I will refer to the first point in our resolution and the fundamental texts of the European Union.
The human body is inalienable and cannot be a source of profit.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, todayâs debate is also an acid test for the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I believe that it will become clear whether the Commission is serious about the values laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, such as human dignity, or whether it turns a blind eye to violations.
Does the Commission sit back and hide behind the Member States, or does it actually expose the contradictions?
How is it that the Commission is unable to explain to us today why, on the one hand, the British Government is maintaining that this trade did not take place, that no payments were made beyond mere compensation, and why, on the other hand, the Romanian Government has shut this clinic down?
You have not given us any explanation for this today.
Are we to understand from this that you do not take this point seriously, that you have let yourself be lulled into complacency by these soothing assurances, or are you prepared to really look into these items of evidence?
They are innumerable â derived from the Internet, from journalists, from other documentation â and make clear that payments were made.
MrÂ Kyprianou, common sense should make you ask yourself what reason there could be for these Romanian women to supply egg cells to British clinics, of all places, free of charge: something that after all entails a serious health risk to themselves.
What I should like is for the Commission to take this debate more seriously, for it not to hide behind assurances or behind the resolution.
We are familiar with the draft Directives.
As guardian of the Treaties, it is your duty to ensure that there are no ethical cluster bombs of this nature lying around in the European Union.
You have to ensure that they are shown the red card.
I do not just mean by Parliament, as we plan to do with our resolution; it is also your duty, as the European Commission, to send out a crystal-clear signal that trade of this nature is prohibited, and that the Commission will do everything â absolutely everything â to put an end to this violation of human dignity.
The Commission must also give a real demonstration that it is serious about this, that it is carrying out its own investigations and perhaps even engaging its common sense and contacting the Government of Romania: which is after all a candidate country.
It must also make clear to the European public that trafficking in human beings and trading in human body parts are prohibited in the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too naturally hope that the Commission really will take the information from Romania seriously.
Let us not be lulled into a false sense of security, because different messages come from different governments.
We have seen the many-faceted wealth of invention that exists when it comes to exploiting womenâs bodies.
Many hours ago, todayâs debate concerned the Fourth World Conference on Women.
Many Members of the European Parliament, the Commissioner responsible and the Councilâs representatives condemned the trafficking in women that was then being debated.
Now, many hours later, the debate again concerns plans further to exploit womenâs bodies through the egg cell trade.
A proposal as cynical as that concerned with buying and selling egg cells should not be possible in a civilised and humane society.
If this were to be permitted, heaven knows what would be the future of such a market for buying and selling.
What other organs would it be possible to buy and sell in a market?
Now, I am not of course talking about voluntary, unpaid donations of human cells and tissue.
That is something quite different from this buyersâ and sellersâ market.
I hope that the Commission will take this seriously and that a unified Parliament agrees with these calls upon the Commission to take all possible measures to prevent what I see as a breach of the law.
Trading egg cells for payment should not be possible.
That must be unambiguous.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, todayâs debate on the problem of trade in human egg cells would not be taking place if people had any awareness of the dignity and uniqueness of human beings, who were created by God Himself.
Financial gain is of course a further reason why egg cells are sold and embryos manipulated.
This is a violation not only of moral principles, but even of the provisions of the 1996 European Convention on Human Rights, which states that neither the human body nor any of its parts may be used as a source of profit.
Any trade in cells or human organs would turn human beings into objects, and womenâs wombs into incubators.
This is an affront to the dignity of individuals, women and mothers.
Gametes must not and cannot be compared to other tissues or blood.
Seen in purely medical terms, large doses of hormones have to be administered in order to obtain egg cells. This can result in neurohormonal dissociation, genetic disorders in the egg cell nuclei, pathological changes and complications with ovary function and structure, especially if the procedure is repeated several times.
Such complications frequently involve cancerous changes, which pose a threat not only to a womanâs health, but also to her life.
The manipulation of gametes or embryos is also unacceptable on ethical grounds. This is because of the major problem of genetic inheritance.
The natural order is violated, and consequently acts as a source of chaos, unhappiness and suffering for many people, including those in future generations who will be brought to life in test tubes.
A further motive for those directing this very modern tragedy in which human beings are turned into objects is that they wish to destroy the meaning of marriage and the family and to separate biological, genetic and legal parenthood.
Action must be taken to stop this.
Many thanks.
Â Â  Mr President, there is something highly obnoxious about any trade in human body parts or tissue.
Therefore, any trade in human egg cells that may be going on from Romania to the United Kingdom is utterly reprehensible and must be condemned.
I trust the Commission will be more forthcoming as to whether or not it believes such a trade is actually going on.
The harvesting of egg cells poses serious risks to the health of the women involved, owing to hyper-stimulation of the ovaries.
It is therefore offensive and utterly wrong that women in economic need in poor countries are being offered financial incentives to become paid donors.
I would support any moves to stamp out this disgraceful trade.
The understandable desire of childless couples to have children must not override the human dignity and health of the donors being exploited.
As the UN General Assembly said today when adopting its declaration against the cloning of human beings, measures need to be taken to prevent the exploitation of women in the application of life sciences.
This is just such a case.
Â Â  Mr President, the removal of eggs from young Romanian women aged between 18 and 30 to create human embryos is one of the most heinous examples of the modern exploitation of women.
It also represents the greatest possible perversion of the principle of free movement of goods and services in our so-called developed European countries.
The only crime of the new female slaves of biotechnology is that they were born in an economically poor European country.
Their statistics are now on the Internet and you just have to click in order to select them for their race, the colour of their eyes and their level of education.
This reminds us of other sad moments in human selection in Europe.
At the time, it took up more space and was more visible.
In Europe too, the joy of having a child can now be bought on the Internet, and cheaply, secretly permanently destroying the bodily integrity of these young women and, above all, destroying forever their deep desire to be able to give birth one day.
We should not be too quick to believe that announcing an acceptable solution will bring an end to this sad story.
A branch of science also needs these embryos and poor women are easy prey, especially in Europe and particularly when they are young.
Will we, the MEPs, still have good reasons to fight this market and above all the courage to do everything to renounce it?
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased to be here tonight in order to correct some of the misunderstandings regarding this question.
UK policy does not allow any financial inducements for egg donation.
Clinics can give donors compensation of GBPÂ 15 â about EURÂ 20 â plus expenses for donations.
Those rules apply both to donors in the United Kingdom and to donors supplying anyone in the United Kingdom.
That is the first clarification.
Second, I should like to clear up the issue raised in the original question about payments of GBPÂ 1Â 000.
There is currently a debate in the UK about the shortage of egg and sperm donations, particularly now that we are discussing a new law giving children born of such donations the right to know their parents.
We believe there will be a shortage of eggs and sperm.
So people are talking about how to correct that shortage and some people have talked about GBPÂ 1Â 000, but that has not been agreed and it is not UK policy.
There is indeed a clinic in Romania that supplies the UK market.
Concerns were raised with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in the UK, which is independent.
It investigated those concerns, went to Romania, spoke to women and looked at the issues.
It found that there were some concerns about consent forms. Those forms have now been changed.
It found no evidence of any payments that were not authorised.
However, it is continuing to scrutinise what is happening in Romania.
At one point it actually stopped the egg cells coming into the UK. It is monitoring the situation all the time.
There are some questions to be raised in this regard.
I do not think we want a market in human eggs and other human tissues.
I support the EU directive's reference to voluntary and altruistic donations.
Yet we should consider how we are going to deal with people who donate across international borders.
We have the capacity to regulate this in our EU countries.
That is not the case in other countries that do not have that regulatory capacity.
I hope that the Commissioner will work with the WHO on these issues and look at them again to ensure that we find answers to the concerns of Members.
Â Â  Mr President, each year hundreds of thousands of couples are sentenced to a childless life because the woman is unable to produce eggs.
The situation can now be rectified through egg donation.
Two main ethical questions arise.
Firstly, is it justifiable for the egg-donor woman to be subjected to the necessary medical preparation treatment, which is not entirely without risk?
Secondly, is it justifiable for the woman to have this done and be compensated for it?
A properly controlled and regulated system, under which healthy, consenting women, fully counselled and screened, donate their eggs, is both ethical and desirable.
Such a system could function with an absolute minimum of acceptable risk to all involved.
It could provide high-level medical service and much happiness for many couples, while at the same time ensuring much-needed financial assistance to young women, many of whom will use this help in order to care better for their existing families.
The principal concern is the risk of exploitation.
The surest way to make this happen is, of course, to drive the egg-donation service underground.
So let us not shy away from the realities of modern human needs.
Let us not bury the opportunities that medical advances offer to our citizens.
Let us not destroy the family dreams of thousands of loving couples and deny them the happiness of childbearing.
Let us direct our efforts towards controlling and guiding, rather than suppressing, punishing, scaring âŠ
Â Â  MrÂ President, women will undoubtedly be put under tremendous pressure to supply eggs.
A great shortage of eggs will arise.
This is something we are unable to talk clearly about.
I am rather uneasy about the fact that we talk indiscriminately in terms of eggs, semen and embryos.
I was not fully aware that embryos could be procured in the same way as semen.
That is what the British say in their answer. They mention them in the same breath.
I think the most worrying thing is that the Commission clearly believes that, through rules alone, it has solved the many problems that follow hard on the heels of human trafficking.
We need very tough controls, and we need to see those who break the rules tracked down.
I also want to raise the issue mentioned a moment ago concerning what we are to do about cross-border trafficking.
This should, of course, be controlled too.
It is, of course, not enough simply to say that it is permitted in the other country.
Trafficking in women may also be permitted in the other country, but we still want to see it banned.
I eagerly await the Commissionâs explanation of how it will ensure that this desire is complied with.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I had a great many things to say, but I shall confine myself to very few, because I do not want to go over the background, which you already know.
However, we do know that what is going on is a trade, of that there can be no doubt.
It was polite of Mrs McAvan to try and persuade us that these things are not going on but, as a doctor, I know what is going on and it needs to be banned because this is also in keeping with the views of the European Parliament.
Furthermore, I received an e-mail today from MrsÂ ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, which she sent to all Members about a resolution by the General Assembly of the United Nations â resolution 59516 â on this specific subject, but which Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ did not mention in her speech.
If this is the case, then we also need to allow the trade in other organs, for a fee, such as when obtaining kidneys.
We know the brutal haggling which goes on over kidney transplants, especially in the Far East and in the Middle East.
We know of a great many such occurrences.
However, I also wish to comment on the side effects for healthy women who use this method not for their own purposes â for the purpose of fertilisation â but in order to become donors.
The side effects, which are significant, have been reported by other Members.
Deaths have also been reported, without yet having been scientifically substantiated, but I believe that this is a serious reason for women to think twice before taking such a decision.
It is a pity today, when we are celebrating Women's Day, to be debating a subject such as the exploitation of poor women in Romania.
Â Â  Mr President, we are discussing this topic here today, partly because the European Union makes funds available for research into embryonic stem cells.
I have on a previous occasion expressed my surprise at this in this House, because this research is banned in some Member States and is incompatible with the resolution against all forms of human cloning which was adopted in the General Assembly today.
In addition, there is the commercial exploitation of women who, attracted by payment of hefty sums, donate egg cells without precise knowledge of the medical risks involved to which they are exposing themselves.
It is clear to me that the trade in egg cells and human embryos should be stopped as quickly as possible.
The Commission would, however, do well to examine whether or not it is itself partly responsible for this, because it uses European funds to promote research which is punishable in some Member States.
It appears to me that the subsidiarity principle is being ignored, because this is not a problem that cannot be resolved at Member State level.
Commissioner, can you share your view on this trade and can you confirm that research is only funded if this research is permitted in all the Unionâs Member States?
Are you prepared to adhere to the resolution adopted today in the UNâs General Assembly in which an appeal is made to take measures in order to prevent the exploitation of women?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for once again clarifying the principle that the European Union considers the trade in human cells and tissues unacceptable but supports free donations.
I should like to express my thanks for this fundamental clarification.
Having said that, I agree with those who have said that the Commission should investigate the case even more closely.
The statements by Britain and Romania contradict each other, and, when we come to the vote, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be proposing a motion further calling, in writing, for the Commission to clarify this contradiction.
In my personal opinion, the account by the British authorities â which MrsÂ McAvan read out so nicely â is just not credible.
We have all seen the note from the British Embassy, which contains precisely what she just read out.
She has every right â maybe even a duty â to defend the British Government in the run-up to an election, but credible is not a word that can be used to describe the terms in which she did so.
We have media coverage from Romania and, in the next few days, televised interviews with women who did this for money are to be broadcast on European channels.
I should like to see how you continue to defend the British Governmentâs account then.
There may be some people in the United Kingdom who consider GBPÂ 1Â 000 acceptable.
This GBPÂ 1Â 000 appears in a document of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in the UK without further comment, and against this we must be on our guard.
What we are seeing here is just the tip of the iceberg, and there is a colossal problem.
If we can make out the tip of the iceberg, we should not be continuing to obscure the issue or prevent at least those who we are able to catch being called to account.
I should now like to address MrsÂ Ries, whom I hold in high regard as a Member of this House.
We agree on many issues, but I cannot understand why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is planning to vote against paragraph 11.
Firstly, this is a joint resolution and, secondly, all it says is: . I am sure that this House is agreed on its opposition to the exploitation of women, especially on International Womenâs Day.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is very important that the European Parliament should deliver a firm rejection and condemnation of all types of dealing and trafficking in human tissue and cells, as being contrary to the basic principle of the inalienable nature of the human body, and that it should prohibit the buying and selling of human body parts.
Here, I think, it is important to stress the difference between trade and donation.
However, even in relation to donation, we need to emphasise, sincerely and frankly, the need for a high level of vigilance.
Voluntary donation often conceals the motivation to make a profit of a certain type and therefore to exploit the situation.
It is no accident that reference was made a short time ago to the shortage of eggs and sperm in countries where the anonymity of donors is no longer assured.
We can see, therefore, that donation is often not the result of altruism but is a front for certain types of profiteering.
I therefore believe we need to be extremely careful, vigilant and clear.
Finally, I would stress that when we are discussing cells, it is important that the difference between cells in general and egg cells should be understood.
Here, it is important to ensure that Member States have the freedom to legislate, since the donation of eggs is not permitted in every country and this is an issue over which the Member States have jurisdiction.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, European legislation clearly states that human tissues may not be traded, purchased or sold.
Any other position on this matter would open up the floodgates to corrupt practices.
Trade in organs and tissues goes on in various parts of the world, but its victims are inevitably the poorest of the poor, forced by poverty into selling valuable assets.
Although Europe has always opposed trade of this kind, it has always supported and continues to support voluntary and unconstrained donations, for example of blood.
It also agrees to the donation of egg cells if the donation is genuine, or in other words a voluntary, unselfish and free act.
European legislation defends the poorest of the poor, and prevents human beings being commercialised.
It works on the principle that not everything may be bought or sold, even if the seller agrees to an exchange of money.
How can it be explained that Romanian clinics offer a wide range of egg cells for free?
Are Romanian women fundamentally different to women in other countries?
Are they more inclined to make sacrifices for the benefit of anonymous recipients?
Or is it possible that the explanation is to be found in their economic situation, or in other words in the fact that they are illegally paid?
Investigations must be carried out into whether these women are given hormone treatment beforehand, and if they are aware that such treatment can have an effect on their health.
Is the initiative by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to pay women GBPÂ 1000 in compensation not an attempt to subvert the principles of European legislation?
If this is the case, does it not expose women who are already at a disadvantage as a result of difficult financial situations and poverty to even greater exploitation and humiliation?
Are they not at risk of being treated like factories full of parts that can be traded, or like bodies subject to the laws of the market that produce tissues needed by others to order and for a certain price?
The European Commission and the Commissioner should look into all these matters in order to be able to provide answers to the many questions raised.
Â Â  . I found the debate very interesting, but perhaps did not make myself clear in my opening speech, and would like to clarify my position.
I can assure you that I take this matter extremely seriously and am very concerned at the whole situation.
I do not recall saying anything that could possibly be interpreted otherwise.
The Commission is indeed worried about the situation, but one has to take into consideration the possibilities, competences and rights that it has under the Treaty.
Those of you who followed my hearing know that I am not very happy with the competences we have under the Treaty in relation to health.
However, that is the law and the reality and we must comply with it.
Under the Treaty we can deal only with the issues of safety and quality.
That is why the directive stops short of dealing with the issue of payment, and simply expresses the spirit and philosophy of non-payment that should be implemented and followed by the Member States.
However, it is not a binding rule.
The Commission has limits on how much it can do in this respect.
For example, it cannot initiate infringement proceedings against a Member State, because the principle of subsidiarity applies and this is a matter for the Member States.
I repeat that this does not mean that because we do not have legal competence we cannot adopt political positions or take political initiatives.
We intend to do this primarily through the report we will produce on the implementation of this directive, which will cover the measures taken by Member States to promote unpaid and voluntary donations.
In this respect we will do whatever we can to promote this aspect of the philosophy of the directive, relating to unpaid and voluntary donations, and at the same time report and point out where it is not being followed and payments are taking place.
While I understand the points of view expressed by some Members, I must make it clear that we have to comply with the directive and its philosophy of unpaid and voluntary donations, which is what guides the law that the Commission has to follow.
As far as the specific case is concerned, I once again remind you that we do not have legal competence and that it is not a question of direct investigation by the Commission.
We received a report from the UK authority and its independent agency and have no reason to doubt the results of that investigation.
In fact the trade was stopped some time ago and there was no proof of payments having taken place.
We will nevertheless follow up on this matter and pursue it with the Romanian authorities to see what evidence they may have, although the UK investigation took place in Romania as well and, here too, no proof was found as to payments.
Even though the directive states that âMember States shall endeavour to ensure voluntary and unpaid donationsâ, that does not mean that Member States cannot go beyond that and legislate, as I suggested in my speech, on such unpaid voluntary donations in a national context and even ban payments, provided that this can be justified on ethical, public morality grounds.
Given the realities of the Treaty, greater responsibility lies with the Member States than the European Community in this respect.
I do not feel that the problem has been solved, because it is true that since there is demand, there will always be a potential for trade and payments.
Perhaps this case did involve payments, although nothing has been proved, and there will always be a potential for this.
That is why we must find ways to promote voluntary, unpaid donations so that demand is covered and there is no room for illicit trade or payments, with all the risks that this entails.
I can assure you that, within the scope of our competences, we will follow this matter very closely.
If we find there has been any violation of either the letter or the spirit of the directive we will report it and make it public.
Â Â  As I wind up the debate, I should like to state that I have received seven motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure (1).
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Commissioner has not answered all the questions put to him.
Commissioner, you have made many references to the Directive on tissues and cells, but the question has also been put as to whether this violates the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I do not believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights can be described as a matter of subsidiarity.
Nor do I want this eveningâs debate to give that kind of message to the European public: that we are, so to speak, describing violations of human dignity as a matter of subsidiarity.
I would ask you to answer this question again.
I should also have been interested to hear your answer to MrÂ Bloklandâs question: this is another ethical question that should not go unanswered, as it is one that preoccupies both the public and Parliament.
Â Â  . In order to answer every single question on related and unrelated issues I would need about 45 minutes, which is not possible.
However, we will answer in writing the question on the legal implications of the violation of fundamental rights and the position we can take on that.
I am not from the Legal Service and so cannot give a legal opinion here.
Therefore we will respond in writing, at a later stage.
Otherwise, I believe that the main points raised have been answered.
Â Â  As I wind up the debate, I should like to state that I have received seven motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure(2).
The debate is closed.
Voting will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements regarding the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy.
We have with us MrÂ Schmit representing the Council on this item and MrÂ Verheugen representing the Commission.
A number of MEPs will be speaking on behalf of Parliament: they are just taking their seats.
Mr Schmit, on behalf of the Council, you have the floor.
Â Â  Mr President, five years after its adoption, the European Council is to be asked to debate once again the relaunching of the Lisbon strategy, on the occasion of the mid-term review thereof.
As the Commission has proposed, we must give this strategy a new start, by concentrating our action on achieving stronger and more sustainable growth and on creating more better-quality jobs.
The European Council will therefore be able to confirm the relevance of the strategy by clarifying its purpose as well as what is at stake.
The objectives of growth and employment must be pursued via a process of synergy which must be developed between the three dimensions of the strategy, namely the economic, social and environmental dimensions.
In this context the European Council will also set the priorities which should guide the Unionâs action in the social sphere.
A re-examination of the social agenda must, in fact, supplement and support the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy, particularly as regards the promotion of the social dimension of economic growth.
As far as the environment is concerned, the European Council should emphasise the contribution to growth and employment made by environmental policy, and should confirm the need to integrate environmental considerations into the Lisbon process.
Moreover, the European Council will also be examining the Commissionâs communication on the sustainable development strategy, but I shall come back to that later because this is an issue which forms an entirely separate item on the Councilâs agenda.
The European Council will also be examining the question of how to improve the governance of the strategy, both Union-wide and at the level of the Member States.
The question of governance really lies at the heart of the mid-term review.
It will be a crucial factor in the success of the strategy.
As far as the Presidency is concerned, this complex issue can be boiled down to a few essential points.
Firstly, there is the adoption of a set of integrated guidelines making it possible to synchronise and rationalise the various processes which exist at present.
The fact that there are so many processes and reports is actually responsible, to a large extent, for the lack of transparency of the strategy as perceived by the public, and prevents it from being effectively implemented.
In the light of the broad guidelines provided by the European Council, the Commission should now submit proposals for guidelines comprising the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines, and should combine them in a single coherent text.
Those integrated guidelines would then be endorsed by the European Council and, where required by the Treaty, would be formally adopted by the Council.
It goes without saying that, within this process, the views of Parliament will be fully taken into consideration.
Secondly, there is the introduction of the three-year national action programmes.
This gives Member States greater flexibility in choosing the priorities and methods of action which they use in order to implement the strategy, within the framework laid down by the integrated guidelines to which I have just referred.
It is proposed that, on the basis of these integrated guidelines, Member States should work out in detail their national action programmes, following the broadest possible consultation between all those involved.
In order to facilitate consultation and coordination, and the implementation of what is decided upon, each Member State would be able to appoint one public figure who would be responsible for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
Thirdly, there is a monitoring procedure based on a regular assessment of implementation at intermediate meetings.
The idea is that, each autumn with effect from 2006, Member States should submit a single report on the implementation of their national action programme.
On that basis the Commission will submit, in January of each year, an assessment report, where necessary accompanied by certain proposals for adjustments, but without that being able to lead to the total reshaping of the integrated guidelines, which will be valid for a period of three years.
The European Council will then give its opinion on those adjustments.
The Council, in its various formations, is continuing its work on all the issues linked to the review of the Lisbon strategy, and the General Affairs Council will return to this matter on 16 March, just before the European Council meeting.
These, then, are the major proposals which are currently being discussed and prepared with a view to the European Council meeting on 22 March.
Â Â  MrÂ President, honourable Members, a month ago, at the Conference of Presidents, I put forward our ideas for a partnership for sustainable growth and employment, thus giving new impetus to the Lisbon Strategy.
Our objective for this partnership is simple: we have to modernise and invigorate our economy and our social model, and we must improve our quality of life through truly ambitious reforms.
We have to realise that appropriate environmental policies can result in twin benefits, in terms of employment and ensuring lasting growth; and, in the context of economic stability, we have to improve the ability of our businesses â from the very largest to our small and medium-sized enterprises â to create more and better jobs.
We also have to enhance productivity through greater investment in knowledge, innovation and people.
Today is the first opportunity for one of the partners with whom we want to work â one of the most important partners, the European Parliament â to express its views and establish its priorities.
Both I and the other members of the Commission welcome this debate.
We want to thank you for the political investment that you have made in order to table a global motion for a resolution that reflects the vast spectrum of opinions within this House.
We share many of your priorities, and we are sensitive to your concerns.
Later today we will debate the forthcoming European Council.
That summit will be the start, and not the end, of the journey as far as the renewed Lisbon Strategy is concerned.
I fully support the remarks made by the distinguished representative of the Luxembourg presidency.
We will only succeed if everyone feels that they have a stake in Europeâs success.
That success depends on presenting a vision that mobilises popular support, gives a real sense of ownership and, above all, leads to real action at a national, regional and local level.
However, to mobilise support it must be clear why these reforms matter and that they are part of our wider vision.
They are about people and the issues that matter most to them: the chance to work, a decent start for their children, security in retirement or ill-health, and quality public services.
They are about a better quality of life and a better standard of living in every part of an enlarged Union, from our city centres to the heart of our rural and coastal communities.
They are about binding the Union together through 21st-century infrastructure and regional investment.
They are about making the most of European excellence in our business community â addressing, in particular, the concerns of small- and medium-sized enterprises â and in all areas of creativity, but also in science and technology and in our unique model for society.
They are also about achieving all this in a way that guarantees future generations the same or better possibilities than we ourselves enjoy.
This goal of sustainable development underpins the Lisbon Strategy as it does the action of the Union in every area.
These are broad economic, social and environmental objectives.
They were at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy when it was launched and remain at its heart today.
I can promise you that this Commission will fight to ensure that they do so tomorrow, not least as we discuss the future financial perspectives over the months ahead.
Then and there we will test the real commitment to cohesion and solidarity of those who are today â at least in their political discourse â on the frontline of defence of the European social model.
Nevertheless, we need to face facts.
The first five years of the Lisbon Strategy have not delivered the desired results.
There has been insufficient delivery, little ownership at national level and even less among society at large.
In key areas, from productivity to research and education spending, early school-leavers or poverty, we have barely made an impression on closing the gaps that existed five years ago.
We can add to this the challenge of intense global competition and an ageing population.
These are no longer challenges for the future, but the day-to-day reality for our businesses and workers.
This is why Lisbon needs a new start, with fresh ambition.
This is why we propose a new focus on growth and jobs in order to meet those challenges.
A dynamic and innovative Europe offers us the best chance to do this.
Vice-President Verheugen will set out in more detail how this new focus translates into concrete action and results.
This does not mean downgrading action in other areas.
Our new social agenda, our review of sustainable development and our action on climate change show the Commissionâs commitment to moving ahead across a wide range of areas.
Let me turn to two specific concerns that your resolution addresses.
The first is the balance within the Lisbon Strategy.
I know a variety of concerns have been raised about the new focus on actions to promote growth and jobs.
This is not at all in contradiction with our social and environmental policy.
Growth is a necessary precondition for an effective and more ambitious programme in terms of solidarity, just as fighting unemployment is the best protection against exclusion and poverty.
Without growth, without a dynamic economy, there will be no sustainable development; we will not foster convergence between regions and our social and environmental goals will slip out of reach.
However, I fully accept that lasting growth relies, in turn, on parallel progress on cohesion, our social agenda and addressing unsustainable and damaging environmental trends.
With regard to the services directive, we need an open and thriving internal market for services in the Union, as well as high-quality, accessible public services.
They are key factors for a successful society.
Yet we have identified a number of areas where changes will be required for the broad consensus that we would like to see to emerge.
We have said that we are ready to work pragmatically with you, the Parliament, and with the presidency, in preparation for your first reading.
In particular we need to ensure a framework that removes the risk of social dumping, has a broad coverage â but does not necessarily cover healthcare or services of general interest â and addresses genuine concerns about the operation of the country of origin principle.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me end by saying a few words about the governance of the Lisbon strategy.
I do not think that it is necessary for us to rewrite the Lisbon strategy completely in the course of the next few weeks.
Having said that, however, a certain number of innovations have been suggested by the Commission and â let us not forget â by Parliament too.
We proposed that a European Institute of Technology should be created, that greater priority should be given to improving the regulations, particularly in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises, that there should be a greater emphasis on re-examining existing proposals, that the rules on State aid and taxation should be used in a way that would encourage the spirit of enterprise, innovation and research, that employment market reforms should concentrate on measures to help women, young people and older workers to find and keep jobs, and that a European Pact for Youth should be concluded.
In reality, I think we can say that people have a pretty clear idea of what needs to be done.
The political challenge this time around lies in finding out how, at Community level, we can help them to do it in reality.
It is all a matter of ownership.
It is primarily because Member States â and society in general â have not made the structural reforms their own that a number of those reforms have produced disappointing results over the past five years.
In response to this situation, we have made the following proposals, which you seem to approve of, if your motions for resolutions are to be believed.
First of all, we are proposing the formulation of integrated guidelines at European Union level, combining the current Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines, so as to give Member States a clearer idea of what action they are committing themselves to.
For the first time, micro-economic reforms will be dealt with in detail.
This will therefore be an integrated vision encompassing macro-economic policies, micro-economic reforms and employment policy, so that Lisbon will not have a purely decorative role, but will really lie at the heart of our economic policy.
Secondly, we are proposing the development of national Lisbon programmes adapted to fit national situations.
Of course, the initiative will lie with Member States, but we have already prepared, at the same time, a European Union programme on the Lisbon strategy, which offers initiatives at Community level and thus explains in detail what needs to be done at Community level and what needs to be done at national level.
Thirdly, we are proposing the simplification of the compulsory provision of information, at both Community and national level, so that Member States can devote more time to implementing the reforms and less time to writing reports about them which most people will ignore.
Therefore less importance should be attached to reports than to an integrated vision of the reforms currently taking place.
It is our ambition to develop active participation in these reforms, and to put them at the heart of national political debates.
The European Council taking place this spring will not be the end of the road: on the contrary, it will give political impetus to the new approach.
However, in order to be entirely consistent, the broad policy guidelines defined in March will have to guide the financial decisions to be taken in June.
The Union must not be content with being ambitious.
If it wants to succeed, it will also have to mobilise resources to match its ambitions.
In this respect, a proactive agreement on the financial perspective, placing the proper emphasis on cohesion, would be a crucial factor in strengthening and developing our social model over the next few years.
At the same time, the European Council will also be opening the way for debates at national and regional level on the action programmes which Member States have been asked to submit this autumn.
I personally expect a great deal from these debates.
The Lisbon strategy must take its inspiration from the partnerships and dialogues which the cohesion policy has put in place in recent years between the various people involved at national, local and social level.
Unless this happens, it will not be possible to mobilise those partners who are affected by its implementation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me just say that, following my meetings with the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, I find it very encouraging that those institutions have, generally speaking, warmly welcomed our review of the Lisbon strategy.
I am also particularly pleased to see the joint declaration issued recently by the two major European trade-union and employersâ organisations.
It is, therefore, possible to reach a balanced consensus on ambitious reforms.
It goes without saying that within this partnership the Members of the European Parliament will play a major role if we really want to implement these reforms.
This is why I am asking you to make your contribution each year to the work of the spring European Council which, in accordance with the Treaty, lays down the guidelines which will direct the process, and also, of course, to take the lead in the political discussions which will mobilise support at national, regional and local level.
This is our conception of the partnership which this Commission wishes to establish with you.
We believe that, on that basis, and with that commitment, it will be possible to do much more for our Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, the great growth and employment initiative that we are discussing in this House today is the Commissionâs most important project for the coming five years, by the success of which we â and not we alone â will, we know, be judged.
All European institutions will be judged by whether or not this growth and employment initiative is a success, for the people of Europe expect us to really reverse a trend and keep Europe up to the mark in global, and ever more acute, competition at a high level â and I emphasise âat a high levelâ.
The prescriptions that we sometimes hear for how to deal with the perils of an ageing society, with the dangers of increasing globalisation, with the ever-more complicated ways in which work is shared out around the world, the prescriptions that we sometimes hear to the effect that competitiveness must be achieved by cutting wages and downgrading social and environmental standards â such prescriptions are wrong.
Instead of being able to indulge in downward competition, we will have to hold fast to the fact that Europeâs ability to compete is dependent on the quality of its goods and services and on the leading position that they occupy, and we should not be too abashed to say loud and clear that something made and sold in Europe can not only claim to be ânumber oneâ in terms of technology and quality, but also that it embodies certain European values, such as the idea that our products and services cannot come into being by dint of the ruthless exploitation of the environment or ruthless trampling on peopleâs rights.
I am firmly convinced that, in the long term, such a European philosophy of economic policy gains us a competitive advantage, for the other dynamic regions of the world cannot get away from the fact that people want higher environmental and social standards.
I want to explicitly stress that the growth and employment initiative, the new Lisbon agenda, is a project that can work only if it is understood as being founded on partnership.
People may well think, âright, let that lot in Strasbourg and Brussels get on with it, and weâll watch them fail yet againâ, but it can only work if the European institutions and the Member States regard this project as a shared responsibility.
The President has just had something to say about the doubts expressed by some Member States about the way we intend to implement this strategy, and it is they whom I am addressing when I say that we have no intention of building up a ponderous mechanism of reporting, recommendations and sanctions; what we want is a model in which we, together, set out and analyse the policyâs outcomes.
We do, however, need to have these summarised in a progress report, and that has to be based on progress reports from the Member States.
These are nothing for anyone to be afraid of, for, even now, the Member States have to submit detailed reports; indeed, what we are now proposing reduces the burden on them.
Nobody need have any fear that the Commission plans to draw up rankings, or, as one says, to âname and shameâ anyone, but we must be able to see clearly what we have achieved in a year and what we have yet to achieve.
Secondly, the Commission is pressing hard for the governments of the Member States to appoint members â ministers â who will have responsibility for coordinating the Lisbon strategy in their countries.
This strategy must have faces associated with it.
The most natural solution would be for this function to be taken on by the ministers who sit on the Competitiveness Council, whose remit includes the Lisbon Strategy in any case.
That would also enable this Council, which is currently looking for a new role, to find one and be much more effective in playing it.
The Commission is very, very emphatic in recommending this option.
The last point I want to make is that I will, in the course of this year, be producing a series of important initiatives to flesh out the projectâs European dimension.
Everything that the Commission presents will be subject to prior approval, judged in terms of what contribution a particular project or initiative makes to growth and employment in Europe.
That is the question that must be answered in all cases, and answer it we will.
We will very soon be presenting to you major policy initiatives in my own area of responsibility, and the order in which I shall now list them is a matter of deliberate choice.
First of all comes better lawmaking.
The âBetter Lawmakingâ project has, to put it tactfully, been trundling along for some considerable time.
It needs a clear political direction.
It has to be clear that improved lawmaking is something that has an immediate and direct effect on the productivity and quality of the European economy.
It is another thing that we cannot work for unless we do it together.
Parliament has a great part to play in this, as does the Council, as do the Member States and the Commission.
It is not just about future lawmaking and how we ensure that it improves competitiveness; it is also about the as it stands at present and examining it to see whether we really do still need all the things we have enacted over the past decades or whether a considerable degree of simplification is possible in this area.
Secondly, Europe possesses vast and virtually unused potential in terms of economic performance; it is there, before our very eyes, we often talk about it, and yet little is done about it.
I am talking about the 25 million small and medium-sized businesses in Europe, which provide two-thirds of our total workforce.
Let us not be content with telling those 25 million that they are the backbone of the European economy, and then do nothing beyond that.
Instead, we need a policy that makes use of the sectorâs enormous potential in terms of innovation, investment capacity, and creativity, and turns it into jobs.
I will shortly be putting before you proposals for the comprehensive modernisation and upgrading â I stress âupgradingâ â of Europeâs policy on small and medium-sized enterprises.
Thirdly, there is industrial policy; the word itself calls forth fear in some Member States.
We need a modern definition of industrial policy for the twenty-first century.
It can no longer be what it was in the past, with protective fences being put up around certain industries; here, too, the only thing to do is to maintain competitiveness and enhance it, but we need to be aware that Europe needs a strong and long-term industrial base, and so it will be necessary to consider European industry sector by sector and to discuss with all the stakeholders â companies, trade unions, legislatures and governments â which framework conditions are the best for the sector under consideration, enabling it to make the maximum use of its potential for growth.
The last topic I want to mention is that of innovation.
Here, too, the Commission will be coming up with new and far-reaching proposals.
Innovation is the link in the chain between research, development and production, and it is where Europe is not strong enough.
We need to improve our capacity for turning what comes out of research into innovation, and to do so everywhere.
The Americans, among others, are much better at it.
The present Commission is firmly convinced that Europe is strong enough to face up to the challenges of global competition.
In almost every sector of the economy, there is at least one European company or country that leads the world.
To put it another way, we can do it.
We can learn from one another.
We can support each other making use of the potential that exists in our societies, but we will need to give the European institutions the capacities to implement a policy along these lines, and so, before I conclude my speech, I cannot do other than observe that growth and employment policy is a powerful instrument for achieving these long-term policy goals of ours, but the figures in the next Financial Perspective must reflect it.
I think the only thing I can say on this is that it would do serious damage to the success of our growth and employment policy if the uncertainty about the next Financial Perspective were to persist for some time.
As a matter of urgency, I appeal to the Member States to take to heart the fact that great projects need time for preparation.
Time is not on our side.
It is also an issue of Europeâs credibility in the eyes of the public; we must be prepared to demonstrate that what we say will be backed up by what we do.
It is also a fact that action costs money â there is nothing I can do about that.
Without a Budget that produces the goods, without a clear Financial Perspective, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve what we aim to do.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start this very, very, important debate with very warm thanks to both the rapporteurs, MrÂ Lehne and Mr DÃ©sir, for the work they have done.
While extending thanks to the chairman of the steering committee, Mr Daul, and our groupâs coordinator, MrsÂ Thyssen, whose work has been outstanding, I also would like to thank those, not all of whom I can name, have played their part in enabling us â it is to be hoped â to get a broad majority in a good cause when we vote at midday.
The Commission â whose President and Vice-President we welcome here today â has set the right priorities for its five-year term of office: growth and employment.
Our group is very definitely behind them in this, and we are also glad to see the Commission represented here not only by such important members, but also in such numbers.
What is at stake is the European Unionâs ability to compete.
Let us just look at a few figures and compare ourselves with our main competitors, our partners and friends in the United States.
If we take the standard in the fifteen-Member State EU as 100, the enlargement to 25 Member States reduced our productivity per worker to 93, while work productivity in the USA stands at 121.
That shows the competitive advantage that the United States of America enjoy.
In itself, the fact that our people are living longer is very much cause for rejoicing, but it is one of the great challenges we face, in that the question arises of how we make use of older peopleâs experience.
In the Europe of 25, the employment rate stands at 40%, while it is 59.9% in the United States.
Ought we not to be giving thought to how to enhance older peopleâs potential and experience, and improve their work opportunities?
If we turn to research and development, we see that the European Unionâs 25 Member States spend 1.9% of GNP on it, as against the USAâs 2.8%.
It is clear from that what a massive effort we have to make.
Our group very much welcomes the substance of two amendments that speak of the need for us to strengthen the spirit of entrepreneurship.
Vice-President Verheugen was right to stress the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, the need for us to create a culture of risk-taking, the need for us to encourage personal initiative and personal responsibility, and, above all, for economic legislation that is unbureaucratic and that businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones, can comprehend, with a simple and fair tax system and the predictability that we need in economic policy.
What that means is that we have to make it possible for those who work in business to have confidence in those who hold political office.
It is crucial that we should develop a growth-oriented macro-economic environment, that we should have a stable currency and dynamic development in our economy and labour market, and that we should reduce state debt.
I cannot therefore do other than encourage all the actors to reform the Stability Pact in such a way that â assuming they succeed in this â the Pact ends up being at the heart of our shared efforts.
What we need is reform, flexibility, the acceptance of responsibility, less red tape, and if we succeed in all these things, that will also facilitate solidarity â in the shape of a very rational and far-sighted social policy â with those people in our community, in our Member States, who are in need of it.
What we demand of the Member States is that they should make their contribution to a Europe that is capable of development and that fosters growth, a Europe with a growing economy.
That is not, however, an end in itself; rather, the object is the creation of jobs, enabling people to get involved and make use of their options in Europe.
Such is now our common task.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Verheugen that the realisation of the Lisbon strategy will, over the coming five years, be the most important of the Commissionâs projects.
I also share the view â taken not only by the Commission, but also by all the European institutions and all the Member States of the European Union â that the project is complete in itself, and that, in order for it to succeed, all alike must play their parts in it.
I want to join in thanking the members of the ad hoc committee â my colleagues Mr DÃ©sir and Mr Goebbels, as well as Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne â and of my own group, for all of them did very intensive work and made a very constructive contribution to the broad and consensual text that we have before us today.
We spent a long time discussing what we should emphasise when talking about the achievement of the Lisbon goals.
What I hear said today echoes in a positive way the messages we sent out from our debate.
I agree that Lisbon will fail if people come to feel that it aims to recast the European social model, and if possible to downgrade it, but if, as a project, it enhances Europeâs prosperity by making it a more competitive continent, while at the same time maintaining the social framework conditions that can make it possible for every person in this Union to live decently, by creating jobs and social security for young and old: if that is what Lisbon leads them to feel, then it is a project that the people will accept.
It is on that that its success depends â on whether a project gains popular acceptance or not.
For forty or fifty years, the whole point of the European Union was that it kept the peace in Europe, achieving a balance between the poor and the rich, bringing a divided continent together and overcoming division.
All these things we have achieved.
For as long as it was a success, the people regarded Europe as their project, but that period of history is coming to its end and people are asking more and more what the point of Europe is.
For more and more of them, this is a very personal question.
People want to know, not only about Europeâs values, but also about the European Unionâs economic benefits, and the European Union is of economic benefit in that, being an integrated Europe and an internal market with the capacity to unleash its own economic and social power, it is this continentâs organised answer to the challenge of globalisation; making social and economic sense of it is precisely what the Lisbon strategy is about, and that is what made it a good start and a good decision.
The fact that we have been engaged in this process for a number of years now, and are not satisfied, must not prompt us to give up; instead we must muster our courage and press on.
I think the text we will be adopting today shows that a broad majority in this House will join the other institutions â the Commission and, I hope, the Council, as well as the individual Member States â in their efforts, for what both Commissioner Verheugen and the President of the Commission have said today is crucial: it is not we alone, nor the institutions of the EU alone, but, above all, the Member States must pull their weight.
I am very much in agreement with Commissioner Verheugenâs view, and would like to make that clear on behalf of my group.
I was also delighted to see the President of the Commission smile with pleasure when Commissioner Verheugen pointed out the connection between the Financial Perspective and the Lisbon process.
If this project is going to succeed, it will not do so on the basis of ever more tasks with ever fewer financial resources; that will not work.
Those who want this project to succeed while leaving the resources unchanged must not be left without an answer when they want to reallocate them for the benefit of the Lisbon goals.
People may say that we are capping; fair enough, but if an upper limit is imposed when no more money is available, a qualitative decision will have to be taken as to which investments under the Lisbon strategy will have to be stopped, and to the detriment of which other tasks.
So far, the Council and the Member States have maintained a dignified silence as to what these might be, but, at some point, they will have to be put to the test.
I expect from the Commission the sort of commitment we have heard today from Commissioner Verheugen and from the President of the Commission.
Let the Heads of State or Government be told that the point of the Financial Perspective must be none other than to help achieve the Lisbon objectives, where these are taken seriously.
This connection is, in our view, important, as are their three points: better regulation, the strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises and a pro-active industrial policy to secure both industrial jobs and the environmental standards and quality of our products, thereby making us better able to compete in export markets.
Yes, we, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, are all in favour of that, for all these things, above all else, create one thing, and that is work, which, in its turn, creates social security.
That, for us, is the starting point.
I am grateful to all those on the ad hoc committee who helped to bring about a broad majority in this House on this crucial issue.
As we see it, one thing is clear: if this House adopts resolutions that bear the stamp of the Right, the Left will have no part in them.
If this House adopts resolutions reflecting what we Social Democrats think, then they will enjoy our support.
Â Â  . Mr President, for the President of the Commission to succeed in his Lisbon Agenda he needs the Member States to take it seriously.
The Council presidencyâs plea this morning for somebody in each Member State to take responsibility is well judged.
Moreover, President Barroso, you will need political will in the Council and support in this House for your reforms, neither of which is yet fully evident.
Europeâs right-wing parties have still not yet embraced the central fact of globalisation that the nation-state and the free market are no longer compatible.
Free movement of goods and capital without similarly free movement of services and labour is economic nonsense.
And the left is still riven by dissent over the role of the state in managing the economy.
President Barroso, Europeâs Liberals and Democrats will remain steadfast and united in support of your agenda, provided you recognise that the forces which spur growth and create new jobs lie in entrepreneurship and in the determination to make a great product or provide a great new service.
The real competition in the global economy is to attract investment capital to back new ideas and create new jobs.
Unless the single market can be made to work properly, we will lose that battle.
Liberals and Democrats do not deny that government has a role in economic management.
When a better educated, wealthier, more assertive public has developed ethical concerns and a higher sensitivity to risk, and when companies value intangible assets like corporate reputation, there is a demand for active and responsible government.
For that reason we welcome your REACH proposals, for example, or a commitment to bringing aircraft emissions into the emissions trading system.
Government too has a role in protecting citizens from fraud or market failure and levelling the playing field not only between businesses, but also between business and the citizen.
That is why my Group supported the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive in the last mandate and will support proposals for greater legal certainty in cross-border transactions in this Parliament.
To us, getting the balance of economic policy right seems fundamental.
We therefore have serious reservations about, for example, a poorly prepared software patents directive, which seems of more benefit to multinationals than to smaller inventors.
Greater intellectual rigour needs to be applied if Mr McCreevyâs proposal is to secure a majority at second reading.
Patents should protect innovation, rather than stifle competition.
Without a coherent intellectual property regime across the European Union, we will create few new European companies.
Finally, a single market in services must be the centrepiece of the Lisbon Agenda, to provide growth and jobs.
But Liberals and Democrats recognise a big difference between the functioning of a market and the discharge of a public service, and the Services Directive will need some changes to reflect that.
President Barroso, you recognise that if Europeâs growth rates continue to lag, we will not provide the same degree of security, prosperity and opportunity for our citizens as others enjoy.
We will support your efforts to kick-start Europeâs economy but we are not blind to the weakness of measuring economic progress only in quantitative terms.
For example, cars that are safer, more fuel efficient and easier to dismantle after use reduce economic growth in classical terms but create another type of good.
We will expect your Commission to be open to such ideas.
To improve the economic vitality and the social and environmental health of our continent simultaneously, the Lisbon Agenda must combine flexibility, fairness and farsightedness.
If it does, the Burghers of Lisbon will be proud to have lent their name to Europeâs success.
Just as Henry the Navigator guided Europeâs pioneers in the discovery of new lands and great wealth, so you can guide us in the discovery of similar economic success.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, if we compare this morningâs speeches and the resolution on the review of the Lisbon Strategy, which we are about to put to the vote, with MrÂ Barrosoâs speech of a few weeks ago, we cannot help feeling pleased that there is now broad agreement, at least in principle, on the fact that relaunching the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategy depends on finding an essential new balance among the three dimensions of the strategy, that is to say its environmental, economic and social dimensions.
Nonetheless, we do not feel that that is enough, at least in its current form, for us to take part in the political compromise that is taking shape.
We are obviously pleased that some of our proposals have been included in the joint resolution, but we believe there are still gaps in the text.
It lacks a clear choice as to the instruments that we should have at our disposal to achieve our goals, and it lacks guarantees that the Commission â and Parliament as well â will be willing and able to stand up to those who do not believe in the need for European control of the economy and are pressing for renationalisation of the cohesion policies, a backward reform of the labour market and a further cut in the Unionâs budget.
Because of the concern to reach a compromise, contradictory elements have been included in the resolution, leaving the message confused instead of more convincing.
We have picked out a number of incongruities in the text.
It is a fact that nobody likes paying taxes, but we do not share the aim of indiscriminately cutting taxes to a minimum, because that would only lead to greater social inequalities.
Europe needs a tax reform that reduces labour costs and taxes other sectors.
Jacques Delors said as much very many years ago, but nothing has been done since then and instead the subject has dropped out of the European debate.
Secondly, the resolution retains a remarkably moderate and even ambiguous stance on three extremely important topics, which are going to be the subject of some hard legislative wrangling over the coming months; they are the services directive, the REACH regulation and the software patents directive.
The outcome of the wrangling will show whether the Lisbon Strategy is just a return to old Thatcherite formulas or the beginning of a genuine New Deal for Europe.
MrÂ President, MrÂ McCreevy, we think that the Bolkestein directive should be withdrawn so that we can start off again on the right foot, in other words with a directive on services of public interest.
MrÂ Verheugen, we believe that the REACH regulation in its current form is already just enough of a compromise between the undoubtedly important arguments of industry and the priorities of health and the environment.
It is a compromise that the Commission and Parliament too should defend tooth and nail against the aggressive lobbying of the chemical industry, which does not understand that organising an efficient and credible control system is the best way to ensure its competitiveness.
Lastly, I think that coming out explicitly against the patentability of software means affirming that innovation âmade in Europeâ is fostered through the freedom and dissemination of knowledge and not by protecting the large multinationals and their monopolies.
MrÂ President, a basic ambiguity hangs over this text in relation to the true added value of the Union compared with action taken by national governments.
In our view, such added value derives from the ability to invest in instruments for growth, which cannot be reduced just to GDP percentages, and in sectors that are not strictly tangible, such as education and culture.
That is done by making use of renewable resources and sustainable solutions and gradually abandoning sectors that use up and waste resources, such as major infrastructure works and intensive agriculture, and those that create major health and environmental risks, such as nuclear energy, GM organisms and harmful chemical products.
MrÂ President, we shall be on your side in making these choices when that is possible, but we shall be against you and on the side of the people of Europe when it is not.
Â Â  Mr President, in March 2000 the Heads of State or Government of the Union, as well as the Commission, wanted to prove that social action was possible via liberal means.
Their decisive objective of moving towards full employment by 2010 gave rise, here and there, to real hopes.
Five years later, the situation is a cruel disappointment.
Unemployment remains, on average, about 9% in Europe, where lack of job security is increasing rapidly.
In the Unionâs premier economy, that of Germany, which holds the absolute record for exports, unemployment has nevertheless exceeded the five-million mark.
In order to achieve the Lisbon objective, that is to say a 70% employment rate by 2010, it would be necessary to create 22 million more jobs than the present rate over the next five years.
This is hard to imagine at a time when the European Central Bank has just revised its growth forecast for the euro zone, reducing it to 1.6% for this year, and when countries such as Italy and the Netherlands are on the verge of recession.
However, things are not going badly for everybody. observes that there has been an explosion in the profits of the big companies.
Their share in the GDP of Europe and of Asia, as the British journal points out, has achieved a level which is without precedent in the last 25 years.
The workers, it explains, are the major losers.
Yet who is talking about the workers here?
For its part, the organisation ATD Fourth World regrets the fact that nowhere in its communication of 2 February does the Commission mention the objective of eliminating poverty, which currently affects 68 million people in the Union.
Do you not think that such a radical separation between the objectives announced yesterday and the results obtained today justifies our asking some serious questions about the relevance of the liberal dogmas which have served, from the start, as the basis for the Lisbon process? .
Yet what are the messages from Brussels which our fellow citizens are hearing day after day?
MrsÂ Danuta HÃŒbner, Commissioner for Regional Policy, wants to facilitate delocalisations in Europe.
For Mr Å pidla, Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs, our objective is, above all, flexibility.
The Vice-President responsible for industry, Mr Verheugen, hits the nail on the head in the French press, when he says that, with the Lisbon strategy, there were so many priorities that there were none, and that this time we want an action plan which is specific and which concentrates on competitiveness.
For her part, Mrs Nellie Kroes, Commissioner for Competition, has declared that she wants to do away with State aids of a regional nature in the 15 older Member States of the Union.
As for Mr Mandelson, Commissioner for Trade, he has reminded Member States of their duty to continue to reform their labour markets and their welfare systems.
Finally, MrÂ McCreevy, the Commissioner responsible for the internal market, deserves special mention.
He brought to an end the long-running saga on the withdrawal, revision or retention of the Bolkestein Directive, explaining that there is no question of withdrawing this text, despite the fact that it had been rejected on all sides.
He immediately followed that by refusing, in collaboration with the Council, to re-examine the directive on software patenting, despite the fact that this had been unanimously demanded by the parliamentary groups.
Finally, at the European Policy Forum in London, he revealed his true opinion, with Anglo-Saxon bluntness, by saying, and I quote MrÂ McCreevy,
âWe should remember that the internal market programme is by far the greatest deregulatory exercise in recent history.â
This is what Mr Barroso calls âa new focus on growth and jobsâ.
Do you not sense, therefore, that people feel that they are moving irresistibly closer to the liberalism-overdose threshold, and that the rejection of this model will, sooner or later, return like a boomerang to rebound on the Unionâs governing bodies in one form or another?
My group is campaigning precisely in order to help this opinion to be expressed, not against Europe â and there is a danger of that happening â but in favour of its profound transformation.
That is why we obviously cannot give our backing to the compromise resolution which has been tabled today, and that is why we have submitted an alternative version.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Kok report, as it is known, argues that there are synergistic effects and states that every euro spent on development projects by the EU may be worth considerably more than the same amount spent by the individual Member States.
EU projects may, then, reduce the need for state appropriations to the individual Member States.
Increased EU funding need not, therefore, result in an increased tax burden.
In the case of large projects such as space initiatives and those involving nuclear power, there may be economies of scale to be gained from carrying on projects at EU level.
Otherwise I believe that the Lisbon Process should primarily be funded by the Member States themselves.
The Lisbon Process must not be allowed to become the jumping-off point for a large number of new projects at EU level that require funding by the Member States.
In general, I think that the issue of whether national initiatives can be replaced by EU projects is an important one.
I wonder whether there is any empirical evidence of the existence of synergistic effects.
My experience tends to suggest the opposite: the more the EU invests in expanding its bureaucracy and the more legislation and directives it adopts, the more the public sector in the Member States grows.
For each new official in Brussels, the total number of officials in the Member States increases by a factor of five, ten or twenty-five.
According to what is known as public choice theory, it is to be expected that each national bureaucracy will seek to maximise its influence and role.
The more the EU takes over power from the bureaucracies in the Member States, the more these bureaucracies expand.
There are many reasons for this.
The new directives have to be implemented, monitoring must be tightened up.
Moreover, the politicians who have lost their right of initiative seek out new areas in which to act and tell us that more resources are needed in order to strengthen their negotiating position in Brussels.
As an example of this, we only need to look at what happened on the launch of the euro. As the national central banks lost their real function â that of conducting monetary policy â the number of their service staff increased substantially.
This same phenomenon can be observed in a number of areas.
In my opinion, the Commission should take the initiative and allow independent researchers, economists and political scientists to study the operation of the bureaucratic multiplier within the EU.
It is important to stop this process, and one of the ways of doing this is by having fewer legislative directives and more voluntary agreements.
If this is not done, it is likely that the biggest growth sector will prove to be public bureaucracy.
Through our ambitions to harmonise, legislate and become involved in every conceivable issue, we run the risk of putting a brake on growth.
The EU should, therefore, instead make more use of the institutional competition that resides in diversity.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it will be impossible to achieve the objectives laid down by the Lisbon Strategy unless the European Union radically changes the way it addresses the economic and social problems that characterise contemporary society in Europe and the rest of the world.
We live in a globalised market economy, which only appears to support free competition.
A prerequisite for free competition, in fact, is starting off on the same footing, or at least on a comparable footing, based on negotiated trade-offs.
That prerequisite does not exist in practice, just as there is also no mobility policy in the various sectors that might help to revitalise competitiveness and hence employment.
Politics, finance and the economy have to find new rules for running the system imposed by the global market, to replace the rules that governed the market before globalisation.
Europeâs institutions must be short-sighted and unable to grasp the consequences of globalised information over the Internet if they still believe that getting together and announcing a series of intentions is enough to make them actually materialise.
It is not sufficient to make long-term plans which are handed down from on high.
History shows that during the last century a great powerâs economy collapsed under the weight of reality because of centralised plans that were splendid only in theory.
Reality does not depend on plans; on the contrary, plans have to take account of reality.
At this stage in our society it cannot be enough to have an economy still based exclusively on unbridled consumerism.
At the Lisbon European Council, when the knowledge-based society was first defined, a few issues were overlooked, such as making rules to ensure that knowledge is genuine and not manipulated or used for illicit ends.
In addition, the Lisbon strategy will not be able to take off if the Unionâs objectives do not include identifying and implementing measures to provide developing countries with effective help, leading them to democracy and respect for human rights and the rights of workers and children.
It is essential to think in terms of social economics in parallel with development economics.
To achieve this aim, Europe has to change its relations with those countries where workers do not enjoy social security or legal protection and where children cannot play but are forced to work.
Environmental protection and the creation of a European social model are goals that must be pursued.
Â Â  Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Lisbon strategy is to safeguard the prosperity and cohesion of European society, and to ensure it continues to develop.
It is essential to establish sources of funding that make it possible to achieve these goals, yet at the same time it is crucial that the cost of living be as low as possible.
Cheap services and products are particularly important for the poorest groups in society.
Developments in research allowing wider access to modern technologies, and production methods enabling us to compete with countries outside the EU, are examples of ways in which it will be possible to achieve the Lisbon goals.
Priority should also be given to the effective implementation of modern production methods thanks to which jobs can be created that are both modern and secure.
Modern, cheap and high-quality production makes it possible to compete on external markets, which in practice then results in new jobs in the production and services sectors.
Implementation of the Lisbon strategy entails the analysis of a number of areas of activity involving both the European Union and its Member States.
One of the main problems we face as far as the Lisbon strategy is concerned is ensuring that the appropriateness of the goals set for research and for implementation programmes.
The current system for laying down guidelines on research and for channelling funds towards individual research projects is heavily exploited by those Member States that are largest in economic terms.
Over the past few decades, leading research and development centres have been established in Europe, for example in Finland or Saxony.
Over the next five years, a great many new centres of this kind should be set up, in order to close the gap between the EU and the global leaders in this field.
We must increase expenditure on research to at least 3% of GDP, as well as employing at least one million more people in science and research and putting in place procedures to guarantee funds are spent effectively.
Major organisational changes must be made to the present set-up in order to ensure the cohesion of measures.
For example, an appropriate number of research centres should be established in accordance with planned developments in technology and production, with the aim of bringing together local research units.
The latter should be established in order to exploit the intellectual potential of countries that could not afford to build modern research facilities, and therefore to carry out research on their own.
In addition to research, both the local units and the research centres should carry out teaching and take on talented young PhD students, thus creating a new cadre of researchers.
An action plan of this kind would help to fill the gap left by those researchers who have been poached by countries outside the EU.
The primary aim of science and technology as a whole should be to promote small and medium-sized enterprises.
The development of the latter would eliminate unemployment, yet they cannot afford to carry out research or to implement progressive and modern production methods.
Three programmes should be set up relating to research, the employment of researchers and the cohesion of such measures in the EU Member States.
These should comprise a programme laying down guidelines for regional development and the specialisation of production in European countries, a programme aimed at setting up a European system for research and the training of researchers, plus a programme designed to provide information, facilitate the introduction of new technologies and products and ensure that they are applied in production.
The aim of these programmes should be to reduce any negative economic impact caused by the planned introduction of the REACH programme to a minimum.
The system according to which research measures are carried out ought to be simple, easy-to-understand and based on the principle of competitiveness, which will ensure it is effective and encourage investment by the private sector.
In order to gain public and political support, the system must promote cohesion âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, we in Europe are facing a historic challenge, one to which the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is prepared to rise, because we want future generations to prosper and be enabled to enjoy our social model, have jobs and claim a reasonable pension afterwards.
This is impossible without economic growth or jobs.
We must achieve these with an ageing population and against the background of the aggressive globalisation of the economy.
In order to succeed, we need insight and vision, but also the right decisions, which, above all, we need to carry out.
A European stick behind national doors in the shape of a new form of governance will certainly prove useful.
We appreciate the fact that the Barroso Commission has taken the brave decision to revive and breathe new life into the Lisbon strategy and, on the recommendation of the Kok working party, has opted to give priority to growth and jobs in a balanced social and ecological context.
It testifies to honesty and is also in keeping with our approach of a citizensâ Europe founded upon values.
We have given our wholehearted support to the steering committeeâs recommendation, and to that made by the Conference of Presidents, and indeed, although the formulation is general, it is up to the Member States to make specific choices.
We will indicate the way and have made our basic position quite clear.
We must opt in favour of competitiveness, a positive business climate â definitely also including SMEs â and economic growth and jobs.
The three initiatives announced by the Commission will certainly have a place in those.
We must provide the means in order to achieve these ends.
The Member States must plan and deliver.
We will encourage the national parliaments to galvanise their governments into action.
Reforms need to be carried out now in order to allow for sustainable development in all respects.
Finally, all of us, including all institutions and all social partners at European, local and national level, must all do our level best.
I am therefore pleased to find out that the Socialist Group in this House takes a positive view of the resolution.
This once again throws open the possibility of a constructive dialogue, which will benefit Parliamentâs work and responsibilities.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Vice-President, first of all I should like to thank my co-rapporteur, MrÂ Klaus-HeinerÂ Lehne, for the work which we did together on the preparation of the motion for a resolution on which Parliament will be voting today.
I am also pleased to have heard already, in the remarks of the President and the Vice-President of the Commission, an echo of what our resolution expresses.
In recent years the European Union has acquired a currency of its own, has been enlarged, and has adopted a draft Constitution; in other words, broadly speaking, it has established its framework.
Now, however, the substance of its policies does not match up to its citizensâ expectations.
That is why it has to concentrate on growth, on employment, on social and territorial cohesion, not only because these are the very objectives of this process of building Europe â now that peace is assured â but also because they are the prerequisites for the publicâs support for the political plans for the construction of Europe, as Mr Martin Schulz has reminded us.
That is why we believe that it is important to state that the Lisbon strategy must be the Unionâs priority over the next five years.
We believe that this strategy is the right one, provided that it is taken seriously, in other words provided that it is effectively implemented in the Member States in the three dimensions defined at the 2000 Summit under the Portuguese Presidency.
Our objective must be to put our money on European competitiveness and growth, by basing them on the elements of the European model and not âÂ as we sometimes have the impression that you are doing, Mr President, when you mention your three threads â by setting one of those three threads against the other two.
We think that we can only properly serve the interests of economic competitiveness by looking after the social and environmental aspects equally well.
We do not believe that Europe has a future as a low-cost competitor.
I am delighted to hear you mention the need to put our money on excellence, high-quality training for the labour force, human capital, research, and the quality of infrastructures and public services.
These are advantages which will ensure that investors back the European Union.
It is because the European Unionâs products will be based to a greater extent on technology, know-how and eco-innovation that they will find their place in the world markets.
It is because we are relaunching growth on that basis that we shall have the resources to finance effectively a high level of training, distribution and social cohesion within the Union and in particular the enlarged Union.
There is therefore a battle to be fought, and clarifications to be made.
In fact â and I welcome the fact that in this Parliament, essentially, by means of our motion for a resolution, we have managed to avoid these pitfalls â there are a certain number of people who would like to see the Lisbon strategy reduced to a sort of magic formula, a programme of wholesale liberalisation: liberalisation of the services market, liberalisation of the employment market, and liberalisation of pension schemes, as if that was enough in itself to ensure the relaunching of European growth and of competitiveness.
In my view, not only is that rather limited, but it is also completely beside the point.
Europe needs reforms, and we are all agreed on that.
It needs to adapt and to have a more dynamic economy, but it also needs investment, it needs to restimulate internal demand, and it needs to coordinate its efforts and to concentrate them on what can, in future, constitute its wealth and its opportunity in international competition.
That is why our resolution puts the emphasis on a financial perspective which is consistent with the Lisbon strategy, in other words the doubling of the European research budget and constant effort as regards the major trans-European networks, social cohesion and regional policy.
That is why our resolution puts the emphasis on an ambitious social agenda which must be integrated into this overall strategy, and on the fact that the road map which you have presented to us â the legislative and budgetary action plan â must relate to the three dimensions of the Lisbon strategy.
At the moment we have the feeling that there is still a lack of balance, that most of the specific proposals concentrate on competitiveness, the economy and structural reforms, and that there is a lack of incentives, information and legislative initiatives in the area of social cohesion and on environmental issues.
For example, we now want to see a real draft framework directive on services of general interest.
We would like to see a reform of the European Works Councils, in order to enable us to say that the quality of employer-employee relations in Europe is part of our development strategy.
In the area of eco-innovations, we should like to see more specific initiatives, and we are pleased to note that, finally, industrial policy linked to innovation and aid for small and medium-sized enterprises has been included in the Commissionâs programme.
That is the essence of the message which will be expressed by the European Parliament.
I am delighted that we have achieved very broad agreement once again thanks to the work of Mr Daul, Mr Lehne and Mrs Thyssen.
I am sorry that a certain number of other groups on the Left feel unable to join us, on the basis of the content of this resolution.
I can understand that there are still differences, but I can quite honestly say that I believe we have managed to come up with a clear, strong message which is in line with a Lisbon strategy which contributes to the European social model.
Â Â  Mr President, five years after the launch of the Lisbon Strategy it is clear that we need to give it a fresh start.
This new start should not, however, follow the line of the Commission proposal.
I am not critical about what is contained in the proposal, but rather what is not in the proposal.
Separating economic growth from social and environmental development must be a mistake since these three areas are linked.
When President Barroso presented the mid-term review in this Parliament more than a month ago he used the metaphor of having three children and having to pay most attention to the sick one.
The other two, in this case environmental and social development, will have to await their turn for President Barrosoâs attention.
My conclusion is the opposite. To cure the EU economy we need the health of the whole family.
Investment in environmental technology leads to more jobs, boosts innovation and creates sustainable growth.
When the forestry and pulp industry in the Nordic countries made a major shift towards cleaner green technology, the companies concerned became even more competitive on the international market.
New technologies for saving energy are another example of business interests being in tune with environmental concerns.
There is a saying that competition brings out the best in products and the worst in people.
This is definitely true of business, and it is important to create an internal market that is a level playing field.
We need to create a competitive and sustainable economy in Europe; this also means investing in research and development.
The Heads of State must take the situation seriously.
We can set up ambitious goals, but if we lack the necessary political leadership we will never reach them.
In Europe we look at the situation in the US and wonder why it has double the growth that we have.
The US wonders why China has twice the growth it has.
The EU has a great potential to be the worldâs leading knowledge-based economy.
The proposals from the Commission are good, but to reduce the Lisbon Strategy only to a matter of economic growth would be to take steps in the wrong direction while time is running out.
The major groups have negotiated this resolution and the clear message is that economic growth, social cohesion and environmental development have to be seen as a whole.
We demand the same from the Council and the Commission.
I want to thank my fellow negotiators because it is a major achievement to table this resolution â I almost said revolution! â and to have a large majority in the Chamber.
Â Â  Mr President, we Greens do not want to write blank cheques, whether to the Commission under Mr Barroso or to this Parliament, for the fact is that we fear that, when the fog of Lisbon has cleared, we will, in the social and environmental spheres, be faced with realities that do not reflect the integration of the three pillars.
As we have made clear in our amendments, there must be no blank cheque for MrÂ Bolkestein.
Until such time as the Commission â and here I am also appealing to the Members of this House â withdraws the proposal, it can veto a progressive vote at first reading stage, and we are weakening ourselves and making this House to some extent ridiculous if we do not right now insist on the Commission withdrawing this proposal and thus enabling this House to know on what basis our debates are being conducted.
This we have set out in our second amendment.
Â Â  I should like to welcome to Parliament Mr Hrusovsky, President of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, who is now present in the distinguished visitorsâ gallery.
His visit demonstrates the great value that Parliament attaches to dialogue with national parliaments.
I wish MrÂ Hrusovsky and his delegation an enjoyable and successful visit.
Â Â  â The next item is the continuation of the debate on the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, this debate is taking place at a particularly difficult moment for the social situation in the European Union.
We are a long way from the economic growth and rising employment of the late 1990s, as a consequence of restrictive economic and financial policies, the Stability Pact and the rapid liberalisations and privatisations called for by the Lisbon Strategy.
Today, with rising social and regional inequalities, unemployment affecting almost 20Â million workers, growing job insecurity and almost 70Â million people living in poverty, social inclusion and cohesion have to be a priority, a central concern in this mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy.
That means not only creating secure jobs, but also sharing out the created wealth more fairly, through social policies designed to ensure human rights, better pensions and retirement provision, quality public services in health, education, research and vocational training, social security and protection, housing and family support, paying particular attention to promoting equal rights for women and taking account of suitable environmental policies.
Instead of that, the President of the Commission, MrÂ Barroso, has come here to state that the Lisbon Strategy is at the centre of our economic policies, following the conclusions of the Kok report, which places particular emphasis on competitiveness.
What is required, however, as mentioned in our groupâs resolution, is to call a halt to this neoliberal race, to strengthen public investment at EU and national levels, to put a stop to the privatisation of public sectors and services, to withdraw the proposal for a directive to create the internal market in services, to revoke the Stability Pact, to establish a clear distinction between current spending and investment, and to promote a development and employment pact, prioritising growth in jobs with rights, social inclusion, and economic, social and territorial cohesion, the only way to help create the 22Â million secure jobs that are required to meet the 70% target by 2010 laid down in the Lisbon Strategy.
If that does not happen, we will have a rise in social tensions among the people in our countries in protest at the policies we are implementing.
They want greater social protection and better social policy, and that, MrÂ President, is the challenge.
Â Â  Just five years ago, the EU set out to make itself a rival to the United States of America within ten years.
Now we hear the half-time whistle, but I suspect Mr Barroso is not a man to listen to whistle-blowers.
We are asked to consider a mid-term review, but there seems little to review.
The unemployment rate is high and rising and 101Â 000 regulations and directives are bleeding the life out of the wealth creators.
Growth is worse.
Mrs Figueiredo said in her report yesterday that 22Â million jobs need to be created in the EU in the next five years.
You do not have to be Hayek to know that cannot be done.
It is interesting to see the panic setting in amongst the federalists at last; the cracks are really showing.
Mr Barroso is a rampant free marketeer, according to the people over there, while his ideas went out with the Ark according to Mr Mandelson, from the right.
In Britain, at least, people are waking up.
I quote from this morningâs : âPeers tell Brussels to give back cash from EU budgetâ.
We have paid in GBPÂ 180Â billion and got back GBPÂ 105Â billion.
Where has the GBPÂ 75Â billion gone?
Mr Barroso, you try and keep bleeding the British taxpayer at this rate, because worse is better and on that basis this corrupt institution is doing very well indeed.
Â Â  First of all, I would like to congratulate the Commission on its realistic view of the situation and its determination.
We have realised that âLisbon 2000â is an unachieved objective and a clear demonstration of a lack of political will.
Although when we look at the situation realistically it is not, on the whole, a dramatic one, nevertheless the resources for implementing the strategy require radical rethinking.
As I see it, this is what the Commission is indeed proposing.
The objectives remain the same, which is understandable since there is no real alternative.
The main task also remains the same â to convince the Member Statesâ social partners and all European citizens to accept change.
The risk is â it so happens that at the same time as we are relaunching the implementation of the Lisbon strategy we are also discussing the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact â that we have a reform that will not promote convergence between the Eurozone states and will pass greater economic and financial risk on to the Member States.
The Member States will need political leaders and the will to put reforms in place.
The Services Directive too, which the Commission put forward as an essential tool for implementing the Lisbon objectives, has met with stiff opposition.
Unfortunately, the Commission is willing to make concessions.
On the other hand, in implementing the Lisbon strategy there is a risk of falling into the trap of excessive regulation at the European Union level, and so we must ensure that the subsidiarity principle is observed and that there is regular evaluation of the effect of the European Unionâs legislative initiative, where the main goal is to guarantee the competitiveness of Europeâs businesses.
One of the serious risks I would also mention is the ideological debate we are hearing again today, about the importance of the Lisbon agenda pillars.
This debate is tending to return to the previous already overcharged agenda.
Among the advantages of this period is that the European Unionâs enlargement by ten new Member States is a propitious moment.
Fears about jobs moving to the new Member States, cheap labour forces and tax competition within the European Union itself are forcing politicians to consider reforms and are making society more open to change.
With the enlargement of the European Union the time for active competition and change has arrived.
This is the right moment to relaunch the Lisbon strategy.
Â Â  Mr President of the Commission, your review of the Lisbon strategy contains statements that are gravely misleading, not only for this House, but also for the leaders of the 25 Member States.
You state that, and I quote; âWe need to avoid the type of jobless growth that has marred the performance of the US economyâ.
I am not sure whether it was dyed-in-the-wool anti-Americans, Communists or perhaps trade unionists who tricked you into including this false statement, but I should like to point out that figures from Eurostat show that the American economy is growing faster than the European economy, and that unemployment is not only lower in the USA, but dropping almost twice as fast as in the European Union.
I would ask that you refrain from using false economic data, and I would particularly ask that you do not give in to pressure from those socialists who do not wish to admit that maximum freedom for entrepreneurs and minimum state intervention are the only way to achieve prosperity.
I would ask you to face up to the truth and to take action.
This is the only way in which you will make good on what you said when you took up office in the summer, namely that Europe must first earn its right to a welfare state.
I thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we can justifiably describe the text of the resolution before the House as balanced and as containing everything relevant to the Lisbon strategy.
It also gives real impetus to the strategyâs revival.
All three of its elements â growth and the labour market, welfare policy and the environment â have been addressed in a proper context, and my group has been particularly keen to stress the importance of making a clear connection between these two pillars.
A proper environment and social policy is possible only if there is economic growth and a functioning labour market; there is a close and practical connection between the two, for the success of the one as a policy is conditional upon the other, and that this resolution makes this clear is crucially important.
As the short time available to me prevents me from discussing all three of these points, there is one aspect to which I would like to give particular attention, and I regard it as being of fundamental importance.
I refer to the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement of December 2003 on better lawmaking, which â as I have been observing for a year now â is not operating adequately.
It is particularly unsatisfactory when it comes to scrutinising the impact of laws and to involving interested parties in the production of drafts within the Commission.
One reason why we have had to have the debates we have had on, for example, the services directive and REACH is that the impact of legislation has been assessed either inadequately or not at all, and that the interested parties were not sufficiently involved in the process whereby they came into being.
This is, I think, one of the priorities that this resolution addresses, and it is something that must change.
Let me conclude with a couple of observations on the role played by the other groups in this House.
I am grateful to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for following the Liberals in now deciding to support this draft.
They were not quite willing to do that in the Steering Group, but I am glad they have now decided to do so, for it needs a broad majority.
It is vitally important that the Lisbon process should be supported by all.
I do have something of a problem with the attitude of the Greens, who met separately in Luxembourg and decided to oppose it without even waiting for the result of the Steering Groupâs deliberations.
Surely, this is rather peculiar; perhaps the Greens should re-read the text and think about whether it might after all be better to vote in favour of it, or else they will find it difficult to explain their opposition.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Borrellâs initiative, to invite representatives of the national parliaments to a joint discussion on the economic, social and environmental future of Europe, is already bearing fruit.
In most national parliaments, the Lisbon strategy has finally become a political subject.
The European Parliament, in its turn, has done its utmost to produce proposals that are less ideological, more balanced, and closer to the day-to-day reality of life for our 455 million fellow citizens.
Of course our draft resolution could be improved still further.
There are certain deafening silences, such as the lack of any reference to the need to adjust the Stability and Growth Pact.
Happily, the governments, whatever their political colour, have a more realistic approach than some Conservative or Liberal MEPs.
Thus, the Ecofin Council, in spite of some difficult debates, is moving towards an adjustment of the pact.
I am willing to bet that the spring summit will succeed in transforming a somewhat ineffectual budgetary monitoring tool into a political-economy tool in the service of growth.
With limited inflation, interest rates which are low compared with the past, a savings surplus and businesses that are more than profitable, Europe â and above all the euro zone â is currently lacking, not in stability, but in growth.
As a matter of priority we should stimulate internal demand, particularly in the larger countries within the euro zone, Germany, France and Italy.
It is only by resuming public and private investment and giving new impetus to consumption that our Union will be able to increase its growth and create jobs.
The mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy will have to result in the concentration of resources on the priority objectives, that is, investment in education, training, research and infrastructures.
Fewer reports and more specific actions are needed in order to create that Europe of excellence which the Socialists are calling for.
Defending a Europe of excellence, however, does not mean defending the status quo.
High social and environmental standards can and should be included in the framework of any successful economic option.
In a world in which capital is becoming increasingly mobile, Europeâs most precious competitive advantage remains its well-educated and trained labour force, which also has the independence necessary to enable it to react to constant change.
It is no accident that the Scandinavian countries, which showed the greatest determination in adopting the Lisbon strategy with regard to social and environmental excellence, are now among the best performing European countries in economic terms.
They did their utmost to ensure that they could provide the type of real job security that is based on the capacity to maintain the constant upgrading of professional skills.
A modern competitive framework requires a re-examination of the concept of flexibility.
In a rapidly developing global economy, the most prosperous businesses will be those that are the most flexible.
Those businesses which rely on revolving reserve supplies of temporary workers will lose ground to those whose employees are tied to them by motivation based on job security and decent working conditions.
Policies on the employment market and on industrial relations systems must be reoriented towards the anticipation and management of change, so as to create a dynamic European economy and persuade the European labour force that change is an opportunity rather than a threat.
We need a modern labour organisation system and active employment market policies.
The same logic applies to social protection policies which play a crucial role and which call for the strengthening of policies to combat poverty and social exclusion.
I shall end, Mr President, by saying that the Europe of excellence is possible.
Moreover, the European Union is much better than its reputation.
Seen from the outside, the Union is the world political entity which has the highest standard of living, not only in economic terms but also in social and environmental terms.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Lehne and Mr Goebbels particularly, and also the other Members for their constructive cooperation.
My warm thanks go to them all.
Five years after the inception of the Lisbon strategy, we have now reached a fork in the road, and I would like to take this as an opportunity to reiterate something fundamental about the situation in Europe.
The last time Europe suffered from this sort of structural mass unemployment was in the 1930s.
In Germany, from which I come, the number of unemployed is higher than at any time in the history of the Federal Republic, having gone over the million mark in North Rhine-Westphalia, which both Commissioner Verheugen and I call home.
At the same time, many Member States are getting deeper and deeper into debt, and science and research are going elsewhere as the intellectual, moral and political consequences of mass unemployment spread â lower turnouts at elections, general dissatisfaction with politics, burgeoning racism, and extremism from both the Right and the Left.
All of these things we have to face up to.
We have had five wasted years in which we wanted everything and achieved nothing, and now Europe must come to a decision.
Do we have the courage and the strength to at last go into battle against mass unemployment?
Do we have the courage and the strength to turn things around, and go for more jobs and more growth?
Do we have the courage and the strength to stop focussing on those who are still in work and at last turn our eyes upon those who want to work but cannot?
In response to that, I say that we must, clearly, summon up the courage and strength to do these things, and it is no less clear that they call for a combined effort by all of us and for absolute concentration on greater competitiveness.
Let us at last come to grasp what that is: the indispensable requirement for more growth and new jobs, without which we will not achieve the ambitious social and environmental goals of which we are all in favour, as the resolution says.
In this, the completion of the internal market as the engine of development will be crucial.
None of us can any more be ignorant of the fact that the European internal market has created two million jobs since 1993.
That being so, can we afford to have a European market for services that exists only on paper?
