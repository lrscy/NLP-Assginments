While budget support to national governments may spend more money quicker, it is much more difficult to police and monitoring will have to be of a high calibre.
Small-scale help for entrepreneurs must not be abandoned.
It is here that the members of the Committee on Development should be more active in keeping the Commission alert to its responsibilities.
The Commission has laid down its six priority principles, all of which we can strongly support.
The priority within the six is also important.
We should never forget that without peace, stability, good governance and the rule of law none of the other five priorities can be acted upon.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gemelli, for his work in producing this report, on which all the groups have ultimately reached a consensus in committee, although, as has been said, this has not been easy.
This report deals with a field of action - globalisation - which is increasingly complex, especially when it comes to environmental problems and the problem of migratory flows, which is becoming more and more important in defining the European Union' s role in the world.
The Socialist Group has always argued that development policy should be an essential element of the external action of the European Union and its Member States.
And this is for two fundamental reasons: firstly, because the underdevelopment in which at least 800 million people live strikes us as intrinsically perverse, socially unjust and economically inefficient.
Secondly, because we believe that the principles of solidarity and cohesion on which the European Union is based must guide the management of globalisation, so that it may be sustainable.
To this end, I recommend that anybody who is not convinced should read the latest essay by Susan George.
However, we do not support just any development policy.
Commissioner, if the objective of development policy is to eliminate poverty, as you and the Council have stated on numerous occasions, you should not, in your preliminary draft budgets, take funds away from the least-developed countries for the benefit of other external commitments.
If this means that you have to increase the ceiling of the Financial Perspective, then do so, and if you do not, then change your tune.
If we follow the model of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD for the rationalisation of strategies to combat poverty, we will also have to follow the DAC on the structure of the budgets, so that we can assess the effectiveness of our policy in relation to our objectives.
That is what Parliament approved and what we want to see.
If the Commission wants new forms of governance for Europe in which dialogue with civil society plays a fundamental role, we must help those organisations which are more representative in the development of the European Union.
In summary, we cannot manage this policy in the erratic way that we are doing at the moment.
Mr Gemelli' s report is good.
The Commission' s communication is also good although it suffers from a lack of specific points and quantifiable objectives, as the report says.
Both documents are worthless if they are not applicable in practice.
In the coming months various world conferences are going to take place and the debate will be reopened on the great development issues: the World Conference against Racism, the United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, and the first AIDS Conference.
All of these issues affect our everyday policy.
Racism, for example, is closely related to the problems of immigration, which in turn must be analysed from the point of view of the development of the countries of origin, and AIDS is closely related to the whole policy of patents and the pharmaceutical industry.
The Socialist Group of the European Parliament advocates the European Union' s active participation in these conferences and it is therefore necessary for European Community development policy to be effective, coherent and cohesive.
We therefore hope that this report bears fruit.
Mr President, unlike the Commission our Parliament is not really in a position to establish priorities.
The main question at issue at present is whether we support the six areas of special interest as formulated by the Commission.
The answer is yes, with the proviso that communication and energy should be added to transport.
The European Union must concentrate as far as possible on those areas in which it has value added.
A crucial element in this is a properly functioning government apparatus in the developing countries.
If the essential tasks - maintenance of the rule of law, health care, education, infrastructure - are not effectively carried out, participation in the free-market economy is not really feasible.
In my view therefore, the building up of administrative capacity should be at the top of the list of priorities.
Even more important than strengthening the institutions as such, is the combating of abuse of power, corruption and unlimited force.
The promotion of regional cooperation should also be given new impetus.
It is better for us to do less very well than a great deal badly.
It is a question of effectiveness.
This is why the policy of the Commission and that of the Member States should complement each other.
That is, it must not be a matter of Europe following the Member States or of Member States following Europe.
The much-discussed internal coherence is also crucial to the success of this policy.
In addition it is of the utmost importance that we can actually implement the priorities that we are now establishing, with the help of well-qualified staff.
Reducing poverty in the world is more important than increasing one' s own wealth.
Development cooperation must therefore be a major component of European policy.
That will only be possible if this Parliament itself also establishes clearly defined priorities and does not get carried away in amending the sound report of Mr Gemelli.
The Commission' s proposals now need to be elaborated further into a clear strategy.
That must also be given absolute priority by our Parliament.
Mr President, Community development policy must make it possible to establish a framework for discussion with the European Union' s partners, to coordinate European action with other donors, particularly the Member States and to increase consistency with other Community policies, especially commercial policy and common agricultural policy.
The Commission' s current approach, however, will not give rise to a fair policy because it is still dependent on the market' s operation and the rules specified by the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank, which are still unfavourable for developing countries.
Liberal globalisation to promote development has admittedly been a failure.
Mr Gemelli' s report quite rightly denounces the deterioration in the economic, social and environmental situation of developing countries, the worsening of poverty and the negative impact of globalisation on these countries.
It advocates a review of the WTO rules so that account is taken of developing countries.
We should reiterate, however, the basic principle of a sustainable development policy.
The beneficiaries of the aid should set out their development strategy themselves, with their own needs in mind.
Here, however, we have exactly the reverse - the European Union gives itself the right to dictate to its partners how to use the aid in the six areas that it considers to be priorities.
We must take away this fundamental ambiguity.
Are we acting in the interests of the countries that we apparently want to help, or in the interests of the European Union and its Member States?
Where does the European Union stop having a direct interest and where does its development policy begin?
Developing countries are obviously experiencing difficulties in protecting their interests within the international community.
For example, in terms of health care, a court case was brought against South Africa by pharmaceutical multinationals.
Brazil was condemned by the United States because it manufactured or imported cheap generic drugs for combating AIDS, a disease which is killing millions of Brazilians.
The European Community must make its voice heard in the international courts in order to defend the principle of potentially granting free licences to developing countries that have pressing health care problems.
I am asking my fellow Members to do this by adopting an amendment that has, moreover, already been adopted by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
The continued reduction of the Community budget for development, which is 1.1% smaller in the draft budget for 2002, is also incomprehensible, whereas development cooperation is one of the priorities of the Commission' s Work Programme for 2001.
There is a long list of deviations from the development policy that the Commission has, up to now, been conducting.
We shall therefore vote in favour of this report, since it highlights the gulf between political statements and the progress that has actually been made, even if it does not always follow our logic to the letter.
Mr President, I agree to a large extent with the critical comments in the report and Mr Gemelli's proposals.
However, I too doubt that it will be possible to halve the number of poor people by 2015.
The new-liberal policies of the northern countries, which have made the rich richer and kept the poor in the poverty trap, are also shaping development policy.
The new motto 'Everything but Arms' sounds fine but misses the mark.
First, the arsenals are so full, as the result of arms exports from industrialised countries, including Germany, that war can be waged and will be waged with the weapons already available.
Secondly, it is hypocritical of the European Union to preach liberalisation of the markets as a universal panacea while bemoaning the fact that the 48 poorest countries have been allowed to export all their products to the Union duty free since the year 2000.
Thirdly, I think it is cynical of rich countries - including Germany - to encourage a brain drain from developing countries, thereby pulling the rug out from under a self-perpetuating upswing.
Development policy is not just altruism, it is self interest.
It is striking that areas which provide raw materials are defined as areas of interest and, according to the new NATO strategy and the rules of engagement for the future EU strike force, areas of interest can also be secured using military force.
If we want a new European Union for the twenty-first century, then we need a radical change in development policy.
Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Gemelli on this report which is absolutely the most important report we shall be working on in this parliamentary term.
There is good reason for joining Mr Gemelli in reminding both the Council and the Commission of the rules which are contained in Article 178 of the Treaty but which neither the Council nor the Commission is following.
In paragraph 7 of the motion for a resolution, Mr Gemelli splendidly draws attention to the fact that there must be coherence between development policy objectives and decisions taken in the commercial and agricultural spheres, that the EU' s agricultural policy must be revised and that the EU' s markets must be opened to all goods from the least developed countries.
Nonetheless, we have just experienced the incredibly embarrassing fact that, in the 'Everything but Arms' agreement, the EU has postponed free access for sugar right up until the year 2009 and that it has also postponed opening its markets for rice and bananas, in short the most important export goods from the world' s 48 poorest countries.
Combating poverty is the primary goal of the EU' s development policy.
In order to combat poverty in the developing countries actively and constructively, there are a number of areas which must seriously be taken care of.
There are, in particular, three very important points with which the Commission' s communication has not dealt particularly thoroughly.
The Committee on Development and Cooperation has adopted a range of amendments on all three of these points, namely reproductive health, the involvement of developing countries as cooperation partners and the involvement of NGOs and civil society in the decision-making process.
Bearing in mind the fact that women, and especially women of child-bearing age, are the mainstay of development and the fight against poverty and the fact that reproductive health also includes the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, it is significant that, in general, the Commission rarely refers to health, including women' s reproductive health rights, other than in an aside.
It is of the very greatest importance that the EU should help combat these life-threatening diseases that are partly responsible for halting the development process.
As is well known, George W. Bush has recently suspended all aid to organisations which, in any way whatsoever, offer advice on contraception and abortion.
This is a step which, in the first place, discriminates profoundly against women. Secondly, it is a real threat to public health - or, rather, the absence of public health - in developing countries.
That is why it is that much more important for the EU, in future, to make a determined effort in the health field.
I therefore hope that the House will adopt those amendments also adopted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
Mr President, I too want to congratulate Mr Gemelli on his report.
The Commission' s proposal represents an important step forward when it comes to presenting a more focused programme of development aid.
The activity can only be effective if it is more concentrated and results-oriented.
The six priority areas listed in the Commission' s report are well chosen.
At the same time, Parliament' s resolution contains a number of important additional paragraphs and remarks.
Parliament places more emphasis than the Commission' s proposal upon the environmental aspects of all development.
Parliament highlights, for example, the fact that a large proportion of the poor majority in the countryside is heavily dependent upon basic natural resources and that the nurturing of natural resources, forests, pasture-land, agricultural land and water resources must therefore be an important component of any strategy on poverty.
Another of Parliament' s important remarks concerns the Commission' s priority number five: transport.
Parliament' s comment on this is important, namely that the focus should be broader and therefore not only be upon roads but also include access to information and communications technology, as well as to modern energy resources.
Poor countries were never given any real chance of participating seriously in the development of the industrial society.
There is now a great risk that large regions will end up outside the new economy that is growing up around information and communications technology.
Helping to develop capacity around these forms of technology must be an important component of any development strategy.
In general, there is a tendency not to attach enough importance to technology issues in combating poverty.
I hope that the Commission will be constructive in accepting the various recommendations of the Gemelli report, above all on those points where we indicate the need to look more broadly at the priorities.
We shall, in any case, have the opportunity to return to these issues in connection with the budget.
Mr President, during the discussion in this Chamber one of the suggestions made is that we, if we name sectors in which we wish to pursue a development policy, should at the same time as it were, impose conditions on colleagues in other countries in the South.
I oppose that.
In essence the international commitments that we made at the Poverty Summit in Copenhagen, are commitments between North and South.
It is our social task to try to make them operational and primary education and health care play a large part in this.
The underlying idea is that anyone who has no chance of basic education or health care in his own country, has no chance of personal development and therefore of getting a decent start.
Of course, sensible interaction is required between the Member States, the European Union, the countries concerned and civil society.
On that point we have set important targets, both with the six priorities and with the priorities of the European Parliament for the 2001 budget.
In practice, however, that is not easy: too few well-trained people, an organisation that is not yet effective, underfunding.
Still I believe that the Commission has taken an extremely important step - and the Commissioner deserves every credit for this - by putting the emphasis on the problem of poverty and coherence between it and other policy areas.
Of course, the Commissioner does not have an easy job: first Commissioner Fischler wants to give the wrong food aid again, then Member States grant Mr Lamy insufficient support when he wants to give extra aid to 48 countries.
But gradually you can nevertheless see that a modest step forward is being taken.
I believe that in the next few months the main point will be how all those fine words will be put into practice.
If these fine words can create a climate in which we can not only well formulate a broader policy together, but can also implement it, and if we support the Commission in a coherent way, we have a good chance of succeeding.
The situation at this moment is definitely not a simple one.
Those people involved in the changes in the various services are also very uncertain about the organisational changes.
It is not easy, because the people in the delegations are not there yet and sometimes the necessary experience is missing.
But we must build up this side of things; if the Commissioner really shows us that he and his Commission, with the support of the Council, are taking a first step in the direction Parliament wishes, then I believe we have the opportunity to enter a new phase together.
Let us not look only at all the misery in the world, but also at the positive proofs that we can achieve something together.
And if people in the developing countries have a good project of their own that deserves support, then we must take that route.
I should like to see us try to convert all that misery into a positive policy on poverty and to show that with our European help - the EU is the largest donor in the world - we can really make a difference.
I wish the Commissioner every success: we shall judge him by his actions, as he will us.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr van den Berg is optimistic.
So are we, although we are aware that things are not going too well with development cooperation in the world, including European cooperation.
For that reason we actually consider it a good idea that a new policy is being constructed.
In statistical terms aid from European countries is considerable, but the number of poor people in the world has increased in the last ten years.
So there has definitely not been a success in combating poverty.
That is why it is a good thing that that priority should be established, with the proviso that we are prepared to acknowledge why we have failed hitherto, that we intend to do things differently in future, that a plan of action is agreed and that we are prepared to incorporate benchmarking in that plan.
The fact is that we are absolutely unconvinced that liberalisation of world trade leads to the abolition of poverty, though world trade can of course increase prosperity.
But if corruption continues unchecked, if governments are not prepared to redistribute even the new wealth, then not much will be achieved.
However, we must be prepared to cooperate fully with those partners that want to.
Our lack of coherence has already been pointed out and I add my voice to those calling for coherence.
I wonder if we can talk of coordination and complementarity if countries go on thinking that they must continue to pursue a strictly personal cultural, economic, and geopolitical approach.
We are prepared, though, to give credit to the reform of European development policy, since reform is a must after so many years of inefficiency.
However, I should like to ask a few questions.
Why is aid not concentrated to a greater extent on the poorest countries?
How much will the poor in those countries really benefit?
And a question to which Mr van den Berg devoted a great deal of attention: are people prepared for true partnership?
Actually we have the impression that out texts still emanate to a large extent a feeling of one-way traffic, a feeling that we know so much better.
Will we have any say in the expenditure of the European Development Fund?
Is the Council prepared to stop intervening in concrete implementation plans?
I could go on asking questions. I shall not do so, Mr President, but they are questions that preoccupy all of us here.
Mr President, one comment from the Gemelli report struck me particularly: on page 22 it is asserted that the trade policy of the European Union has substantially greater consequences for developing countries than development aid.
If we take that into account, we can no longer debate in a non-committal way on the Union' s development policy.
We must do our utmost to make development policy in such a way that the divide between North and South is bridged.
That means first and foremost great emphasis on the coherence of trade and aid.
I am gratified by the attention paid to this in the Commission document and should like to express the wish that all our trade measures should be assessed on their consequences for the developing countries.
In fact, that applies to other policy fields too.
The creation of a special budget line is not sufficient to counter negative effects of EU policy on developing countries.
I am thinking of agricultural subsidies, for example.
In conclusion, I should like to remark that I have a problem with the term "reproductive health care" in recital aa) and Section 33.
I should like to hear from the rapporteur whether funding of programmes for abortion also falls under this heading.
Only recently it emerged that in financing such programmes Europe was showing a high profile in contrast to the United States.
When the Dutch minister Herfkens asked Commissioner Nielson for a budget for these programmes, he was given a positive answer without further ado.
Quite apart from the ethical aspects involved, I do not think that it is the task of Europe to respond to every change in US policy.
The European Union has its own limited political priorities and responsibilities.
Such a reactive strategy does not benefit the coherence of our policy.
Mr President, in my turn I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, in which he does indeed get to the heart of the matter, namely the urgent need for greater coherence in the policy pursued, greater coordination between development policy and other policy fields and between European development policy and that of the Member States.
The setting up of a permanent task force to coordinate the development policy of the Union and the Member States and to strengthen the European position in international bodies, is a laudable idea.
In addition, the Gemelli report adds precision to the Commission' s document on a number of important points.
Information and communications technology must indeed be a major priority.
The same applies, for that matter, to conflict prevention, which unfortunately is only mentioned indirectly in the Commission document.
Then there is health policy.
There is certainly an urgent need for affordable and more efficient drugs for basic developing world diseases, such as TB, malaria and sleeping sickness.
The Commission' s action programme on pharmaceutical drugs is commendable but inadequate.
It may encourage research into tropical medicines, but it is mainly the European taxpayer who is likely to foot the bill.
A more fundamental requirement seems to me that the poorest countries should obtain cheaper licences for the production and sale of drugs against basic diseases.
It is also a more fundamental requirement that an end should be put to so-called "heritage piracy" , that is, claiming patients via the heritage of developing countries by making use of the knowledge of local healers.
In the almost two years that I have been a Member of this Parliament I have already voted for five reports arguing for greater coherence in development policy.
You won' t mind my asking today when the Council and the Commission are finally going to make this a priority.
Can I begin by being self-critical of this Parliament.
We support the Commission in drawing up a clearer and concise set of development objectives and then produce a resolution that numbers 68 separate paragraphs in response.
Nevertheless, there is much in this report on which the Commission should reflect.
Our objective should not be poverty reduction but poverty eradication.
Integration in the world economy cannot be an end in itself in comparison with bringing the poor themselves to market.
Poor people frequently depend on fragile ecosystems and therefore conservation and sustainability should be prime objectives of our policy.
EU development policy should be guided by all UN international development targets and not just poverty.
The EU has a key responsibility, for example, in promoting access to education for all, especially girls.
However, while supporting this resolution, let us recall previous statements in the Maastricht Treaty, in Horizon 2000 and then in Agenda 2000, all of which included fine statements of goodwill on development policy.
The test is implementation.
Let us also recall that the Commissioner' s response in this Parliament last year that a communication on coherence had to wait until the overall development policy statement had been agreed.
The protectionist backlash against the 'Everything but Arms' proposal demonstrates only too clearly the need to raise the profile of development objectives in our trade, agricultural and other policies.
Finally, we will only manage to focus on poverty if we reallocate properly our use of resources.
The Commissioner and his services have been working closely with me and Parliamentary colleagues in recent weeks to ensure agreement on how to deliver this through the budget.
I thank him for that.
We are very close to an understanding which will ensure that Parliament and Commission move forward together.
However, a failure will seriously undermine the principles in this development policy communication and I appeal to him from the floor of the House to continue the dialogue before we reach a set of difficult votes in forthcoming weeks.
I ask him to work with us so that we can turn our mutual desires into a common commitment.
The EU has been a willing donor but has, in the past, and I emphasise in the past, failed to deliver effective help when it is required and where it is most needed.
Such failure has left many countries poorer today.
Fortunately, and I disagree with the last speaker, the Gemelli report strengthens the Commission proposals.
Commissioner Nielson and his team have done a great job and Mr Gemelli' s report - an excellent report - reinforces those new proposals.
The acid test will be whether the next ten or twenty years of EU aid will reduce poverty substantially - I disagree with the last speaker, we will never eradicate poverty.
The aim is to reduce substantially the poverty and misery experienced by so many.
The Gemelli report attempts to take a fresh approach, a bold approach.
Out with theory, the models which did not produce results.
In with practical ideas to promote real development: development of human resources, so that indigenous people acquire technical skills; development of vocational skills for rural production, so that people can grow, harvest, process, package and sell their goods for added value with which they can then buy their education, health and homes; building capacity through transfer of technology to SMEs, promoting use of sustainable energy, application of information technology, enhancing awareness of social education, health and human rights.
These are the ideas in the Gemelli report which support Commissioner Nielson' s report and good work.
Therefore, this important report should be fully approved by this House because it should improve the efficacy of EU aid.
It will be a blueprint for other donors and I hope that all Members from all sides will support this report and the Commission as well.
Mr President, Commissioner, I voted for the Gemelli report in committee and I will vote for it in this Chamber.
I fully support the report and, like all the Members, I can find no fault with a work that I feel has been carried out conscientiously with a great deal of commitment, and with the cooperation of all the members of the Committee.
I would like to take advantage of this time available to me to raise two or three points of a different kind.
Whenever, either here or elsewhere, I discuss development or development cooperation, the question that springs involuntarily to my lips is, as some of the Members have said, "How can this be?"
If we consider the situation of 40 years ago and then we look at the way things are today, we realise that the North-South divide has widened, that the gap between the poorest and richest countries is wider.
How can this be?
We must endeavour to respond to this question or we will be in danger of never being able to make any headway when we discuss the subject.
Why is it, as Mr Gemelli asked, that there are more poor people, fewer educated people and new illnesses, and that the conditions of children, babies and women have deteriorated.
What are the reasons for this?
In my opinion, there is one basic reason.
We talk about development policy and we talk about public resources: these represent a tiny, tiny stream flowing from North to South; but then there is a very big stream, a huge river of private resources which flows from South to North.
Therefore, the problem is whether the Member States and the European Union and the other rich countries will succeed in establishing a development policy capable of promoting coherence between public and private policies. Of course, this would not mean depriving the private sector of the ultimate goal of its initiative but putting more pressure on it more than we have done thus far.
This is the point. If we do not do this, then we will be like King Canute trying to stop the waves.
So what is the risk now, Commissioner Nielson?
You know better than me: it is that, in the current globalisation and in the information society, those who are excluded from wealth are also excluded from knowledge.
In other words, they are twice excluded.
This is a serious risk and that is why we need to take radical decisions now, at this historic time.
With regard to the issue of debt and of whether our countries have made good the commitments undertaken 25 years ago to allocate at least 0.7% of their respective GDPs to development policies: well, only one country out of 15 - Sweden, which has the honour of holding the Presidency of the Union - has stood by this undertaking.
We need fresh support for development policy, support which has thus far not been forthcoming, from all the economic systems in which we live, not just from the States or public institutions.
One last point, Commissioner Nielson: I have also read the Commission's action plan, but we are not talking about that.
We requested an information campaign in Europe on cooperation policy and public aid policy.
I have seen no sign of this.
There can be no support for a development policy without the backing of the European public, and how will we obtain such backing if an information campaign is not staged within the European Union, not outside it?
I could be tempted to start an information campaign here and now in the light of Mr Imbeni' s remarks about only Sweden being at 0.7% or above the ODA.
In fact, there is a group of countries which actually are above 0.7%.
Sweden is about 0.8%, as is the Netherlands.
Luxembourg has just made it above 0.7%.
Denmark is at 1.0%; Norway, not a Member, but still the closest competitor to Denmark. Norway is around 0.9%.
So it is fine that we have the G7.
Fortunately for development cooperation we also have the G0.7.
Ireland has decided to reach 0.7 at the latest in 2007 so things are moving and some of the bigger countries are, in fact, also trying to increase the level.
To add one more remark on this quantitative aspect: working at European level we should recognise the fact that Member States have accepted that the Commission can continue working at the level of ambition that has been defined.
For the ACP countries we have the money promised for the ninth European Development Fund and for the rest of the world we also have, as part of the Financial Perspective, clarity and certainty as to the budget level for development cooperation.
This is quite important, when we look around the world, that we have the availability of resources.
One big element in the complex equation of what we do is to be considered stable.
Member States have said that they are giving the Commission the benefit of the doubt to see if we can do this better than we used to and they are not squeezing us on funding.
We have to be quite humble against that background and it is a challenge to live up to this.
To Mrs Sauquillo, I would just give the information that on 9 February we had a very good meeting with a whole range of different development NGO networks in Europe and at that meeting they asked us about how to organise future discussions.
I can tell Parliament that I immediately accepted the idea of regular meetings on substance with the different development NGOs and this will be very useful.
However, I find it more important to have a substantial debate, an ongoing discussion, with Parliament than with anybody else.
One does not exclude the other but it should be remembered in any discussion about the role of NGOs that this House has the legitimacy and representation which gives any opinion from here a somewhat bigger weight than any from anywhere else.
This is also part of my approach in dealing with these issues.
Mr Rod pointed out the problem of whether we or our partners are deciding what we are supposed to do.
This is in any case a complex issue.
We can only offer to do those things in the developing countries that we know how to do.
We have had to limit ourselves to some extent because there are many things we do not know enough about to be delivering good assistance in those fields.
There are some limits to what we can make our obligation and we also have to ensure that it fits in with what other donors can offer.
It is not correct to say that we have designed our priorities by thinking how we could help ourselves by doing these things in the developing countries.
This is simply not fair, especially when we look at the new policy and the very strong focus on poverty.
Mr Rod also mentioned access to medicines.
It should be noted that the Commission has recently taken a number of steps in the follow-up to its communication on AIDS, malaria, TB.
We decided two weeks ago in the Commission on a programme of action which follows up what we did in the autumn.
This actually includes some very strong ideas on opening up for a more focused attention on tier pricing and also opening up for bidding and becoming a supplier across the geography for non-OECD companies from, for instance, Brazil, India, South Africa, China which should have access to bids on all our agendas relating to malaria, TB and AIDS.
Mrs Sandbaek, the opening up for exports from LDCs has been an issue which I assume everybody is well informed about now.
I listened carefully to the different evaluations concerning how Member States finally decided on Monday.
There was very little doubt as to the Commission' s views and its original proposal.
The Member States have now decided.
I take some relative satisfaction in looking at comments from everybody outside the EU, as well as comments from Third World representatives, that they now sincerely hope that other big trading partners and players in the global trade policy discussions will now do something as good or comparable to what Europe has done.
There is absolutely no doubt that Europe is now in a better position than before the LDC conference and in the effort of creating a basis for a new global round in the WTO framework.
We can always discuss whether we have done our part and whether it is good enough.
But what we have done is something which the others now have to match.
Relatively speaking, this is very good at this time.
Mrs Sandbaek also questioned what Europe is going to do in view of President Bush' s announcement of cutting US support for organisations involved in family planning activities.
We are strongly engaged in this area and the relationship between poverty, conflict, AIDS and gender equality is so strong that we have absolutely no doubt in our mind as to the need to react strongly and immediately to the threat coming from the US Administration in this field.
I announced in the UN in New York in January that Europe is able and willing to fill the decency gap and we will do that.
There is a misunderstanding, and I noted Mr Belder' s remarks here, that this is about abortion programmes.
The reality is that the work of UNFPA, and of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, even looked at in a very narrow, yes or no perspective, is clearly a part of the solution and not part of the problem.
They are reducing the number of dangerous and illegal abortions carried out in this world and not the other way around.
To Mrs Maes, I would say you are right that the battle against poverty is not over and has not been won.
One of the reasons why development assistance has not worked is, quite simply, because there has not been enough of it.
Some of it has not been good and the crazy conflicts, the problem of corruption, all these problems are there.
But we are in a situation where, for once, it is reasonable to say that more of the same is part of the answer.
We know what good development cooperation is and the sigh of relief, the sense of getting things in order now for the EU, reflects that fact that there is a global consensus to relate to.
Otherwise we would have invented something very new and exciting which we could choose to call a wheel or whatever, but the interesting thing is that there is not really much new in what we have done.
But we have become mainstream.
We are hooking into the priorities and the ways of working which reflect best practice in the understanding among donors and partner countries in the south.
This is why I feel so confident that the priorities that we have listed, the policy paper and the support it has got is strong, real stuff that we can use.
Getting it done will be quite a challenge but we will face up to it.
To Mr Howitt and Mr van den Berg I would say, on the issue of priorities, that it is pretty well established that we agree on the aims of actually being able to deliver something that more than lives up to the 20-20 principles from the Social Summit in Copenhagen for instance.
Giving priority to health and education agreed and so on. But our problem, and this also comes back to what Mr Imbeni said, is strangely enough the fact that we do not know what we are doing.
To some extent we do know what we are doing but we have no record of the composition of the different activities.
We are not able to say how much we are doing on environment because the labelling of our different projects was never organised in such a way that we can take out the files and say, "Well, this is it" .
We are not able, as of now, to say how many kilometres of roadway we built last year.
This is something I am trying desperately to produce - clear, tangible, real, down-to-earth statistics, telling people what we are doing.
But it is all obscured by commitments and long-term programmes etc. and there is no link between the spending and the commitment.
This is where we are now.
So delivering, technically, in the manner that Parliament would like will require more homework than we are able to perform in a very short time.
This is the core of the discussion that is still outstanding, not an issue of substantial disagreement.
Honestly, at the beginning I myself had some doubt as to the importance of writing the overall policy statement for development cooperation because in my view it was not really that new.
Today, almost a year after we did it, I am of a different opinion because first of all the actual process of writing it and having it accepted showed that it was definitely worth the trouble and that debate was necessary to create real ownership in the Commission throughout the different services with regard to these principles.
The next thing was that Member States were much more enthusiastic about having one paper covering the whole geography saying what our policy is.
We never had that before.
So, even if it is not revolutionary, I see a strong meaningful value in having it and certainly, as I sense in our discussions over the months between the Commission and Parliament in this field, we have real value in having this shared framework of what it is that we think about when we talk about the development policy paper.
So it is valuable.
The next thing now is that we are going to use it and the moment is important because together with the launching of the Cotonou Agreement, the hammering out of country strategy papers for each and every one of the 77 ACP countries, we are in business, and we are going to use these principles.
For the rest of the geography we are going to move from country to country applying the same rules.
This is where we will be calling the bluff on the reality of the acceptance of focusing on poverty when we come to middle-income non-ACP countries and start looking at the real distribution of what we are spending our money on in these countries.
So, we will have tons and tons of work and a lot of political challenges to correct the course of what we are doing in the coming months and years in this area.
Another big drama will be the actual delivery.
I will continue being very open and frank with Parliament, not to reduce our own responsibility for executing the budget but rather to make sure that there are no misunderstandings as to the size of the challenge and its nature.
We now have a good policy and we are fortunate to have the backing of this House for that policy.
The next thing is to move forward hand-in-hand and implement it and make sure, as I have said before in this Parliament, that we change the situation from what it is today, where we can say that as Europeans we are proud that we do this, to some years from now when we should also be proud as to how we have done it.
Highly migratory fish stocks
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0047/2001 by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation laying down control measures applicable to fishing for certain stocks of highly migratory fish [COM(2000) 619 - C5-0585/2000 - 2000/0253(CNS)];
A5-0046/2001 by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a Community financial contribution towards certain expenditure to implement certain management measures on highly migratory fish [COM(2000) 651 - C5-0556/2000 - 2000/0268(CNS)];
A5-0051/2001 by Mr PiÃ©trasanta, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species [COM(2000) 353 - C5-0016/2001 - 2000/0149(CNS)].
The Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, has the floor.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are once again holding - and once again at night - an important debate on the common fisheries policy, specifically on its external aspects, on what we could call the external fisheries policy, by which I mean the European Union' s participation in Regional Fisheries Organisations, which from now on I shall refer to as RFOs for short, and the renewal of a fisheries agreement with a third country, in this case Equatorial Guinea.
I would firstly like to congratulate my fellow rapporteurs this evening, Mr PiÃ©trasanta and Mr Gallagher, on the wonderful work they have done.
To focus on the first of these aspects, the role of the European Union in the RFOs, in this case we are dealing with RFOs that regulate the populations of highly migratory species, that is, tuna and related species, such as swordfish. These are fish resources of the highest commercial value to which we must apply the utmost effort since they are of enormous economic importance, both to the Union and to third countries.
I would also like to draw your attention to the Community decision-making procedure in this field.
In committee we have introduced an amendment to the regulation on control measures, so that the Commission may present us with an annual report on the control and monitoring measures carried out within the scope of the RFOs in which the European Union participates.
This report must include the provisions which are adopted by the management committee of the fisheries sector in implementation of the provisions of that regulation.
The European Parliament is given very little information and, what is even more serious, there is a sense that these consultations with the European Parliament are useless, since we are consulted after the event, when the measures have already been adopted, thereby making a mockery of the role of the European Union' s principal democratic institution.
We must change this system, Commissioner.
We are already trying to do this de facto through the ICCAT meetings, a system which we must extend to all the other RFOs in which the European Union participates, and we hope there will be an increasing number of them.
Our Committee on Fisheries wishes to have prior knowledge of the proposals the Commission is going to make in these fora. We want the Commission to discuss them with us and then put them forward, thereby fully involving the European Parliament in meetings which it is going to continue to participate in - or at least I hope so - as an observer, as it has been doing recently thanks to the code of conduct established between our institutions.
I am not going to dwell on the enormous role which the RFOs are expected to play, on which our committee has already produced several reports.
Please allow me to remind you, in this context, that we are producing an own-initiative report which is closely related to the RFOs: I am referring to the control of illegal fishing in international waters, to the report on ships flying flags of convenience, which is unfortunately also a frequent problem in the fishing grounds for highly migratory fish.
The European Parliament wishes to participate, together with the FAO, in the definition of new notions, which are more precise and more developed, of undeclared and unregulated illegal fishing, of declarations of catches, of inspections at sea and in ports, of prohibitions of landings etc. for this irresponsible form of fishing.
Commissioner, we have therefore also asked to attend the initial control and inspection meetings of the RFOs, and also those on criteria for allocating quotas, since they must be linked to those organisations, so that in the future one of the main criteria for allocation may be the real capacity for compliance with the control and inspection measures which these RFOs implement. It seems neither advisable nor reasonable that a State should increase its catch quotas if it does not have the means necessary for controlling them.
In summary, we are happy with the Commission' s efforts to regroup the broad and diverse regulations referring to highly migratory fish, although these efforts present us with decisions that have already been adopted and which are binding at an international level because no objections have been raised against them. The Commission is, furthermore, only making these efforts in order to achieve greater legal certainty.
However, we would like the European Parliament to participate more actively in the proposals which the Commission must put forward in these fora, communicating them to the Committee on Fisheries beforehand.
Secondly, not only as rapporteur for these reports, but also, above all, in my capacity as current Chairman of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, I must repeat here once again, Commissioner, our committee' s request, ratified by Parliament, for the administrative structure of the Directorate-General for Fisheries to include within its organisation a specific unit to deal with the management of the populations of these highly migratory species.
The many RFOs in existence for these species, and those that may still be created in the future, as well as the importance of the European fleet which fishes for highly migratory fish, plus their high commercial value, which we mentioned earlier, are crying out for greater material and human resources from the Directorate-General for Fisheries and for the creation of a specific unit within it.
Commissioner, if you attended a meeting, either a preparatory working meeting or an annual meeting of one of these RFOs, and saw the resources deployed by other delegations and the resources available to the Community delegation, you would immediately give the order to create such a unit.
In this context and within the reform of the staff organisation of the Directorate-General for Fisheries currently taking place, Parliament therefore repeats its desire that this request be considered.
I would finally like to refer to the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries in relation to the management expenses arising from the European Union' s membership of these RFOs for highly migratory fish.
Our Committee on Fisheries has considered, and it has been taking this line previously, that if the European Union is to have exclusive competence in the field of the common fisheries policy, the international financial commitments acquired by the Commission, in exercising that exclusive competence, must in turn also be met exclusively by the Commission, by means of the Community budget, and not be passed on to the Member States.
To have competence must mean having the financial capacity necessary to confront it.
And a policy described as common - as is the case with the fisheries policy - must fully apply the principle of sufficiency of resources which governs it.
These are the considerations, Commissioner, which I have wished to raise in relation to these two reports for which I have had the honour to be rapporteur.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the most sought-after species of fish in the world are those which are referred to as "highly migratory" , including the commercially important species of tunas and billfishes (swordfish, marlin, sailfish).
Large quantities of these species are caught: in 1997, 3.5 million tonnes of highly migratory species were taken in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans combined.
The European Union was a very active participant in these fisheries throughout the oceans of the world. Vessels flying the flags of different Member States accounted for over 400 000 tonnes in 1997, second only to Japan.
Several regional fisheries organisations have been established to regulate fisheries for these species: the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), covering the eastern tropical Pacific, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC).
The EU belongs to both the ICCAT and the IOTC and has applied for membership of the IATTC.
These international organisations adopt recommendations regarding, among other things, technical measures on minimum size and weight, time and/or area closures, restrictions on certain gear types or fishing practices and limits to the capacity of some fleets.
At present, these measures are scattered throughout a number of regulations.
The sensible aim of the Commission' s proposal is to draw together, in one regulation, all the technical measures relating to highly migratory species.
Some of them have been in effect for many years while others were only adopted by the regional organisations at the most recent meetings held just last autumn, and we have taken these into account in our report.
The simplest and most objective way to evaluate the efficacy of the technical measures is to look at the status of the stocks which they are meant to conserve.
Many, if not most, of the important tuna and billfish stocks in the Atlantic are in bad shape.
According to the 2000 Report of the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) of ICCAT, the spawning stock biomass of bigeye tuna has suffered rapid declines over the past five years and the current levels of fishing cannot be sustained - further declines are anticipated.
Of the major stocks, only skipjack is not thought to be over-exploited.
In summary, management of the tuna and billfish stocks in the Atlantic has been more notable for its failures than its successes and, as the most important fishing power in the region, the European Union must accept its share of the responsibility.
Each of the three ocean areas are experiencing similar problems, which is not surprising considering the high mobility of not only the tuna and billfish but also the fleets which exploit them.
The problem of excessive fishing effort has been noted, and catches of small fish must be monitored in particular.
As regards excessive effort: some form of vessel register is being created in each area as an initial step to limiting capacity.
These are new initiatives, so it is too soon to evaluate their effectiveness, and they will undoubtedly not be enough to have an impact on the extensive overfishing of stocks such as bluefin.
As regards catches of small fish, the ever more popular practice of setting purse seines on FADs, rather than free-swimming schools of tuna, has led to high exploitation of juvenile tuna.
The simple expedient of imposing a minimum landing size has been demonstrated in ICCAT to be totally ineffective.
Limited closed areas and seasons may offer some protection but they have proved difficult to implement.
The IATTC plan for compulsory retention on board may be more useful but that solution is not presently viable in other areas as it is only in the Eastern Pacific that all large seiners have observers.
Finally, unless a way is found to eliminate fishing by vessels flying flags of convenience (FOC), all the other efforts proposed will come to nothing.
In conclusion, I would draw your attention to two other comments which should be made. Firstly, the special attention which should be paid in order to also reduce by-catch, other than that involving juvenile fish, which is often the result of longlining and purse seining.
ICCAT is taking action on this, and other organisations should also be addressing this problem.
The final problem is that of authorising certain countries, which do not currently have quotas, to fish in their exclusive economic zone, their EEZ.
They, quite naturally, wish to be allowed to fish the stocks within their waters, but in that case it would be logical for the European Union to reduce its share of the catch, which it has so far refused to do.
The EU must be more flexible on this question.
Mr President, as we all know, species of highly migratory fish share a series of characteristics which require their fishing to be subject to a particular kind of monitoring.
Their movements, both through exclusive economic zones and through free waters, their current regulation by four regional fishing organisations, their high economic value, which makes them the target of many fleets, and their association with species which are not subject to direct fishing, such as dolphins and marine mammals, explain the fact that even the United Nations has decided to intervene by means of the agreement on highly migratory species.
Therefore, the Commission proposal to group together in a single text the technical measures for the conservation of these species, which have arisen from Community legislation and from the recommendations of the international organisations, is very appropriate and is generally to be applauded.
There is no doubt that a single text will not only be useful to legislators and to the fleet, which will not have to refer to dozens of different regulations in order to find out what their obligations are, but that it will also contribute to finally improving control. It is even possible that a single text will respond to this Parliament' s frequent demand that the recommendations of the regional organisations be incorporated into Community legislation with a speed that we are still far from achieving.
With regard to this proposal, Mr PiÃ©trasanta has produced an excellent report and, furthermore, he has sought to place his trust in the opinions of other MEPs who are already involved in certain issues.
I am referring in this case to the Commission' s peculiar intention to sidestep the ICCAT recommendation to restrict the number of ships authorised to fish long-finned tuna by means of the subtle trick of not including certain so-called 'experimental ships' in the restriction.
When we are eight months away from the final ban on driftnets, when this species has just been subject to a TAC and when the ICCAT' s 1999 scientific report expressly warns against this so-called 'experimental' fishing, the Commission' s intention is quite simply irresponsible, and the tactic of transplanting a recommendation in one paragraph in order to remove its content in the next one is unacceptable.
We know that there is already an internal Council agreement to try to lessen the impact of the ban on driftnets on certain Member States, but this has already been suitably compensated for within the Council by means of quota assignments.
The intention therefore to limit the presence of boats, whether we like it or not, with a fishing tradition in order to open up the ports to new fleets is completely unacceptable and I therefore ask for your full support for the amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries.
Mr President, it only remains for me to thank the rapporteur once again for his collaboration and to congratulate him warmly on his wonderful report.
Mr President, we are talking today about a type of fishing, that of highly migratory fish, which requires the European Commission to maintain a strong international presence.
To the increasing activity which the European Commission must carry out in the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna we can add that which is carried out in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and the activity which is required by its participation in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission.
The Commission' s human resources for this task are altogether insufficient and the sector therefore feels under-represented.
Furthermore, neither the Commission nor the Member States affected are carrying out parallel diplomatic work in the search for allies, since there is a lack of a cross-sector focus and a joint vision in the Union' s external relations, which leaves our fishing sector unprotected, which is not the case with the fleets of other fishing powers.
In the practical field, we pay the price for this when it comes to decision making or reaching agreements, as happened in relation to the lack of scale on swordfish at the last ICCAT meeting.
We therefore wish to see the creation of a specific unit for highly migratory fish in the Directorate-General for Fisheries.
A single text and a single regulation require that we have a single management unit.
In relation to the reports by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and Mr PiÃ©trasanta, I congratulate both rapporteurs on their wonderful work.
The Socialist Group supports the Community meeting all the expenses incurred by the observers, since the representation of the Union in the international fishing organisations falls within its exclusive competence.
We also support the request for greater information on the control and monitoring activities carried out within the regional fishing organisations.
My group also supports the amendments in the report by Mr PiÃ©trasanta, whom I congratulate on his very thorough work, including the Latin corrections.
I believe there are questionable aspects in his explanatory statement, but we share his concern about the presence of ships flying flags of convenience whose operation does not come under any control.
The Community and the RFOs must not hesitate to confront them, because the first to be affected by this type of fishing are the resources and the Community fleet, which complies with the rules of the common fisheries policy.
The Commission must liaise with the sector in order to define the strategy on the management, control and conservation of these highly migratory species.
In our view, the strategy must be based on the defence of the historic rights corresponding to our fleet.
Commissioner, if the Commission wants an easy negotiation, the simplest thing is to agree with the other States, as happens too often, and give in to States which have no fleet or any real interests.
However, the Community fishing sector has created a market which did not exist before and has made great sacrifices in adapting the fleet to the resources available, and therefore before allocating higher quotas to other countries the quotas corresponding to the Community fleet must be respected.
Lastly, we Socialists believe that the Commission must pursue certain imports, mainly those from Indonesia, which are based on dumping.
It is estimated that this type of import, which enter the Community with an export subsidy from Indonesia, amounts to 14 000 tonnes.
First of all I would like to support very much what my colleague Mr PiÃ©trasanta said and say that our group will be voting for the reports by Mr PiÃ©trasanta and Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna.
I only have two points I want to make.
The first concerns the very important amendment tabled by my colleague Mr PiÃ©trasanta in committee.
Stocks of blue and white marlin are severely depleted in the Atlantic and they do need protection.
In 1996 ICAT adopted a resolution saying that the contracting party should promote the use of mono-filament leaders in recreational and long-line fisheries.
This gear helps with the live release of marlin and so can contribute to the conservation of the stocks.
Mr PiÃ©trasanta wanted to strengthen this resolution by saying that the gear should be obligatory rather than just simply encouraged.
After all the stocks need our help.
However, the amendment was defeated as it would have interfered with the catching of sharks by EU industry.
However, there are no international or even European regulations on shark-fishing and these species are also in some cases over-fished.
It is unacceptable to reject measures to conserve depleted species because they would hurt completely unregulated fisheries for other depleted species.
The second point I want to make is in relation to the financial contribution report by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna.
Member States should finance measures, including observer programmes, to monitor their responsibilities.
The Commission has offered to fund half the cost and that is sufficient.
We will be opposing one amendment, but supporting the overall report.
Mr President, Commissioner, as the representative of the Member States the European Union plays a major role in regional fisheries organisations.
Quite rightly, measures agreed on in these organisations are given a place in Community law.
However, in my view, the method followed deserves no beauty prizes.
Parliament is asked, as a kind of rubber stamp, to approve an ordinance that already has a binding character.
Rapporteur Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has, in my view, not understood the Nice Summit.
He believes that the European Union is a superstate, and must shoulder all the costs of deploying observers to monitor the catching of tuna on board ships of Member States.
When the rapporteur lands back with both feet on the territory of the Union, he will have to acknowledge that the Union is a far-reaching collaborative agreement between Member States.
Cofinancing is certainly not a dirty word and does not imply a renationalisation of policy.
It seems to me only common sense that Member States that benefit from the tuna catch should contribute proportionately to the costs.
A cost-benefit analysis for each Member State might be a cause of embarrassment to the rapporteur.
The stocks of fish species that migrate over long distances are in serious danger because of overfishing, the catching of under-sized fish, and by-catches.
Rapporteur PiÃ©trasanta rightly observes that the Union must accept its responsibility for the poor management of these fish stocks.
Precisely because of that, the Commission must take a leading role in managing these fish species.
The danger that more and more ship owners will send their ships to sea under a cheap flag of convenience and so evade the management measures is a real one.
The blacklist with embargoes on importing from countries that pay no attention to management measures agreed within the regional fisheries organisations should be supplemented with a public campaign aimed at informing the public on the methods of fishing, by-catches and the killing of dolphins.
In this way the public will have the opportunity in its purchasing behaviour to opt for best fisheries practice.
Such a campaign would involve one of the major forces in the free-market model, namely the consumer.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that I greatly appreciated the Commission's initiative to combine all the provisions on highly migratory species in a single text, although I agree with Mr PiÃ©trasanta that it would have been preferable to wait for the end of the autumn series of fisheries meetings so as to be able to incorporate the decisions taken at the meetings in the regulation.
With regard to the species described as highly migratory, the total catches have increased significantly.
Indeed, in 1997, 3.5 million tonnes of highly migratory fish were caught in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. As we are quite aware, the European Union is an active participant in these activities of fishing the world's oceans.
Recently, a number of regional organisations have sprung up which aim to regulate the fishing of these species.
These organisations adopt recommendations which provide, amongst other things, for limits to the capacity of some fleets, time and area closures and technical measures on size and weight. If no objections are raised, the recommendations become binding upon the contracting parties.
I would, moreover, add that the regional organisations continue to adopt effective measures to resolve various types of problems, such as those listed above, but it will certainly be difficult for them to resolve a thorny problem which is common to all the areas such as the elimination of fishing by vessels flying flags of convenience.
Hence the need for a joint action of cooperation between the regional fisheries organisations and the national governments, in order to prevent shipowners, who feel overburdened by the regulations in force, from deciding to fly a different flag.
In conclusion, may I draw your attention to and emphasise the fundamental role played by the regional fisheries organisations in this matter where, given the huge scope of the subject and the specific local situations, it would be difficult for the Community institutions to respond adequately to the different requirements, as the regional fisheries organisations are able to do.
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a Council regulation laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species now incorporates measures that were dispersed between various regulations into a single legal framework.
This is therefore a proposal to be welcomed, since it creates more efficient conditions for implementing one of the most important aspects of the common fisheries policy. It is aimed at fish species that are under considerable pressure from fishing due to their great geographical mobility and their high commercial value.
For reasons, however, that I must say are beyond me, the rapporteur has issued an opinion on the Commission' s original proposal and not on the compromise proposal arising from the December meeting of the Fisheries Council, and on which I think it would be more appropriate for Parliament to issue an opinion.
I am not going to repeat aspects that have already been highlighted by the two rapporteurs and, especially, by my colleagues in the PPE-DE. I simply wish to emphasise two important aspects.
The first concerns the issue of disciplinary measures to be imposed on vessels flying flags of convenience.
This is a crucial aspect that we must resolve.
The second aspect is that ships experimenting with new fishing methods must be included in the quotas for their respective fisheries. Lastly, I wish to state that it is becoming necessary for the European Union to fight within the various international bodies for coordinating fisheries management in which it participates so that all of the world' s fishing fleets, especially those of the great fishing powers, fully respect the same rules for conservation that the European Union itself respects.
I think that this is a fundamental point.
Finally, I wish to thank the two rapporteurs for their excellent work and I hope that their reports will be adopted with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs for their comprehensive reports on the three proposals on highly migratory fish stocks.
Fishing of these species has certain characteristics in common, irrespective of where it takes place, which is why we have proposed a coherent package of measures.
Our aim is to implement the recommendations of various international organisations in which the Community is actively working for these resources to be preserved.
Let me start with a few comments on the two regulations, one on control measures and one on technical measures.
We have included both new and existing provisions in these regulations.
As the international tuna fishing organisations are very proactive and decide on new measures every year, we have suggested a fast-track procedure which will allow new measures or changes to existing control and technical measures to be implemented for the Community quickly and efficiently.
I am delighted that Parliament also supports this idea.
As regards the proposed amendments, I should point out that we can accept the first amendment to the regulation on control measures if it is changed, i.e. the Commission proposes that it submit a report on control measures in the Member States to Parliament and the Council every three years.
This would then be coherent with the control regulation which applies to internal fisheries.
The amendments to the regulation on technical measures are acceptable to the Commission in substance, but there is a procedural problem here.
I think it would be better to take account of this problem when the regulation on technical measures is next amended.
That way, the present proposals could be implemented immediately and I would gladly promise to submit a new proposal to implement the most recent measures decided in the international tuna fishing organisations by 1 October 2001, i.e. by 1 October this year.
We shall then consider your amendments in a fitting manner in this proposal.
Which is why, at this point in time, I am unable to accept Amendment Nos 1 to 7, which concern, as stated, the procedural issue and the start date of this proposal.
Amendment Nos 8 and 9 concern technical measures, which we can accept.
Now to the regulation on financial support for the assignment of observers.
This proposal is part of the Commission strategy set out in our communication on regional fisheries organisations.
We want to promote the introduction of a system of observers working on board Community ships in order to guarantee that juveniles, especially tropical tuna juveniles, are protected.
Hence our proposal of financial support.
Now you are calling for the Commission to bear the full cost of this observation system.
I should point out that it is primarily the duty of the Member States to implement Community law, in all areas.
The Commission has not plucked the proposed figure of 50% out of thin air; it is based on past practice or, more specifically, on the 1995 Council resolution on the cofinancing of control measures.
Which is why the Commission cannot, unfortunately, agree to the proposed amendments to the regulation on financial support for observers.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
EC/Equatorial Guinea fisheries agreement
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0044/2001) by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the protocol establishing for the period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 the fishing rights and financial compensation provided for in the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea on fishing off the coast of Equatorial Guinea [COM(2000) 690 - C5-0712/2000 - 2000/0287(CNS)].
The protocol of the fisheries agreement between the Union and Equatorial Guinea expired at the end of last June.
It was therefore decided to extend the protocol by one year and a new protocol was initialled by both parties on 16 June 2000.
This new protocol fixes the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels in the waters of Equatorial Guinea during the period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
The protocol concerns tuna only.
It is important as it will ensure the continuity of Community tuna activities in the Gulf of Guinea.
There has been an uptake of licences by French, Spanish, Portuguese and one Italian vessel.
The current proposal is a result of problems which transpired during the negotiations for the conclusion of a new protocol. The delegation from Equatorial Guinea encountered several difficulties in attending meetings with the Commission.
Although these problems have now been resolved, there was not sufficient time for substantial negotiations to be undertaken.
The current proposal, which I support, will ensure continuity while negotiations for a new protocol are carried out in the course of this year.
The current agreement provides little in the way of serious targeted measures and contains no provisions to ensure their transparent implementation or any assessment of the result.
A project aimed at setting up a proper system for fisheries management in Guinea must be embarked upon, so as to ensure that Atlantic yellow fin tuna and big-eye tuna stocks are not increasingly over-exploited.
An explicit reference to the application of ICAT rules should be included in the text of the next protocol.
I support the Commission' s approach that in future negotiations with third countries, there should be a high percentage of special measures.
This should also be the case with Equatorial Guinea.
As rapporteur, I can support the proposed extension of the protocol for one year.
I would stress the need for greater efforts to ensure that any new protocol is subject to a proper control system and that there is adequate transparency in the operation of the agreement.
I would urge the Commission to bear this in mind during the forthcoming negotiations.
The three amendments which I have tabled are consistent with the points I have just raised and they are also consistent with the traditional approach of this Parliament.
I would like in conclusion to point out that the Council had already adopted this proposal last Monday.
Of course, this is nothing new.
It happens on a regular basis and we all have an opportunity to make it very clear to the Commission in this debate that we do not accept this.
Of course, it has happened time and time again and we must do something to try and control this.
This is something that all of us on the Fisheries Committee regret.
It poses the question as to whether the work carried out in the committee and today' s debate have been a total waste of time.
I would hope not but I would sincerely hope that the Commission and the Council will take on-board the recommendations contained in my report before adopting a more permanent protocol.
Finally I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute and thank the secretariat of the Fisheries Committee for their assistance and also the secretariat in my own group.
Mr President, we can only express our satisfaction at the conclusion of a new fishing protocol with a third country, with which we already enjoy a long history of working together. This protocol guarantees three things of enormous importance: the continuation of the supply of fish and Community employment; the safeguard which is always offered to a fishing region by the presence of fleets which, like the European fleet, are subject to regulations and responsibilities in relation to the control and management of activities, and, naturally, the Community contributions to improving the local fishing sector, contributions which are specifically laid out here.
I therefore ask that you support the three amendments which have been presented by the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries.
However, we do not feel able to vote in favour of Amendment No 4, which insists that the whole cost of the agreement be financed by the shipowners.
Although this is a traditional demand by a political group in this House which has always been rejected, to propose it when another more than controversial protocol has just been concluded, in which the shipowners involved not only do not pay the 25% which is paid in this case, but pay absolutely nothing, is particularly offensive.
Furthermore, in view of the agreements concluded with the countries of the North, it is incomprehensible to read in the explanatory statement that there is a lack of transparency in the agreement with Equatorial Guinea.
To begin with, in this protocol, all the items, including those on cooperation with local fishing, are not only itemised, but are set out to the last penny, something which does not happen in other agreements, where any differentiation between what is financial compensation and what is development aid is non-existent.
We must put an end then to attempts to create more obstacles for certain agreements, which, compared to others, are exemplary in terms of transparency and details, something which the Council agrees with, having called for greater equality of treatment since 1997.
While we are on the subject of agreements, I would like to end by mentioning the Commission' s working programme for this year, whose timetable for the renewal of protocols is incomprehensible.
By way of example, the negotiation with Cape Verde, which has been pending since November of last year, does not even appear in the Commission' s timetable.
And in the majority of cases, the mandates for negotiation that have been planned are contingent on the agreement being concluded, as in the flagrant example of Gabon, an agreement which expires on 30 March and whose mandate for negotiation is planned for the fourth quarter of the year.
Commissioner, I am sorry to say that the least the Commission can do is keep its agenda up to date. Anything less is shameful.
Mr President, the Socialist Group can only support the proposal to extend the fishing agreement between the Community and Equatorial Guinea by one year.
We are also pleased that, according to news reports from two weeks ago, an agreement has been reached to renew the aforementioned agreement between the Community and Equatorial Guinea for three years.
This is a modest agreement, both in terms of fishing opportunities and in terms of financial compensation - since 1994 it has been restricted to tuna-fishing ships - but it is no less important for that.
The previous protocol contained a financial contribution for grants and aid for units for monitoring fishing grounds and for non-industrial fishing.
However, we agree with Mr Gallagher and we share his concern that little or nothing has been done on these inspection and monitoring tasks, so much so that what concerns us most about fishing relations with Equatorial Guinea is that the country may become a flag of convenience as a result of this lack of control, which has already led to sanctions from the ICCAT.
The Commission must call on the Government of Equatorial Guinea to act in accordance with the Convention on Maritime Law and with international law.
We call on the Commission to provide more information on these aspects and to act more diligently in dealing with the authorities of that country so that it may adapt its practices to international law and to the recommendations of the ICCAT. The Member States should also apply these principles in their relations with that country as well as within ACP fora.
The sector too often feels abandoned as a result of the lack of a joint policy.
Ladies and gentlemen, a single musician cannot perform a symphony.
As well as a whole orchestra reading the same score, a conductor is required, and the Commission must show that it has the will to act as the conductor.
And while the Commissioner is present and given that six months after the expiry of the agreement, negotiations with Cape Verde have ground to a halt, could he tell me if this deadlock is caused, as the press says, by differences on fishing opportunities and financial compensation, or by the Government of Cape Verde' s unwillingness to allow the Community to tell it what to do with that funding?
It will be no surprise to anyone that the Greens will vote against this agreement, as we do with all third-country fisheries agreements.
I have one specific question for Commissioner Fischler.
The agreement with Equatorial Guinea concerns tuna, but Equatorial Guinea is a well-known flag of convenience country.
Members of ICAT, including the EU, have agreed to prohibit the importation of big-eye and blue fin tuna from Equatorial Guinea.
I presume that negotiations are already proceeding for the next agreement, as this one expires in June.
Could the EU not use its influence to encourage Equatorial Guinea to cease allowing vessels to use its flag to fish illegally.
The EU is concerned about the growing use of flags of convenience.
This would seem to be a very good opportunity to get one state at least to be more cooperative with international legal norms.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us an agreement of great importance, both for Equatorial Guinea and for various regions in Europe.
To speak of tuna in the North Atlantic, however, necessarily requires us also to take account of the situation in other regions, such as the autonomous region of the Azores, for example, where in 2000, we have just experienced a second year with almost no tuna catches at all.
Our fishing fleet, which comprises around fifty vessels, has been all but grounded for the last two years.
Given these circumstances, we must wonder whether some types of fishing, such as purse seining, may be threatening the sustainability of tuna stocks in the North Atlantic.
On this issue, I would like to know whether the Commission has already conducted any research into offsetting the consequences of this type of fishing.
Secondly, we would also like to know whether the Commission is aware of the crisis spreading throughout the tuna fishing industry in the Azores and Madeira and whether he intends to adopt any measures to combat this.
To conclude, I should also like to highlight the fact that there are tuna fishing methods, such as those using lines and poles, as practised in all of the Micronesian islands, that pose no threat to dolphins and turtles as other, more aggressive methods and techniques do.
I should therefore like to know whether the Commission would be prepared to take this fact into consideration.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gallagher, for his report and for the support which he has given our proposal.
Everyone who referred to the excellent fisheries relations which we have with Equatorial Guinea was quite right.
These relations go back to 1984, when we concluded a framework agreement which is, in fact, a very important agreement for the Community because it opens up tuna fishing to our fleet in the Gulf of Guinea.
The previous protocol to this agreement expired on 30 June last year.
However, negotiations on a new protocol initially broke down, which is why we agreed with Equatorial Guinea that the old protocol should be extended by a year.
Since 1 July last year, the provisions of the protocol have applied provisionally, as it were, without any change to fishing possibilities or financial compensation.
In the meantime, thank God, we have managed - at the beginning of this month - to sign a new protocol for the next three years.
The text of the protocol is currently going through Commission channels and will then be submitted to Parliament and the Council for approval.
As far as the proposed amendments are concerned, I can accept the first two in principle.
Nonetheless, I feel that they do not belong in the text of the regulation, as the forwarding of the required reports and information to Parliament is already regulated under the framework agreement signed by our two institutions on 5 July 2000.
However, the Commission is unable to accept Amendment No 3 because it would contradict the principle applied hitherto, that fisheries protocols are annexes to the framework agreement and that no special authorisation is therefore needed from the Council in order to negotiate an extension.
It goes without saying that the Commission always abides by the Council's guidelines during negotiations as, of course, it did in the present case.
Now to the question raised in connection with Cape Verde.
I do not share the view that there should be any special problem here, because our side and, more importantly, the main Member State affected, rejected what was on offer.
What Cape Verde had in mind was for us to have to land all catches on the Cape Verde Islands.
However as, for various reasons, there is no possibility for exporting from Cape Verde to the Union, it would have made little sense, because then we would have had no access whatsoever to this fish.
I cannot agree with the amendment by Mrs Attwooll and Mr Busk proposing that the shipowners rather than the Community should bear the cost of the agreement with Equatorial Guinea.
If for no other reason than because this is not in keeping with the negotiating guidelines adopted by the Council back in 1980.
The guidelines stipulate that the cost must be borne by the Community and the shipowners jointly, with the shipowners' contribution taking the form of licence fees.
I know that it is very late at night and everyone is very tired but I did ask a specific question of the Commissioner and I think the Commissioner misunderstood me.
The Greens are voting against this agreement, as we do with all third-country agreements.
We are not happy, as you said in your introduction, in relation to the agreement with Equatorial Guinea.
The question is in relation to flags of convenience.
Equatorial Guinea is notorious in relation to that and you did not address the question.
Maybe it is too late tonight, but we would like an answer because you are negotiating, despite the fact that there is an agreement to ban tuna imports and this agreement is very much related to that.
We need a reply.
Maybe it is too late tonight, but it is important.
Mr President, I clearly heard the lady Member state on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that she opposed this sort of agreement in principle.
But I see no reason why I should comment on this principle of the Group of the Greens in my reply.
As for what she said about flags of convenience, the question of this playing a role in the specific context of Equatorial Guinea has not yet been raised - either during preparatory meetings or anywhere else.
But I would be more than happy to have my services investigate and forward a reply to you in due course.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I take great pleasure in conveying a message of thanks to you this morning.
Last week in Prague I had the opportunity of meeting Mr Ivan Pilip, a Member of the Czech Parliament.
Mr Pilip was detained for 26 days in a Cuban jail for having established links with dissidents.
He is now back in the Czech Republic, is in good spirits and thanks the President and also the Members of the European Parliament for their efforts towards his release.
Mr Pilip remarked that the Czech public also felt great satisfaction in the friendship forged for his benefit between the European Parliament and the Czech state and Czech members of parliament.
He is convinced that our intervention in particular played a significant role in securing his release.
I would like to make it clear that I personally played very little part in this process so I am all the more delighted to be able to pass on his thanks.
Thank you, Mr Wuermeling.
Air strikes in Iraq
The next item is the statements by the Council and Commission on air strikes in Iraq.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this opportunity to comment on a topical and important issue.
On Friday 16 February, as we all know, American and British warplanes attacked military targets outside Baghdad.
As we also know, the background to these attacks was said to be an increase in Iraqi anti-aircraft fire aimed at the British and American war planes patrolling what are known as the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq.
The Americans and the British have made statements emphasising that the actions were taken in self-defence, as well as the fact that they were routine and must not be seen as an escalation of, or change to, the policy.
We also know that several countries have been critical of the actions.
The UN Security Council briefly discussed this issue in informal consultations on 20 February when statements were also made reflecting expected positions.
The UN' s Secretary-General has also commented on what happened and said, 'Obviously, the timing is a bit awkward for the talks I am going to have on 26 February' .
That was the Secretary General' s reference to the high-level talks which have just now been concluded between the UN' s Secretary-General and Iraq' s Foreign Minister and which therefore took place last Monday.
The Presidency notes that there are different views within the European Union about the basis in international law for these military actions, including the maintenance of what are called the no-fly zones.
We know that one Member State took part in the actions and that other Member States have complained about what happened.
At the same time, we know that the common foreign and security policy implies a common position.
The common foreign and security policy is being developed gradually at the pace decided by the Member States and will obviously be that much stronger if the EU' s Member States hold a common view.
At the same time, we must respect the fact that there are issues we view differently.
In this connection, I would nonetheless take a positive view of the dialogue embarked upon in New York between the UN' s Secretary-General and the Iraqi Government.
We obviously hope that the talks can help break the deadlock and that Iraq will make up its mind to cooperate with the UN and the UN' s weapons inspectors on the basis of the current Security Council resolutions.
It might also be noted that the American Secretary of State, Colin Powell, has recently come out in favour of an overhaul of the American policy of sanctions.
Mr Powell has also expressed the hope that, within a couple of weeks, the United States might present its ideas on such an overhaul in more detail.
The conditions under which the Iraqi people have to live, together with lasting security and stability in the region, are the most important issues for the Council when it comes to the latter' s policy towards Iraq.
The Council is at present investigating the EU' s opportunities for making humanitarian and cultural contributions, especially to the 'oil for food' programme, within the framework of the UN Security Council' s existing resolutions on Iraq.
It is important for the Iraqi Government to cooperate if it is to be possible to implement such a programme.
Security Council Resolution No 1284, adopted on 17 December 1999, allows for a suspension of the sanctions, provided that the Iraqi Government cooperates fully with the UN' s inspectors responsible for disarmament in Iraq.
The Presidency has just explained the background to the recent air raids.
I do not wish to go over the same ground so let me just say that I agree fully with the assessment of the situation which we have just heard.
I agree very much with the distinction, which I thought was nicely made, between the first efforts to create a common foreign and security policy and the ambition that many have for a single foreign and security policy.
I also agree very much with what was said about the differences between Member States on this issue.
I would like to say a few words about the wider picture. I would like to say a word or two about the sanctions and the efforts to improve the miserable lot of the Iraqi people.
We all agree that the stalemate over the Iraq sanctions and the suffering which that stalemate has caused is extremely unsatisfactory and we should do all that we can to avoid it continuing.
We must bear in mind, however, that the sanctions were put in place originally for a purpose.
As a result of the Gulf War the UN Security Council established through a number of resolutions that Iraq should dispose of all weapons of mass destruction and that this should be verified by UNSCOM, the UN Special Committee with responsibility for dismantling Iraq' s arsenal of weapons and maintaining a monitoring programme to ensure that it was never rebuilt.
Until this was achieved it was agreed that Iraq would be subject to various economic sanctions though exceptions were allowed for essential humanitarian supplies.
Although they could have done it straight away, back in 1991, the Iraqi Government did not take steps to set up an arrangement with the UN before 1995, when Iraq agreed to the 'oil for food' facility as set out in the UN Security Council resolution that year.
The 'oil for food' facility has since then been extended every six months with improved conditions.
In principle the 'oil for food' facility should provide basic humanitarian aid without recourse to outside assistance.
However, the management of the programme and cooperation with the Iraqi Government in implementing it, is not effective.
There is no shortage of funds available to the Iraqi authorities through the 'oil for food' facility to buy food and medicine for their people.
It is the Iraqi regime which has chosen not to do this, not to use the opportunity offered to them by the international community.
The issue of sanctions, worsened of course, when UNSCOM was expelled from Iraq in November 1998 and it took a year to agree to a common approach to deal with this problem.
The UN Security Council adopted Resolution No 1284 in December 1999 which allowed for a suspension of the sanctions against Iraq following arms monitoring.
However Iraq did not accept the resolution and resisted any cooperation on verification of dismantling of weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq has not therefore complied with the UN Security Council resolution, a point made I recall in the European Parliament' s resolution of April last year.
We have now reached an important point in our dealings with Iraq.
The sanctions which have been in place for 10 years have clearly not achieved their desired objectives.
They are perceived to be exacerbating the humanitarian condition of the Iraqi people.
The recklessness of Saddam Hussein and his regime has resulted in malnutrition, ill-health and widespread degradation of the physical and social infrastructure of the country.
This policy will have consequences beyond the present which will be borne by future generations of Iraqis.
These dire circumstances have brought into focus the plight of the Iraqi people and the problem of dealing with a regime which is as ruthless as it is reckless.
We all agree that there is clearly a need to re-think the whole Iraqi issue and to identify the best course of action to take.
The new US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, has said as much.
We must not lose sight of the basic objective.
We must make sure that we will never again give Saddam Hussein the means to pursue aggression against his neighbours, or indeed against his own people.
The sanctions remain in place but we should look at how we could make them more effective in pursuit of the basic objective.
We want to focus on the Iraqi leadership and their weapons, not on the Iraqi people and Iraqi society.
The international community should explore the possibility of replacing the present sanctions regime by, what is called in the jargon, "a smart sanctions programme" and other appropriate measures whilst seeking to ensure that weapons of mass destruction are not manufactured.
The suffering of the Iraqi people is very much a concern of the European Union.
Since the Gulf War in 1991, Europe has been the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq with over EUR 250 million.
For the last two years, the European Union has provided assistance of between EUR 8 and 10 million on an annual basis.
For 2001 the amount may be somewhat higher at around EUR 12 million.
The assistance, through ECHO, focuses on provision of clean drinking water and health facilities, with special emphasis on institutions for the handicapped, for orphans, and with emphasis as well on street children.
The ECHO assistance is provided through international non-governmental organisations and through the appropriate UN agencies.
The Commission welcomes the resumption on February 26 and 27 in New York of the dialogue between the United Nations and Iraq.
Although no significant breakthrough has been reported from the two-day meeting between the UN Secretary-General and the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs, it is encouraging that there is an agreement for further talks.
Signals should be sent to the Iraqi Government of the importance of continuing the talks and of reaching an agreement with the United Nations that allows the improvement of the economic and humanitarian situation in Iraq, while at the same time respecting the various UN resolutions on Iraq, particularly on the question of weapons of mass destruction.
Mr President, beyond the polemic to which these military interventions may have given rise and quite apart from the fact that the allies might have been consulted, I believe that what our debate today is really about is how, on the one hand, to pursue a coherent policy of respect for international law by the international community - and I am thinking here of the twelve resolutions approved by the United Nations Security Council - and, on the other hand, to take account at the same time, as Mr Patten said, of the suffering now being endured by the Iraqi people.
That is the position from which I should like to tackle this problem, but not without first laying a very secure foundation.
I believe it has been wisely said that no-one has caused more suffering to the Iraqi people and Iraqi society than the country' s present regime, and I believe it would be correct to recognise too that no-one has derived as much personal profit from this suffering as the Iraqi regime itself.
From this perspective, I should like to address a number of questions to the Commission and the Council.
Mr Patten has stolen a march upon us this morning by suggesting a line of thought we might pursue concerning the way in which we should proceed, and I should like to ask the Council of Ministers whether it thinks that an embargo is or is not essential in order to achieve the objective - which my political group shares one hundred per cent - of preventing Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
I believe that - as Mr Patten has just explained - the Commission and the European Union as a whole can have a very clear conscience in the sense that we are the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq, but I believe that we should carry out a serious analysis and ponder the results of the 'oil for food' programme, given that many Arab countries believe that the Iraqi authorities are committing fraud to the tune of more than USD 1 000 million per year.
I should also like to ask the Presidency if it thinks that the problems created by the embargo might instead be solved by replacing the system of United Nations sanctions with an international verification committee focusing, as Mr Patten said, upon the flow of cash and arms.
I share the view expressed by the Presidency that the easiest solution of all would be for Saddam Hussein' s regime to apply United Nations Resolution No 1284 which, subject to cooperation with the United Nations, would in fact enable the trade embargo to be suspended for a period of 120 days, subsequently extendable for further periods.
Saddam Hussein' s regime has obviously been defeated without, however, having been destroyed, and I therefore think that to say that these military interventions are the acts of an imperial power against an unprotected people is a rather simplistic interpretation.
That said, I believe it is also legitimate to ask ourselves whether these actions by the international community and this policy of sanctions are really helping to weaken Saddam Hussein' s regime or are instead helping to reinforce it, because everyone knows perfectly well that, in order to consolidate their power, dictatorial regimes of this type invoke the spectre of foreign enemies.
(Applause from the PPE Group)
Mr President, it strikes me as obvious that we all wish to repudiate Saddam Hussein' s detestable regime.
The sooner he disappears, the better things will be.
However, democrats and democratic countries must discuss in a worthwhile manner how to achieve this aim.
Some very legitimate doubts have been expressed as to the timing and even the legal basis of the recent bombings of Iraq.
The United Nations Security Council must make a clear statement on this issue.
The Security Council, rather than one or other of its members, even if they are permanent members, is the only legitimate authority that can determine which coercive steps are to be taken against a country.
The issue remains as to how effective the current economic sanctions are.
It must be acknowledged that the economic sanctions have not destabilised Saddam Hussein, something that Commissioner Patten has indeed just confirmed; they have instead caused the Iraqi people very great harm and suffering.
I also drew this conclusion from a recent hearing on Iraq before our Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy.
I was extremely impressed, particularly by the speech by Mr ViÃ©not, who is the President of Caritas Europa.
He concluded that, to put it briefly, the sanctions are catastrophic from a humanitarian point of view.
Politically speaking, they are ineffective.
Legally, they can be called into question.
Morally speaking, they are intolerable.
I can only hope that this respected Caritas representative will not be let down by the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats in the European Parliament and that the Council of the European Union will, at its level, draw the necessary conclusions from this speech.
Mr President, I visited Kuwait recently where I met a man whose childhood friend has been killed during the assault by Iraq upon Kuwait.
He went out into the street and saw his friend' s body.
When he put his hands down he saw that he was dead.
He found that he was touching almost a piece of jelly.
The Iraqi soldiers had broken every single bone in that man' s body.
When we talk about the Iraqi people let us not forget the 750 or so Kuwaiti prisoners of war still inside Iraqi prisons.
We do not know what has happened to them.
We have to keep looking.
I visited Iran.
I have talked to the families of prisoners who are still in Iraq from the Iran/Iraq war of 1981-1988.
A million people were killed because of Saddam' s assault and predatory efforts inside Iran.
Maybe 25 to 30,000 prisoners from Iran are still inside Iraqi prisons.
Let us not forget those people either.
I have been to Kurdistan.
I have seen the results of the chemical weapons.
Do not let us forget the half million Kurdistani people whose lives have been taken away from them by Baghdad since they were invaded in the north with chemical weapons in August 1988 shortly after Saddam was driven out of Iran.
I have been to the marshlands of Iraq many times, the antique heritage of the world, the marshlands of Mesopotamia.
I have seen year after year the steady drainage, the reduction of the water, and the fact now that over half a million marsh dwellers, reaching right back beyond the beginnings of civilisation of our world, have now had their livelihood, their lives destroyed, their place removed from under their feet by the Iraqi marsh drainage.
And why?
So that Saddam can get his tanks closer to Iran and closer to Kuwait so that he can invade more easily next time.
The no-fly zones have been effective in protecting the lives of at least some of those people but we should do more; we must do more.
It is within our power to restore the marshes of Iraq.
This man is a monster.
When we talk about the no-fly zone, when we talk about the collateral damage, do not let us forget that point.
In 1989, he earned USD 15 billion from oil and he spent 13 billion on arms.
In 1999 he earned USD 16 billion and at least, legally, he could not spend any on arms.
I recommend that we look at taking the food distribution of the "oil for food programme" out of his hands, that we look at tearing down those dams that have wrecked the marshes and that we work to set up a criminal court where he can be tried at least in abstentia.
When we talk of a policy on Iraq, Commissioner Patten spoke about the recklessness of the Iraq regime.
It is not recklessness it is ruthlessness.
This man is indeed a modern Hitler.
(Applause from the centre and the right)
Mr President, according to my group, the bombings which we are debating here are the wrong response to a real problem.
Let us start with the legal basis, which is extremely dubious, to say the least.
My group is in favour of maintaining the no-fly zone, but without a new statement by the Security Council, there is no legal basis for the present air strikes.
The air strikes are wrong because they are counter-productive: Saddam is the hero of the Arab, and also the Palestinian, people, and this will only make it more difficult to find a solution to the Middle East problem.
That does not mean that my group questions the fact that there is a problem or that nothing should be done about it.
We share the view that Saddam still forms the main threat to stability in the Middle East and that Iraq is a country where human rights are being violated systematically and on a massive scale.
I am pleased that Commissioner Patten has already mentioned that he is in favour of changing the current regime.
We could talk at great length about this issue.
After ten years of sanctions, it is not Saddam who has suffered the most, but the Iraqi people.
Saddam has applied extreme cynicism to benefit his own PR at the expense of his own people.
I am therefore pleased that most of you appear to be in favour of changing the sanctions.
The embargo on weapons and strategic goods must remain in place and might even have to be tightened, whilst the current regime must be replaced by what are known as smart sanctions.
However, we must continue to insist on weapon inspectors being admitted.
We should not allow the regime to keep developing biological, chemical and even nuclear facilities.
As the previous speaker has already mentioned, we should not forget Haladja.
The international community must have access to Iraq and be able to control arms development in that country.
Finally, with regard to the action to be undertaken, I would like to urge the Swedish Presidency to implement the resolution of the European Parliament of November last year, which requested an ad-hoc international tribunal to be established for Iraq.
In this way, Europe would be able to play an autonomous role in world politics by exercising a restraining influence on the United States without giving in to the demands of Iraq and Saddam.
It will also be able to exercise a restraining influence on Great Britain which believes that, through its action, it can act as a bridge between America and the European Union but which, at this rate, will be more of a hindrance than anything else.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I was one of the Members who had requested that a debate on the bombings of Baghdad by the United States and Britain be included on the agenda of this sitting.
I did this in the same spirit as when, at the Conference of Presidents, I suggested that Mr von Sponeck be invited to attend the European Parliament. He is the former coordinator of the UN oil for food programme who had the courage to resign from his post in the light of the appalling consequences of the Washington-inspired strategy in Iraq.
My conviction, which is shared by everyone in my group, is that the European Union has everything to lose if it is tentative or indecisive in this matter and everything to gain if it takes a clear stand.
I believe that the latest air raids on Iraq illustrate with startling clarity what is at stake.
I believe that the main thing at stake is our approach to international relations.
These air raids on Baghdad are, in essence, totally illegal, deeply counter-productive and ethically unacceptable, as were the previous raids that have taken place since Operation Desert Fox in 1998, which is recalled with some horror.
They are in direct opposition to the principles that we stand for.
None of the UN resolutions provides for this sort of use of force.
These continued bombings have enabled Saddam to get rid of any international inspection of disarmament measures.
Lastly, whilst Saddam Hussein is continuing to tighten his control on Iraq and his neighbours, most of society, on the other hand, is utterly devastated and is suffering terribly.
This alone should be enough to put the European Union on the offensive so that it can help Iraq escape its shameful, dramatic downward spiral.
If it fails to do this, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership might as well be dead and buried - it has already been heavily compromised.
Secondly, I believe that the nature of relations between Europe and the United States, led by George W. Bush, is also hanging in the balance following this new series of bombings of Baghdad.
Let us remember that Iraq is one of the 'rogue' states, which the US Government uses to justify its antimissile defence programme.
The new US Administration undoubtedly wants to test the vulnerability of the EU by playing the Iraqi card again, in order to quash or, at the very least, to soften Europe' s opposition to the National Missile Defence programme, that irresponsible strategy championed by the White House.
In my view, the third and vital thing to be endangered by the European reaction to the British and US bombings is the credibility of the European project itself.
Basically, this is because it is unusual for one of the leading Member States, one of the pillars of what some call the vanguard or hard core of the future Union, particularly in terms of security and defence, to commit itself instantly to support of Mr Bush.
Today, the political affinity that existed between Mr Blair and Mr Clinton is no longer even applicable.
This can no longer be termed the 'third way' - these actions blatantly overstep the mark.
We have already said this about the Echelon affair.
Nonetheless, at a certain point, choices have to be made.
It is impossible to be in two places at the same time.
What a poor example to give to the leaders of the applicant countries, who are encouraged to make gestures to the more powerful countries rather than to contribute to a common project with their neighbours and partners!
Poland has already given Washington its support, but it is virtually the only country in the world to do so.
Is this what we really want to see as we prepare for enlargement?
That is why, Mr President, although I welcome the odd criticism made here and there in the European Union about the bombings, I believe that we need a much more willing attitude from Europe towards the whole Iraqi issue, which could be achieved by providing, if need be, a kind of enhanced cooperation by most of the Fifteen, including considerable support to the democratic opposition in Iraq and the lifting of the embargo.
Mr President, I share the view of Saddam Hussein expressed in this House.
The Iraqi Government will have to abide by the rule of international law. So too might I suggest should the United States and Britain.
As an admirer of the ancient civilisation of the Iraqi people, I find it hard to accept that the population has been allowed to suffer so much in the economic interests of others and been attacked both from within and without.
First there was the Iran/Iraq war; a war sponsored by the West in the main.
Iraq was given technology and weapons to pursue that war.
US President Reagan was famously quoted as saying about Saddam Hussein "he' s a sonofabitch, but he' s our sonofabitch" .
The technology for chemical weapons flowed to Baghdad.
The Western military/industrial complex had a field day and poured its weapons into Baghdad.
Kuwait encroached on Iraqi oilfields and the US Ambassador gave the Iraqi Government the impression that the US would not object to an invasion.
That was an enormous misinterpretation by the Iraqis and they suffered the consequence.
It was right to impose sanctions in the immediate aftermath of Iraq' s expulsion from Kuwait, but it is certainly not right to continue them in their present form.
It is estimated that 1.5 million people have died since the introduction of sanctions.
The former US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, considered 5,000 children a month as a price worth paying to get rid of Saddam Hussein.
He is still there.
But all those children who have died are not.
What did they know about sanctions?
Sanctions hurt the citizens, as has been said already here.
They do not hurt the elite of the state on which the sanctions are imposed.
The Islamic world is outraged, and rightly so, at the genocidal policies being pursued in Iraq.
They are storing up resentment and even hatred among the people in the Middle East and the Islamic nations throughout the world.
UN sanctions are applied with a ferocity that tears apart the fragile consensus of the region.
It also plays into the hands of Saddam Hussein who has remained unchallenged for the past thirty years.
He is more popular among the Arab people now than ever before.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we should, first of all, thank the Americans and the British for showing such a sense of responsibility.
Mr Wurtz, who believes that we could and should entrust any decision regarding this matter to the Security Council, has, if I may say so, a bit of a nerve.
Since we are aware that two other members of the Security Council, namely the People' s Republic of China and the Russian Federation, are currently supplying arms to Iraq, it is, in my view, irresponsible to say the least, to think that we can take decisions in this context.
However, though we are grateful to the US, we should not let this prevent us from considering a new form of sanctions but we should certainly not lift them.
I believe that these sanctions can be effective, as General Powell himself acknowledged.
I would also like to say that I am astonished that, apart from Mr Wurtz, no one has mentioned American interests today.
Mr Wurtz presented us with an excellent analysis of American interests, which would justify the US strategic defence programme.
Everyone can draw their own conclusions from this.
In other debates, however, we have certainly always attacked the Americans for their underlying economic interests in this region.
Today, I suspect that there are possibly one or two Member States - perhaps one of them is your own, Mr Wurtz - who might have similar interests, the same sort of interests that you most strongly condemn where the US is concerned.
If we wish this discussion to be in any way constructive, I believe that all these issues must be laid out before us.
We must also go back to the heart of the problem, as Mrs Nicholson has done, which is the regime in power - we should have no illusions about this either.
We know how difficult it is to overthrow this sort of regime, how hard it is to introduce a system of sanctions.
After ten years, we have some experience of the sanctions imposed in 1991.
I believe that we must consider a new form of sanctions, but it will be difficult to remove the military element from them, and we will certainly even have to step up the military pressure, as we will certainly have to consider increasing the size of the no-fly zone over Kurdistan.
It is precisely the lack of protection of various Kurdish regions of Kurdistan that has brought about the recent waves of Kurdish immigrants arriving in France.
These no-fly zones must be extended, and so that their protection is guaranteed, we will unfortunately have to use some military means that, currently, only the British and the Americans seem to be able to provide.
We will also have to consider putting more pressure on the People' s Republic of China and on Russia to put an end to their military collaboration with Iraq, but, above all, we will also have to consider a different type of bombing which consists of bombarding Iraq day and night with information, using satellite broadcasting and bombarding the whole country with leaflets, so that the citizens are aware of the international community' s policy but, more importantly, so that they are aware of Saddam Hussein' s policy, which allows him to misappropriate most of the aid that he receives from the oil for food programme.
We must, therefore, have an information policy that provides the Iraqi people with knowledge, so that this regime can finally be overthrown.
Mr President, undermining one' s own political authority is always a bad thing.
If this is done in front of a ruthless enemy, it can have disastrous implications.
I would like to outline my view on the divided European reaction to the recent American/British action against Saddam Hussein' s regime in Iraq.
With regard to their Iraq policy, the EU Member States deserve criticism on three critical points.
To begin with, how can the CFSP' s goal be reconciled with the disturbing lack of consensus in the most recent Iraq crisis?
I fully share the opinion of the German commentator who noted last week: 'A European foreign policy?
How wide the gulf between ambition and reality still is has been demonstrated in the way the EU' s Fifteen handled the most recent Iraq air attack: the Brits joined in, the Germans ran for cover and the French launched a verbal attack on Washington.'
And who had the last laugh?
Saddam Hussein, of course!
It is exactly this Iraqi President who, after two lost Gulf wars, remains the main destabilising factor in the Middle East.
After all, Saddam is forever fanning the flames of the unholy conflict in Palestine/Israel, the very region, incidentally, where the European Union claims to be making efforts to resume the peace process.
How do the Council and Commission reconcile this ambitious goal with the conflicting European signals which are being sent out in the direction of Baghdad, where a self-confessed opponent to the same peace process is continuously stirring up Arab sentiment and is even threatening to destroy the Jewish state?
I would like to conclude with my third, and probably most fundamental, criticism of the divided European policy on Iraq.
Saddam Hussein is being backed by the EU in his efforts to erode the UN resolutions on Iraq.
And what is at stake? The risky revitalisation of Mesopotamia no less.
Instead of reminding Saddam' s regime of the crucial arrangement whereby the UN would supervise the dismantling of his weapons of mass-destruction, including production capacity, in exchange for the lifting of the sanctions, the Europeans, the Russians and the Chinese have chosen to enter into a pact with a despot who has turned his country into an aggressor externally and a republic of terror internally.
I therefore urgently call on the Council and Commission, in proper consultation with the Bush administration, to arrive at a consistent European policy on Iraq.
Mr President, I want to comment on, and try to answer, a number of the questions put during the preliminary part of this debate.
Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra put a number of questions to the Council, for example concerning the sanctions.
I believe it is extremely important that we should have a common view of the purpose behind the international community' s action against Iraq.
The purpose is to make Iraq comply with those instructions and commitments that are mainly to be found in Resolution No 687, which is of course the major and basic resolution governing the international community' s relations with Iraq.
It is there that our demands upon Iraq are stated.
Those demands do not, for example, include any change to the government in Iraq - that is a matter for the Iraqi people - but Resolution No 687 states very clearly what is required if it is going to be possible to lift the sanctions against Iraq.
That is the basis for our entire discussion.
Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra went on to raise a number of very relevant questions about whether we need an embargo against Iraq and about whether consideration might be given to changing the sanctions regime currently imposed upon that country.
Issues he mentioned included those relating to an international verification committee and to the currency flow.
Within the framework of the reforms being worked on by the UN Security Council, there is intensive discussion of the effectiveness of sanctions as a tool.
The European Union is actively participating in that discussion.
These are difficult issues.
For example, the issue is being discussed of whether time-limited sanctions ought to be introduced so that, right from the time that sanctions are first imposed, it is determined when and under which conditions they are to be lifted.
As was mentioned here in the debate, the issue is also being discussed of whether what are called smart sanctions should be introduced which, by being more specific and more clearly directed against those whom they are intended to affect, would be aimed at minimising the suffering of the civilian population.
I believe it is important that the European Union should actively participate in that discussion.
I also believe it is important that Parliament should contribute to this important discussion about how we get the world to comply more readily with international law.
Mr Lagendijk addresses the issue of bringing Saddam Hussein before an international tribunal.
Clearly, this may appear to be an attractive idea in itself, in view of what that man has done.
I would say once again, however, that I believe it is important that any action against Iraq should be taken within the framework of the UN' s resolutions.
To act outside that framework would, I believe, damage all of our common efforts in the long run.
These efforts - and on this issue I can see that this House is completely unified - are aimed at ensuring that we get an Iraq which can again be incorporated into the international community.
That is, unfortunately, impossible with the current regime.
I note what Mr Lagendijk has to say about the European Parliament' s resolutions from last autumn.
They are important.
They also serve as an important guide for subsequent actions on the part of the Council.
I look forward to a continued exchange of views as to how we can strengthen international law even where Iraq is concerned.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that the bombing of military targets in Iraq has once again shown the continued extent to which the European Union and in particular, the Council of Ministers have no voice in the matter of foreign and security policy.
We must also point out that the way in which the United Nations operates, whereby actions are only implemented when the Security Council has reached an appropriate decision, would mean that, in order for UN resolutions to be executed and implemented against a regime like that of Saddam Hussein, dictatorships such as China would have to give their consent in each individual case. As a result, it becomes impossible to take action against dictators such as Hussein.
Therefore, it is not right that the Security Council should decide in each individual case. Rather, cases should be handled in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.
I believe that it is imperative to make a distinction in this regard.
We all agree that Saddam Hussein is a mass-murderer who is carrying out a renewed rearmament programme in nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, that it is in the interests of the safety of the European Union and the world to prevent this, that this also lies within the framework of the UN resolutions and that, at the same time, the protection of minorities in southern or northern Iraq also falls within the remit of these resolutions.
Action against military targets must therefore be permitted, particularly since aerial inspections are otherwise impossible due to the risk presented to the aircraft themselves.
However, a great debate is raging in the region which may ultimately culminate in the elevation of Saddam Hussein, a prolific violator of human rights in this region, to hero status in the Arab world.
Therefore any military action must take this situation into account and consequently it is also necessary to weigh up the situation; what can be done on the one hand to benefit the civilian population, to promote their survival and to ensure the provision of medical supplies and food, and what can be done, on the other hand, to ensure the fight against this regime.
For this reason, Colin Powell' s proposal that there should be modified types of sanctions should be welcomed.
I believe that we should constructively and actively participate in defining these.
This must involve using every instrument to destabilise Saddam Hussein' s regime.
At the same time, however, we need to make a distinction in this regard so that the burden is not borne solely by innocent people in Iraq.
For this reason, that is for humanitarian reasons, we should attempt to adjust our actions, but at the same time to use these as an instrument to conduct the PR battle currently underway in this area and designed to promote our interests in enforcing international law, democracy and human rights in this region.
I believe that we must put this policy into action in such a way so as to enable Iraqi people to move away from the threat of Saddam Hussein' s regime and into the free world and also in such a way as to prevent Saddam Hussein from becoming a hero of the Arab world.
In this respect, therefore, I feel that a heavy military operation against Saddam' s military installations and the curbing of the rearmament programme is the correct path to take. At the same time, however, I feel that the Iraqi people should be given the chance to survive.
Mr President, the European Union is often divided on the issue of foreign policy.
This observation is made repeatedly and Iraq is further proof of it.
Yet, everyone in Europe is united in condemning Saddam Hussein' s regime.
Past experience has taught us that embargoes or blockades never work.
The evidence of this can be seen in Baghdad, where the current regime is strengthened with each passing day, where each air strike is shown to have no effect other than to divide Europe somewhat further.
Whilst Saddam Hussein may have cause for celebration, the Iraqi population, his people, are sinking further each time into crisis and poverty.
Hospitals can no longer provide care.
The number of deaths is rising at an alarming rate.
Schools can no longer remain open.
Most of the population is illiterate.
Finding food is an achievement.
Access to information is controlled.
In short, everything is done for, apart from Saddam Hussein.
So, let us admit it, the current measures are unsuitable; the air strikes are excessive, given the situation in Iraq - they change nothing and still solve nothing, here or elsewhere.
We need to change the content of some UN sanctions now, if we are to help the people of Iraq.
They need to be clarified and included in a timetable specifying when they can be lifted and that is as soon as we see that, under UN control, the Iraqi regime is respecting its commitments.
Humanitarian aid should be encouraged, cultural and commercial exchanges should be developed, freedom of circulation for people and, thus, for ideas should be re-established, access to information should be restored, as these are all ways which could lead the Iraqi people down the path to freedom.
For the time being, however, the Iraqi people can only consider how they are to survive against the West, who they hold accountable for all their problems, because of what they witness but mainly because they are manipulated.
Nowadays, we can no longer make peace by waging war.
The Iron Curtain and the Berlin wall were brought down by information provided by the international community and the consequent need for freedom.
Let us put an end to the isolation instead of continuing with the blockades.
Our principles of freedom and democracy will cross frontiers all the better when conditions conducive to dialogue are restored.
Let us move in this direction.
The Iraqi people will then be able to find the path to freedom.
Mr President, actions such as we are debating today must be underpinned by democratic legitimacy.
I am sure that we all agree.
The problem is how to do it.
At the moment the CFSP is a mixture of national attitudes and European attitudes and the particular subject we are debating today of course only involves one single Member State of the European Union.
So how do we provide the democratic legitimacy when we are all involved?
Two or three weeks ago there was a Conference in Stockholm of the chairmen of the defence committees of the fifteen national parliaments and the European Parliament to debate exactly this question - how to exercise democratic control over European policies and foreign affairs and defence.
Although no conclusion could be reached in a single day, I can tell you that they have set up a working party between the chairmen and intend to meet again and to come up with a conclusion.
This Parliament has proposed various mechanisms for introducing this legitimacy.
We have proposed setting up an interparliamentary body between members of the NATO Assembly and our Foreign Affairs Committee.
Another proposal has been a joint interparliamentary body between national parliaments and Members of this Parliament.
I very much welcomed the statement just now from the President-in-Office saying that this Parliament must play a role.
But what I would greatly appreciate from the Presidency is a statement of how precisely they plan to do this, because in the various treaties we have had recently and the European Councils, there has been no suggestion of how this might be achieved.
Mr President, Saddam Hussein is, without doubt, the very picture of a repulsive dictator, but he is a repulsive dictator who consolidated his power at a time when he was a close ally of Europe and the United States, when the revolution was building in Iran, and we would do well to remember that because there is a great deal of hypocrisy flying around.

There is hypocrisy flying around today; various members are crowing away, calling for every kind of embargo on Iraq, which tried to occupy part of Kuwait ten years ago and was forced to retreat in the face of military intervention by the West. The very same members who are passionately in favour of extending the European Union to Turkey, which occupied part of the Republic of Cyprus 25 years ago and continues to occupy it 25 years later.
It is disgraceful.
It is quite disgraceful.
People listen to us, journalists watch our every move.
It is disgraceful, having two sets of standards, two yardsticks.
I think that lifting sanctions, with the exception of military sanctions, would help us to deal with the problem of Iraq.
Mr President, after listening to this debate this morning, it seems to me that there is one thing that can be said that we all more or less agree on in this House, and it is this: the system of sanctions in its current form is not working; it is leaking like a sieve - the Americans themselves have said it is as full of holes as a Swiss cheese - and so it needs changing because it has not achieved the objectives for which it was set up.
Changing, but certainly not abolishing; there are also reasons for abolishing it, according to Mr Salafranca, but abolishing the sanctions against Saddam Hussein today would mean declaring him the winner in his own country and throughout the Arab world and holding him up as the victor in this psychological war, just at this sensitive time in the war between Israel and the Palestinians, and this would make his dictatorship even more permanent and even more brutal.
So we ask ourselves: what of the children, the people who are suffering in Iraq; what is happening to them?
They, Mr President, are victims of Saddam Hussein and not of the sanctions, as Commissioner Patten said rather more diplomatically, and I fully agree with his analysis.
They are the victims of a despot who - and I refer to Kofi Annan' s denunciation - deliberately withholds millions of dollars earned from oil and does not spend it on food and medicines, in order to starve his people and, as is happening here today, to arouse our sympathies and our solidarity and to transform every child that dies into a propaganda weapon; a despot who exports food from his own hunger-stricken country to neighbouring states to increase his prestige, who finances the Palestinians, who go to demonstrations with his portrait, who gives ten thousand dollars to every family that has had victims in the Intifada, who builds himself huge palaces - I saw them with my own eyes when I was in Iraq a month ago - right on the ruins of Babylon.
Iraq is the victim of Saddam, not of the sanctions.
But the sanctions must be changed; agreement on them is weakening and Saddam Hussein is taking advantage of the divergences of opinion in the West on this point; he is taking advantage in order to split the West even more.
The economic sanctions must be eased but those on arms and technology must be tightened, at least until Iraq allows the UN inspectors free access.
Iraq is in fact rearming with chemical, biological and probably even nuclear weapons, and the danger it poses is becoming greater all the time.
This latest air raid on Baghdad should, in fact, have been better prepared, with an attempt to gain consent from neighbouring countries and perhaps also consultation of the Western allies.
However, it was a useful signal, I think, to make Saddam Hussein understand that, even with the new American administration, the vigilance will be maintained and, we hope, even increased, and I would even go so far as to say that we can already see the first fruits of this action.
In connection with this, I should like to direct a question to the President-in-Office of the Council: do you know whether, during the current mission in the Middle East, Colin Powell obtained Syria' s agreement to United Nations control on the use of the oil pipeline linking Iraq to Syria?
Mr President, in addition to being an evil perpetrated against the civilian population, the sanctions may, if maintained over a long period, turn into a harmful political tool and rebound upon those who impose them.
Now, Colin Powell says that the US administration is considering a system of sanctions which will hit the Iraqi regime rather than the Iraqi people.
These last few days have nonetheless served as a reminder that this is precisely what President Bush senior said ten years ago when the theory was floated that, thanks to the sanctions, the tyrant of Baghdad would be overthrown by his own people.
With a few exceptions, the Arab states nowadays share the position of those countries that are more concerned about the risk of extending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict than about applying sanctions against Iraq, as well as the position of those other countries which wish to resume relations with Baghdad.
And all this exactly coincides with the new Anglo-American bombing.
Frankly, I believe that, with the increasing bombing of Iraq, comes the further radicalisation of what is already radicalised public opinion in both the Arab states and Palestine.
We should also remember that, at the same time, a favour is being done to Saddam who - at least according to a particular conception of morality and politics - is being morally and politically strengthened both within his own country and in the opinion of the majority of Arabs.
This may lead to Arab public opinion' s being characterised by a growing sense that Arabs are enduring a war on two fronts: on the one hand, the United States against Iraq and, on the other hand, Israel against Palestine.
I hope that such public opinion does not believe that there is an Anglo-American war against Iraq.
In conclusion, I should like to say that it is not only in the Arab countries that the West is considered to be responsible for the prolonged suffering of Iraqi children.
Many in the West, including myself, think the same.
Mr President, can I first of all say that I am rather surprised that this debate is entitled air attacks against Iraq.
It should more properly be entitled "How can Saddam Hussein be controlled more effectively?"
What a tragedy for the people of Iraq to have a ruler such as Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator who has exploited the wealth of the country for his own ends and ambitions and oppressed his own people.
Saddam is not just a threat to his own people but to a wider area, including our friends and allies in the Middle East, and potentially our own citizens.
Estimates vary about the success of Iraqi efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems but few analysts doubt Saddam' s determination to acquire such a capability and many expect him to achieve some success within the next four years.
There is then a real and current threat over which some degree of international control is exercised, really by two means: the economic sanctions and the maintenance by Britain and America on behalf of the international community of the no-fly zone covering about a third of the territory of Iraq.
The sanctions are controversial in that Saddam has been able to persuade some significant elements of international opinion that it is sanctions that are the cause of the distress of the Iraqi people rather than his own actions.
Sanctions will be suspended when Saddam complies with certain conditions, primarily in relation to the monitoring of his weapons of mass destruction capacity.
Nevertheless, it is right that the sanctions regime should be reviewed and that they should be focused more precisely.
The main purpose of the no-fly zone is twofold: to prevent Saddam using his helicopter gunships and other aircraft against the Kurds in the north and the Shia marsh Arabs in the south, and to carry out reconnaissance, bearing in mind that there are no UN inspection teams operating in Iraq at the moment.
Ground targets are only engaged if there is a threat to coalition aircraft.
There is no bombing campaign against Iraq.
There is an element in this House which seeks to distort all these facts.
We heard this during the hearing on Iraq the other day in the Foreign Affairs Committee, and there is a subtext of anti-Americanism.
But I am rather reassured by the overall tone of this morning' s debate.
We need to close ranks to ensure that whatever new regime is put in place for sanctions is not breached by those seeking commercial or political advantage.
If EU Member States really have aspirations to play a greater role in security policy, then let them contribute to enforcement of the no-fly zone, and ensure that whatever sanctions regime is imposed is rigorously enforced.
Mr President, we should remind ourselves as Mr Van Orden has done why we have these no-fly zones in the first place.
They are simply to restrict Saddam Hussein' s ability to kill and terrorise his own people.
The no-fly zones are in support of Security Council Resolution No 688 which demanded an end to his brutal repression.
They are justified under international law as a legitimate response to prevent a grave humanitarian crisis.
Without them, we would have seen the continued brutal repression of the Shias and the Kurds.
We would have seen once again as we saw in 1991, the use of helicopter gunships and aircraft to murder, to gas and to displace.
So the no-fly zones are vital in avoiding humanitarian disaster.
Yet those enforcing the no-fly zones have themselves come under constant attack.
Since January 1999 there have been 1 200 attempts to target aircraft with surface-to-air missiles or anti-aircraft weapons.
This year alone, there have already been more attacks than there were in the whole of the year 2000.
The coalition aircraft are legally authorised to respond to these attacks in self-defence, and they have done so entirely in accordance with international law, attacking only those units which are threatening them.
We cannot allow the pilots who are trying to protect humanity to be themselves endangered.
That would be irresponsible, and would also be a betrayal of them.
Finally, on sanctions, we should not forget a simple message: the sanctions are not causing the suffering of the Iraqi people.
Saddam Hussein is causing the suffering, as he has done from the day he came to power, and it is entirely in Saddam Hussein' s hands to lift those sanctions, by meeting the requirements that the UN are making on him.
The debate is closed.
Association agreements
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0049/2001 by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, with a proposal for a recommendation from the European Parliament to the Council on the negotiating mandate for an interregional association agreement with Mercosur [2001/2018(INI)];
A5-0050/2001 by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, with a proposal for a recommendation from the European Parliament to the Council on the negotiating mandate for an association agreement with Chile[2001/2017(INI)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to its own process of consolidation, the European Union has an ever more important role and ever greater influence on the global stage.
As part and parcel of this process of globalisation to include the East, the Mediterranean, North America and Africa, closer relations with other regional blocs are being forged.
The agreement, which was recently reached with Mexico and to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr CastaÃ±eda, attached considerable importance is a move in this direction.
According to Mr CastaÃ±eda, this agreement, whereby his country is able to rely upon a positive input from Parliament and the European Union, will act as a kind of stimulus to Mexico to improve the conditions under which people live.
Within Latin America, special importance is attached to the Association Agreement with Mercosur - an agreement modelled on the Treaty of Rome as a response to the process of globalisation and as a means of improving Mercosur' s relations with North America.
This process began in 1995 and was made concrete in the Declaration from the First Summit between the Heads of State and Government of Latin America and the Caribbean and the European Union, held in RÃ­o de Janeiro from 25 to 29 June 1999.
Since then, meetings with organised civil society have also been taking place.
In this connection, it is to be regretted that the European Parliament nonetheless has no part to play in defining the mandate for the negotiation of agreements with third countries. True enough, the agreements give top priority to the commercial sphere and to economic development, but other considerations also have an important role to play: the fight against poverty, the promotion of cooperation and the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law and respect for human rights.
This agreement was conceived as a transitional legal instrument between the third-generation agreements and the more broadly based interregional agreement which, at the same time, covers the political, economic and trade liberalisation dimensions.
The commitment signified by these agreements with Mercosur and Chile is therefore unique.
The directives adopted by the General Affairs Council on 13 September 1999 are effective as from the date of the Summit I have just mentioned.
However, we think that a number of changes need to be made.
Bearing in mind, too, that the European Parliament represents the will of European society, which is not only a commercial and economic society but also a society full of concern for justice, fairness, solidarity, culture and the social dimension, Parliament hopes to use this report to introduce new directives expressly embodying the following requirements.
Firstly, the legal basis of the new agreement should consist of Article 310 (formerly Article 238) of the EC Treaty, together with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 300(2) and the second paragraph of Article 300(3).
It is important to provide the agreement with a legal guarantee and to give expression to the fact that the negotiating parties do in actual fact have a whole legal tradition behind them.
Secondly, it is necessary to include practical mechanisms for the provisions of the future that will enable the objectives proposed by the CFSP - international cooperation and the development of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights - to be based upon the principle of economic and social cohesion and to tend towards reducing imbalances.
Thirdly, the new directives need to be based both upon international conventions - I am thinking of those concerning ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples, as important in Mercosur as in other countries - and upon agreements connected with the International Labour Organisation. In that way, monitoring mechanisms might be established, designed to improve the specific ways in which unions operate and workers are organised and providing not only for joint participation in the UN and other international bodies - something which would lend more importance to this agreement - but also for the existence of explicit mechanisms for dialogue in matters relating to the common European security and defence policy, as recommended recently by the Institute for European-Latin American Relations.
It is also necessary to increase and improve the specific participation of civil society, as well as to examine the conditionality whereby it is assumed that this Agreement has to be subordinate to the World Trade Organisation despite the fact that both the European Union and Mercosur have enough of a solid reputation to reach practical agreements.
It is also necessary to improve relations with other countries and, as far as is applicable, to eliminate the current division of the process into two phases.
In order to achieve this, Parliament must be able to approve this report, which has been adopted unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs following considerable help from the Commission' s Secretariat General.
Mr President, Mr Marset Campos has already discussed the main points and Parliament' s main demands common to both reports.
If I could summarise this debate in just one point, I would say, Commissioner, that Parliament is using these reports to call for the negotiating directives to be revised.
Why should it make such a request?
Firstly, because it is inconceivable that negotiating directives should not mention the legal basis of the agreement.
In the opinion of this Parliament, as Mr Marset Campos has already said, the only possible basis is Article 310 of the Association Agreements.
This Parliament acknowledges that these are 'mixed' because of the subject matter - in which, that is to say, jurisdiction falls both to the Member States and the Community. Parliament nevertheless feels that the division of the negotiating process into two separate phases is discriminatory and should be corrected.
The first of these phases, which has already begun, concerns general trade issues and the second, which will begin on 1 July, concerns negotiations on tariffs and services. I, however, feel that, in practical terms, it would not make a great deal of sense to request the directives to be amended just for this purpose, given the closeness of the date.
What is more serious, Mr President, is the inclusion of a clause making the conclusion of these agreements conditional on the completion of a new round of negotiations at the World Trade Organisation. We are not sure that this round will take place and, if it does, when it will finish.
This condition has not been imposed on any other country or bloc of countries and we in Parliament therefore feel, Commissioner, that this obstacle must be overcome.
Parliament is therefore calling for a review of the current negotiating directives so that this anomaly can be eliminated and overcome.
I should like to hear the Commission' s opinion on this matter, specifically on the connection between the conclusion of these agreements and the completion of the new round of negotiations at the World Trade Organisation.
During the discussion of the report - in the drafting of which, Mr Patten, we enjoyed an excellent working relationship with the services of the Directorate-General for Latin America and those of the Mercosur and Chile division - we heard that one of your colleagues, Mr Lamy, who is responsible for trade relations, did not support the idea of revising the negotiating directives unless the Council accepted the idea first.
Since this agreement is an agreement of political association, economic association and cooperation, which includes trade liberalisation, but in which political will must, and I think does, prevail, I should like to hear what impression the Commissioner responsible has of the political momentum of these negotiations.
I wish to add, Commissioner, that if this aspect of the political dialogue is to have any credibility, there is one essential requirement which must be respected: that of adapting our discourse to the reality of cooperation and of turning words into action so that we move beyond simply rhetorical declarations.
Latin America needs support and opportunities, not handouts, and trade relations provide an excellent opportunity to use action to demonstrate political will.
With a view to the forthcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government of the European Union and Latin America, I would like these negotiations with Chile and Mercosur to have reached a sufficiently advanced stage and, if possible, to be concluded.
I know that Chile and Mercosur are different cases and I wish to publicly request that each of these sets of negotiations be conducted on its own merits, something we requested in the reports that are to be voted on this morning. This must be done, however, with the aim of ensuring that the negotiations have reached an advanced stage or have been concluded with a view to this Summit, for which we must provide ample material over the next six months.
The European Parliament feels, and has expressed this view on numerous occasions, that the commitments given at the Madrid Summit and these agreements are an urgent imperative and a mark of the European Union' s renewed belief in Latin America.
The comments that I have just made about trade apply just as much to cooperation, because even if we acknowledge the size of the contribution we have made to the region, which in absolute terms adds up to a sizeable amount, we feel that there is, to some extent, a degree of unjustified discrimination against the subcontinent compared with the treatment of other parts of the world.
I do not think that we can address new priorities with the same resources: the priorities designated by these agreements, such as the renewal of the agreements with the Andean Pact and with Central America and the priorities arising from the Rio Summit.
At this time, therefore, before the budget is drafted and presented, and although I understand that the pressures on our budget are great on the eve of the introduction of the euro, I would ask the Commissioner responsible to give an indication, to give a sign different to the one given in last year' s draft budget for the region, with the aim of making the forthcoming Madrid Summit more productive.
Mr President, in Parliament, one of the two branches of budgetary authority, we too are fully aware of the difficulties involved in this exercise, but although in recent budgetary debates we have been able to show that the European Parliament remains supportive of Latin America, it is my view, and I repeat, that significant progress must be made on these agreements.
Lastly, I wish to conclude by expressing my thanks to Mr Patten' s staff for their cooperation in drafting this report, for the exemplary working relationship we have enjoyed with our colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, as Mr Marset Campos stated, and also for the support provided by the services of this House.
Mr President, the two rapporteurs have already mentioned the essential points.
Many thanks to both of them for their detailed explanation, first here in the House and secondly in their reports.
The association agreements with Chile and also of course with Mercosur are valued highly by the European Union.
Therefore we support the Commission in its negotiations and also regret of course that the European Parliament is not yet formally involved in the definition of negotiating mandates.
Turning to the matter in hand itself, and I speak now on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we feel that the free trade area which we wish to establish with both Chile and Mercosur must conform to WTO rules.
Secondly, we do not want to damage the regional economic and trade relations between Chile and her neighbouring countries but rather to encourage these relations.
This is a matter of urgency, a point also emphasised by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra.
We do not want to wait until the round of WTO negotiations has been concluded.
Let me remind you as well that the new Bush administration in America has already announced its intention to make the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) a main focus of its external relations.
