As the name suggests, natural disasters are unpredictable and hence carry a very high risk, although it is sometimes the case that such disasters do not occur for many years.
This risk is borne by both the large insurance undertakings and the numerous smaller ones. It is particularly high in the field of agriculture, as the large quantity of farms means that a huge number of insurance policies are taken out.
Finally, I should like to say that even though I believe that any form of regulation would improve matters, many of the issues I would have liked to have seen covered in this proposal for a directive are unfortunately missing from it.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I wish to begin by apologising to Mr Skinner and other MEPs for being unavoidably delayed due to traffic congestion and a Competitiveness Council meeting in Luxembourg.
However, I was here for the speeches.
I am very pleased to inform you that the Commission can fully accept all the amendments in the report adopted by the committee.
The amendments take account of the discussions in the Council and are also strongly supported by the insurance industry.
The solutions proposed are, furthermore, well balanced and respect the Commissionâs initial intentions with this legislation.
Mr Skinner also raised the issue of collateralisation.
Collateralisation is highly costly for reinsurance companies, as it restricts the investment strategy.
This ultimately leads to more expensive reinsurance services, which could increase insurance premiums for policyholders.
The EU insurance industry would particularly like to see the American collateralisation system abolished or amended.
I have had discussions recently with my United States counterparts with a view to eliminating or reducing the US collateralisation requirement and those discussions are ongoing.
I congratulate the committee and the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for their excellent work and thank all those who helped to ensure that the work was done speedily and effectively.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I wonder whether the Commissioner is aware that there is a possible draft model law for states in the United States, which has been drafted for the legislators.
What I would be very willing to do, if you have not seen it, is to pass it on to you.
I think at the moment they surely are at their weakest position.
It is something that comes from the strength of this report and it is worth pressing this point with the Commissioner, to make sure that we have full agreement across the floor so that a Commissioner and Parliament will be pressing most strongly to push the Americans further into the corner and see whether or not we can get the agreement from them that we really deserve.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am having difficulties in that regard, although I have had discussions with people in the insurance industry.
On my recent trip to the United States I raised the issue with some of the insurance commissioners.
As the honourable Member will well know, one â though not the only âdifficulty with this issue is that in the United States each state has responsibility for that particular area.
At least in the Member States of the European Union you can go to one regulatory supervisor in the Member State, you can go to the European Union for this particular directive; but in the United States each state has responsibility in this area and each state appoints its own insurance commissioners.
It was believed that great strides had been made in recent years and the insurance industry on this side of the Atlantic had been working very hard and thought they had reached an understanding of how things would move forward.
But then it all broke down, because the insurance commissioners change on a pretty regular basis in the United States.
So one can appreciate the difficulties.
During my recent trip to the United States in April, I raised this matter and now the talks are ongoing again.
But I would like to underline the difficulties, which are mostly related to the issue to which I have just referred.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0145/2005) by MrsÂ Schierhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (COM(2004)0490) â C6-0181/2004 â 2004/0161(CNS)).
Â Â  .
Mr President, at the outset let me apologise for my fellow Commissioner, Mrs Fischer Boel.
She has been delayed, but will be here before the end of the debate.
I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Schierhuber and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all their work on this report.
The committee adopted the report with 129 amendments.
I shall comment only on some of the major points.
Some amendments reduced the minimum percentages of funding for the three axes, maintained the proposed funding for LEADER and eliminated the reserve for this approach.
This should give more flexibility to the programming priorities of the Member States.
I understand this need and I also welcome the fact that the European Parliament agrees on the need for minimum percentages.
This is crucial if we want to ensure balanced programmes that address the wide variety of challenges in rural areas.
The Commission is prepared to accept the reduction of the minimum percentages.
However, I consider that the reduction for Axis 3 â quality of life and diversification of the rural economy â from 15 to 8% is too large, and would affect negatively the necessary balance between the axes, i.e. Amendments 17, 43, 44, 115, 117 and 118.
Please do not forget that measures under Axis 3, if used correctly, could contribute significantly to promoting economic growth and job creation in rural areas.
This is clearly in the interests of our farmers and their families and is closely linked to what we want to achieve under the Lisbon Strategy.
Other amendments bring together the strategic and operational planning and reduce reporting procedures to two reports for the whole financial period â Amendments 34 to 41.
I am sceptical on the first point, since the strategy would precede the operational planning.
However, I am prepared to compromise on a reduced frequency of the strategic monitoring, biannual instead of annual.
I would stress that robust reporting is essential for accountability and for explaining to Europe's citizens the contribution of our policy to agriculture and rural areas.
I can in principle accept the main amendments to Axis 1 â Amendments 54, 63, 65 (in part), 66 and 67.
They concern the extension of support for young farmers to subsidised loans, the requirement that forest management plans be a function of the size of the holding, the extension of support to minimum- sized enterprises for the processing and marketing of agricultural products (in the forestry sector, however, the support will remain limited to micro-enterprises), the inclusion of reparcelling among eligible support for infrastructures, focussing predominantly on operations aimed at improving competitiveness, support for the cooperation between actors in the food chain and for the transfer of knowledge.
I come now to Axis 2, which concerns Amendments 73, 79 and parts of 69, 76 and 81.
The Commission is in principle prepared to accept or partially accept amendments on: the inclusion of the conservation of genetic diversity, the inclusion of payments linked to the Water Framework Directive, not to consider the requirements for pesticide and fertiliser use as additional to mandatory requirements but as part of them, a more flexible approach towards the duration of agri-environmental commitments, the eligibility of high nature value areas among non-productive investments, and the inclusion of loss of income criteria for Natura 2000 payments in forestry.
Finally, some of the proposed amendments are difficult to accept for various reasons.
A number of them go beyond the scope of the Commission's proposal and existing norms, thus risking diluting their policy effects.
Others make unnecessary specifications which are already included in more general concepts.
In conclusion, I can accept or partially accept some of the fundamental amendments proposed in your report.
The other amendments I cannot accept.
I wish to thank the Members of the European Parliament again for their positive and constructive contribution to European rural policy.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking in return the Commission, all the members of the Committee, all the Groups, and especially the Council, the secretariats, all their staff and all those who helped them do the groundwork, for working together so well.
It was good to produce this report together.
Over half the population of the European Union lives in rural areas, which account for around 90% of its territory.
We all want to make the regions with their towns and villages active and attractive and to keep them that way and give rural areas a bright future â I am very pleased to see you have now arrived, Commissioner â and a flourishing and above all productive agriculture and forestry is the most important prerequisite for this.
The 2003 reform of the common agricultural policy introduced lasting changes in European agriculture and forestry.
Rural development has assumed even greater importance as this reform has progressed.
This report contains the 2007â2013 programming period for rural development.
I was particularly concerned to keep to the timetable for the vote here in plenary so that the Council and Commission can have a dossier available before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency.
Farmers need the security to plan ahead.
This is the first major programming for agriculture in the EU of 25.
Rural development is important for all Member States, but for the new States in particular.
It is particularly important in relation to the Financial Perspective for the period commencing 2007.
May I remind you that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development tabled a total of 342 amendments, the Committee on Regional Development 75 and the Committee on Budgets one, so it is something of an achievement that we now have only 130 of them.
The fact is that we need this sort of interdisciplinary cooperation and we need willingness to cooperate in rural areas.
There is much that is positive about the Commission proposal: the combination of financial instruments into a single fund, simplification for greater ease of understanding and much more besides.
Also the three axes structure and the Leader approach.
We reached three major compromises in our deliberations in the Committee on Agriculture.
The first is the weighting of the axes, the second is Leader and the third is cofinancing as proposed by the Commission.
We concluded that in order to preserve subsidiarity it is important to reduce the appropriations for the axes, that is 10, 20 and 8.
For Leader we see a minimum appropriation of 7%, but we want the Leader reserve deleted.
It is also important that Parliament will be sending the Council and Commission an important political signal if a majority in this House adopts this.
I was always concerned that this report should cover both northern and southern regions, both eastern and western.
This report also clearly acknowledges that the CAP reformâs modulation releases money that should be used primarily for Axes 1 and 2.
I know that the Commissioner agrees with me on the need for support for young farmers.
Our future generations are at stake and I hope that you, Commissioner, will be able to agree to Parliamentâs estimate of EUR 55Â 000 per farm.
It is the need for greater competitiveness that prompts us to extend it to small and medium-sized farms and, in forestry, to small and very small enterprises, not to mention, Commissioner, to the less-favoured areas, where we want a study to get a suitable redefinition of less-favoured areas and also to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives.
There is a lot more besides.
We also want more money, because we support NaturaÂ 2000, but that will only work with more resources in rural development.
The Rural Development Programme cannot replace the other programmes, structural funds and the like; we must all be there for the rural areas together.
A productive agriculture and forestry is essential for an active and attractive rural area.
A policy for rural areas is a policy for the entire population in all of Europeâs regions and is the way to ensure they will survive.
Finally, three amendments were tabled for plenary.
I can accept Amendments 130 and 131, but unfortunately not 132.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rural development policy is the most innovative element of the Communityâs new agricultural policy, and it is crucial that the EU budget does not sacrifice this most ambitious of challenges for the future of our rural areas.
Cutting the funds allocated to rural development means taking away resources from food safety, environmental protection, measures to enhance the countryside, product quality and job creation.
The report endorsed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development attaches great importance to support measures for young farmers, who should be encouraged to remain in the countryside and to farm in a competitive and sustainable manner.
MrsÂ Schierhuberâs efforts to maintain funding for rural development are commendable, but reducing the minimum percentages of expenditure on three axes causes misgivings.
It would have been more appropriate to keep the Commissionâs proposal; lowering the rates means allowing Member States more discretion in their management of resources, and consequently a weaker and less incisive EU policy.
In addition, with regard to the LEADER programme, the Commissionâs proposal establishing a reserve fund for countries with lower spending levels, in order to enhance and reward the best projects, should be kept.
It is crucial, moreover, that the national action plans should be consistent with the Communityâs strategic objectives, and the strengthening of partnerships is an essential tool in fulfilling these objectives.
Finally, in order to transform rural development into a genuine territorial policy, the policy must be consistent with, and integrated with, all of the other Community policies.
It involves fundamental elements of the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategy, which we cannot abandon if we hope to revive Europe, its objectives and its values.
Â Â  . Mr President, as has already been said, the Commission's proposal establishes three main priorities: increasing the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sectors, improving the environment and land management, and improving quality of life and promoting agricultural diversification.
I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, on the wonderful work she has done, not only because of the document we are going to vote on during tomorrow's sitting, but also because she has been able to produce a balanced text which fully incorporates the compromises reached in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Furthermore, it makes very significant improvements to the Commission's text that will help to provide more flexibility and make the management of programmes more effective and efficient.
Amongst other improvements, I would like to refer to the reduction of minimum spending percentages for each axis â which I believe to be positive â the possibility of combining national and/or regional programmes, increasing equality between men and women and the appeal to the Member States to facilitate access by women to joint ownership of farms.
With regard specifically to each axis, I would highlight the increase in assistance for the installation of young farmers, which Mrs Schierhuber has just referred to: the EUR 55Â 000 granted in the form of a premium or an interest subsidy of loan and the flexibility to help them to comply with the rules.
I would also stress the extension of assistance to medium-sized companies for marketing and processing, as well as any form of producers association.
In this regard, I believe that it is they, at the end of the day, who are in the best position to provide added value for local products.
I would like to refer to an issue that is of crucial importance: the recovery of the depopulation criterion in the least-favoured areas which, whichever new definition the Commission provides for these regions in the future, must be treated as a priority, because the abandonment of rural areas by their populations is an undeniable sign of their backwardness.
With regard to the funding of NATURA 2000, which Mrs Schierhuber has also referred to, the report calls for an increase in the resources allocated, since the Commission has on several occasions rejected our proposal to provide NATURA 2000 with its own financial instrument.
I would finally like to refer, in axis 3, to the support for the activities of women in rural areas.
I believe that this is a fundamental element to which we must dedicate all of our efforts and that we must provide many guarantees in order to ensure that women are fully incorporated.
I also wished to refer to the rural development measures, to the LEADER approach as a whole, which is going to be enhanced by this Regulation, because it helps to make the European Union visible to the citizens and at this point in time visibility is something that we must not diminish.
The thing that surprised me in particular about the French ânoâ was the fact that 70% of French farmers had voted against the draft European Constitution.
We have the obligation to correct the situation and I believe that this report makes a good contribution in this regard.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, MrsÂ Schierhuber has produced an excellent report on the EUâs new regulation relating to the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.
I also wish to express my sincerest thanks for the constructive cooperation shown by the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development.
The main focus of the EUâs agricultural policy is moving in the direction of rural development, as direct subsidies and market measures have been strictly confined to the framework of the Brussels compromise, as it is known.
The intention is to cut direct aid and market measures by around 5% every year, which is an annual saving of EUR 1.5 billion as far as the EAFRD is concerned.
In all, more than 11 billion a year has been set aside for rural development in the EUâs future financial frameworks.
The need, however, is a desperate one.
The Commission proposed that measures should be targeted at three policies: the improved competitiveness of agriculture and forestry, land management, or enhancement of the countryside and the environment, and the diversification of the rural economy and enhancement of the quality of life in rural areas.
The Commission proposed that a certain minimum amount of financing should be allocated to each policy.
The committee reduced these threshold amounts to the lowest value possible, because Member States have to be guaranteed sufficient flexibility in order to draw up their own individual programmes.
The central task of the EAFRD is to improve preconditions for agricultural competitiveness in different parts of the EU.
For this reason, the development of the Least Favoured Areas scheme, for example, is more relevant than ever, as aid under the common agricultural policy mainly focuses on the EUâs best farming regions.
In the same way, the importance of environmental aid for agriculture is growing, as environmental issues become more and more relevant to the present time.
The purpose of the EAFRD is to improve the opportunities that rural life can offer.
That is why my group believes that aid measures should be targeted specifically at private individuals and the organisations they establish, not the state.
Furthermore, financial support for business should focus specifically on micro and small enterprises.
With these comments, we give our heartfelt support to the adoption of MrsÂ Schierhuberâs report.
Â Â  . â Mr President, in the successive reforms of the common agricultural policy, which have had terrible consequences for family farming and for small and medium-sized holdings, one of the most recent and most worrying developments of which is the untying of production aid, the Commission has repeatedly overlooked the importance of agriculture in ensuring a settled population and economic and social cohesion in rural regions.
It has also paid no attention and offered no support to the so-called cohesion countries, in which people are deserting the countryside in increasing numbers.
The budget proposal tabled by the Commission for the new Rural Development Fund within the framework of the financial perspective for 2007-2013 is woefully inadequate, for example in the way it takes substantial amounts from this fund to finance the Natura 2000 network.
It is particularly important to Portuguese farming and farmers that the budget for AxisÂ 1 and for agricultural and forestry production, covering uncultivated land and their representative organisations, be increased.
Community funding for Natura 2000 must be based on the corresponding much-needed increase in financing within the framework of the financial perspective for 2007-2013, as part of the Rural Development Fund and the Structural Funds, which ought to be the main sources of financing, or as part of the LIFE+ programme.
In other words, the most appropriate solution would be to set up a specific Community fund in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective for Natura 2000, thereby promoting the protection of biodiversity, as we did in the proposal that we tabled in the Committee on Agriculture.
We object to the Commissionâs plan to lay the groundwork for entities that have nothing to do with the rural world to be able to receive support that ought to be earmarked for farming, production and the rural world â in other words, for agricultural and forestry production and for farming as a whole â encompassing a huge and complex range of entities that can apply for funds within the framework of rural development.
We should like to stress once again that genuine streamlining and limiting of the maximum payment per farmer in the common agricultural policy will help not only to redistribute the aid more fairly among the Member States, farmers and farms, but also to increase support to the market for small and medium sized farmers and the amounts available for rural development, in particular for compensation payments and support for organic farming.
Â Â  .
Mr President, in rural Ireland, family farming is the basis of community life.
Through successive anti-farming policies, we are seeing a dismantling of Irish family farming and, as a result, of our rural communities.
Everyone wants rural development, but in the context of beleaguered Irish farming, the only rural development I welcome is one that supports family farming, while enriching rural communities with complementary social, educational, transport and employment projects and infrastructure.
But, looking at this rural development plan, which seeks to promote the complementary activities, while reducing and taking money from the primary activity â family farming â I can only say the plan is crazy, and in the Irish context, will destroy the very rural communities it purports to enrich.
Instead, let us return to a bit of sanity, where we understand the value of farming, where farmers farm and are rewarded for their labours by a fair price for their produce.
Farming is one of the oldest, most basic and most essential activities.
In Ireland we seem to think that all the so-called âbetter jobsâ are the future and unwisely we starve out family farming.
We are mad.
We need both.
Let us have the high-tech jobs, let us even bring the software development company to the rural area, but let us have cows, sugar beet, and furrows of maize and orchards of apples in the fields around it.
Then we will have a future.
Â Â  .
Mr President, in the explanatory statement, the rapporteur states that over half of the population of the 25 Member States of the European Union live in rural areas, which account for 90% of EU territory.
Agriculture and forestry are the cornerstones of land use and the management of natural resources, and they serve at the same time as the basis for economic diversification there.
I am in total agreement with the rapporteur.
However, I would add that in my country, Ireland, small and medium-sized family farms are the very backbone of Irish society.
Down the years they have given us security of basic food supplies, they have contributed to protecting the environment, and they have promoted rural interests.
I would add that one in eleven people in the workforce in Ireland is employed in the agricultural sector.
I would add that the agri-food sector is a vital player in the Irish economy, accounting for 8% of gross domestic product and furthermore that 7% of Irish exports, and about one fifth of Irelandâs net foreign earnings, come from traded goods from Irish agriculture.
Also I want to emphasise that in 2004 Irish agricultural exports exceeded EURÂ 7Â billion.
In a word, agriculture in Ireland is a vital national interest.
Continued rural development in my country is therefore vital.
On the key issue of funding of the agricultural fund for European development, I have some misgivings, because unless there is unanimous agreement in Council on the financial prospectus for the period 2007 to 2013, this whole project could find itself in limbo land.
In view of recent developments, notably the massive rejection of the Constitutional Treaty by the French farming community, who, it must be said, have been one of the main beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy down the years, perhaps the Commissioner could tell us if, in the event that there is no rapid agreement on future financing, there will be a âplan Bâ for rural development
Only last week the Agriculture Council adopted conclusions on the European Union forestry action policy.
The Council of Ministers acknowledged, inter alia, that the economic, ecological and social relevance of the forest sector in the EU and the contribution that forest and forestry can provide to the Lisbon objectives of sustainable economic growth and competitiveness, as well as to the GÃ¶teborg objectives of safeguarding the quantity and quality of the national resource base.
Consequently I do not support the Commissionâs approach to forestry in its rural development programme.
Its proposed premium period of ten years is far too short and its proposed grant rate is too low.
In fact the Commission proposals represent a reduction on existing grant rates.
Can we not do better?
Because we need to do much better than this.
Contradictory approaches are almost impossible to explain to the non-initiated general public, and, in my opinion, completely undermine our collective credibility.
Finally, let me record my opposition to the proposed minimum expenditure levels in the Commissionâs proposal.
I believe that they are contrary to the principle of subsidiarity.
I believe that they do not take account of flexibility to respond to diverse rural needs.
In fact I would prefer no prescribed minimums at all.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a time of unprecedented change in agriculture.
Agriculture in my constituency of Northern Ireland still remains our most significant industry.
Therefore it is vital that the rural development regulation aids, rather than aggravates, our situation.
This funding must not be prioritised unfairly to the new Member States, with gross disadvantage to the EU-15.
âWe pay, they spendâ simply will not do.
Indeed, I believe the allocation of rural funding should bear some proportionality to the budgetary contributions of Member States.
I want to see Axis I, in particular, accentuated, not diminished, with money actually getting to farmers, not being hijacked into government departments.
Rather, money from Axis I should be ring-fenced and targeted to the agricultural community, which is directly involved in farming.
Remember that it is the farmers who, through a whopping 9.5% modulation from the single farm payment in 2006, are going to be key funders.
I also want to see maximum regional flexibility permitted within the regulation.
Flexibility, minimum regulation and a belief that farming and rural development are allies, not alternatives are, in my opinion, the way to proceed.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by warmly thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber.
She has done a great piece of work with this report, which seeks to strike a balance between many different interests, all of which have something to be said for them.
Sixty per cent of the population and 90% of the territory of the EU.
These two figures really do bring home the importance of rural development as the second pillar of the European Unionâs agricultural policy.
The EU population can be content only if the rural population is content.
In the light of recent political developments and the failed referendum, we must not only be more aware of the need for acceptance of European policy, it must quite definitely be to the fore everywhere.
In view of the empty coffers and the fighting over distribution, I must also point out that, historically, the EU budget was an agricultural budget.
The policy areas that were added later must not be allowed to overshadow this historic core of Europe.
That is why there are also calls for rural development funds, which are part of agricultural funding, to remain primarily with farmers in projects related to farming.
I therefore expressly support Mrs Schierhuberâs proposed financial appropriations for all three main axes.
It is very important that the support available for very small enterprises should also be extended to medium-sized undertakings in rural areas.
We must also join the rapporteur in calling for Natura 2000, financing for which has still not been settled, not to be funded out of second pillar resources but out of additional money.
At this point I would like once again to extend my sincere thanks to Mrs Schierhuber and to everyone else who has worked so hard on this important report.
In the light of the above points, this report has earned our support.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the echo of the 'no' to the European Constitution from two nations which, possibly for different reasons, voted against it, is particularly loud in plenary of the European Parliament.
It is a fact that it has created insecurity among citizens as to what is going on within these walls â in other words, as to how the Community institutions take decisions â and insecurity as to the continuation and stability of European social, economic and development policies.
One of the policies which does not guarantee a stable, long-term economic and business framework is the CAP.
The common agricultural policy is being amended and reformed not mainly as a result of the need to resolve its inherent problems but, above all, due to outside pressure, such as that being exerted by the World Trade Organisation, bilateral trade agreements and the financial perspectives of the European Union.
An effort is being made, through the financial perspectives in particular, to express new renationalisation trends in the European Union, by reducing the Community budget and renationalising the financing of Community policies such as the CAP.
Although this policy is criticised for having created financially privileged farmers in certain areas of the European Union, instead of discussing the question of the redistribution of Community resources in order to reduce these blatant discrepancies, its cofinancing is being promoted, which will exacerbate these discrepancies.
If rural development is to strengthen the rural economy and keep pace with sustainable regional development, it needs resources and integrated planning.
The resources proposed by the Commission and in the Presidency's compromise proposals will not result in a stronger rural development policy, which will give new opportunities and will introduce innovations so that the rural sector can approach the Lisbon targets.
The reclassification of disadvantaged regions, excluding the criterion of employment, makes a sitting target of the Commission, which appears to be taking decisions solely on the basis of technocratic criteria, such as soil composition.
No account is taken of the real problems of the countryside, which has been struck by rising unemployment.
The duration of development programmes should be seven years, in accordance also with the implementation of the CAP, in order to give producers and the food industries a constant timeframe.
I absolutely agree with the comments and proposals in Mrs Schierhuber's excellent report.
The 'no' vote in the two recent referenda cannot take us backwards; it must convince us to say 'yes' to the major structural development policies for a Europe of cohesion and solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to add my thanks to Mrs Schierhuber for the enthusiasm with which she has, as usual, presented her report.
I too am in favour of maintaining a liveable countryside in Europe, and I can therefore endorse the Commissionâs three objectives.
However, I fail to appreciate why the Commission has to prescribe that a certain percentage must be used for one objective and another percentage for another objective, and so on for the whole of Europe.
Certainly after the referendum in the Netherlands and perhaps that in France as well â to which, indeed, a few people have already referred â it is necessary to keep rules from Brussels to an absolute minimum.
We are quite capable of deciding for ourselves and the Commission can establish afterwards whether the funds were spent wisely or not.
With regard to the report in general, there are a few too many gifts for the different regions for my liking.
There is no disadvantaged region in Europe that has not been mentioned.
We could well end up with a lack of funds for the ordinary regions in Europe, which have countryside of their own.
I do not think that the amendment that argues in favour of an increase in the total sum for rural policy has any realistic changes, but, fortunately, a has been added to say that that is conditional on the outcome of the vote on the report on the Financial Perspectives.
I should also like to stand up for sound quality policy in Europe.
Certainly if liberalisation is on the increase, and we prescribe entirely different conditions for the rest of the world, it is unfair to expect European farmers to compete freely.
Someone who sells to us will need to do so under our conditions, but those conditions will need to be known and that is where European quality policy comes in.
I should like to welcome Agnes Schierhuberâs report on the Commissionâs proposal for the EAFRD.
I endorse the view expressed in her report, which sees the Commissionâs proposal as positive, but in need of some specific improvements.
I welcome the Commissionâs proposals that aim to enhance the environment and the countryside through support for land management.
Equally important is the aim of enhancing the quality of life in rural areas and promoting diversification of economic activities, through measures targeting farm sector and rural actors.
I also welcome the fact that through the establishment of a single rural development fund, bureaucracy and duplication are reduced.
I welcome the proposals in Mrs Schierhuberâs report to promote equality of opportunity and the participation of women in farming and in the wider rural economy.
Support for organic farming is also important.
The Commissionâs proposed budget of EURÂ 88.75 billion for 2007-2013 at 2004 prices was also welcome.
We would still face considerable problems even with this amount.
It is vital that such funds are used to meet the objectives of improving the quality of life of our family farming communities and the protection of our rural environment.
There is a need for the aims and objectives of Natura 2000 to be mainstreamed into all aspects of EU agricultural and rural development policy and funding.
Farmers, foresters and other land managers should be appropriately supported for protecting and maintaining Natura 2000 sites.
Resources should be put into the fund for the 2007-2013 period that will enable this to happen.
Otherwise, we seriously run the risk of repeating past mistakes.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the field of human activity that we are debating today is a special one, as agriculture amounts to nothing less than the means of our biological existence.
At the same time, however, we all know that agriculture is not only significant in economic terms, but also in social, environmental and cultural terms.
I should therefore like to pay tribute to MrsÂ Schierhuber for the effort she has put into drafting such an excellent report.
We are well aware that the current trend is for more and more of those living in the countryside to have only loose ties with agriculture, with the result being a large overlap between agricultural policy and regional policy.
It therefore needs to be possible to carry out multiple agricultural activities in a rational manner in rural areas, thus ensuring that agricultural products of the highest possible quality can be produced and processed.
At the same time, people living in such areas ought to be guaranteed adequate living conditions.
Further issues that must not be neglected in rural areas include family and social ties and cultural concerns, as well as ecology and tourism.
There are a number of issues to which I should like to alert the House.
The Member States must be aware that adequate funding should also be set aside in national budgets and used solely for rural development.
Secondly, use of EAFRD funding at local level to promote integration or SMEs should be as wide as possible.
My third point is that geographic conditions should be taken into account when distributing funds, for example the unique nature of mountainous or semi-mountainous areas.
Fourthly, serious consideration needs to be given to the education system in the countryside, and to the provision of agricultural advice.
The fifth point I should like to make is that rural areas need infrastructure, or in other words roads, water supplies, sewage systems, telephone lines and Internet access, and that this infrastructure must meet todayâs requirements.
Basic medical care must also be available in these areas, as well as access to cultural and recreational facilities and high-quality education, to reiterate a point I made earlier.
I propose that more funding be set aside to regenerate rural areas.
If it were placed under the control of local communities, such money would certainly not go to waste.
Â Â  Mr President, what we need to do today, I believe, is to send a very clear signal to Europeâs countryside.
Whatever major changes may occur in the market, Europe must remain visible, tangible and recognisable.
What became apparent last week was that âmarket, market, marketâ, in other words money alone, does not bring Europe any closer or touch the hearts of the people.
There is more to it: a social dimension and a liveable countryside.
That is why it is such a splendid thing that this programme is so broad-based and that the Committee on the Regions, on which I had the privilege of sitting, has adopted amendments which making explicit provision for regional and local involvement and, at the same time, for an integrated approach.
Not only agriculture, but also natural landscape and tourist activities play their part in this development, and we must actively encourage new features, such as Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for the sake of business innovation.
Switching to different functions in the countryside will definitely have an impact in the sort of rural and urban areas that we have in the Netherlands, where plenty of proposals are ready to be tabled in order to make changes by engaging in reconstruction in rural areas.
These include achieving the Gothenburg and Lisbon objectives, maintaining strong agriculture, and, not least, all the innovation that is possible in processing right down the food chain.
I should like to endorse Mr Maatâs earlier suggestion that more flexibility be tolerated between the columns and also in the subsidy percentages.
Finally, Europe is currently being haunted by the spectre of renationalisation.
It is already rearing its head as a reaction to common European policy, but will be even more prominent in 2013 when the next financial battle will be fought.
I am opposed to it on the grounds that it leads to less Europe, less recognisability and less closeness to those people in the countryside, a large majority of whom, while looking to Europe, have said ânoâ to the Constitution.
Not because that is not what they want, but because there is uncertainty in the policy, and that would be counterproductive.
Â Â  I can only congratulate Mrs Schierhuber on her work.
She has prepared an excellent report that would provide an excellent conceptual framework for the distribution of rural development resources, if there were actually any resources to distribute.
Compared with the Commissionâs proposed allocation of 88 billion euros, the most recent negotiating framework, submitted by the Luxembourg Presidency, proposes a drastic reduction to a mere 73-75 billion euros for the period 2007-2013.
This reduction is a very major one for all Member States, but it is particularly disadvantageous to the new Member States, given that we believed this allocation would offset the discriminatory Copenhagen agreements, as indeed was also promised by Mrs Fischer Boel at her hearing.
I know that this does not depend on her.
In the light of the discriminatory direct payments system, this discriminatory payments system will mean that, over seven years, agricultural support per farmer in the old Member States will amount to 48 000 euros, while in the new Member States it will be just 14 000 euros per farmer.
In other words, farmers in the old Member States will receive three times more over seven years in direct payments and rural development funds than farmers in the new Member States.
If this reduction does indeed go ahead, please do not let it affect the resources going to the new Member States.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I welcome, as MrsÂ Schierhuber does in her report, the creation of a single fund to finance the rural development policy and stronger strategic guidelines.
With regard to the allocation of funds for 2007-2013, I find it regrettable that the financial perspectives propose a reduction in resources.
It is also regrettable that the proposal for a regulation no longer provides a period of grace for young farmers, as was the case during the 2000-2006 programme.
That is why I support a return to the previous instrument.
One solution, when compliance with standards requires investment, could be to allow a period of five years after setting up for this investment.
During this period, young farmers could continue to benefit from investment aid and would not be penalised for failing to comply with the standards clearly identified in the agricultural development plan.
Finally, as I am convinced that rural areas are becoming more and more attractive, I have presented some amendments that aim to make this regulation more favourable to rural development, particularly by adding impetus to its non-agricultural component, including craft trades and micro-enterprises.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this excellent report and congratulate the rapporteur.
Rural development is going to make a very important contribution to the future of rural society.
The rural community has been under increasing pressure to survive.
I believe that when you remove the farmer and his family from rural society, it begins to disintegrate.
We have already seen what happens: schools, churches and post offices close and people move away from the countryside to the towns.
I know things must change and I know we have to be prepared for that change, but it has to be for the better.
We do not want to see further disintegration.
I believe that the Leader programme has in the main been successful and it should be developed to achieve more at local level.
There is no magic wand that we can wave to bring about a magic solution.
But the one thing we do need for the second pillar of the rural economy is money.
When modulation develops to a larger budget, this must be deployed as direct support to secure the future of the small family farm which is the backbone of the rural economy.
We must give hope to young farmers and encourage young people to make farming their future.
The modulation funds must go back to the farmer and must not be thrown away on useless projects that have no hope of surviving.
More encouragement should be given to farming families to develop small and medium-sized enterprises on their holdings.
The bureaucratic planning authorities which, with their dogmatic beliefs, are destroying and depopulating rural society, need to show more understanding.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I congratulate Mrs Schierhuber on her success in putting before us, with conviction and perseverance, indeed with stubbornness, a balanced compromise which the Council will be able to approve before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency.
Since it is a key part of the 2003 CAP reform that agricultural and forestry production should be preserved, especially in what were up until now less-favoured areas, I have argued for retaining the existing definition of less-favoured areas for the time being, with any changes made only on the basis of a comprehensive study.
We cannot simply drop compensation payments in those areas because the current definition no longer applies.
That would be an outright social, economic and ecological disaster for agriculture in my country in particular, because sadly 96% of the agricultural area is of course less-favoured.
I am therefore relieved that my amendments have been accepted.
That is not in farmersâ interests alone; without them, the rural area in which more than 50% of the EUâs total population still live and which makes up 90% of the territory would not exist.
The results of the vote in the French referendum in the rural areas should give pause for thought to all who believe the common agricultural policy is too expensive.
It will be even more expensive to combat poverty and crime in the large conurbations if we drive the rural population into them too.
Support for the countryside and preserving agriculture based on our family farms is money well invested in the European Union.
As my amendments on the subject were not accepted, I must not of course forget to make clear that beekeeping is also farming and that beekeeping, which is very much at risk, also deserves proper support in rural areas.
I hope this will also be borne in mind.
Â Â  Â âÂ MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, without rural development there will be no further agricultural development.
This theory is backed up by economic and environmental arguments, as well as by social arguments, including those relating to demographic issues.
I come from Lubelszczyzna, a region in eastern Poland that is one of the 10Â poorest in the European Union.
The majority of people there live in rural areas and run small farms that cover an average of around eight hectares.
There is an urgent need for these farms to be amalgamated and their lands merged, as farmers often work several dozen different plots.
Instead of receiving assistance, however, to date most of these farmers have been deprived of the opportunity to grow profitable crops, such as flax, hemp and tobacco, and recently even soft fruit.
Direct payments for small farms do not provide any guarantee that the people working there will receive a decent income.
The people living in rural areas are therefore even more worthy of our attention than such matters as the management of these areas and agricultural and forestry production.
This is all the more true because rural areas are very rich in cultural and environmental terms, in spite of being poor in economic terms.
Natural landscapes, local dialects and cultural traditions have been preserved there, as well as the ethical and moral values that European society is so sorely in need of today.
We must ensure that these values remain intact for future generations that will follow us.
People living in poor regions are in need of particular assistance.
It is to be welcomed that the Council regulation on support for rural development by the EAFRD we are discussing also covers such issues as the provision of advice, professional training and tourism, even though it unfortunately does not go far enough in this respect.
It is particularly important that we do not neglect the education of young people.
We must not forget that we will only achieve our desired results if the measures we take are both comprehensive and well â thought out.
Finally, I should like to pay tribute to MrsÂ Schierhuber, who has dealt with a difficult subject and many amendments in an exemplary fashion.
I would offer her my congratulations.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union was confronted with a major challenge following its enlargement to include 10Â new Member States.
We have been debating the new rural development policy for over a year.
The main goal of this policy is to improve living and working conditions for families living in the countryside and to increase the number of new non-agricultural activities covered.
The policy also aims to help restructure and modernise agriculture and to increase agricultural competitiveness, at the same time as protecting the environment.
A solution is needed to the problem of adequate funding for rural areas.
Poland in particular is in urgent need of such funding, as it is suffering from structural problems and very high unemployment.
The new Member States should be excluded from any cuts the EU makes to funding for rural development.
These Member States were told that full direct payments would be phased in over a 10-year period, on the grounds that we were in greater need of funding for rural development, and yet the EU now wishes to curb its spending on the latter.
If the European Commission wishes rural development in the former cohesion countries to bear the brunt of funding cutbacks, it should ensure that this does not take place at the expense of the new Member States.
We can only hope that the introduction of a single funding and programming instrument will make it easier to manage and control the new rural development policy.
State forests, which are home to natural landscapes of exceptional value, should also be eligible for support under the new fund, as otherwise our progress towards the NaturaÂ 2000 objectives could be adversely affected.
Technical assistance should be provided for authorities and local action groups in the new Member States in order to ensure that the LEADER axis can be fully implemented without any problems.
Particular attention should also be paid to the development of human capital.
This is especially true in the case of women and young people, who play a leading role in rural development.
Â Â  The diversity of the landscape in various European countries also dictates a diversity of conditions for work, especially in the agricultural sector.
In this way countries with predominantly hilly landscapes cannot match the yield per hectare of those that have much more favourable conditions for farming.
Nevertheless great harm would be done to each country and landscape from the environmental and strategic aspect, if, owing to the more difficult working conditions, farming and rural development were neglected.
It therefore makes sense to support the proposal of the Committee for Agriculture regarding support for rural development through the assistance of the European Agricultural Fund.
Our fathers and grandfathers worked the land from a need to survive and a love for the land, although the effort they put in was never fully repaid.
And nowadays there are fewer and fewer people who would do this for love, but rather, like those in the commercial or public sectors, they want to earn and create for themselves more favourable working and living conditions.
For this reason I especially support the proposed support for young farmers, with which they will be able to create the basic conditions for continuing their work.
We know from our experiences in Slovenia that if a young farmer takes over a farm, he will usually also modernise it and continue to farm successfully.
If, however, he leaves the farm because he sees no prospects there, he will only rarely come back, since in many cases a living can be earned faster and more easily elsewhere.
However, modern times demand educated farmers, who will know how to get their products into the market economy and will be familiar with legislation, as well as being innovative and environmentally aware.
All of this requires a great deal of knowledge and support on the part of society, the European Union, the state and citizens.
All citizens would like to continue to enjoy healthy food and to live in a beautiful landscape and clean environment.
For this reason, concern for rural development is a task for the whole of society and not just for farming people.
To contribute to this there should be simpler regulations, so that in paying out assistance the intermediaries will not all be earning more than the farmers themselves.
Â Â  Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this thorough and professional work.
This is a worthy continuation of the reform initiated by the previous commissioner, Mr Franz Fischler.
I strongly approve of proposals for both the Commission and Member States to support small and micro-enterprises.
Since the role of these enterprises in the employment rate and development of rural areas is particularly important, the support criteria established by Member States must allow those enterprises preferential access to funding for rural development.
I also endorse the idea of continuing support for young farmers in founding their own companies, by covering the expenses they incur in preparing their business plans.
In addition, I would like to emphasise the need to support private forest owners more effectively, using a new financing system, and to compensate their expenditures in the reproduction and maintenance of forest resources.
Representing Estonia, where forest makes up 50% of the mainland, 40% of that being privately-owned forest, I am aware of these peopleâs concerns.
In financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, a few circumstances should be kept in mind:
Firstly, the European Union must guarantee the financial viability of this regulation; in other words, the funds must make it possible to finance the rural life of both the old and the new Member States.
Secondly, the EUâs budget line for rural development must not be lowered under any circumstances, since that would be at variance with the logic of the common agricultural policy.
I would like to emphasise that the new regulation of rural development expands the selection of measures in the areas of forestry, NATURA and non-agricultural jobs, which necessitates an even more rapid increase in funding.
Lastly, in financing, it is important to make a clear distinction between measures with structural consequences and the measures of other structural funds.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the Commissionâs document and Parliamentâs report set out a great many key proposals for ways in which assistance could be provided to rural areas, and especially to agricultural areas.
I should like to focus on two particular issues that relate to non-agricultural matters.
The first of these is infrastructure, or in other words water, roads, sewage systems and telephone lines, all of which are necessary in order to improve standards of living in rural areas.
The second is education, since people from the countryside must be given the same educational opportunities as those from towns.
Amongst other things, this would help stop the rural exodus.
A new trend has been noted, namely for people to move back to the countryside, but with the sole aim of living close to nature.
It is important for country people to be able to work there in order to fulfil themselves professionally, notably within small and medium-sized enterprises.
People are moving away from the countryside.
The proposal to encourage people to move back there will help maintain a demographic balance and reduce the negative selection process that stems from rural-urban migration.
Communication technologies and new forms of transport mean that a great many people could live and work in rural areas.
IT specialists and SME owners are but two examples.
In order to do so, however, these individuals must be provided with the appropriate conditions, or at least some form of assistance.
If we were to take such action, we would help preserve the tradition of family businesses, and at the same time strengthen family ties.
The latter are of inestimable value for modern-day Europe.
We would also ensure the survival of the values without which Europe, in the shape of the EU, would be unable to function and would lose its .
To sum up, money invested in rural areas will not go to waste.
Europe will profit greatly from such investment in many key respects.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I should like to thank you for the very valuable and constructive contribution you have made with your opinion on the rural development regulation.
I am convinced that your concerns, particularly substantial on the first and second axes, have helped us to understand better the key issues that are important to the European citizens whom you represent in this Parliament.
I should like to comment on a few of the issues raised here tonight.
First of all, the minimum spending rates, which several Members mentioned.
The Commission is open to a balance between axes, leaving more margin to the Member States.
However, the proposed rate of 8% for Axis 3, compared to the 15% proposed by the Commission, is too little.
Please do not forget that measures under Axis 3, if used correctly, can contribute significantly to promoting economic growth and job creation in rural areas.
This is clearly in the interest of farmers and their families and it is closely linked to what we want to achieve under the Lisbon Strategy.
Someone mentioned the need for Members to be allowed to prioritise rural development funds on the third axis.
They have plenty of room to do this with the minimum rates that we have proposed.
But we also need to ensure that Member States have a minimum of balance so that they address the variety of challenges in rural areas.
Regarding young farmers: they need to have the business plan.
Apart from agri-environment, the Commission is not willing to make other measures compulsory.
If there is a real problem for young farmers in a Member State, the national strategy should address it and propose the appropriate measures.
On the other hand, the business plans should not be over prescriptive at this stage.
If needed, additional provisions can be included in the implementing regulations.
As Commissioner McCreevy already mentioned, we also accept the extension of support for young farmers to subsidise loans.
I also noted your comments on the grace period for young farmers concerning the minimum standards.
Let me be very clear on this: there cannot be a blank cheque for young farmers.
In principle, they have to comply with cross-compliant standards just as other farmers have to do.
However, I am prepared to consider one exception to this principle: when a young farmer takes over a farm that has problems in meeting one standard or another, he can identify this deficit in his business plan and provide for the action needed to address the problems.
In this case, it would make sense to give him some time to adapt and during this period we would not penalise him for non-compliance with the standards concerned.
On less-favoured areas, you asked me to look at the inclusion of socio-economic criteria and phasing-out periods for areas that have lost their status.
The Commission proposed a change as regards the present intermediate less-favoured areas.
Mountain areas and specific less-favoured areas remain as they are today.
Member States are requested to confirm or to modify their current delimination in their programmes.
But for the intermediate less-favoured areas, there is an agreement that we need to change the approach in the light of the criticism from the European Court of Auditors, which is also shared by this Parliament.
The Commission recognises that more time is needed for this work and that we need to review the criteria we have proposed so far.
Let us, however, keep in mind that the criteria we use have to be objective to the WTO to be able to fit into the green box.
In this context, a phasing-out period for the existing intermediate less-favoured areas can be considered.
In 2008, the Commission will present to Parliament and to the Council a report accompanied by a proposal in view of an entry into force in 2010.
You also suggested we bring the co-financing rate for the outermost regions and the Greek islands up to 85%, as is proposed in the cohesion policy regulation.
Please let me explain why we proposed a slightly different approach.
Firstly, like you, I believe that the co-financing rates for these regions should be higher.
This is why we proposed a co-financing rate that is actually 5% higher for each axis.
However, it is good to maintain a certain differentiation between the axes to express the importance that we attach to the second and the fourth.
The cohesion policy proposal does not distinguish between axes and, therefore, has no such differentiation.
In addition, we offer in our proposal a number of specific advantages to operators in the outermost regions.
Such specific advantages do not exist under the cohesion policy.
Some of you mentioned modulation money to be targeted only against the first and the second axis.
This is not possible, because once the modulation amounts are made available they are part of the programming as a whole and should be allocated based on needs identified in the national strategic programmes.
On Natura 2000, we have to strike a delicate balance.
Rural development funds can, and should, contribute, but they can never be the only source of funding to solve this problem.
It is very important for me to underline that there must be other sources so that rural development is not the only banker.
I believe that with our new regulation, including the improvements made by the European Parliament, we will have a solid basis for our rural development in future.
However, we also need the money, which many of you have mentioned tonight.
The financial perspective will be the moment of truth.
I hope I can count on your support to make it possible to maintain as much money as possible in this very important area.
I thank you once again for your excellent work.
I heard Mr Mulder say that the rapporteur had given a vintage performance. I completely agree.
It has been a pleasure for me to cooperate with the members of the Committee on Agriculture.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I would really like to thank you very much for what you have said.
I think it shows that we have moved very much closer in the essential things that are important to us all.
I think what you said about the less-favoured areas, small and medium-sized enterprises and young farmers in particular was very good.
If modulation must be applied to all axes, then we must also pay close attention to the level of their appropriations.
Again, Commissioner, my sincere thanks to you and your staff for your support.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  . Mr President, today is an important day.
This global debate once again places the European Parliament at the forefront of the fight against terrorism.
We are a political House and this is a political debate on the measures to be taken by Europe to defend human rights and beat terrorism, and it is a debate that is also intended to provide lessons in democracy.
We are convinced that, in order to be effective in the fight against terrorism, Europe must have a common policy in this area as well, in order to go beyond the increasingly close and effective cooperation amongst the countries of the Union â of which Spain and France are a good example â and between the Union and third countries; a policy that responds to the concerns of the citizens and that can be promoted as a model throughout the world.
Beating terrorism requires, firstly, a belief in the supremacy of democracy.
Beating terrorism requires that we be prepared to use all the instruments of the rule of law, all of them, but no more than those that the rule of law allows us.
Beating terrorism requires that we combat impunity and deprive terrorist action of any legitimacy.
Beating terrorism requires that we keep the memory of its victims alive in our hearts.
Terrorism, ladies and gentlemen, is a form of totalitarianism, of fanaticism.
Terrorism seeks to destroy free and plural societies.
Terrorism is incompatible with democracy.
I would therefore state that only a strong, vigorous and committed democracy will be able to beat it.
This House has been at the forefront in this field on more than one occasion.
On 6 September 2001, just days before the attack on the Twin Towers, two recommendations were adopted here: the arrest warrant and the common definition of the crime of terrorism, which were able to be adopted by the Council in December of that same year thanks to the fact that we, the European Parliament, had done our work on time.
It is true that there are some countries of the Union that have yet to transpose them into their legislation and there are others that have not done so adequately.
The report for which I am rapporteur therefore calls for an urgent evaluation, but these two decisions are an example of the extent to which the European citizens need a Parliament that is able to be at the forefront of political decisions.
Europe is a model of democracy and respect for human rights.
That is our vocation, that is the purpose of our political union.
We therefore combat terrorism in order to defend and promote democracy and in order to guarantee respect for human rights, because we know that terrorism is the enemy of democracy.
We therefore propose a European policy to combat terrorism in order to guarantee respect for collective and individual human rights, the right to life, freedom of expression, freedom of movement, ideological freedom and religious freedom: a European policy that combats terrorism in order to make collective security compatible with individual freedom and dignity.
I am not going to bore you with the details of every recommendation in the report.
They are all pioneering, but they are all possible.
They only require political will and they are all necessary.
They range from enhancing the role of the European anti-terrorism coordinator to promoting the creation of the post of European public prosecutor.
I would like to highlight the recommendation that we institutionalise a European recognition of the victims of terrorism.
Also politically significant is our commitment to promote an international definition of the crime of terrorism, something which is increasingly necessary if we want, as proposed by Kofi Annan in the Madrid Agenda, these crimes to be pursued and punished throughout the world.
I would finally like to draw attention to a truly ambitious recommendation: the request that the Member States not allow terrorist crimes to be time-barred, thereby reflecting the reprobation of the international community, which considers them to be some of the most serious and inadmissible crimes against humanity.
I will end, ladies and gentlemen, by saying that I know that this is a small step that we are taking today, but it is an important step.
And I am proud of having contributed to placing the European Parliament once again at the forefront of the fight against the impunity of criminals and at the forefront of the defence of human rights.
I would like to thank all of my fellow Members, and all of the political groups, for their contributions to this long debate.
Thanks to all of them, this House is going to propose proactive initiatives to the Council that will change the dynamic of the past.
This series of initiatives is aimed at drawing up a European policy that is capable of preventing terrorism as far as possible.
As a Socialist, as a Basque, as a Spaniard and as a European, I am proud that this Parliament is once again acknowledging the memory of the victims of terrorism.
The President of the Spanish Government, JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero, reiterated his commitment last Saturday at a Civil Guard diploma ceremony, where he stated that all of the victims will remain in our memories forever.
For every democrat, that commitment, to remember the victims, must make societies such as the ones which the terrorists pursue through their crimes impossible.
Europe knows about totalitarianism and it knows about the importance of keeping memories alive in order to prevent history from being repeated.
Primo Levi explained it very well in a magnificent book: âTo understand is impossible, but to know is necessary and to remember is a dutyâ.
Â Â  âI should like to welcome our former colleague, Mr De Vries, who is following the debate from the Council benches.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Commissioner Frattini and the Councilâs coordinator of the fight against terrorism, Mr Gijs de Vries, for being here this morning.
I would also like to thank all the MEPs who have worked and cooperated, sometimes on the basis of discrepancies and sometimes on the basis of agreement, on this report on the prevention of and response to terrorist attacks and I would like in particular to thank my good friends Rosa DÃ­ez and Antoine Duquesne for their cooperation and their contributions to this report.
In the few minutes available to me I would like to be very concise and in particular to summarise the reasons and objectives that have inspired me to present this report in the European Parliament today.
What have I wanted to contribute today in this House by means of this report?
Simply the little I have been able to learn, my limited and modest experience of what fighting a terrorist organisation has meant, for more than twenty-five years, in my country, Spain, and in the Basque Country.
I therefore believe that the most important thing today is to turn the European Union's traditional approach to combating terrorism, which has usually been by means of an exhaustive list of measures, into what I believe must be a European political project.
You may ask me what the difference is between an exhaustive list of measures and a political project.
A political project is much more ambitious than a list of measures.
A political project is always the result of a priority, of an emphasis and, above all, of an appropriate and correct mindset.
And a political project, above all, has the capacity to be summed up and understood simultaneously by a public opinion that appreciates the efforts of a politician to turn that list of measures into a political project.
Allow me to point out that the recent results in Europe confirm to us that we need a limited number of political projects, because there cannot be infinite political projects.
We must have just a few political projects, which are understood by the European citizens and able to tackle their problems.
And I believe that one of them is unquestionably terrorism.
Terrorism cannot be fought in a generalised fashion.
The security forces cannot take on the correct mindset if we are fighting terrorism in a generalised fashion.
We must combat a particular type of terrorism, a particular organisation.
It is true that it must always be fought on the basis of the same principles of freedom, of respect for human rights, of the ideas upon which Europe is based, but in each case we must be able to create a particular concrete political project, and we must always be able to specify, determine and measure the organisation being fought; amongst other reasons, as I said before, because that is the only way to stimulate the security forces to put every possible effort into combating a particular organisation.
What is a terrorist organisationâs main ally?
Its dispersed nature: we never know where it begins and ends; we do not know what social structure sustains it nor which States, on occasions, are behind that group.
But it always has social support, and one of the keys to combating the phenomenon of terrorism is to be aware of the range of the organisation and of the social strata supporting it.
For this reason âÂ and I regret certain amendments to this effectÂ - I regret that we have not had the courage to call the organisation that the Europeans are faced with, which is a radical, Islamist organisation, or one that claims to defend Islam, that is to say Al Qaeda, by its name.
It is essential to call it by its name, because that is the only way to combat an organisation: we must be able to say what we are currently facing in the European Union.
The main risk facing the European Parliament is paralysis, inaction, being sure of our principles and values and being in general agreement, but not creating a common European political project to deal with this great issue that is going to affect our present and our future, and treating it as if it were somebody elseâs problem: as if it were something that happened to the Americans on 11 September, a few years ago, or specifically to Spain, for particular reasons, on 11 March, but I do not believe that that is what we should do.
In conclusion, I would like to remember the victims and say that they must always be at the centre of our debate, the main focus of our attention, I would repeat that, on this issue, we must all have the moral strength together with them fundamentally to tackle this issue which is essential in terms of our future.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, in the fight against terrorism, fear is the worst enemy and advocate.
It paralyses the population and affects its sense of security and that is how terrorists win.
It also reduces the resistance of the population and causes governments anxiety about suppressive measures, which often infringe fundamental freedoms.
Here again terrorists win.
The best way, therefore, to limit this fear is for us to be ready, as Europe, both to prevent terrorist attacks and their repercussions and â if a terrorist attack ultimately occurs â to be ready to deal with the repercussions of the attack in the best possible way, in other words by mitigating them both for the population as a whole and for the victims.
Why should we do this together, rather than each of us separately?
Firstly, because terrorism has no borders and our critical infrastructures often have no borders now either.
We cannot each deal with an issue which has pan-European repercussions alone.
Secondly, because we have committed to this Europe, not only through economic ties, but also through ties of solidarity.
In the case of terrorism in particular, we declared in the new European Constitution on 25 March 2004 that we clearly need to operate together.
But what should we do together?
In prevention and in the protection of critical infrastructures, I would say to you that it is extremely important for there to be a Commission proposal approved by Parliament for a programme to protect critical infrastructures.
The Member States, in cooperation with the infrastructure operators, who are mostly private operators, must each define these critical infrastructures using a harmonised European method.
We need to analyse their sensitivity and assess the threats, which means that we need to exchange information on these systems.
For example, my country might have information about a possible threat to another country.
We need to find solutions for their protection, as well as for an adequate reaction if an attack takes place.
At the same time, we need to safeguard confidentiality, so that the owners of these infrastructures can exchange information in advance. In other words, they must be able to warn each other about possible attacks.
We need to safeguard financing.
We need to safeguard, above all, the protection of fundamental freedoms in this process.
The ends do not justify the means.
We need to safeguard a recognisable and achievable timetable and independent monitoring by Europe as regards support for this timetable for prescribing infrastructures.
We cannot simply shell out money with no timetable.
What can we do for the purpose of crisis management?
We need here to create a European civil protection force and safeguard European financing for its movements.
This is the biggest cost.
You can have a database so that you can coordinate throughout Europe â if a disaster strikes one country, which other countries will help and with what forces â but it costs money.
We must have cooperation with non-governmental organisations and local authorities. They are all involved in the event of a disaster, be it a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.
All the early-warning systems must be unified in ARGUS.
There must be a crisis management, coordination and monitoring and information processing centre in Europe.
We also need, as Europe, to consult the national authorities with experience.
I mention this because, with the Olympic Games in Greece in 2004, we organised what was probably the biggest civil protection and infrastructure protection operation in the history of the entire world.
The European Commission cannot organise such a large-scale programme without consulting authorities such as these.
What should we not do together?
We do not want green, red or orange alerts to the world.
We cannot create a climate of panic.
In creating a climate of panic, we have created what the terrorists want: the fear I mentioned at the beginning.
Nor do we want preventive wars against terrorism.
They are either wars against nation states or they are wars against fundamental rights.
There is a huge temptation at the moment, in numerous countries around the world, to restrict fundamental rights, allegedly so that we can combat terrorism.
Nor do we want to address terrorism solely as a police matter.
That is not and should not be the way we combat it.
Nor do we want specific terrorists to be demonised, because that way we turn them into heroes, or the victims to be ignored.
We have to remember these people.
Terrorists want the opposite; they want us to ignore them.
Thank you for listening and thank you to all my honourable friends for adopting this report unanimously in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I hope that we shall achieve a great deal together in the future.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures listed in the Hague Programme, primarily concerning money laundering, the funding of terrorism and exchanges of information among the Member States, must be carried out quickly and effectively.
That is one of the aims proposed in my report.
Such an objective must be fulfilled while observing the privacy of personal data â a point on which many Members have insisted during the debate â with a view to strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union, which are severely threatened by international terrorism.
Terrorism is funded primarily through the traffic in arms and drugs, and it is clear that transactions made by such groups controlling trafficking of this kind involve official banking and financial institutions.
Measures for preventing and countering the funding of terrorism, therefore, must centre on these institutions.
From this standpoint, we warmly welcome the commitment made on behalf of the Commission by MrÂ Frattini â whom we thank for his report â for the immediate presentation to the European Parliament of a proposal for a regulation on the traceability of financial transactions.
We believe that this initiative, for which we acknowledge the Commission, is practical, speedy and effective.
There is another equally substantial issue, moreover, of judicial cooperation.
How is it possible for an individual judge â and in Italy there are many of them engaged intensely and effectively in the fight against terrorism â to act without adequate instruments of cooperation and exchange of information?
That is a problem that still needs to be resolved.
I do not intend to underestimate the concerns voiced by many Members about the issue of personal data protection, but one requirement must take priority: to crush the terrorist headquarters that threaten citizens.
It is necessary to reflect carefully, therefore, on the need for cooperation in the exchange of information and on the requirement for an instrument that will allow us to stop terrorism in real time, by means of effective measures and intervention, in order to prevent crocodile tears from being shed at a later date for the hundreds of dead victims of the attacks, or, worse still, of biological terror attacks.
It is obvious that the organisation and operational development of terrorist networks entails constantly evolving methods and techniques, which also include infiltrations.
From this standpoint, and whilst having the highest regard for the work and the selflessness of not-for-profit organisations, I felt it necessary to stress the real danger of not-for-profit charitable organisations being infiltrated by terrorist groups, as many investigations have already documented.
These organisations must ensure maximum transparency in managing their funds, must exclusively use official bank accounts and standard financial channels, and must publish their budget plans â this also protects the not-for-profit sector, which is a source of pride for European civil society.
Let us not forget, moreover, the implementation of the FATF (Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering) recommendations, which take on great importance in devising new rules for bank transfers.
These rules are an absolute prerequisite in enabling us to single out the source and recipients of the transfers, who must not take cover behind ghost companies.
I would like to conclude by recalling the still entirely unresolved issue of financial and tax havens, both inside and outside the European Union, which even today can offer a veil of protection to the international terrorist organisations that threaten the peace and security of European citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, terrorism is an amorphous and multifaceted phenomenon which has hit Europe hard and which, unfortunately, will continue to pose a major threat to our democracies if we fail to reach a wide-ranging consensus in order to fight it, if there is not a firm commitment to cooperation between us and if we do not adopt an overarching strategy to eradicate it.
It is not enough to react, we need to anticipate and be ahead of the game.
Above all, terrorism must be unanimously condemned at a political level, and in order to do that, Europe must equip itself with effective means to do so.
I am therefore delighted with the five reports that we are to vote upon today, as each of them sets out very specific actions against this blight on our world, and I feel reassured by the conviction that I share with MrsÂ DiÃ©z GonzÃ¡lez, MrÂ Mayor Oreja, MrÂ Lambridinis and MrÂ Borghezio.
I hope that these reports will be adopted, if not unanimously - which would be ideal - then at least by a very substantial majority.
Exchanges of information have a key part to play in preventing the menace of terrorism and in effectively combating major crime.
However, if such exchanges of information are to be truly effective, we must, as a matter of urgency, impose some order and coherence on the controls already in force and check, by means of a thorough assessment, that they offer real added value.
We must avoid sacrificing security on the altar of efficiency, while at the same time not letting efficiency be undermined by bland platitudes.
Let there be no mistake about this: when it comes to the war on terror, we have nothing to fear from waging that war democratically and with determination while respecting the law. The danger lies in not reacting at all.
To that extent, I believe that the proposal for a Council decision is helpful, because it strengthens vertical cooperation by involving Europol and Eurojust, and provides for analysis.
The Swedish proposal is helpful because it provides for swift bilateral exchanges as part of horizontal cooperation between the services in the Member States.
To my mind, these proposals complement one another.
The amendments adopted in committee serve to make these measures more effective, in particular by providing for information to be available on previous convictions, by facilitating spontaneous exchanges of useful information, by setting deadlines for the exchange of information, by providing for an obligation to justify any refusal to supply information, by providing for an annual report to be presented to Parliament and by giving the Court of Justice the power of interpretation.
Furthermore, we are proposing for the first time that there should be a coherent set of controls that establishes common standards of data protection under the third pillar equivalent to those under the first pillar, in particular by creating a new joint supervisory body.
In this way it will finally be possible to convey to the police in very simple and specific terms, possibly by means of a code, what amounts to good practice.
This will allow objections which are very often used to justify inaction to be set aside.
Although we are simply being asked for our opinion, we are taking the initiative by formulating precise proposals.
If the vote is largely in favour, as was the case in committee, it will be impossible for the Council and the Commission to turn a deaf ear and to ignore proposals that I believe to be well balanced.
We have a very important political role to play here, and I am convinced that MrÂ Frattini and MrÂ de Vries will heed what we say and convey our views.
We also need to react as a matter of urgency to other vitally important dossiers, such as the European register of convictions and the fight against the financing of terrorism, because terrorism is dependent upon money.
Hence the vital importance of regulations to prevent money laundering and identify the holders of bank accounts financing major crime.
Ladies and gentlemen, as I have said, terrorism has many facets.
The most important threat we face today is the violence committed by the amorphous terrorist groupings that wrongly claim the right to invoke Islam.
There are also other threats, however.
In waging the war on terror, we must make sure to identify our various targets properly. We need to be aware of the links between terrorism and major crime.
We also need to set up an early warning system by strengthening cooperation between information services and by providing better protection for locations most at risk.
There is also a great deal to be done as regards prevention.
We must not let ourselves be fooled by the excuses that terrorists use to justify the unjustifiable.
Nevertheless they do relate to problems that often genuinely exist and need to be addressed and that represent a breeding ground for people driven to despair and therefore susceptible to terrorist lunacy.
Prevention also involves educating people to the danger of certain statements, and requires us to convey the importance of democracy as regards tolerant debate and respect for the opinions of others.
We must also have the capacity to react appropriately when the worst happens.
In such cases, solidarity must be the order of the day: specific political solidarity that marshals all our resources and energy both to provide assistance and to crack down on such acts.
We need to think still more about the victims of terrorism.
They need to be involved in the process not only so that we might respond to their concerns but also so that we might demonstrate to them that efforts are being made to ensure that such disasters never happen again.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, our greatest weapon in the face of barbaric acts is our passionate commitment to freedom and democracy, underpinned by human rights.
Once again, if we are proactive and unanimous we can defeat those whose dream is to destroy the ideals at the heart of Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr de Vries, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Duquesne has already given a detailed explanation of the need for action to curb, combat and prevent terrorism in Europe and throughout the world.
In the context of the reports on the table, and particularly the one for which I am responsible, the report on the retention of data, I should like to remind the House of what the European Court of Justice has said with regard to the war on terrorism, namely that governments must constantly consider whether all the resources they deploy and all the measures they enact, however legitimate they may be, are not actually endangering what they are intended to protect.
In some cases, this may be the existence of a free society; in others it may be the right of personal privacy.
I heartily agree with the shadow rapporteurs, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to them, that we are not fundamentally opposed to the proposals made by the governments of the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Sweden.
We would certainly insist, however, that measures involving significant curtailments of fundamental rights, which â as all law students learn in the first term at every European university â must always be properly justified, are based on a needs assessment which endorses the measures in question.
This assessment should not be confined to identifying the need for action but should also outline the benefits of retaining, as a matter of course, data from public telecommunications networks â the Internet, landlines, mobile phones and SMS â which could relate to any of 450 million people.
The main problem I should like to re-examine in this context is that of the procedural method.
I am grateful for the communication we have received.
With the best will in the world, however, I have to say that the procedure leaves a great deal of scope for improvement.
The report on which you will vote today is based on a draft dating from April of last year.
In the meantime, the Councilâs proposal has undergone several amendments.
The most recent proposal dates from 24Â May.
Since then the Commission has taken the initiative to introduce its own proposals.
Since Parliament is not up to date on these, not having been involved in the latest discussions to the extent of receiving a new document through official channels, we can scarcely be expected to express unbounded enthusiasm about the cooperation of the other institutions in this matter.
Perhaps some thought should be given to ways of improving interinstitutional cooperation if we want to succeed in combating terrorism.
To deal briefly with the report itself, in the old version â and similar problems may well exist in the new version too â we identified technical defects with regard to the means of enforcement.
It is a matter of creating databases designed to store as much data as it is possible and necessary to retain; it is a matter of ascertaining how easily ways can be found to circumvent the provisions contained in the present proposal and how easy or difficult it may and must be for the relevant industry to effect the requisite structural changes â and this is the economic crux of the matter â without the need for compensation.
Perhaps some of the new proposals set out different rules on this last point, but there was certainly no provision for compensation in the version on which we had to base our deliberations.
The other question we had to examine was a legal one: to what extent is the proposed system compatible with the right to respect for private and family life as defined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights?
To what extent is it compatible with the fundamental rights enshrined in our national constitutions, such as the right to determine the disclosure and use of oneâs own personal data, as in Germany, and the right of telephone privacy, which presumably exists in every Member State, to store the data of all European citizens?
In which country will the framework decision first be declared unconstitutional, if it is adopted at all?
Another aspect is the political message conveyed in the justification of the first document, which states that the system should be deliberately designed to include those who have never come under suspicion so that it can achieve the goal of combating terrorism and organised crime as comprehensively and efficiently as possible.
Perhaps an alternative solution could be sought among the other available options.
We have the Convention on Cybercrime, which proposes ways of striking a reasonable balance between the storage and protection of data, such as the use of a data freeze or a system of data preservation.
This Convention proposes several solutions that have not yet been implemented in a single country.
At this point one begins to wonder whether the desire to take rapid action did not triumph over rational reflection in this case, particularly in view of the fact that the Council received its mandate on 25Â March of last year, exactly two weeks after the dreadful atrocities in Madrid.
I hope that the message we are sending out from here will be properly interpreted.
We are willing to cooperate, but we also want the right procedure to be chosen.
As the report shows, we believe, and the legal services believe, that this matter should be part of the first pillar of the EU Treaty, in other words one of the areas in which our Parliament engages in joint decision-making and is not merely consulted.
Perhaps that can be taken on board, and perhaps we shall then be accorded the same level of respect that we give the other institutions in the course of our work.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, in the context of this debate, I should be very interested to learn how sharply the European Union in general and the Council in particular are focusing on the issue of bioterrorism.
I have no doubt that a good foreign policy which functions properly is the best preventive mechanism.
This, unfortunately, has not been fully understood by part of the European electorate in recent weeks, and some of the responsibility for that surely lies with us.
Be that as it may, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that we are liable to be confronted with the problem of bioterrorism.
We hope it will not come to that, but I should like to know from the Commission and the Council how they are preparing for such an eventuality.
I should also like to know how these preparations have progressed over the past year and over the last few months since the appointment of a common European coordinator.
If the rumours are true â and I hope they are not â that cooperation has been dreadful in the entire area around my country, I should like to know what steps the Commission and the Council are taking to tackle this issue resolutely.
There is no doubt that this is a European mission and that the European dimension brings added value.
I keenly await the Commissionâs comments.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I will address all at the same time the many sensitive issues raised by the rapporteurs, to whom I have listened with great attention and whom I sincerely thank for having drawn attention to matters of exceptional interest for the democratic life of Europe.
I believe that terrorism is genuinely the new tyranny of the 21st century, a tyranny which seeks to limit our freedoms and to attack peopleâs fundamental rights â the right to life and physical safety â and I therefore agree with your approach.
A response is needed that involves European intervention and strong international cooperation.
It is not a case of an emergency response: we must regard terrorism as a permanent threat, which therefore requires a strategy and, as many have said, concrete action, above all.
Only last Friday in Luxembourg, the Council, on this basis, endorsed the action plan proposed by the Commission, which contains some new, and in my opinion, effective proposals.
These will be implemented as early as in the next few months and will add to the measures already in place.
As MrÂ Mayor Oreja correctly stated, we are dealing with aspects of a single strategy, not a list of measures.
It will be a question of a political plan on which Parliament, the Council and the Commission obviously must and can work together.
I believe that one of the fundamental principles resides in the fact that the fight against terrorism does not mean restricting peopleâs freedoms; quite the opposite!
The greatest political mistake would be if peopleâs fundamental freedoms were also to fall victim to terrorism, in the sense of being sacrificed, or, even, wiped out.
The balance between preventative action and repression, on the one hand, and the safeguarding of fundamental rights and freedoms, on the other, is therefore the focus of all of the reports.
If I may now make some brief observations on the reports presented.
MrsÂ DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez is certainly right in stressing the importance of an available action plan, allowing us in particular to monitor the actions of the Member States in implementing the measures decided upon.
It would be truly paradoxical if, after having identified a strategy, there was not a mechanism for overseeing the implementation of the measures outlined in the strategy itself.
The action plan and its implementation will therefore be a priority for the Commission.
As many of you are already aware, one of the main elements of the action plan approved on Friday in Luxembourg was precisely the creation of a permanent monitoring instrument.
The Commission proposes to issue a report periodically â on a six-monthly basis, I believe.
It will, of course, be made public and will concern the methods and the quality of implementation of all of the measures by the Member States.
For instance, with regard to certain points outlined in MrsÂ DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lezâs report, we are working on a communication on explosives, detonators and firearms, and on a second communication that concerns the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists.
In addition to these measures, we will clearly and promptly put forward a number of proposals on the issue of the funding of terrorism â I will return to this issue â with particular reference to certain organisations that assist and support terrorism.
We will obviously work towards the implementation of the ARGUS system, with which many of you will be familiar.
I am certain that this system will allow us to create a network of all of the existing rapid response systems within the Commission.
The aim is to create a European network that will enable the immediate exchange of information â I would say in real time â between all of the Member States in the event of a terrorist attack.
MrÂ Mayor Orejaâs report very rightly stresses the importance of strengthening information exchange, cooperation with third countries, dialogue with civil society â which is a fundamental aspect â and assistance and support to the victims of terrorism, which is another aspect on which the Commission will work intensely.
I believe that this period of work, which Parliament has begun today with the presentation of the reports, will increasingly have to take into account the victims of terrorism, as well as the perpetrators of terrorist acts, of course.
I believe that the key to the success of this strategy lies in the principle of inclusiveness: all of the actors in society, both public and private, must be able to participate in the democratic debate on terrorism.
I believe that providing the public with appropriate information, which is neither threatening nor exaggerated, but is in contrast clear, can be a reassuring response.
If we tell the citizens that there exist practical measures and that together we are fine-tuning them, I believe that the citizens can feel reassured by the fact that the great institutions of Europe are working, and will continue to work, proactively.
With regard to the protection of critical infrastructures, I greatly welcomed the report by MrÂ Lambrinidis.
Without doubt, one of the principal terrorist threats affects infrastructures, and it is precisely within this sector that cooperation is essential between public institutions, every level of government and the private sector.
By the end of the year, the Commission aims to present to Parliament a proposal for a European programme for critical infrastructure protection.
One of the items in the programme relates to the possibility of providing access to immediate and well-timed information â a kind of early warning â in the event of the danger of a terrorist attack.
I can tell you that an important seminar is taking place in Brussels on this issue as we speak, with 150 representatives of the 25 Member States in attendance.
This meeting provides a positive response: there is broad consensus on the principle elements of this future programme.
We will organise a second European public seminar in September in order to then be able to present a tangible programme by the end of the year.
In this context, we will have a sum of EUR 1.5 million available for studies relating to best practice in the exchange of information among Member States on the security standards for critical infrastructures.
Each Member State must obviously invest in the structures in place on its own territory.
With regard to the funding of terrorism, which is the subject addressed in MrÂ Borghezioâs report, I am in agreement with the main points outlined in the report.
With reference to the not-for-profit sector, the Commission is working on a kind of European code of conduct with a view to tackling the vulnerability of the sector, which, in certain instances â as has been discovered â directly or indirectly supported terrorist organisations.
In order to do so, however, we call for large-scale cooperation from the not-for-profit sector itself and from civil society, which is, like us, keen to root out all those who assist terrorist activity in any way.
In addition, we certainly have in mind a better exchange of information among national authorities with regard to the funding of terrorism.
We are assessing this issue, and a communication is being prepared by the Commission.
There is a further, extremely sensitive issue: the traceability of financial transactions.
It is obvious that, in the absence of the necessary instruments for investigating the trail of financial transactions, we are deprived of an effective instrument for clamping down on terrorist funding.
With regard to this issue, we therefore aim by this summer to propose to Parliament and the Council a draft regulation on information and the instruments that will be used in tracing financial transactions.
Then there are the three reports by MrÂ Duquesne, which touch on a subject which is particularly close to my heart: the link between action against terrorism and personal data protection.
I believe that the amendments tabled with a view to supplementing and improving the Swedish proposal must be upheld.
They are amendments that take account of the important conference held a few days ago in Poland, and which highlight the importance of every personâs right to personal data protection, even when we are confronted by terrorism.
That means establishing a balance: no one can envisage abandoning the prevention of, and fight against, terrorism, but individualsâ fundamental rights must be preserved.
I agree with MrÂ Duquesneâs thoughts on the role of Europol and Eurojust.
It is important to allow these bodies access to a wide spectrum of information, so that they may effectively carry out the exchange and coordination work which is the role of Europol, as is evident from the organisationâs new remit, received a few days ago by its new director.
The principal of respect for fundamental rights is a subject addressed by MrÂ Alvaro, and it is a subject on which I myself have spoken many times.
The principle of personal data protection must respond to real needs.
Personal data cannot be safeguarded if the safeguard does not correspond to established objectives and for a specific period of time, and neither can permission be granted to access those data except to the competent police and investigation authorities that have a right to access them by law.
We are preparing a provision in this respect, founded on a legal basis which, in my opinion, is more appropriate than the existing one, and which I outlined on Friday to the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers.
I shall be presenting the actual text by the end of this summer.
The final subject that I would like to address quickly is bioterrorism.
The rapporteur is aware that the Commission has some powers, but not all.
It can take charge of food safety, the trade in medicinal products, coordination between the Member States, civil protection and the funding of research.
That is no small thing.
It is the responsibility of the Member States, however, to adopt practical measures for effective preventative action and potential reactive action in the event of a terrorist attack.
You are aware that, following the 2005 bioterrorist attack using traces of anthrax, a high level committee for public health safety was set up with an effective programme of cooperation for prevention and rapid response.
The cooperation in progress is working and we are able to tell you that there is a system that can provide a rapid alert in the event of a biological, chemical or radiological attack, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Many steps taken by the Commission will improve the level of preparedness and prevention: we are developing simulation exercises in case of potential bioterrorist attacks, two of which will be performed this year to provide a practical assessment of the standard of prevention and rapid response.
We are drawing up guidelines, moreover, for managing medical diagnoses in the event of agents being spread by bioterrorists; we are preparing training courses in collaboration with Europol, and we are supporting national emergency plans that aim to make available an adequate number of vaccines and emergency assistance.
As you are aware, MrKyprianou unveiled an important European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control barely a week ago.
We will continue to encourage the Member States on these issues.
There are two final and practical proposals that I would like to point out.
Firstly, the drafting of a new European programme on health and consumer protection, under which we aim to increase the level of funding allocated to prevention and rapid response in the event of public health emergencies.
We have also proposed the reimbursement of costs for public health emergencies under the Solidarity Fund, up to a sum of EURÂ 1 billion.
Secondly â and this is my final point - I will mention an important initiative that we have identified as a framework programme.
It is a programme, planned and approved for the next Community budget, which is focused on preparedness and prevention relating to security.
Obviously, this will include funds to be allocated in the event of potential bioterrorist attacks.
Â Â  . Mr President, in this very brief speech, I would like to stress the importance of the exchange of information for combating the kind of terrorism we are discussing.
This is why Mr Duquesneâs report is so appropriate, since it places the emphasis on this extremely important issue.
We must have the courage to call the organisation we are fighting by its name and there is no question that we are facing a series of fundamentalist groups which do not represent Islam, but which claim to operate in the name of Islam.
That is why I believe information to be so important, because it is an emerging phenomenon that we have practically no knowledge of, and in the case of this type of phenomenon, information is essential.
We certainly do not know how they act and above all we do not understand their sense of time.
They are not like other organisations that have the same sense of time as us.
That is why it is so important that we be able to work to understand the social support for these organisations, in the knowledge that they are prepared to die, to sacrifice their lives in these attacks, something that does not happen in the case of other kinds of organisation.
That is why it is so important that we are able to place the emphasis on the exchange of information from national police forces and not just with Europol.
The European project must have sufficient capacity to promote the exchange of information amongst national police forces, who are the bodies working in particular on this phenomenon.
The Council, the Commission and this Parliament must therefore create more fora for exchanging information amongst the police forces working on this sensitive and difficult issue.
Â Â  . One of the greatest and most complex challenges facing liberal democracies is international terrorism.
Terrorism first and foremost targets our security, but it also fundamentally jeopardises our freedom.
We must find ways of defending ourselves against terrorism and protecting our security whilst ensuring that our civil and human rights and our freedom do not fall victim as a result.
Mr Duquesneâs report confronts this dilemma, and I congratulate him on this, because he knows that on the one hand, rapid and effective exchange of information is the key to this whole problem, while at the same time it is precisely due to this exchange of information that concerns arise regarding protection of personal data.
In this regard, Mr Duquesne makes a very good suggestion â which I support â namely to set up a body to monitor developments throughout the whole process.
But until we have put these new measures in place, we need to take as our standard, the statutory provisions prevailing in those countries, that provide the strongest protection of their citizensâ personal data.
For the second time, we propose that countries which are not yet members, but are candidates for membership, should be involved in this exchange of information â at least let us consider their inclusion as an option â in other words, countries that will soon be members of the European family and neighbouring countries that are affected in this regard.
Finally, we recommend and urge that the Member States of the European Union ratify the various international agreements and treaties relating to combating terrorism as soon as possible.
Many Member States have unfortunately not yet ratified many of these international agreements and we therefore have no unified means at our disposal to fight terrorism effectively.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in time, combating terrorism, preventing it and wiping it from the face of the Earth must be the sole priority objective of this European Unionâs policies.
We must not forget that on 11 March, Spain and Europe were attacked in a cruel and cowardly fashion because they represent a model of the freedoms that we in this House are always trying to safeguard.
On that day, 11 March, the history of Spain, the history of Europe, and hence the history of the European Union, changed.
From that moment, it became necessary to acknowledge that terrorism is not a uniform, homogenous or monolithic reality.
On the contrary, that attack demonstrated that there are many different types of terrorism; the means for combating those different types of terrorism must not, therefore, be generic, but rather specific and suited to each of them.
From this point of view, the terrorism of Al Qaeda cannot be fought in the same way as the terrorism of ETA or that of the IRA.
And it cannot, of course, be combated if we deny its existence, as some Members here in the European Parliament want to do, by removing any mention of Al Qaeda from our anti-terrorist documents.
If I have learnt one lesson from history, it is that if we ignore it, we are doomed to repeat it.
If this fight is to be effective, we must base our efforts on prevention mechanisms, and I entirely agree with the Commissioner.
The fight must not be based exclusively on reaction mechanisms; the best way to combat terrorism is to prevent it.
I entirely agree with Mr Mayor Oreja when he says that prevention must be based on the rapid and bilateral exchange of information amongst the specialised services of the Member States, on facilitating the systematic transmission of information to Europol and Eurojust and on the creation of registers, such as the register of European criminals, to facilitate investigations.
No difficulty must hinder the effective protection of freedom and the right to life.
The defence of life and of freedom must always be our priorities in this fight.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I drafted the opinion on data retention for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and I should also like to restrict myself to that subject.
Before I begin, however, let me thank the rapporteur and everyone else who was involved for their work.
It is surely incontestable that the democracies of the European Union must face up to the threat from crime and terrorism and engage in the effort to defeat them.
The Commissionâs proposal on the retention of stored and processed data could contribute to the pursuit of that aim, but not in its present form.
The proposal for a framework decision has rightly come under heavy cross-party fire in this House.
Allow me to highlight a few of the issues.
The proposal fails to answer the key question of the extent to which the retention of data is actually necessary and expedient.
Regrettably, it contains no plausible evidence that the proposed measures will actually serve to improve our collective ability to fight crime and terrorism.
Without this evidence, however, it is absolutely impossible to justify the profound effects of this type of data storage on people and businesses.
I know that the Commission is currently working on a proposal of its own.
However, I ask the Commission â and indeed I personally wrote to Commissioner Frattini on this matter â to have an independent impact assessment conducted with a view to ascertaining whether the benefits of the planned measures justify their cost.
Let me also add a few words on the current process.
As far as the procedural provisions are concerned, I should have liked to see a different form of parliamentary involvement in this sensitive matter.
Data protection, which truly affects every individual and every business, demands a proper legislative process.
Under the EC Treaty, this includes the full participation of the European Parliament.
All of which leads me to conclude that the proposal for a framework directive must be thoroughly overhauled in the light of the criticisms voiced by the European Parliament.
Â Â  .
Mr President, this is a very important debate and I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, in particular my colleagues Mr Mayor Oreja and Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez, on their reports.
The report by Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez, in particular, is highly ambitious and is intended to provide the citizens with a very high level of protection against terrorism.
I believe that one of the achievements of the modern State has been the protection of citizens against crime of all kinds.
We are currently facing a very specialised kind of crime, terrorism, and this requires action not just by State institutions, but also cooperation in the international field.
As far as we are concerned, we believe that cooperation within the framework of the European institutions is fundamental and, in this regard, I would like to stress the importance of the swift ratification of the European Constitution to the citizens of Europe, since it establishes a framework for fighting terrorism that begins with the recognition of peoplesâ right to life and to physical integrity, as a fundamental right, and goes on to enshrine an area of freedom, security and justice.
These texts should be read it appears that some citizens of the Union do not know them yet.
The Solidarity clause in Article I-43 of the European Constitution states that âThe Union and its Member States shall act jointly in a spirit of solidarity if a Member State is the victim of terrorist attack or natural or man-made disaster.â
It then says, âThe Union shall mobilise all the instruments at its disposal, including the military resources made available by the Member States, to:
a) prevent the terrorist threat in the territory of the Member States,
protect democratic institutions and the civilian population from any terrorist attack,
assist a Member State in its territory at the request of its political authorities in the event of a terrorist attack;
b) assist a Member State in its territory at the request of its political authorities in the event of a disaster.â
Furthermore, the European Constitution establishes a mechanism for cooperation amongst the Member States.
My conclusion, therefore, Mr President, is that the citizens of Europe currently expect us, the European politicians, to promote the process of ratifying the European Constitution so that we may soon have the appropriate instruments for fighting this scourge.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the six rapporteurs, who have carried out some very complicated work on the difficult job of combating terrorism, of drawing up a common assessment with a view to combating terrorism on the basis of legality, respect for human rights and data protection.
I would like to congratulate, by name, Rosa DÃ­ez, Jaime Mayor, Stavros Lambrinidis, Antoine Duquesne, Mario Borghezio and Alexander Nuno Alvaro.
My speech relates to a documented commitment, a modest but thoroughly documented commitment, in the fight against terrorism and support and protection for its victims.
Mr President, the victims must be heard, they must be respected and they must be protected, and the resources must be provided for doing all of this.
There can be no concessions for terrorism.
Terrorist crimes can never be justified and they must be pursued in every part of the world.
Nevertheless, Mr President, inspired by my commitment to the victims, I have presented an amendment to Mr Borghezioâs report: Amendment 4, which relates to forms of terrorist funding.
In my country we have the so-called ârevolutionary taxâ which is demanded by the terrorist organisation ETA.
It is the worst form of extortion in the European Union; it is a form of extortion that consists of writing to Basque businesspeople and asking them to fund its criminal activities.
It is estimated that this funding amounts to some EUR 12 to 15 million per year.
If this funding is cut off and made impossible, the terrorist group could not survive.
There are three types of reaction to this phenomenon: there are those who pay, there are those who leave the country and there are those who do not pay but who then pay a very heavy price for not doing so.
The National High Court has the legislation and processes in place for these crimes.
I am therefore appealing in particular this morning to Mrs Roure to take account of what I am saying, because the support of the second largest group in the House and the other groups here is very important.
I would ask you affectionately to accept and support this amendment, and to support an amendment using other more acceptable terms, such as âform of extortion that the terrorist organisation ETA calls a revolutionary taxâ, for example, since I am talking about solidarity with the Basque and Spanish businesspeople suffering from this type of extortion.
Finally, Mr President, and I will end here, I would like to address Mr Gijs de Vries: the threat persists.
And Mr de Vries, who knows that the threat persists, must have sufficient resources not just to produce strategic reports, but also to run an office that can fight terrorism effectively.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteurs and all the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who have made a particularly important contribution to this work and to this debate.
We need to demonstrate our determination by agreeing a united response as regards the fight against terrorism, because terrorist organisations have no respect for national frontiers when they commit their crimes.
That is why, for us, the only effective response to terrorism is a response at European level.
The European Action Plan against terrorism must be the Unionâs basic political tool in this area.
We accordingly need to be ambitious in identifying specific responses to the problems which lie behind terrorism and fundamentalism.
Having said that, we cannot limit ourselves solely to security policy, because terrorism amounts to a denial of our citizensâ freedoms.
That is why we should first and foremost counter terrorism by protecting and actively promoting fundamental rights.
This priority under the Hague programme should also be at the heart of our policy.
We must promote the values of democracy and solidarity if we are to combat the causes of terrorism.
We must confront situations of extreme poverty and social exclusion, which all too often provide a breeding ground for extremist views.
Within the Union, we must fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia.
By the same token, however, it would be unacceptable for the fight against terrorism to favour new forms of discrimination.
We also need to find a way of coordinating the European Unionâs internal and external policies for combating terrorism.
We need to encourage dialogue with non-Member States, particularly with a view to stimulating codevelopment.
No one should be pushed to take desperate measures because of their precarious situation.
Furthermore, there is no doubt that transport security has an important part to play in the fight against terrorism, but it must be achieved while respecting our citizensâ right to privacy and protection of their personal data.
In the light of that, we must pursue our work to adopt appropriate legislative and operational measures including the European arrest warrant, which is a fundamental instrument.
The third money laundering directive, which also covers the financing of terrorism, will also provide us with means of combating networks supporting terrorism.
We are therefore calling for Europol and Eurojust to be strengthened, so that they can genuinely coordinate the fight against terrorism and organised crime in Europe.
Nevertheless, we also have to give the public guarantees about the protection of their private life.
That will only be possible if data retention is provided for as an instrument under the first pillar, so as to ensure the protection of personal data.
Unfortunately, this process has been slowed down by a lack of political will on the part of the Member States to make European decisions truly effective.
By way of conclusion, I would like to say that reason has always been a victim of hatred, violence and fear.
We are living in an era of fundamentalism, accompanied by fanaticism and terrorism.
The world seems to have become politically and economically inflamed, and it is vital for us in the Union to create renewed confidence in democracy and to fight against all those instances of injustice that provide a breeding ground for violence.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am not sure whether I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe or on my own behalf â I rather believe I am speaking on my own behalf.
In any event, it is clear that this is an important debate.
Several reports are being presented to this House today, each of which has followed its own course through the committee stage, and, together, they demonstrate very clearly the importance that this Parliament attaches to this debate.
The rapporteurs for these reports deserve our congratulations and we should also be pleased that they have appreciated the need to accept many amendments that have improved them and have clarified some of the statements contained in the original texts, in some cases in a very significant manner.
In any event, today this Parliament will make very clear its commitment to an extremely vigorous fight against terrorism in terms of policing, in terms of judicial efficiency, but one that, at the same time, is extremely respectful of human rights, of data protection, of the guarantees without which this fight against terrorism makes no sense, a fight that takes account of the victims of terrorism, on the basis of respect â it naturally does not put political decisions into their hands, that would not be appropriate, but it is logical that they should have a voice and be heard directly â and which, without justifying terrorism nor those who sacrifice themselves or are capable of indiscriminate murder in any way, without justifying it under any circumstances, it is an anti-terrorist policy that deals with the possible reasons why somebody may become a terrorist.
We cannot look at terrorism as if it had just landed from Mars.
There are situations which lead to people being prepared to kill, and that does not excuse the individuals who do so, but it does oblige us, as politicians, to examine why and which specific situations lie behind this behaviour.
The balance, therefore, between this vigorous fight, this examination of the reality as it stands, and respect for human rights, is actually a real balance which, if translated from these reports into political action, could have significant results.
Some amendments remain alive, and some of them I presented myself on behalf of my group â in this case, it was on behalf of my group.
I would like to highlight two of them.
Firstly, we are talking about terrorism from many sources and, therefore, to mention Islam, even if we only say, âWe believe that Islam is fundamentally fine, but we are worried about Islamic terroristsâ, would be to mix terrorism with Islam.
We therefore propose the removal of any reference to Islam in this document, because otherwise we could be producing a list of those who are potential terrorists.
We have not done that, and it would be very dangerous to do so because we would always leave somebody out.
Let us not, therefore, mix up terrorism and Islam, even if that only means introducing a clause stating that âIslam is fundamentally okayâ, which is what these reports apparently intend to do unless this amendment is approved.
Secondly, we propose the removal of any reference to the International Criminal Court.
We believe that this court is only now beginning its work, and to complicate its operation through a debate on its powers in the anti-terrorist field would only jeopardise its operation.
Let us, therefore, leave that debate out of the issue we are dealing with today.
There are other ways to deal with it, and today we should be dealing with what is already operational.
Finally, I would like to say to Mr Gijs de Vries, who is honouring us with his presence today, that the important thing is to turn all of this into political action and concrete measures.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, with seven reports today, this Parliament is trying to arrive at a comprehensive common position on terrorism and to organise the fight against that terrorism.
This is a monumental task that we are undertaking.
Allow me to specify what it entails.
The task is to win a struggle against adversaries who cast aside all human qualities, break every rule and every law, disregard national and moral boundaries, know no restraint and fanatically pursue the criminal aim of abolishing human freedom.
Our goal is to win this war without sacrificing our own decency, casting aside our humanity, betraying our own laws or endangering personal freedom within our own domestic territory.
That is the task, and it is incredibly difficult.
Even for war, common rules have been developed over the centuries, but here we are faced with adversaries lurking in the shadows, imperceptible and transcending all borders.
This makes firm resolve and a common approach essential, but it also requires us to realise that we must not let our sensitivity to our own peopleâs needs and rights be deadened at the sound of the word âterrorismâ or give for the use of any and every instrument in the war on terrorism.
MrÂ Alvaro, one of the rapporteurs, raised this point.
I believe it is particularly important to emphasise that fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law do not seem to be adequately protected by the provisions of this draft.
There is another aspect, however, that confronts us with an entirely new situation.
The whole GonzÃ¡lez report is based on the assumption that the European Constitution will enter into force.
It builds on the foundations of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, parliamentary codecision, open legislative processes, the solidarity clause, the right to determine the disclosure and use of oneâs own personal data, parliamentary scrutiny, judicial review and the dissolution of the pillar structure in favour of a unified Europe.
This is not wishful thinking or a dream that may be set to crumble before our eyes.
No, it is an absolute, imperative and indispensable prerequisite for this package of measures and its legitimacy and for the defence of fundamental rights.
Without this prerequisite, without the European Constitution, we are in no position to approve this catalogue of measures, because there is no guarantee that the balance between justice, security and freedom will be preserved.
Add to this the fact that, on the issue of converting Europol into an agency and of transferring the Counter-terrorism Coordinator to the staff of the Commission, there is still no more on the table than our request â no consent, no explanation â and it becomes clear that we run the risk of upsetting the balance here and jeopardising our citizensâ freedom.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the first sentence in the strategic document on national defence approved by the United States in March 2005 states: the United States and the world are fighting a war.
That is the ideological premise that has given rise in recent years to the theory of preventative war, the violation of individual freedoms, the end of personal data protection, and the fixation on security.
Terrorism is an extremely serious crime that must be condemned and combated.
It cannot be combated by military means, however, and I believe, therefore, that Europe must distance itself from that approach.
We must carefully analyse the spiral of war and terrorism, because the military response has strengthened terrorism, and we cannot sidestep this issue.
In Afghanistan, the military occupation has generated exponential growth in the production of opium, which is funding the al-Qaâida network.
In Iraq, the war has boosted the strength of terrorist groups, not all of which are religiously motivated, and that is the reason why we need to remove the anti-Islam fixation from some of the reports being examined in this House.
Such a fixation also reveals a cultural subordination to the United States.
PresidentÂ Bush has, in fact, asked Islamic regimes to limit, control and record all charitable donations made by Muslims.
We, however, cannot look upon not-for-profit organisations as the main source of terrorist funding, as do some of the rapporteurs in this House.
We must avoid making overly simplistic equations along the lines of terrorism equals immigration, or terrorism equals Islam.
Terrorism must be combated and defeated: the aim is noble, but the methods are all too often improper and sometimes criminal.
Terrorism is a crime against humanity, but I do not believe that it is necessary to single out an International Criminal Court as the place for trying such crimes, partly because at the same time it is unacceptable that nobody judges the massacres of civilians during military actions.
All too often sovereignty relieves the prince of criminal liability.
An influential expert in law once said that the legal history of the Western State is that of instilling the notion of its innocence in criminal acts.
I believe that in order to combat terrorism, we must re-examine the old legal proverb that says that the king is never wrong.
Â Â  Mr President, in this debate on terrorism I welcome the fact that last Saturday morning, in Belfast, an IRA member, Terry Davison, was charged in court with the murder of Robert McCartney and that a second IRA person, Jim McCormick, was charged with the attempted murder of Mr McCartney's friend, Brendan Devine.
I should like to congratulate the police service of Northern Ireland on overcoming an IRA-orchestrated and ongoing campaign of intimidation to begin the process of securing justice in this notorious case.
I trust that many more charges will follow, for that is the only way to deal with the processes of terrorism.
The mission of democracies must be to defeat terrorism, not merely to contain or to tame it.
'Softly, softly' conciliation is merely banked by the terrorists, who then demand more and more.
We have lived through that in Northern Ireland: our government foolishly tolerated 'no go' areas for their own security forces, an acceptable level of violence, political status for prisoners, secret talks, side deals, the restructuring and renaming of the police, the soft-pedalling of paramilitary organised crime, and the ultimate ignominy of the early release of terrorists under the ill-conceived Belfast Agreement.
None of it worked, because the latest International Monitoring Committee report shows that we still have a functioning, recruiting, training, threatening and active IRA that works hand-in-glove with its junior partner, Sinn FÃ©in, whose members, as ever, are notably absent when we debate terrorism in this House.
I implore the rest of Europe to learn the lessons. Be quicker in learning than the British Government was, and learn the lesson that terrorism cannot be tamed or sanitised but must be resolutely defeated and driven out of business, including all its sidelines of criminality.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the six rapporteurs for their reports.
As shadow rapporteur for my group, I have tried to make a positive contribution to the Borghezio report to help combat the financing of terrorism.
It is evident from all interventions that there is general agreement on the need for coordinated action to combat internationally organised crime and the means by which it is financed.
The public expects a powerful European response.
After all, the benefit of European cooperation in this respect is beyond dispute.
Tracing and combating the financing of terrorist networks and/or attacks is not an easy task because it is often small amounts that are involved.
Apart from the abuses via the regular financial sector, it is mainly charities that are the favourite hunting ground for international terrorists.
Accordingly, recent Belgian police statistics show that an increasing number of non-profit organisations are taken advantage of for criminal activities.
Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, everyone was suddenly given a wake-up call, and no fewer than 86 dossiers were opened in our country.
The organisations involved all state that they do charitable work, but their only , though, is the collection and channelling of funds for the benefit of terrorist organisations.
Such statistics, but also the result of the enquiry into the murder of Theo van Gogh in the Netherlands, for example, demonstrate that we must, as a matter of urgency, adopt preventive policies based on the exchange of information, better traceability of financial transactions and greater transparency of legal entities.
That is why the specific recommendations in this report, including the setting up of common frameworks for transnational investigations, developing a network for the structured exchange of information, improving cooperation with SUSTRANS and the drafting of minimum standards for the verification of customersâ identities, receive our support.
Finally, we also want to provide charities with the necessary funds to guarantee a more effective protection against abuse by terrorist organisations.
We therefore hope that this report can give the initial impetus for combating the financing of terrorism in the European Union in a structural and sustainable manner.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we agree that we must take resolute action against international terrorism and organised crime.
Today, however, I should like to re-emphasise that we must adopt the right measures.
In my opinion and in the view of my group, the proposal on the retention of stored and processed data is not the right tool for the job.
We made this abundantly clear with our vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Let me also make a point of congratulating my honourable colleague MrÂ Alvaro on his report.
The protection of individualsâ personal data is not guaranteed by the Councilâs proposal.
It would impose huge costs on the European telecommunications industry, and the benefits of storage are not sufficiently commensurate with the effort involved.
There are too many opportunities for circumvention against which the Councilâs proposal offers no safeguards.
What about flat-rate contracts and the use of foreign mobiles from Brazil or Asia, for example?
Even the BDK, the trade union representing Germanyâs criminal police, has emphasised that it is the quality of data which is crucial, not necessarily the quantity or the retention period.
What we have in this case is a knee-jerk reaction, which merely creates the illusion of greater security.
We surely cannot seriously intend to store data on more than four million people generated by the use of the Internet, telephone calls and text messages.
If in doubt, we need only look across the ocean to the country that very often exceeds the bounds of reason in its anti-terrorism measures.
The US Congress rejected a similar bill on the retention of stored and processed data on the grounds â believe it or not â that the proposed measures went too far.
Instead, an agreement was reached on the âquick freezeâ mechanism, which is perhaps a suitable solution.
Why can the same thing not happen in Europe?
The German Bundestag has rejected the Councilâs proposal.
Finland has also warned against data retention.
What really riles me and puts me in a veritable lather is the news that the European Ministers of Justice plan to go against the recommendation of our committee and implement the Councilâs plans for the retention of data come what may, without parliamentary codecision.
In the light of the referenda in France and the Netherlands, it beggars belief that any attempt can be made to squeeze Parliament out of the decision-making process.
Such a move is downright dangerous.
We are not talking here about a single measure to combat terrorism but about public protection and the rights of every individual in this European Union.
For the Council to say in this context that it will decide unilaterally as it always has done will not bring the European Union any further forward.
The fact is that much of what has gone awry in the European Union and has shaken many peopleâs belief in the Union is due to the policies, often driven by self-interest, pursued by ministers of the national governments.
Â Â  Mr President, let me begin by commenting on EU action on justice and home affairs.
Criticism of the Hague Programme for placing undue emphasis on security considerations at the expense of respect for fundamental rights is justified.
It is not the remark of some left-wing agitator, but a sober assessment by the upper chamber of the British Parliament â the respectable House of Lords.
Of course, threats to our security are threats to our freedom, but the reverse is also true.
Undue infringements of our civil liberties make us less secure as individuals.
I fully support the work of the last four years to ensure that our law enforcement agencies shed their insular and bureaucratic habits, and that our legal and judicial systems are enabled to interact, so that terrorist suspects cannot slip through the cracks. But in the words of the European data protection supervisors meeting a few weeks ago: "Terrorism is used as a justification for new initiatives, many of which deal with a range of offences, some of which are significantly less serious.
It is important to recognise that derogations from fundamental rights that might be justified to tackle terrorism, will not necessarily be justified where other criminal or activity is concerned."
They look forward, as I do, to implementation of the suggestion, made by Commissioner Fratini when addressing a meeting of the Joint Supervisory Authorities, that the Commission would consider an assessment of proportionality of any measures to be introduced in future, examining the impact of the proposal on fundamental rights including the question of personal data protection.
Regarding exchange of information, the guiding norm adopted in the Hague Programme is the principle of availability.
That is entirely reasonable, as long as it means ending the kind of inexcusable turf wars and jealousies between agencies that prevent cooperation, but clearly it must not be misinterpreted to mean the abandonment of strict controls over retention, transfer and access to personal information.
I am concerned about the potential for profiling people as potential terrorists on the basis of their race, religion or political opinions.
The data protection supervisors are firm that the processing of such data should normally be prohibited.
The other area where serious concern exists is in respect of the rights of terrorist suspects.
The Council of Europe guidelines on detaining suspects without fair trial have certainly been breached in the United Kingdom and probably in other EU countries.
There has been a slide towards relying on evidence extracted under torture and rendition to those countries in breach of the ban on .
Member States conduct peer review of each other's anti-terrorism and security measures, but they still have not managed to make all Member States even implement the 2002 framework decision on terrorism â the very law which makes it obligatory to criminalise terrorism.
While it remains the case that Member States are not implementing their laws, I really find it unacceptable that we should continue to infringe personal liberties.
Â Â  Mr President, we are on the horns of a difficult dilemma, and in what we might call a chicken and egg situation; should we have sorted out democracy and put democratic and judicial controls in place, or should effective decision-making come first in order to bring about mass public support for a European democracy?
The answer is, of course, that we need both.
As Mr Oreja has already said, terrorism and the fight against it are outstanding examples of transnational issues, and that is why we should work together more effectively.
That is easier said than done, though, for 25 countries have 25 veto rights.
Decisions are drawn out, resulting in woolly compromises or, quite simply, in no action being taken at all.
In my view, countries should now jump over their own shadows.
At the same time, we should also acknowledge that the Council has to take decisions on very sensitive matters, which have an impact on civil rights.
That is another reason why the process of reaching them should be shrouded in such secrecy.
I think that the Council should start having meetings, and voting, in public.
Neither of these changes would require any change in the treaty.
It is simply a matter of opening doors.
I hope that Parliament will take joint action to enter into consultation with the Council on this subject.
Much has been said about terrorism being an attack on our fundamental freedoms and that we should thus not make the mistake of undermining those same civil rights.
Privacy is another much-quoted example.
Privacy is, of course, not sacred , but infringements should always be proportionate, necessary, effective and verifiable.
Indeed, the proposal to store communications traffic data is therefore outside of all proportion.
If the Council adopts it, Parliament should go to the Court of Justice.
Moreover, the Council trying to circumvent democratic control by taking this decision in the third, instead of the first, pillar offers us little comfort.
For indeed, once again, if we want to protect democracy from terrorism, we should not mess it up in the first place.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to thank all the rapporteurs for their reports, but when we talk about terrorism, we need to take particular care to present a clear position on the content of the term.
Indicative of the dangers lying in ambush when we give hazardous definitions is the difficulty being experienced by the international community itself and the UN in making an entirely objective interpretation of terrorism feasible.
Terrorism is a crime which we condemn unreservedly, provided that the term is not abused in order to prosecute liberating movements and radicalism.
Unfortunately, the degree of excess in the measures being adopted under the Action Plan allows conservative forces to justify taking measures which do anything but defend a climate of security.
At the same time, we need to be very careful with regard to the legislative framework into which we are trying fit terrorism, in order to ensure that it will not form the basis for military intervention, which would be contrary to the principles of international law and the founding Charter of the United Nations.
The plethora of measures taken by the European Union in its fight against terrorism is based mainly on the need for there to be a climate of security.
This is essentially the priority which has been set.
The taking of measures which will safeguard the peaceful coexistence of and a sense of security among the citizens of the European Union is not of secondary importance.
Under no circumstances, however, can they be safeguarded on the basis of the interests of big business, of curbing citizens' consciences and of strengthening the climate of fear and insecurity which is the result of excessive controls on and the reduction of it, for example in the human rights sector.
The Action Plan responds mainly to a given interpretation of terrorism and does not aim to resolve its deeper causes.
It responds mainly to existing hegemonic trends and does not address, as we think it should, the underlying cause, which is hunger, poverty, social injustice, the failure to respect civil and national dignity, discrimination, racism, the trampling underfoot of human rights in general and state terrorism.
Consequently, efforts to strengthen this plan in the direction and towards the objectives which it serves worry us and we consider that it cannot, as it now stands, constitute a solution for the creation of an area of real freedom and security.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have been the victim of terrorism.
At the television station which I manage in Athens, I have been on the receiving end of two bomb attacks.
The station was burnt to the ground and it is a terrible thing to see people surrounded by flames trying to save themselves.
I have also been attacked in my home.
I drive around in an armoured car with security.
I sleep with an Uzi under my pillow.
It is terrible to know that you can be attacked at any moment.
However, we must admit that terrorism has already won its first victories against democracy.
What are these victories?
The television cameras, the telephone tapping, the reductions in human rights and the biometric passports which are entering our lives.
All these are victories by terrorism, insofar as we are cutting back on democracy.
People use terrorism in order to impose global control.
They feed it.
When we say that terrorists are usually Islamic fundamentalists and then people go and urinate and spit on the Koran, are they not feeding Islamic fundamentalism?
We therefore have to look at it from the other side.
It is no good looking at terrorism from the benches of the European Parliament.
We need to look at terrorism from inside the caves in Afghanistan and from how someone there sees it, so that we can at some point have a communication code and resolve the issue.
Why does a millionaire prince not live in the casinos of London, why does he not live in the Bahamas and not in the lap, for example, of beautiful women, but goes to live and die in a cave?
We have to see it as it is.
Is it fanaticism?
That is the easy answer.
But what feeds this fanaticism?
Were we always so honest in the past?
Did we not have these areas of the planet enslaved for years?
Was our ally in the hunt for terrorists not guilty of the worst ethnic cleansing in centuries when it wiped out an entire race, the Red Indians?
Did it not base its progress on torturing and enslaving the Negroes?
Perhaps we too are not quite so correct?
What is our stand today?
Do we not have a one-sided stand on the Middle East?
