In the circumstances we need new elections and an election that is neither corrupt nor incompetent.
I will be voting accordingly.
Â Â  We support a free and democratic Ukraine and, thus, the main arguments of the resolution.
Ukraine is a potential member of the EU and must therefore be assured of democratic development.
We are definitely opposed, however, to the EUâs being given an increasing role within foreign and security policy.
As the only pan-European security organisation and as a monitor of the Ukrainian election, the OSCE should have the main responsibility for mediating in the conflict between the government and the opposition.
The EU should therefore operate within the framework of the OSCE.
Â Â  .â The hypocritical bombast about 'legitimacy', 'compromise' and 'democratic procedures' being bandied about in the European Parliament by the Members of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council cannot hide the undisguised and despicable interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine and the suppression of any concept of national independence.
Following the pre-electoral abuse from banned advertising and mass marketing, we are now passing to the stage of blatant intervention by the ÎU, the USA and Russia, in a bid to serve the pursuits of their imperialist powers in the huge geopolitical chess game and secure control of the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and the Black Sea.
The crisis which is raging does not seek to resolve the problems of the Ukrainian people and satisfy their demands for a socially orientated state and fair society.
Neither of the presumptive contenders for power wishes to safeguard anything of the sort, given that both were collaborators with the Ukrainian oligarchy and protagonists of the anti-grass roots and anti-labour policy exercised over recent years.
The interests of the ruling orders of the ÎU and the USA have been set against those of the new Russian commanding order and are confronting each other with such violence that they may lead the country and the region into unforeseen developments.
The Ukrainian people must confront these unfortunate prospects and must not allow themselves to be trapped between Scylla and Charybdis.
- Financial perspectives (B6-0189/2004)
Â Â  . We regret that the four amendments tabled by our group to the Resolution on the Financial Perspectives were rejected.
Accordingly, the Resolution does not condemn the strategy of the signatory countries to what is referred to as the âLetter of the sixâ, a strategy that the Council appears to support.
Their aim is to stifle debate on the Financial Perspectives by proposing that the EU budget be set at a maximum of 1% of the Community GNI, and, in so doing, to shift the focus away from funding social and economic cohesion in an enlarged EU and from other policies in this area.
The question of the duration of the next Financial Perspectives is also left open, in view of the five-year objectives laid down by the so-called European Constitution; we feel that the seven-year period â 2007 to 2013 â is more appropriate from the point of view of programming the structural policy.
Lastly, the Resolution makes an inappropriate connection between the debate on own resources, revenue, the Financial Perspectives and spending, which places the correction mechanisms of the main liquid contributors on the negotiating scales.
Hence our abstention.
Â Â  The June List has chosen to vote against the resolution because we do not under any circumstances wish to work in the service of âParliamentâs prioritiesâ.
All the debates, especially the negotiations prior to the 2005 budget, have clearly shown that a prevailing parliamentary majority would like to see a considerable increase in EU expenditure and, thus, also considerably increased membership fees for Sweden.
Instead, we support the Swedish Government and the other five countries that, in a joint statement, have made it clear that the EU budget, when it comes both to payments and commitments, should not exceed one per cent of the EUâs joint gross domestic income.
Parliament should also be free to review all expenditure, including agricultural subsidies, so as to be able to prioritise support for the ten new Member States.
The June List believes that a strict expenditure framework and a flexibility instrument within the framework of a one per cent budget would release a lot of creativity and provide a stimulus for new savings.
Â Â  We are fixing the budgetary ceilings for 2007 to 2013 in accordance with the âDelors packagesâ and the âSanter packageâ.
There are two problems where expenditure and revenue are concerned.
On the expenditure side, Parliament obviously wishes to increase this, while the Council wishes to place a ceiling on it of 1% to 1.2% of GDP for, after all, the budgetary austerity imposed upon the Member States should also be imposed in Brussels.
The dispute between extravagant MEPs and the thrifty Council gives way, however, to complicit silence when it is a question of the annual expenditure of EURÂ 30Â billion that will be entailed by the accession of Turkey, perhaps in 2011, that is to say during the financial planning.
Nothing has been provided for in this area.
In other words, budgetary estimates are undervalued by 30% from the very start.
On the revenue side, it is obviously the issue of own resources that is raised, given the British cheque and the injustices in the distribution of the âtaxâ burden between those states which make payments, such as France and Germany, and those states which receive funds, such as Greece and Ireland and the ten Eastern countries that have their tax dumping â relocation to the East â paid for by the tax slaves of the West.
Here too, however, there is silence concerning the European tax that is inexorably on the way.
Â Â  . As a Member of the European Parliament and especially given that I am from Portugal, I feel that the need to pursue policies promoting greater integration and cohesion in the EU â as called for in this report â must be a permanent element of the EUâs overall financial strategy.
Solidarity is one of the key principles on which our Community was founded.
It is also a substantial principle that cannot be turned into an equation that varies according to the fluctuations of the European average, particularly so given the downturn in that average resulting from enlargement.
Our objective should and must be to aim high and to create a Europe that is characterised by cohesion and solidarity as regards development and wealth.
Â Â  . â The problem of the future financing of the Community cannot be confined to the interinstitutional problem of relations between the European Parliament and the Council, despite the fact that this too is indicative of the stand of the plutocracy, with the sidelining of any representative bodies.
The basic issue is the political orientation of the use of EU resources and the extent to which it does or does not serve the working classes.
It has now been proven that Community resources and funds result in the redistribution of wealth; they are being grabbed from the workers and from the poor and less developed regions and are being given to big business and to the plutocracy and more developed regions of the EU.
Inequalities are increasing constantly rather than decreasing, the insecurity and uncertainty of the workers about their future is growing and is becoming a means for even greater exploitation of them by the multinationals.
The EU budgets express the economic policy and imperialist character of the ÎU and its reactionary and anti-grass roots orientations.
The package of funds proclaimed is proving to be ashes rather than gold for the workers and manna from heaven for big business.
The current conflict expresses internal oppositions by big business, not the interests of the workers, who are claiming satisfaction of their contemporary needs and fighting for the political orientations to change for the benefit of the majority of the people.
Â Â  . â The European Union is the worldâs largest donor.
World aid to combat AIDS has tripled in the last three years.
Even so, the figures contained in the latest WHO report are terrifying, and poverty is increasing.
A greater financial commitment is useful but not enough.
What needs to be discussed is above all the quality and effectiveness of the aid given.
The Commission should clearly set out its priorities for future action, so that the resources allocated to development are not diverted to other, different policies, such as security or conflict resolution.

What is needed is medicines, prevention and information; support for those groups closely affected by the disease: children with no parents to bring them up, and elderly people with no children to support them; research aimed at the public interest and not just for commercial ends; and action against all kinds of prejudice and against that kind of moralising that hinders prevention.

AIDS is not a distant reality.
In 2004 there has been a terrible increase in the number of cases in Russia and Ukraine, our new neighbours.
The social malaise caused by the reduction in the active population generates poverty, tension and conflict.
Therefore, the war on AIDS must also be waged in our own interests and for the sake of the stability that our Union represents.
Â Â  The global fight against HIV/AIDS is a very pressing issue that demands comprehensive international commitment.
We are nonetheless of the view that the HIV/AIDS issue should not be handled within the framework of EU cooperation.
We believe that the fight against HIV/AIDS should be conducted by individual EU Member States, as well as within the framework of the World Health Organisation (or WHO).
The June List aims at limited EU cooperation.
We are opposed to the EUâs having influence and competences in connection with issues that are already being dealt with by other international organisations.
Â Â  . The interminable spread of HIV/AIDS is a cause of major alarm to all of us.
The efforts that have been made have, for a number of years, been hampered by a shifting situation, which has affected diverse, and constantly changing, sections of the population.
This is true both of Europe and, more so, of the rest of the world, especially Africa, where it is a scourge of terrible proportions.
The situation requires constant efforts to combat any further spread and to invest in research and development in more effective therapeutic and preventative medicines.
The burden of that effort must be shared by the wealthiest countries in the world â our countries.
Â Â  . â By the time today's debate on AIDS closes, thousands of people will have died, many of whom might have lived if the huge pharmaceutical companies had not blocked the anti-virus drug production and importation process, so as to prevent the monopoly from being broken and its profits from falling.
'Copies' of drugs may offer relief, witness the example of Brazil which, by producing them and dropping prices by 79%, has reduced the aids mortality rate by 50%.
The statistics are disturbing: in Africa, only one in a hundred Africans can meet the cost of drug treatment.
In Zambia, one in three pregnant women suffers from AIDS.
Every day 8Â 200 people die.
That is capitalism: savage and barbaric.
It kills not only with weapons, but also by depriving people of basic human rights, such as access to medical care and treatment.
Rights which remain dead letters, while in practice health and medication have become commodities so that multinationals can make a profit.
This is the policy being promoted by the EU and the governments of the Member States who defend the interests of the monopolies.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are fighting solely for a free national health and welfare system and a nationalised pharmaceutical industry.
Only thus will health become a real right for everyone.
Â Â  Parliament has come to the end of its agenda.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 2Â December 2004.
With regard to Wednesdayâs agenda, in relation to the report by Mr Moscovici on Romaniaâs progress towards accession (A6-0061/2004), the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has presented a request that we postpone this report until a future sitting.
Â Â  â Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to point out that we are strongly in favour of Romaniaâs accession to the European Union.
We are, however, opposed to its accession being rushed through without it fully meeting the set criteria.
That would be bad both for the credibility of the European Union â particularly because other enlargements are also being prepared, as we all know â and for all those people in Romania who are fighting for the rule of law and against corruption, and it would work against the resolution of other serious problems, which have also recently been highlighted by the Commission.
That, Mr President, is why we have asked for this vote to be postponed and for a dialogue to be set up with the recently elected members of the Romanian Parliament, so that we can give credibility to a process that would have none if it were automatic and thus utterly pointless.
Â Â  . If I might put it quite briefly, Mrs Frassoni, we are not, this week, voting on Romaniaâs accession, but on the report, which has a number of favourable things to say, and a number of negative ones too.
We believe that we have to show Romania â right now, at a time when things are at a critical point â the way it has to go in the coming weeks, months, and perhaps years if it is to be able to accede.
That is why we are in favour of the debate and, ultimately, the vote on Romania happening this week.
So, speaking on behalf of my group, I want to express opposition to this contribution being deferred.
Also in relation to the Wednesday sitting, there is a proposed change to the agenda.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have both presented requests that we postpone the report by Mr Coelho on the establishment of uniform models for visas and residentsâ permits for third-country nationals (A6-0029/2004) until a future part-session.
Â Â  . Mr President, I was actually waiting for Mr Watson, but now I will do it myself.
I think a mistake has been made here, as the Coelho report that is on the agenda is not meant to be there yet; what should be there is the report dealing with the combating of cross-border vehicle crime.
I therefore ask that the report currently on the agenda be deferred and replaced on the agenda by MrÂ Coelhoâs report on tackling vehicle crime with cross-border implications.
Â Â  Mr President, I have no objection to moving the Dutch initiative on vehicle theft onto the agenda, as I feel that it would be a nice gesture to the Dutch Presidency for Parliament to state its position on what is, after all, a peaceful initiative, and one that does not cause controversy in this House.
What does not strike me as reasonable is that this should be done at the expense of the initiative on registers.
This is because the main thrust of the issue of registers is the introduction of biometric data.
In the last part-session in Brussels, Parliament stated its position on this issue relating to passports.
What we must now do is close the file on visas.
This is not a codecision issue.
The point is that Parliament gives its opinion to the Council and either Parliament submits this opinion in time to ensure that that opinion can influence the Councilâs decision or we lose due to ânon-appearanceâ, because the Council goes ahead and makes its decision in the absence of a Parliament position.
Our position was well-founded, having enjoyed the consensus of the Socialists in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and I see no reason why we should give up this vote in todayâs sitting.
I therefore believe, Mr President, that we could integrate the report on the Dutch initiative, which would be a nice gesture to the Presidency-in-Office, but without removing the visas report, which was, indeed, adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs by an overwhelming majority, including the Socialist vote.
Also for the Wednesday sitting, there is a proposed change to the agenda.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have both presented requests that we include in the vote at midday the report by Mr Coelho, on the initiative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for adoption of a Council Decision on tackling vehicle crime with cross-border implications, approved in accordance with Rule 43(1) of the Rules of Procedure (A6-0052/2004).
Â Â  . Mr President, I did actually think â and framed my request accordingly â that the Coelho report on vehicle crime with cross-border implications was to be dealt with rather than the report listed.
That was what I requested, and, as I understand it, Mr Coelho has no objection in principle to this report being discussed.
Â Â  According to the Rules of Procedure, in order to replace one report with another, we must first vote to remove the first one and then vote to include the second.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am putting this request forward on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and I do not think the other groups will object.
My request concerns the extremely serious situation in Cambodia, where a number of children who had been set free and entrusted by the authorities to an NGO have again been kidnapped by prostitution racketeers, while the staff of the NGO in question have received death threats.
The situation is truly very serious.
We have already dealt with the pressing business and I think all of the groups are in agreement with keeping Zimbabwe, Congo and Bhopal on the agenda.
We do not intend to oppose those topics, but we just ask to be able to address the Cambodia issue within the debate on the preparations for the European Council, to be held on Wednesday, so as to increase awareness in the Council and Commission.
We think that this would be the right thing to do, partly in view of the seriousness of the facts.
Those children have been forced back into the chain of prostitution, which notoriously serves a European clientele.
We therefore believe that dealing with this subject during the debate on the European Council would be an act of great sensitivity and I do not think any of the groups will object.
Â Â  What you have said does not relate to a change to the agenda.
The Presidency will not prevent any issue from being raised in the debate with the Council.
Â Â  Mr President, although we can do as you have said, might we ask you, after the debate, to perhaps write to the Cambodian Government in order to express this Houseâs great concern and disquiet at these events?
This would certainly be an appropriate way for us to deal with them.
Â Â  I am happy to do so, provided that there is consensus and no opposition.
Otherwise, we would have to hold a debate.
I shall communicate the European Parliamentâs concern, but we are not changing the agenda.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too am in full agreement on this point.
If you decide to send a letter to the Cambodian authorities, however, I should like to ask you to underline this episode in particular but also to refer to the overall situation.
As we all know, the Cambodian monarch has abdicated in protest at the general political situation and members of the Sam Rainsy party and the opposition have been threatened with death and with being expelled from Parliament.
I therefore fully agree with your initiative to send a letter, in which I ask you to express our extreme concern not just about this incident but about the overall state of legality and human rights.
Â Â  I am very happy to communicate that and other concerns, but I cannot write a letter analysing the specific political situation of a country and go into all the details which would be impossible to analyse without a debate and vote in Parliament.
There is a very specific issue which could be included in a letter, expressing an concern about that issue, but I do not believe I should go as far as to analyse the overall political situation in Cambodia without a prior debate and resolution by Parliament.
If there are no objections, therefore, my letter will be restricted to expressing concern about the issue raised by Mrs Napoletano, and I would invite you to debate the political situation in Cambodia in accordance with the appropriate parliamentary procedures, if you so wish.
I trust that you understand this, Mr Pannella.
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute speeches.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the difficulties experienced by European producers of soft fruit and those involved in the processing and preservation of such fruit prompted me to put the following question to the European Commission on 28Â OctoberÂ 2004: what steps does the Commission propose to take to protect soft fruit growers, particularly in the new Member States, as well as to ensure a profitable market for both producers and processors?
The Commissionâs answer of 16Â NovemberÂ 2004 included statements to the effect that these problems were the result of a bumper harvest, and that Polish producers should be able to place their products on the market under the most favourable conditions by making use of CMO funds.
Mr President, I did not ask what Polish producers ought to do, I asked what steps the Commission proposes to take to protect fruit growers and to ensure a profitable market for their fruit.
As I have not received an answer, I should like to ask you to take action.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to condemn the abolition in Spain of one of the principles of all democracies: the separation of powers.
The Government has just presented a law aimed at subjecting the judiciary to its decisions and, to this end, has had no hesitation in manipulating the law and parliamentary procedures.
When this law is implemented, the Spanish legal system will fall victim to great instability, inoperability and manipulation, by creating situations of deadlock in the General Council of the Judiciary which will prevent it from moving forward in its decision-making.
And those decisions will be subordinated to the wishes of the government.
This abuse will probably be analysed by the Constitutional Court, but the European Union cannot remain silent in relation to these actions, which remove the independence of the judiciary.
The Union must ask itself why a Member State is trying to take control of the operation of the government body of the judiciary.
If the European Union truly wants to become an area of freedom, security and justice, it must intervene in order to guarantee the independence of the judiciary in Spain.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, a month has now passed since I drew Parliamentâs attention to the fact that on 16Â September we adopted a resolution stating that a fact-finding mission would be sent to Vojvodina to report on acts of violence against national minorities.
Why does it take four and a half months to send a fact-finding mission?
In the meantime the acts of violence continue.
It shows incompetence and a lack of credibility on our part to wait four and a half months to investigate acts of violence against national minorities and to let four months go by without implementing the resolution that we adopted.
It is the credibility of the European Parliament that is at stake.
We need a general re-examination of the procedure by which Parliament monitors violations of human rights.
Â Â  Mr President, many of us have protested against the opening of a new gold mine in Rosia Montana, Romania.
The mining project would destroy the landscape, polluting the rivers and waters of the whole region with cyanide, from Romania through Hungary to the Black Sea.
The Romanian Government has the responsibility of stopping this awful project; however, the Canadian owners of the mining company should be mentioned as well.
I cannot believe that a European company would be allowed to demolish a whole city in Canada, with its houses, churches and cemeteries.
I ask the Canadian Government and the public to show the same respect to us Europeans.
Environmental pollution should not be exported.
Sharing the same planet means a common responsibility for us Europeans and for Canadians.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to bring to Parliament's attention â not for the first time, perhaps â the discrimination against many university students from the 10 new accession states who are studying in the 15 old Member States.
An example â and I have received complaints from these students â is that 19 medical students currently studying at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, Ireland, have been asked to continue to pay non-EU resident fees â many thousands of pounds every year â although Cyprus became a Member State of the European Union on 1 May.
This is very unfair, Mr President, and I ask you to intervene so that there is no unfair discrimination between university students from the 25 current Member States of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, a few days ago, the chairman of our PASOK party, Mr George Papandreou, met Patriarch Bartholomew in Istanbul and had the opportunity to reconfirm our support for the ecumenical character of the Orthodox Patriarchate, for the important spiritual and cultural work which it performs and for the international initiatives by the Patriarch for dialogue with religions and cultures and for environmental protection.
You too had a similar meeting very recently, Mr President, and I would like to welcome the acute humanitarian awareness which distinguished your statements.
As everyone knows, the Ecumenical Patriarchate has, for many centuries, been highly active in fostering the cultural and spiritual progress of orthodox nations.
It is the orthodox pole of Christianity in the world.
That is why I had to propose, given the special political and institutional influence which you wield, that you take an initiative with all the political groups to adopt a joint statement, both confirming the ecumenical character of the Patriarchate in Istanbul and the need for the Halki seminary to re-open immediately, and noting that defending and promoting the work of the Patriarchate does not jeopardise Turkey's national security.
Â Â  Mr President, while working in my electoral district at the weekend, I was told that, following a court ruling in Iran, another woman is expected to be stoned to death in three weeksâ time.
As this information came too late for a motion for urgent procedure, I would now ask the House to examine this case and, if need be, to take action against Iran.
I do not believe that this House, let alone the European Union, can tolerate actions of this kind on the part of states.
I therefore ask you, as a matter of urgency, to determine whether a young woman is indeed expecting to be stoned to death in Iran in three weeksâ time, and to intervene in so far as you are able should this prove to be the case.
Â Â  If you communicate very specific information to us, the Presidency will be very happy to set in motion the relevant mechanisms provided for in our Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, you will recall that during our last part-session in Strasbourg I raised the plight of the three hostages who were being held in Afghanistan.
I am sure that everyone is as relieved as I am that they were released and have now left Afghanistan and returned to their homes.
I thank you and your staff for your help and consideration and for the speedy representation you made to both the Council and the Commission.
It was good to have taken part, if only in a small way, in the release of the three hostages.
I believe it proves the necessity of applying maximum pressure at such times.
In a world of such bad news, it is good to hear such good news from time to time.
Â Â  Mr President, this Parliament has often discussed the issue of trade union rights in Colombia, but on behalf of myself and my colleague, Mr De Rossa, I ask you to intervene urgently in the defence of workers from the trade union Sintracarbon.
They have received death threats and extortion demands from illegal paramilitary forces engaged in negotiations with their employers, .
Mr President, on behalf of the European Parliament could you please send a letter calling for the protection of these workers to the company, to its European owners Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Glencore International, as well as to the Colombian authorities.
This Parliament must register its condemnation of the violent intimidation in Colombia or anywhere in the world against trade unionists simply trying to represent their members according to their rights under international law.
Â Â  Mr President, at our last part-session in Strasbourg, Mr Farage was warned of the legal consequences when he spoke about Mr Barrot.
The clear implication was that he could not speak his mind without fear of arrest or prosecution.
Amongst others, MrÂ Watson said so, although he himself had previously been rude about Marta Andreasen.
Many of us objected to this, but we did not object to Mr Watson's right to speak his mind.
I understood this House to provide immunity from prosecution or from reprisals for words uttered in this Chamber during a plenary session.
How else can a genuine parliament function, or is this not a genuine parliament?
After Mr Farage spoke, the question of French law was invoked.
We are on French soil but the relevance of French law is questionable, as we are endlessly reminded that EU law takes precedence over national law.
So my question is this: had Mr Farage the right to speak his mind as he did and, if not, how and on what authority is Members' freedom of speech in this House curtailed?
Â Â  What you have said offers me the opportunity to make a few comments in this regard.
In fact, at that moment, different views were expressed.
I would like to make it clear that Parliament is an extra-territorial body.
When it meets in Strasbourg, therefore, French legislation does not apply if it may affect the freedom of expression of any Member.
That must be made clear and I believe that we should all accept that a reasonable limit would be to ensure that our words do not question the honour of a fellow Member.
Under no circumstances can it be said that French legislation is applied in Strasbourg in order to restrict the freedom of expression of any Member.
I want to make that very clear.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to remind you and the whole of Parliament that in just three monthsâ time it will have been one year since the worst terrorist attack in Europe of recent decades.
I am referring to the attack in Madrid on 11 March 2004.
The work of the Committee of Enquiry on 11-M is coming to an end.
It has done a fantastic job and some of its conclusions are clear: it reliably and unequivocally confirms that Islamic radicalism was solely and exclusively responsible for that attack; the President, MrÂ RodrÃ­guez Zapatero, has today proposed an international pact against radical Islamic terrorism, and to this end it is essential that there be a dialogue between Europe and the moderate Islamic world; it also indicates the importance of preventing international terrorism, and that the Government of Mr Aznar was seriously at fault, both in terms of lack of preparedness and by manipulating public opinion between 11 and 14 March 2004, for purely party-political reasons.
Â Â  Mr President, between 25Â September and 19 October 1915, 61Â 000 British troops were killed, captured or wounded at the Battle of Loos.
At least 8Â 000 died, their bodies lost in the blood-soaked quagmire of the battlefield, a field which became a mass grave.
That field is in Auchy-les-Mines in northern France.
A few weeks ago that field was dug up by bulldozers to create a municipal rubbish dump.
Since the bulldozers moved in it has become impossible to move around the field without treading on fragments of human bones and remains, shreds of military uniform and military equipment.
The bodies of these thousands of brave men are being reburied underneath household and building waste.
I call on you, Mr President, to write to the authorities in Auchy-les-Mines to express our strongest condemnation of the desecration of the graves of these soldiers â men who gave their lives selflessly to preserve our freedom and democracy in this continent.
It is disgraceful that their resting place has been treated in this way.
Â Â  I take note of what you say.
We will consider what action we can take in that regard.
Â Â  Mr President, the economic and social life of the island communities of Scotland is very heavily dependent on the west-coast ferry routes.
The Scottish Executive, on legal advice and after consulting the previous European Commission, decided that under EU competition law these routes would have to be put out to private tender and private operators should be given the opportunity to take the contracts away from the state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne company.
Last week, in a highly unusual move â in fact it is only the second time since the Scottish Parliament was created that this has happened â the Scottish Parliament defeated the executive on this very issue and said that the Executive and the Commission should rethink their position on these lifeline services.
Mr President, given that the islands are now in a state of limbo â the parliament has stopped the executive from acting and the executive believes it has a duty to act under EU law â I would ask that you request the transport and competition Commissioners to examine this matter urgently and determine whether these island routes really have to be put out to tender under EU competition law.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to protest at the way in which Members of the European Parliament are treated like mechanical voting robots.
The speed at which some votes are conducted is an insult to human dignity and a denial of human nature, given that the latter imposes tight restrictions on the reaction times of the nervous and sensory systems.
Similarly, programmes of work for the individual committees are made available with so little time to spare before meetings that it is physically impossible to study them or even to familiarise oneself with individual items, particularly because translations appear quite literally at the last minute, especially those from Polish.
The Polish people experienced at first hand the disastrous attempts to create a Soviet being, and changes to human nature undertaken as part of the creation of a European economic being are also nothing but pathological discrimination.
This discrimination denies human dignity, rational expediency and common sense, and it results in disrespect for human beings.
We are therefore opposed to efforts to turn this Parliament into a mere sham, where democracy is only nominally present.
Â Â  Mr President, I had hoped in this speech to welcome a political breakthrough in Northern Ireland and to hail an irreversible abandonment by the IRA of its dirty war and its means of war.
Sadly, however, as so often in the past, while Sinn Fein IRA has talked the talk, it has failed to walk the walk.
Today, although mouthing commitment to democracy, it clings to the weapons of terror. Thus it continues to exclude itself from democratic government in Northern Ireland.
It prefers the click of the rifle to the click of the camera.
Camera shy, but terror proud.
Make no mistake, it is Sinn Fein IRA alone that has once again let the people of Northern Ireland down.
Democrats choose the camera shot, Sinn Fein chooses the rifle shot.
The challenge now is to let democrats move on without them.
Â Â  Mr President, during our last plenary sitting in Strasbourg we approved a new European Commission.
Like other major European institutions, it ought to be based on certain values and basic principles, such as equality between and amongst its Member States.
But if we look, for instance, at the distribution of civil servants' posts between the old and new Member States in the Commission, this is unfortunately not the case.
So far, less than a handful of the Commission's 265 most senior jobs are occupied by officials from the new Member States.
The Commission has reserved eight posts at A1 level and 29 posts at A2 level.
So far, however, only three of the Commission's 34 deputy directors-general and none of its 32 directors-general are from the new Member States.
This situation cannot continue.
The European Union is not George Orwell's , where all members are equal but some are more equal.
Rather, I would say that it should be a Community based on principles of equality and justice.
Therefore, I ask the Commission to come to Parliament with a regular progress report on this issue and I also urge the President of our Parliament to monitor the situation closely.
Â Â  Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, 13Â December is a sad day, as it is the anniversary of the imposition of martial law in Poland, a measure that was intended to halt the widespread move towards democracy.
I wanted to take this opportunity to say that this House has already heard on several occasions that MrÂ KovÃ¡cs is becoming the hero of Europeâs transformation.
Such statements have been made in particular by MrÂ Schulz.
I enjoy listening to MrÂ Schulzâs speeches, but only for his use of German, not for their actual content.
I should therefore like to repeat that it was not MrÂ KovÃ¡cs who was the hero, but the Polish workers in Lublin, in Åwidnik, and then in Gdansk in 1981.
I would be extremely grateful if the authentic historical facts were respected.
Â Â  Mr President, the presidential election in Ukraine has been, as regards democratic politics, rich in scandals, and now another one has come to light.
It became a matter of certainty on Saturday that Mr Yushchenko, a candidate for the presidency, had been poisoned.
After examining him many times over, doctors established beyond doubt that he had been poisoned with dioxin, and the rumour persists that the dioxin with which he was poisoned was administered orally, quite possibly during a meal with the secret services.
I therefore call on all European institutions and delegations to make an issue of this use of dioxin as a weapon, to take consequent action in Ukraine, and to press for the matter to be investigated without delay, without regard to the possible high rank of the persons involved.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I visited Tunisia on 10Â December on the invitation of two associations, the Tunisian Human Rights League and the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia, to join in their celebrations of the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
I regret to inform you that MrÂ Ben Aliâs security staff prevented the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia from holding its annual general meeting, in the process not hesitating to hit, beat up, and throw to the ground several militants from this association.
In the light of this, I believe that it is important to convey to the Council and the Commission that it is absolutely essential to implement the guidelines for the protection of defenders of human rights, because quite obviously MrÂ Ben Ali continues to hold all of those who represent civil society in Tunisia in total contempt.
Â Â  â Mr President, an important hearing was to be held around this time in a case that relates to events dating back to 1944, concerning the situation of Italian military and also civilian detainees.
The Federal Republic of Germany, instead of at last taking a positive approach to this legitimate request for moral rather than material reparation, is adopting legal delaying tactics and even taking the Italian Republic to court.
I am asking for intervention in this situation to bring this page in history to a close, as it is still an open wound left over from the Second World War.
Â Â  That concludes the speeches.
I am sorry I cannot allow any more speakers to take the floor.
Mr Posselt, do you wish to speak on a point of order?
Â Â  Mr President, I am one of those who worked for decades to make it possible for the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to be here in the European Parliament.
I rejoice that they are.
I would really like to say, though, that I would also be glad if you ...
Â Â  That is not a point of order.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Eurlings on Turkeyâs progress towards accession (A6-0063/2004).
Mr Eurlings has the floor.
Â Â  . Mr President, when I was given the responsibility of acting as rapporteur on EU-Turkey relations, I decided, while focusing on content, to write a fact-based report that would be fair and balanced.
Apart from the Commissionâs study and other reports, I have also based my findings on my frequent visits to Turkey.
Over the past few months, since the beginning of October in fact, I have spent more than two weeks in that country.
Let me tell you that I am impressed with the reforms that Turkey has carried out.
More has happened over the past few years than in the four decades previous to those.
In my report, I refer to Parliamentâs support in this, but the publicâs continued support for those changes are also decidedly impressive and worthy of congratulation.
At the same time, I have also become convinced â and have said so in my report â that more reforms are yet to follow and to be implemented.
Moreover, the present reforms must be implemented more effectively in order for Turkey to fully meet the political criteria.
Allow me, based on the positive remarks, to mention a number of areas in which a great deal is yet to be done.
First of all, human rights.
In legislation, the government has made much progress in this field.
Along with the Commission, the Council of Europe and all human rights organisations barring one, I too am of the opinion that there is no systematic torture in Turkey, but discussion as to whether it is systematic or not misses the real issue that is before us, which is that approximately one hundred cases of torture, reported by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other organisations, committed in police cells are far too many â one hundred too many for a country that really wants to grow towards Europe.
That is why this report devotes much attention to this issue.
An independent inspectorate, working together with NGOs and able to make random visits to police stations, must be set up .
In addition, it must be emphasised that it should become the practice for each reported case of human rights violation in police cells to be brought before the courts immediately.
Then there is religious freedom, an area in which there are still many problems, and in which not a great deal of progress has been made.
The Alevites, accounting for more than 30% of the population, are not fully recognised.
Religious minorities have problems related to property rights, to training for their priests, monks and clergy, but also, quite simply, to do with the recognition that they share in this Turkish identity.
I think there is a real need here for change, or as Mr Ali Birand, a well-known journalist of CNN Turk, put it last week: âLet Turkey become proud, also about those religious minorities, instead of holding them backâ.
The report makes clear statements about the necessary progress in religious freedom.
A third point concerns womenâs rights.
As with human rights, a great deal has improved in the area of womenâs rights, except that practice is in some ways far less promising, with forced marriages and crimes carried out to avenge honour, even including honour killings.
Turkey must, as a matter of urgency, invest in combating illiteracy among women and educating them more effectively, and NGOs offering those female victims shelter must be given strong back-up.
The report is quite clear about that too.
I have another three points to make.
Turkey has made many constitutional adjustments, but the Constitution itself dates back to a military era.
That is why, I think, it is important to state in this report that if Turkey really wishes to grow much further, we would advise it to draft a new Constitution.
I would now like to turn to the sensitive issue of Armenia.
In this respect, the report proposes setting up a bilateral committee of Armenian and Turkish experts to catalogue all the historical facts.
Furthermore, the borders with Armenia should be re-opened in order to bring about new relations in an atmosphere in which the wounds of the past can truly heal.
Last but not least, Cyprus.
I think that the report is abundantly clear about the recognition of Cyprus, about withdrawal of troops and about a push for fresh negotiations in a bid to achieve lasting peace and the islandâs reunification.
The report that is before you is constructive, but not naive, in my view.
Although it is realistic, it is also critical where necessary.
According to the report, the negotiations can be opened without any unnecessary delays subject to three conditions.
First of all, as the Commission has also mentioned, there is a real need for amendment of a number of laws and the adoption of some new ones.
I know that Turkey is in the process of doing just that.
Secondly, monitoring by the Commission must be fully underway.
Thirdly â and this is crucial to us and also to me as rapporteur â it must be made clear beyond any doubt that when negotiations are opened, the emphasis in the first stage of those negotiations will be on further fulfilling the political criteria in law, but also in practice.
I have made every effort to arrive at a level of cooperation in Parliament in which this balance is struck in a constructive, yet critical, manner.
I would ask all groups who have taken part in this to remain faithful to those compromises, even in this last, plenary, discussion.
Let me say as rapporteur, as I have also done in the report, that it is now up to Turkey to prove whether it can come up with the goods and whether, with further changes in the areas of human rights, religious freedom, womenâs rights, it can really achieve the standard that is necessary for EU membership.
It is now up to Turkey; the ball is in their court.
Whatever happens, we must anchor down the fact that cooperation between Turkey and the European Union will be very solid in future.
The report leaves no doubt in that respect.
In my view, what we should do now is to give a strong message to Turkey to seize that opportunity.
Turkey is being given this real opportunity, but we in this House must also send a clear message about our own relevance as Parliament, by checking in the years that lie ahead whether Turkey makes real progress and whether it does so to a sufficient extent.
The European Parliament must encourage Turkey in this.
I think that that is very important and that is why I hope that this report will, by the end of this week, turn out not only to receive the broad support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but also of this plenary of the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a great pleasure to be here today for your debate on Turkey as we approach the critical meeting of the European Council which will decide whether to open accession negotiations with Turkey.
I have followed Parliamentâs work on Turkey very closely and wish to commend Members of this House for their commitment to pursue a rational and analytical debate.
In particular I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, for the balanced report he has drawn up, as well as the Committee on Foreign Affairs for its valuable work.
The revised version of the report, which incorporates several compromise amendments, demonstrates the will of this House to obtain a broad consensus on the important issue we are discussing today.
In so doing, the report, , follows the line of the Commissionâs recommendation, and I very much welcome this support.
Turkey, as Mr Eurlings said, is indeed making progress in bringing into force the outstanding legislation identified by the Commission as needed in order to meet the political criteria.
We trust that the European Council will endorse our recommendation and decide to open the accession negotiations with Turkey, as long as this conditionality is met.
The Commission has proposed a negotiation strategy based on three pillars.
The first pillar supports the reform process in Turkey.
Legal and political reforms must be broadened and their implementation consolidated to make them truly irreversible.
Many of the issues mentioned in Mr Eurlingsâ report will require further attention.
I refer in particular to the further consolidation of cultural rights, improving the situation of religious communities, strengthening the fight against torture and ensuring full civilian control of the military.
Since 6 October, when our recommendation was adopted, there have been further encouraging developments.
For instance, the new law on associations and the code of criminal procedure have been adopted.
With the appointment of a civilian Secretary-General, the National Security Council is being transformed into an advisory body and its activities are becoming more transparent.
I can assure the Members of this House that the Commission remains committed to monitoring Turkeyâs compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria.
These criteria are not subject to any negotiation.
The second pillar relates to the framework for accession negotiations with Turkey, taking into account the specific characteristics of the country.
This does not mean discrimination.
Turkeyâs accession would be different from previous enlargements because of the combined impact of Turkeyâs population, size, geographical location, economic, security and military potential.
For example, I would remind you that Turkeyâs population is close to that of the ten new Member States which joined the Union this May.
The prospect of Turkish EU accession raises many legitimate questions, concerns and worries.
It is our duty as democratic politicians to address these concerns of public opinion.
Therefore, the third pillar of our approach to Turkey will be geared towards strengthening the political and cultural dialogue between EU and Turkish citizens.
It is clear that the European Parliament can and should play an important role in pursuing this project.
I would like to turn briefly to Cyprus, on which I largely share the language in your report.
In June the European Council welcomed the positive contribution of the Turkish Government to the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.
Efforts to find a settlement must be renewed.
It is clear that accession negotiations would be held in the framework of an intergovernmental conference comprising 25 Member States on the one hand and Turkey on the other.
We also expect Turkey to sign a protocol extending the Association Agreement to all 25 Member States.
EU-Turkey relations have a long history.
The Turkish membership perspective dates back to the Association Agreement in 1963.
In spite of the ups and downs witnessed in the last 40 years, the Turkish vocation to join the European Union has been reaffirmed many times by the European Council, especially since Helsinki in 1999.
Turkey is at present going through a process of radical change, including a rapid evolution of mentalities, as described by Mr Eurlings.
The prospect of accession has proved to be a very important catalyst for Turkey to embark upon far-reaching constitutional and legislative reforms.
I am convinced that the negotiation process will help to guide further reforms in Turkey.
By its very nature, this is an open-ended process whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand.
The ultimate objective of accession negotiations is accession: an alternative to accession is not on our agenda.
To conclude, the necessary preparations for Turkish accession could last well into the next decade.
The EU will evolve over this period, and Turkey should change decisively and fundamentally.
In any event, these accession negotiations need to be managed carefully and prepared thoroughly in order to facilitate such a process and an outcome that enhances the achievements of fifty years of European integration.
This is our shared goal, and I trust that we will all do our best to succeed in this objective.
Â Â  . Mr President, today you will debate an important report by Mr Eurlings on the 2004 regular report and the recommendation of the European Commission on Turkey's progress towards accession.
This debate is timely in view of the decision the European Council will take on Friday with regard to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey.
When we look back to the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999 and try to visualise where Turkey was at that moment in terms of its preparation for the EU, we can conclude that Turkey has made impressive progress.
It is no exaggeration to state that Turkey is changing with almost revolutionary speed.
The fall of the Berlin Wall created the conditions for rapid change in the central and eastern European countries that have become new EU Member States since May this year.
For Turkey there was no such catalyst for change except the long-standing aspiration to join Europe and probably the desire for drastic economic change after the devastating economic crises in 2000 and 2001.
It is interesting to note in the Commission report of October the increasing interaction between the drive for accession and the tremendous modernisation that the Copenhagen criteria have stimulated in Turkey.
The Commission quite rightly concludes that this modernisation is in the interests of both Turkey and the European Union and concludes that accession, if well-managed, would offer important opportunities for both.
At the same time, it is true that the challenges on Turkey's road to Europe are still considerable.
This has also been recognised in the report by your rapporteur.
The report notes the earlier commitments vis-Ã -vis Turkey and welcomes the substantial reforms Turkey has achieved in order to comply with the Copenhagen criteria.
The report also mentions a number of concerns that still exist with regard to the implementation of the reforms.
The report considers that accession negotiations should be opened without undue delay and underlines three important provisions.
Firstly, in the first phase of the negotiations priority should be given to the full implementation of the political criteria.
Secondly, the six important remaining pieces of legislation should be adopted and brought into force prior to the beginning of the negotiations.
Thirdly, all mechanisms envisaged by the Commission to ensure close monitoring and intensive political dialogue and the possible suspension of negotiations should be fully effective.
I also want to mention another important element that has been raised in the report by your rapporteur, as well as by the Commission.
In the report the need is underlined to inform citizens of both the EU and Turkey, through an intensive political and cultural dialogue, in order to increase awareness of the integration process and foster mutual understanding.
I fully agree with this.
Like the Eurlings report, the Council has in its preparation for Friday's decision taken the Commission's report and recommendations as its point of departure.
They provide a thorough, comprehensive and good basis for the decision on the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey.
Today the Council discussed the draft conclusions in preparation for the decision that the European Council will have to take on Friday.
This decision entails more than a simple 'yes' or 'no' to the question of whether or not to open accession negotiations with Turkey.
As the Commission has already stated in its recommendations and as I can see in the Eurlings report, the clear advice is that the decision will need to be inextricably bound up with, for example, close monitoring of the reform process to ensure the irreversibility of that process and its full, effective and comprehensive implementation.
In addition the Commission has, in its recommendations, addressed concerns in Europe relating to Turkey's accession â for example concerns about the budgetary impact, or about the free movement of workers.
In other words, this decision on Turkey will also have to be sufficiently forward-looking.
The Netherlands presidency has extensively consulted Member States in order to prepare for a sustainable decision on Friday that does justice to the interests of the European Union and of Turkey.
Last Tuesday the Prime Minister of the Netherlands visited Greece and Cyprus: two countries that, as close neighbours, have specific interests in this decision.
Today the Prime Minister went to Berlin and Paris; tomorrow he will be in Austria.
I was in Turkey last week, where I had the chance to meet Prime Minister Erdogan and the Foreign Minister, Mr Gul.
As you know, Turkey also has a number of concerns, such as the suggested permanent safeguard clauses and the Commission's paragraph saying that by their very nature negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand.
Lastly, Turkey is afraid that new criteria other than the political Copenhagen criteria will be imposed.
I know that you have already had and today will again have an intense debate on Turkey, including on the elements of the decision that I have mentioned.
I welcome this.
I am convinced that a comprehensive debate on Turkey's accession to the EU is a prerequisite for a good outcome.
For the decision to be sustainable we need political and public support.
The Netherlands presidency is working towards a fair and balanced decision that will be based on the fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria.
In this context we welcome the thorough and constructive work undertaken by your rapporteur and the Committee on Foreign Affairs in this regard.
We look forward to a resolution being adopted by Parliament on 15 December.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Friday, the seventeenth day of December, the Heads of State or Government have a decision to take, and it is one of far-reaching significance.
Never before in the history of the European Economic Community, of the European Community and of the European Union has there been a decision with such potential for far-reaching consequences as that on Turkeyâs membership of the European Union.
Everyone must be aware that, should Turkey become a Member State of the European Union, that Union will undergo a change in character.
In our group, as is inevitable, different people take different positions on this.
Let me point out that other parties, too, include former Heads of Government who speak up in favour of Turkish membership or against it.
In our group, that of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we affirm that we cannot accept any binding obligations, that nothing is automatic, that nothing can be laid down on the basis of things said to one effect or another by former Heads of Government.
We affirm that the Turkey issue is a matter of conscience or something very close to one, and so we do of course accept that each and every Member will vote according to his or her conscience.
I would like to thank our colleague Mr Eurlings most warmly for his report and for giving human rights such a high priority in it.
What the Commission is recommending is open-ended negotiations, albeit with membership as an end in view, and tomorrow evening will see our group deciding what position to take on this.
There are those in our group who would rather not have any negotiations and who are saying from the outset that they would prefer another form of partnership, to which we have given the name of âprivileged partnershipâ.
There is another faction that wants negotiations to have membership of the European Union as their objective, and a third seeking negotiations towards the goal of an alternative partnership, which would also be a privileged one.
What all three positions have in common, though, is that they see Turkey as a large and important country, whose partner we want to be and with which we want to live on amicable terms.
Those in our group who either do not want negotiations or want them to tend towards a privileged partnership â among whose number I include myself â are gravely concerned that, should Turkey join the European Union, this enlargement might prove fatal and Europeans might lose their identity, that it might be detrimental to the sense of being âusâ on which solidarity in the European Union is founded.
We in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party have entrusted Mr Wolfgang SchÃŒssel with the task of coordinating our position, and, Mr President-in-Office, as unanimity will be required at the summit, I would advise â and require â you in the Presidency of the Council to be flexible enough to guide it towards a unanimous conclusion.
If there are to be negotiations, then it has to be said â frankly and fairly, while acknowledging the progress Turkey has made â that we will be in the very remarkable situation of negotiating with a country in which human rights are violated on a massive scale.
We have heard it said, in the most absurd utterance of the year, that there is no systematic torture going on, but if torture is not systematic, it is certainly extensive.
We also know that negotiations are going on with the governments as well, and so the governments with which Turkey is conducting negotiations include that of Cyprus, a country that does not even exist as far as Turkey is concerned.
There is something illogical about that.
We ask that the Turkish Prime Minister should not accuse us of exploiting the Turkey issue for our own internal policy purposes.
On the contrary, we are engaged in discussions with the public, and we have to carry the people with us if we are to unite Europe.
Nor are we applying more stringent standards to Turkey; it is a country of a size that we have never seen in previous accession processes, and that is why all this has to be discussed very, very carefully.
What we must aim for is that we should have a future as a democratic and energetic European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am able to start my speech by saying something positive: Mr Eurlingsâ report is in every respect more nuanced than MrÂ Poetteringâs speech.
Let me say on behalf of those of my colleagues who have worked with him in the Committee on Foreign Affairs that the rapporteur has taken a great deal of trouble to achieve a broad consensus, and in that he has succeeded.
I see the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs as having showed that the line he took in this report â with the addition of elements contributed by our group â has resulted in a broad consensus which can also serve as the basis for a similarly broad consensus here in the plenary, and in that there are three significant points on which our group vigorously dissociates itself from what Mr Poettering has said today.
Firstly, why is it so simple for Mr Poettering to float his theory that the EU would undergo a change in its nature if Turkey were to join it?
If Turkey were to join the EU as it is, it would have to make itself subject to the EUâs as a whole.
If Turkey joins the EU, then, because we all want the Constitution, it would have to make it the basis of its internal policies as soon as it has been ratified.
The European Charter of Fundamental Rights will then become constitutional law and binding in a Member State, namely Turkey.
It will then be demonstrated that the values defined in that Charter, which are the fundamental values of our Union, can be accepted by a country of whose population 99% or 98% are Muslims.
If we succeed in integrating Turkey into the European Union, then it will effectively demolish the Islamic fundamentalistsâ theory that Western â that is, our â values and Islam are mutually exclusive, for it would then provide the proof that the fundamental values for which we contend are fundamental values for all people, whether they be Jews, Muslims, Christians or unbelievers.
It is this advance, Mr Poettering, pure and simple, that compels us to commence these negotiations.
There is a second point that we should not underestimate, that being the reforms that Turkey has pushed through in recent years, which were set in motion by ErdoÄan, and which are â let me say so plainly â markedly more progressive than all the trifling reforms tackled by previous governments, whether conservative or social democrat.
Nine years ago â it was 15 December 1995 â I was one of the three rapporteurs on customs union with Turkey, at a time when Mrs Ãiller was that countryâs prime minister, about which I will say no more at this point.
At that time, she said to us, âFor heavenâs sake, let us have this customs union, or you will be driving us into the arms of the Islamists.â
Nine months later, she formed a coalition with â as we know â MrÂ Erbakan.
That is in the past; the credibility gap has been forgotten.
ErdoÄan has indeed set in motion more reforms than his predecessors in government.
The only thing is that they are not enough, but all those people we have been talking to in Turkey, as Mr Eurlings can confirm â all those campaigners for human rights, for womenâs rights, all the democratic organisations, all the pro-democracy associations, both the employersâ organisations and the trade unions â all have been telling us that the prospect of accession to the European Union has changed their country, that the prospect of accession to this Union will make their country a normal parliamentary democracy.
All this will not be accomplished as soon as tomorrow morning.
If it happens, accession will come at some point at the end of the next decade, but the opportunity, the prospect, of seeing this great country become a normal Western democracy is a peace dividend that we must not cast aside.
Let me ask you, Mr Poettering, what will happen if you reject the Turks?
What will happen if the reform process is cut short?
Is this a risk you can take?
That is the question I put to you.
Tell us what would happen in a privileged partnership if the reform process were to be halted in its tracks?
That is what we need to hear from you, but you have nothing to say on the subject!
This is what we have to say, and it is our third argument: if we succeed in making Turkey democratic and stable, if Western values succeed in putting down roots in its society, if we give the Turks the chance to become what they want to be, in other words, people in Europe, accepting European values for themselves, then we will be creating a European Union that will be making a reality of its peace process, its potential for peace and for the stabilisation of democracy in a region that more than ever needs democracy, human rights, social security and peace.
It is these very things that we in the European Union should be exporting to Turkey â if all goes well!
That it will is not a given.
Nobody can say at the outset of this process whether it will really be successful, but it would be negligent not to try, and so, Mr Eurlings, we, as a group, will be voting in favour of your report.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the majority of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the Eurlings report because, apart from a number of compromises to which I shall return later, it essentially calls on the governments to open negotiations without undue delay and makes it clear that the aim of the negotiations is the accession of Turkey as a full Member State of the European Union.
Many of us would certainly have preferred a clearer and, in some way, less tortuous report.
We have all too often said â and continually repeated to Turkey â that the negotiations are intrinsically open-ended and that therefore the outcome is not a foregone conclusion.
Of course, we cannot say that we want permanent safeguards regarding the free movement of people, because that would be a breach of the Treaty, irrespective of the people concerned.
In legal terms, it would be a breach of the Treaty, whether the Commission likes it or not.
Even so, we are dealing with a compromise in which I believe we should continue to have faith.
Ladies and gentlemen, let me say that the debate today is not so much about Turkey but rather about Europe.
It is about finding out whether this Europe is a trustworthy partner in international relations.
It is about finding out whether we still keep to our word after forty years.
It is about finding out what our identity is, Mr Poettering.
I believe that the identity of the European project consists in its being a political project and not a geographical project or a religious one.
I also believe that our identity does not reside so much in our past and our roots â which some would claim to be completely Christian or Catholic â as in our present and, especially, our future.
Our past has seen not only glories but also wars and bloodshed.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe instead that our identity is represented by the last fifty years, in which we have tried and to some extent succeeded in bringing about the rule of law, the separation of powers and the secularisation of our institutions, as well as the protection of human and political rights as an essential part of human development.
That is our identity, and that is the project in which the Turkish people and government are asking to take part.
I believe the stakes are these: either we choose a self-confident Europe that is able to deal with the problems and challenges that it faces â which range from difficult relations with the Islamic world to immigration and lasting differences â a Europe which is starting the negotiations not lightly or ingenuously but fully aware of their political consequences, or we choose a Europe which, perhaps out of respect for its Catholic-Christian identity, curls up into a ball and thinks it can best defend the well-being we have obtained by shutting itself off from the challenges that it faces.
Ladies and gentlemen, those are the stakes.
The issue is Europe, and that is what we need to debate.
That, for me, is the Europe in which it is worth believing; that is the Europe for which it is worth fighting, that is the Europe which will, in some way, inspire respect in our fellow citizens and on the international stage.
I do not believe that tortuous or ambiguous arguments, whatever they may be, can measure up to our present, to our future or, above all, to what we have achieved so far.
Â Â  . Mr President, my group also supports this report as it is now before us, following amendments in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
As the rapporteur has already stated, it is a critical, but constructive report.
That does not mean that we agree with every paragraph â that is also why our group has tabled amendments â but we support the basic ideas in it.
I should like to respond to two positions in the debate, not only in that conducted in the European public square, but also in this House.
Let me start with the position of those who are simply opposed to Turkish membership.
Mr Poettering has put this into words and there is no time to go into all those arguments.
What I should like to alert you to is the attempt, by means of amendments, to include this position in Mr Eurlingsâ report after all, by anticipating, sometimes in a toned down version, the possible failure of the negotiations and to refer back to other forms of relations between Turkey and the European Union.
Let me be quite clear.
It is not for this House to labour the obvious or to reward the Christian Democrats for the way they make politics with symbols.
The report is very clear on this point.
The negotiations must be opened as soon as possible and without any unnecessary delays.
Nothing in life is certain; that also applies to these negotiations, but the objective, namely full membership, must be clear-cut.
That is unambiguous, and it should stay that way.
I urge you to vote down all attempts to do away with this clarity.
A second position is adopted in the debate by those critics who feel that too little has happened and that far more should happen, particularly in the area of human rights.
I do not propose to mince words about that either.
Together with the President, Mr Borrell and MrÂ Eurlings, I visited Turkey only last week, and spoke to many people in Istanbul, Ankara and also in Dyabakir.
We spoke with human rights activists, lawyers and religious minorities.
They all said that indeed, there is still a great deal amiss in Turkey; some said that we are only halfway there.
However, at the end of all those talks, they all pleaded with us to open negotiations, those being the best guarantee of success for the reforms that are now taking place.
Moreover, they are the best encouragement for all those people who, over the past fifteen years, have risked life and limb to dedicate themselves to reforms.
Both the Commissionâs report and that produced by MrÂ Eurlings contain sufficient guarantees to simply suspend negotiations in the unlikely event of future deteriorations in the area of human rights.
If you value those human rights, if you really think that torture should be forced back further, if you think that the Kurds should acquire rights not only on paper but also in practice, then I urge you to vote in favour of opening negotiations.
That does not mean that things will change tomorrow, or that things will be easy.
I realise this, and so do the Turks, but the opportunity is there, and we should not spoil it.
I really do hope that, during Wednesdayâs vote, Parliament will finally be capable of taking a strategic decision with implications that stretch far beyond Europe, and that the European Council will do likewise two days later.
As Mr Schulz has already pointed out, Turkey can demonstrate that democracy and Islam very much go hand in hand.
That is the best antidote against the sceptics who are monopolising the issue in Europe at the moment and who claim that this will never be possible.
Turkey can demonstrate that it is possible, and Europe can demonstrate that it can contribute to preventing a clash of civilisations between the West and the Islamic world, a clash for which many fundamentalists in the East and West are hoping.
Europe can show that, based on shared values, there is room for more than one culture and that in the Europe of the twenty-first century, there is room for more than one religion.
Â Â  . Mr President, in order, right at the start, to comply with MrÂ Schulzâs demand for a nuanced approach, let me make it clear that my group will, on the one hand, vote by a large majority for the commencement of negotiations with Turkey and will expressly endorse what is set out in the report, namely that these negotiations should have Turkish membership of the EU as their objective, but that we do, on the other hand, have serious problems with the report itself.
This is no fault of Mr Eurlings, who has struck me as being very competent and committed in this matter.
I have to say, though, and with regret, that I am both disappointed and surprised that â of all people â the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens, on all the practical issues in which the negotiation process could have measured further progress in terms of time and impact, have rejected amendments to that effect.
The report we have before us is balanced in its criticisms, but those criticisms are metaphilosophical and so generalised that we can hardly get to grips with them.
Whilst we acknowledge that Turkey has seen considerable positive changes in both the political and legal spheres over the past two years, it must actually be possible to expand on the fact that the reality is often rather different.
In a report that twice, and rightly, addresses the problem of the Greek Orthodox seminary at Halki, it must also be possible to address the issue of the four million Kurds who are refugees in a country in which over four thousand villages have been destroyed.
In contrast to other issues, these things have not been specifically mentioned in this report, and I suspect that this has been done in order to avoid providing opponents of Turkish accession with ammunition.
Yet Mrs Bonino has drawn attention to the problem that these thorny issues touch upon the substance, the presuppositions, and the potential value of the principles on the basis of which the European Union exists, and I believe this, tactically speaking, to be quite the wrong road to take.
My group will have no part in this sort of relativism.
We will take the negotiating process as an opportunity to further set out those things that â as I have learned from other Members â are the necessary practical details of what Socialists and Greens have long demanded.
With fellow Members of this House, I visited the small Kurdish town of Kiziltepe, where, on 21Â November, a lorry driver and his twelve-year old son were shot dead.
The governor announced that two armed terrorists had been killed.
In any EU Member State, a governor would have had to step down for that.
That is the standard we will continue to apply.
I want to conclude by saying something else. We will not allow Turkey to gain, rather than a privileged partnership, the discriminatory membership that the Commission envisages.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the major controversies surrounding the opening of negotiations about Turkeyâs accession to the European Union, frankness is called for.
It is precisely that praiseworthy attitude that our rapporteur, MrÂ Eurlings, exemplifies.
Last Saturday, he told the Dutch press in plain terms about his concern at the complaints lodged by Prime Minister Erdogan about Brussels.
The Turkish Prime Minister and the President of the Turkish Parliament very much create the impression that their country already complies with the political criteria for accession.
To sum up, Brussels is apparently asking too much of Ankara on this crucial subject.
Nothing is further from the truth, though.
That bodes well for the Council and Commission if the unexpected decision is taken this week to open negotiations with lamenting Prime Minister Erdogan.
According to the rapporteurâs findings, Paragraph 4 of the report can in any event be duly deleted.
After all, that paragraph alludes in jubilant terms to the persistently strong motivation and political willingness of the Turkish Government and the Turkish Parliament to grow towards the European Union.
I on my part have also been very frank to the rapporteur about the fundamental lack of religious freedom in Turkey.
Words fail me, in fact, for the frankly small-minded attitude of the Turkish authorities towards various minuscule Christian minorities on their territory.
Suffice to look at the of the past few weeks, but also Fridayâs .
Although in this light, I very much value the critical stance adopted by Mr Eurlings in this basic violation of human rights, I believe that he is still concerning himself too much with fighting the symptoms.
That is why I would once again urge him to back my amendment in which the Council and the Commission are asked to demand from the Turkish authorities, in line with the political criteria of Copenhagen, legal personality for the Christian churches with immediate effect and the immediate abolition of the Presidium for Religious Affairs.
This latter request does, in fact, do away with another intractable political myth, namely that of the secular Turkish State, with the discrimination against non-Sunnites that this entails.
Under the category of non-Sunnites, there is also the considerable minority of Alevites.
Along with the large Kurdish community, they do not wish to be considered minorities but as an integral part of the Turkish Republic, and, indeed, as its co-founders.
Europe does well to keep well away from explosive Turkish political issues such as those, on pain of its own implosion.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, many advantages could certainly be gained from Turkeyâs accession to the European Union. Such advantages would include an extension of the common market, which would be of great economic benefit, and undoubtedly also a strengthening of transatlantic links.
Yet on closer analysis, it emerges that both these goals can be achieved with relative ease without Turkey joining the European Union.
The European Economic Area is an excellent example of a platform for good economic cooperation between the EU and non-EU Member States.
It could also be useful to propose to Turkey an appropriate reform of security policy, as the country is one of Europeâs major strategic partners in the field of security.
A privileged partnership of this kind with Turkey would have another major advantage for us, as it would provide us with the chance of avoiding a full-scale crisis of agricultural policy and cohesion policy.
Reform of both these policies is self-evident and necessary, in particular in the case of agricultural policy, but it would be an extremely negative development if such a reform were to be carried out merely because there was a chance of Turkey joining the European Union.
Privileged membership of this kind would also provide us with an opportunity to forestall further social problems relating to migration.
The latter are becoming ever more prevalent in todayâs Europe, and ever more difficult to resolve.
If we wish to avoid migration-related conflicts, we should not turn a Muslim country into the European Unionâs largest Member State, which is what Turkey would become in 2020, for example.
This could give rise to civil unrest, something we should be endeavouring to prevent in Europe.
The stepping up of relations with Turkey should also be kept more in proportion to Europeâs policy of openness towards Ukraine.
Relations with Ukraine have not been neglected through Ukraineâs wishes or Ukraineâs fault.
It was also not Ukraineâs fault that it was a Soviet republic in 1963.
These are all good reasons why we cannot vote in favour of this report.
We also feel the report was over-sentimentalised in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and we consider it to be imprudent.
If we speak so lightly of Turkeyâs membership in the European Union, we will build up stores of resentment in Turkey, a country that should be our friend.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party, which declares its support for the Eurlings report and hence for the opening of negotiations with Turkey.
Turkeyâs accession would confirm the nature of the European Union as an open, tolerant society that draws strength from its diversity and is bound together by shared values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
Furthermore, since it offers an alternative model to the closed, sectarian society proposed by Islamic fundamentalists, Europe could play an invaluable role in future relations between the West and the Islamic world.
In more general terms, there is no doubt that, at a time when Europe is committed to taking on greater responsibilities in world politics, Turkeyâs accession would considerably strengthen the Unionâs ability to become a major actor on the international political stage, especially in hotspots such as the Middle East, the Black Sea basin, the southern Caucasus and central Asia.
In addition, as confirmed by the OECD, Turkeyâs accession could give added value to Europeâs economic weight in the world, because of its huge geographical area, its considerable natural resources and its young, highly qualified workforce.
The opening of accession negotiations will be both a point of arrival and a point of departure. It will be a point of arrival because Turkeyâs first request to join the then European Economic Community dates right back to 1959.
Over the intervening years the country has modernised and achieved some important results as a result of incisive reforms and innovations that have taken place especially in the last two years.
The opening of negotiations will, however, also be a point of departure, since the duration and outcome of the negotiations, which can start as soon as Turkey meets the Copenhagen political criteria, will depend on the progress made, particularly with regard to the economy and the Community .
The European Union and Turkey thus appear to be united by a major challenge: to lay the foundations for tomorrowâs Europe together.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating MrÂ Eurlings on his excellent work on an issue which, as this debate has demonstrated, is controversial and difficult.
It has genuinely given rise to decisive support for beginning negotiations.
On the other hand, some Members have expressed their fundamental opposition.
I believe that this debate should be carried out calmly and on the basis of objective considerations.
The Helsinki European Council made the decision that Turkey should become a candidate country.
The Prodi Commission has issued a positive opinion on the beginning of negotiations, which, as Mr Rehn has told us, has been accepted by the Barroso Commission.
Turkey is linked to the European Union by means of an association agreement and is part of the Customs Union.
At the same time â and this should be pointed out because it is of significance in this debate â Turkey is a loyal partner of the West within the Atlantic Alliance and, in my opinion, the question we have to ask at this point, given Turkeyâs strategic position, which is absolutely essential in terms of the transit of oil from the Caspian Sea and the decisive role it plays in terms of the stability of the Middle East and Central Asia, is whether we want Turkey to be linked to the European Unionâs Western system of values or whether we want Turkey to move towards Islamic fundamentalism or become part of Russiaâs sphere.
The response to Mr Eurlingsâs report is critical but constructive and I believe there are other issues on the table, which are also legitimate, such as whether European public opinion is yet prepared to accept Turkey as a member of the Union.
But time and the citizens of the European Union will provide the answer to that question in good time.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, Commissioner, I should like to start by saluting MrÂ Eurlings and thanking him for the high quality of his report and the spirit of openness that he showed throughout the process of compiling it.
The report has been substantially modified by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but as it now stands here in the plenary, it recommends opening accession negotiations with Turkey without undue delay, and recalls that the objective of these negotiations can only be accession and nothing else.
These two points are in line with what the majority of my group wants.
That is why a large number of us in the Socialist Group will be voting in favour of it, unless one of these points is called into question by an amendment adopted in the sitting.
In any case, it would send a very strong message to Turkey if this report were to be adopted by a substantial majority.
I should like, MrÂ President and MrÂ Eurlings, speaking in a personal capacity, to express two regrets about the nature of the debates that we have just held.
The first concerns the tone of our spoken and written comments.
The twentieth century was a very violent one for Turkey.
The evidence of this is plain to see: in Cyprus, in its relations with the Armenian and Kurdish peoples and also in the prominent role played by the army and the police in the internal socio-political organisation of the country, where they remain all-powerful.
We are all aware of this.
In the same way, many nations that are now members of the Union have also experienced totalitarian, fascist or communist governments or governments guilty of collaborating with an occupying power.
Building the Union is a process of reconciliation with all of this.
The prime reason for opening accession negotiations with any country is to set such a process in motion, and this will only succeed if there is a minimum of confidence in the effectiveness of this process both within the Union and in the candidate country itself.
In fact, these insistent, sometimes aggressive and often repeated reminders of some of the blackest events in recent Turkish history are inspired more by suspicion and hostility than a desire to start a process of democratic consolidation and reconciliation between all peoples on the basis of an established historical reality.
That is enough: we have gone too far.
When France and Germany began their process of reconciliation by building the Community, they were very careful not to highlight quite so harshly all of the grounds that they might still have had for conflict with each other.
In the same way, Spain, Portugal and Greece also joined us after black periods of fascism.
I do not remember our requirements for tidying up penal codes and changing the attitudes of the police being quite as harshly worded as they are today.
I only hope that Turkey does not see this as a cause for tension and think that any offence is intended, as this is not the case.
But we are taking a risk.
My second regret relates to the subjects that we have debated.
Basically, we have only discussed our own internal or bilateral affairs and the clear, tricky and obvious difficulties, the undeniable difficulties presented by this accession.
We have hardly mentioned the future and the largely positive possibilities opened up by the prospect of this accession.
As a result, these aspects are not adequately reflected in the report.
The enlargement of our market to encompass a market of 70 million consumers, in a country where the economy has been growing very rapidly for the last six years, will strengthen the Union considerably, and let us not forget that growth in Turkey will help to alleviate substantially the concerns that some of our nations have about migratory movements.
But above all, by opening up to a country that is secular but where the majority religion is Islam, the Union would make a major contribution to peace and mutual understanding between peoples in these times of increasing tension, aggravated mistrust and conflict between Muslim and Christian countries.
This contribution, over and above its symbolic significance, is of major strategic importance.
That is the reason for our support.
It would have merited greater emphasis.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, one day the European Union will simply have to decide where its borders are.
The Union cannot be a kind of vague area that all of its neighbours can enter to do a bit of trade on the sole condition that they abide by a few rules that are interpreted fairly generally.
If, whenever a country bordering the European Union is or is seeking to become even slightly democratic, we have to agree to its accession, then the Union will continue to spread like an oil stain.
It will not be truly consistent; it will have no structure and it will have no objective.
We will have built a regional UN and abandoned the political union, this genuine project that we have nurtured for fifty years.
We will have created the Europe of the diplomats, but not the Europe of our peoples.
And that is what the peoples of Europe want.
Obviously the essential question, as Emma Bonino rightly said just now, is what we want for Europe and what Europe means to us.
It is clear, I believe, that this is a political, federal Europe that will allow the peoples of Europe to choose their destiny together.
If we wish to achieve this, however, welcoming a country with such a large population which, geographically speaking, lies outside Europe does not seem to me to be the right way to go about it.
Secondly, this accession will â as many of those here present have said in the debates that we have held â prompt a long list of new requests for accession.
The proposed accession of the Maghreb, the proposed accession of Lebanon, the proposed accession of Palestine or Israel: once again we are building a new, revised and updated UN and not the political project of the founding fathers of Europe.
Finally, MrÂ President, I would add that in my opinion it is inconceivable to start negotiations with Turkey while it remains silent on the subject of the Armenian genocide â sorry, MrÂ Rocard, I hope that this request does not shock the leaders of Turkey.
It is not possible to start these negotiations while the Cyprus issue has not been clarified.
Finally, it is not possible to start negotiations with MrÂ Erdogan, who wrote recently in major European newspapers that Turkish troops would never leave Cyprus.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the rapporteur.
A lot of people have already said that, but it still needs to be repeated, for the task of bringing together the contradictory amendments really was not a straightforward one.
I would like to start by addressing both the Eurlings reportâs detractors and those who have been opposed to accession negotiations from the outset.
There are two arguments that they frequently adduce.
One of them has to do with culture, and if you follow it to its conclusion, you end up attributing differing status to religions and cultures in the European Union, and that bears no relation whatever to the European Union that most of us want.
A European Union in which one religion is worth more than another, one in which there are superior and subordinate cultures, has nothing to do with the Treaties of Rome.
The second argument has to do with our over-stretching ourselves, and it is, admittedly, a very important one, one that has to be taken seriously â and also by those of us who are defenders of the Eurlings report and of the enlargement of the European Union.
It just so happens, though, that we cannot allow ourselves some time out and take a break from world history in order to work on ourselves.
The world will not wait for us, nor will the challenges of fundamentalism and international terrorism wait until the European Union has become deep enough.
We have to tackle, at one and the same time, the enlargement of the European Union and the deepening of European integration.
Let me address those of us who are in favour.
By being so, we are committing ourselves to joining with civil society in Turkey in ensuring that Turkey becomes a country free of every kind of torture.
We are thereby committing ourselves to ensuring that, in Turkey, Kurds, Circassians, Lazs and others can use their mother tongues as well as the official language of the country.
We are making a commitment that every woman in Turkey will be free to go to school, free to choose her partner and to live in a partnership free of any sort of violence.
Finally, we are committing ourselves to joining with our friends in Turkey in ensuring that, in Turkey, the Christian churches and all the various faith communities, from Alevis to Sunnis can, together, flourish as they once did during the history of the Ottoman Empire, and that involves the aspiration that the number of Christians should no longer decline, but begin a renewed increase.
That too would strengthen a multi-cultural and multi-faith Turkey.
Turkey, too, is entering into an obligation; it is committing itself, through ongoing reforms, to helping us win over the hearts and minds of the European public.
Â Â  â Mr President, if it is the wish of the political forces and of the people of Turkey that the country accede to the European Union, because they consider that this will help to develop and democratise it, it is their right to move in that direction.
We are ready to support this endeavour, as long as Turkey complies with the criteria, the codes of conduct and the preconditions laid down for all the Member States of the Union.
The main issue which derives from the Copenhagen criteria is respect for the Member States of the European Union with which Turkey is seeking to enter into partnership.
One of the Member States is also the Republic of Cyprus, which Turkey has to respect and recognise in the same way as the other 24 members.
There is no sense in Turkey's seeking to become a member of the European Union and not recognising a member of the Union, just as there is no sense in Turkey's occupying 37% of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, in other words territory of a Member State of the European Union and, at the same time, acceding to that Union.
If Turkey complies with the criteria and the codes of conduct of the European Union, it will be doing itself and the region a favour, by allowing the easing of tension in the region and the development of good neighbourly relations, which will primarily benefit the peoples and countries in the area.
Î€he Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus and the Confederal Group of the European United Left â Nordic Green Left never had as their objective the economic isolation and distress of our Turkish Cypriot compatriots.
Besides, our group supported the financing regulation for the Turkish Cypriots, with the proviso that the Republic of Cyprus would be respected and that no advantages of a political nature would be offered to the occupying regime.
The underlying cause of the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots is not the so-called 'embargo' on the Greek Cypriot side; it is the Turkish occupation and breakaway action by the occupying regime and the complete interconnection of the economy of the occupied areas with the national economy.
Following the Turkish invasion and occupation in 1974, the Republic of Cyprus declared its occupied ports and airports closed, because it was unable to exert any control over them.
This was also an act of self-defence, so that we would not be led into recognising the pseudo-state.
In reply to the question of reversing the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, the government of the Republic of Cyprus proposed returning the closed section of Ammohostos to its legal residents and opening the port of Ammohostos, together with the Turkish Cypriots, with the objective of its being operated for the benefit of both sides, a proposal which, unfortunately, has not been accepted.
We hope that Turkey will help open a new chapter in the history of our region.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Polish people have special reasons for wishing Turkey great success in the political and economic reforms it has embarked upon.
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when Poland was partitioned and disappeared from maps of Europe and the world for over 100Â years, Turkey was the only country not to recognise that state of affairs.
Both Turkey and the stable development of this country are important today not only for Poland, but also for Europe and for the rest of the world.
Turkey should become a privileged partner of the European Union, but not a Member State.
There are a number of facts that speak against opening accession negotiations with Turkey, such as the fact that Turkey is not a European country in terms of geography, religion or culture.
The political reforms carried out recently were incomplete and far from perfect, and continue to be at odds with everyday practices.
Turkey has not settled its relations with ethnic and religious minorities living on its territory, or with the neighbouring country of Armenia.
Turkey does not recognise one of the European Unionâs Member States, the Republic of Cyprus, and occupies part of its territory.
I should like to stress that European countries wishing to join the European Union should be given precedence regarding integration, especially Ukraine.
In conclusion, given the sceptical views held by the Independence and Democracy Group on strengthening of the European superstate, the Group will vote against the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey.
In fact, the Group should really be voting in favour, as it is obvious that Turkeyâs accession will accelerate the disintegration of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is it a good idea to start negotiations with Turkey?
The answer to that question is neither simple nor a foregone conclusion.
On the one hand there is Turkeyâs legitimate aspiration to join the European Union.
In fact, we certainly cannot ignore or underestimate either the efforts Turkey has made to achieve concrete legislative and institutional convergence with European criteria or its political perseverance and steadfast conviction that it will come to play an active part in the enlargement of Europe.
As Europeans, however, we have a duty not to make concessions, because democracy cannot afford them, just as it cannot afford to sell values, human rights or civil freedoms cheaply.
There is still a great deal to do in these areas in Turkey, especially as regards respect for women and children, the protection of minorities and the abolition of torture and capital punishment.
In the end there are two problems to solve, two conditions that Turkey cannot avoid: it must restore normal relations both with Armenia, by reopening its border, and with Cyprus.
In the latter case, the withdrawal of its troops is a precondition for accession, as is its recognition of the Cypriot state.
Indeed, it is unacceptable that, at the same time as it is applying to join the European Union, not only does Turkey not recognise a Member State like Cyprus but it even keeps thousands of troops on Cypriot soil.
Thus Turkey will still have to face a long process, which necessarily excludes accession .
Realistically, however, we cannot close the door on a Muslim country with secular institutions that is seeking to take a European path of modernisation and development.
Narrowing the gap with Turkey in fact means sending out an important message to the moderate Muslim world, one that can overcome the extremes of fundamentalism and can initiate a dialogue or a meeting of religions and cultures.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Poetteringâs phrase about his concern that this enlargement might prove fatal penetrates todayâs debate with the clarity of a laser beam.
There are indeed eventful times in store for Europe, and yet we in this House must ask whether the EU is even ready to embark on the enterprise that we are planning.
Are our institutions ready?
Do we have a constitution worthy of the name?
As things stand, Nice is the .
What is the financial position?
Where is the financial perspective?
What has become of the British rebate?
Where is the willingness for real solidarity?
To look at it in economic terms, day by day, we see tax dumping, wage dumping and environmental dumping everywhere we look.
The reality is that the EU has gone stiff.
If we ask who, at this stage, would benefit from Turkeyâs accession, or from negotiations towards that end, the answer is that it would be the ones who do not want what many of us in this House were actually originally working towards, and who seek to weaken the EU.
What we will end up with is the âUnited Nations of Europeâ.
That is what we already have at global level, and it no longer has much at all to do with the EU.
The USA and its satellites would benefit, the military-industrial complex would benefit, the big investors would benefit, and this at a time when we are dealing with the greatest peacetime redistribution of wealth in human history.
To those who say that there is no more to be done and that it is too late, I say, âbetter a terrible end than unending terror.â
So, for Europeâs sake, say ânoâ to these negotiations, or else Europe will be heading for the abyss!
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, seeking these negotiations involves the abandonment of two principles.
For a start, such negotiations would begin before the political criteria were fully complied with.
Secondly, I am amazed at the Left adopting this approach when there are issues of torture and human rights; I am particularly amazed by their capacity for distinguishing between systematic and non-systematic torture, and I find it quite astonishing that such a distinction should be drawn.
Quite apart from that, I am not persuaded by the argument that this would reach out to the Islamic world.
Professor Winkler, perhaps Germanyâs most important historian, and a member of the Social Democrat Party, said yesterday that, for historical and other reasons, no such effect could be expected from Turkey, which is, after all, the successor of the Ottoman Empire.
The Commissionâs report is full of doubts.
Today it tells us that there could be no negotiations on matters affecting finances before 2004, because the EU was not ready.
There is a permanent question mark against the free movement of labour.
Even now, in the Commissionâs report and, evidently, in the Council Presidencyâs preparations, consideration is being given to the possibility of failure, and that is an indication of how mendaciously this matter is being approached.
Many of those who take a favourable view of it do not ultimately believe that it will work, and that too I regard as unfair to Turkey, which is indeed of such strategic importance to us and which must be helped to become more democratic.
This âall or nothingâ strategy, involving negotiations lasting some ten or fifteen years and even then perhaps without a positive outcome, strikes me as misguided, and that is why we have to find a second option facilitating a European economic area with a privileged partnership or whatever else one wants to call it.
The fact is that what is at stake here is whether the European Union will survive with its political unity intact and retain its political capacity to act.
I have to contradict Commissioner Verheugen and say that there is one thing that must be clear at the present time: how can it be said that Turkey absolutely must accede and that Ukraine cannot under any circumstances?
Nobody has been able to explain that to me.
That being so, it follows that both must be accepted as Members, and there is doubt in my mind as to whether the European Union can manage that as things stand at present.
So let us seek out new ways of giving all these countries the prospect of membership in the EU, while at the same time allowing the European Union to grow politically.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating my fellow countryman, MrÂ Eurlings, who had the onerous task of acting as rapporteur on this very complex issue, and I think he has done an excellent job of it so far.
Needless to say, we in our group have also closely followed the debate on Turkey and on the question of whether negotiations should be opened.
In fact, we as a group have recently paid a visit to Turkey to find out for ourselves about the discussions that are going on there, and it has borne out our position.
In our view, it should, in principle, be possible for Turkey to become a Member State of the European Union, which is, of course, the first question you must answer.
Turkeyâs integration in Europe will be a crucial step, and a symbolic one.
In this respect, the EU should not, in principle, behave like a closed club, but should open itself up to a country that is guided by European standards.
We expect Turkish membership to have a positive effect in the future, not least on the developments in what we might call the extended Middle East.
Progress within Turkey plays an important role too, of course.
The democratic changes mainly benefit the Turkish people, but Europe also represents the values which Turkey wishes to adopt.
Turkey is changing fast.
Over the past few years, Turkey has demonstrated an enormous capacity to reform in many areas, and it is that process that we are keen to support in future.
In the past, our group has emphasised four aspects.
First of all, the negotiations are about EU membership.
We reject any other formula that has a different goal in mind.
Secondly â and everyone should realise this â the negotiations will be protracted.
Thirdly, given that the negotiations will take such a long time and so much needs to be done, the opening of the negotiations does not, of course, guarantee a successful outcome from the outset.
Actual accession will eventually depend on the progress of the reforms and the developments in Turkey itself.
As far as human rights are concerned, we are positive about the way things are moving at present, provided, of course, that it continues.
In the event of any regression, there is the express possibility of suspending the negotiations.
That has happened in the past in the case of Slovakia.
When we were dissatisfied with the political situation in that country, the negotiations were suspended for a number of years.
In that respect, there is no discrimination.
Since all these items can also be found in Mr Eurlingsâ report, he can count on our support this week.
Â Â  Mr President, it is essential for the sake of our stability as well as morality that we keep faith with Turkey.
If we agree to start accession negotiations we should see them through.
I believe that the so-called privileged partnership is a false prospectus designed to drive Turkey away from integration with Europe.
Turkey has enjoyed a privileged partnership through the Customs Union and also NATO for several years.
This has brought us to the point of pre-accession.
Whatever the outcome of the accession negotiations, it is only through the process of the accession negotiations that the European-Turkey relationship will develop.
Mr Toubon and his friends propose that Turkey be brought into a privileged partnership enjoying some aspects of membership, but without political representation and without the duty to respect European law and the principle of loyal cooperation.
This is madness: it is bad for Turkey, subversive of the European Union and it displays a vast and astonishing absence of self-confidence inside this Parliament for European projects.
Finally, I would like to ask the Commission and the presidency to flesh out the proposal for a mechanism to suspend the negotiations should there be a crisis.
I trust that the European Council will follow the spirit of the Constitution, which requires a third of Member States to trigger such a mechanism and not simply a single truculent member.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it is my belief that since the beginning of this debate the facts about democracy and the human rights situation have risked being twisted to suit the final objective sought, that is either the accession or non-accession of Turkey.
One of the merits of MrÂ Eurlingsâs report is precisely that it avoids doing this.
The report contains a huge amount of very interesting and very precise information about the human rights situation and MrÂ Eurlings really cannot be accused of toning down certain points in order to strengthen the case for accession.
This is a great achievement because the challenge was a considerable one.
It seems to me that some Members nevertheless find themselves in an extremely paradoxical situation, because no one can deny that the prospect of Turkeyâs accession is a powerful lever to encourage democratisation.
Perhaps we have not made sufficient mention in our speeches of the packages of legislative reforms that have been adopted.
It is right to say that things are not moving quickly enough on the ground.
But to refuse accession today because the Copenhagen political criteria have not been met would be tantamount to interrupting a process of democratisation supposedly on the grounds of democratic values, which is completely illogical and paradoxical.
I wish therefore to draw attention to the fact that this position is to some extent a hypocritical one.
There is also an intermediate strategy which is to accumulate a large number of restrictions and go for accession while simultaneously backing away from it.
Conditions are imposed and laid down and alternatives are sought.
I think that MrÂ Brok is right, but I do not draw the same conclusions as he does: to set out a half-hearted accession strategy is to prepare for failure.
What we need is an open, full and complete accession, which is also absolutely rigorous.
If we work towards these two objectives we will, I believe, make a success of the multicultural Europe that we want to see created with Turkeyâs accession.
Â Â  â Mr President, the large majority of my political group supports in principle the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey.
However, we believe that the Eurlings report requires amendments which will strengthen our demand for real compliance by the Turkish leadership with European standards; amendments which will counterbalance the unacceptable pressure of the United States administration on the Dutch Presidency for the ' â in other words more or less unconditional â accession of Turkey to the European Union.
Turkey's long, arduous and uncertain journey towards accession needs changes in deed, not just in word.
I call on the European Commission to process immediately a roadmap with a specific and verifiable timetable for the application of the Copenhagen political criteria, with particular emphasis on the recognition of Cyprus by Turkey and the withdrawal of the Turkish occupying forces from the northern part of the island, visible progress in resolving the problems of the Kurdish people, the safeguarding of human rights and the drafting of a new constitution.
In Greece, my homeland, we hope that this difficult journey towards Europe, which is due to start for Turkey in a few days' time, will make it a better, democratic and peace-loving neighbour, a demand which is also motivating the civil society in our neighbouring country.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, representatives of the nations of Europe, ladies and gentlemen, obviously we French sovereignists will be voting against this report, but we would like to underline the fact that this debate is not really a debate at all. Essentially, as we well know, the decision was made some time ago: not in 1999 in Helsinki, not even in Europe, but in Washington, several years earlier, and it was moreover announced by President Clinton when he visited Istanbul in 1997.
This explains MrÂ Erdoganâs unbelievable arrogance, because he knows perfectly well that his accession is in the bag. I repeat that he is supported by the United States and the fact that he is surprised that some countries are hesitating is the epitome of arrogance.
That is the case of my own country, France.
He should be reminded â and the President of the French Republic is obliged to take account of this â that France is still a democracy and that it has the right to hesitate.
His arrogance is also shown by his refusal to address two issues that I will mention only by name because they have already been touched on here.
Why refuse so obstinately to recognise the dreadful Armenian genocide?
I have tabled a written statement on this subject, which recalls in particular that twice, in 1987 and 1990, this Parliament refused to open negotiations of any kind for as long as this genocide was not recognised.
It is astonishing that this Parliament should be adopting such an illogical position and that it should be so untrue to itself.
I will also mention the Cyprus issue.
It is quite staggering that a country should wish to join a club of states, an assembly of states, a federation of states â whatever it is, we do not know â without recognising one of its members.
It is true that this European Union is no stranger to illogical positions of this sort.
The reality is that I do not know quite what we are in the process of building here; a hotchpotch maybe, but it clearly has nothing to do with Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, reading this report, it is obvious that the rapporteur and the majority that supports the report are quite clear about the profound differences between Turkey and the EU.
It is not merely a question of having to make a few economic adjustments, but of Turkey and the EU being two widely different civilisations whose values are incompatible.
In the light of this report, no responsible politician can come to any conclusion other than that Turkey does not belong in the EU and that there is no basis for embarking upon accession negotiations.
That is not, however, the way in which the majority of the European Parliament thinks.
The operative belief in this House is that we should all like to become Germans: not the bad old Germans who finally suffered defeat in 1945, but the good new Germans with their unimpeachable opinions who obediently agreed to give up the Deutschmark and accept the euro, who are destroying the German economy and throwing tens of thousands of people into unemployment; the good Germans who, without so much as a murmur, are allowing millions of foreigners to move in and destroy German culture from within.
In this way, the EU is trying to change us all, and the majority in this House believes that the Turks can be changed in the same way.
Turkey is not Europe, however.
The Turks do not want to be Germans, a fact that we can, of course, see clearly in Germany.
There is a reason for Turkeyâs countless problems, and that reason is a civilisation that has damaging effects upon the development of society.
What the EU is saying is, in actual fact, that Turkey should give up its Muslim culture.
MrÂ Schulz said it clearly in this House today: Turkey must adopt all our laws and values.
That is something, of course, which Turkey cannot, however, do.
A countryâs culture cannot be taken away from it; or, rather, any attempt to do so takes centuries.
That is why the demands will hardly be fulfilled; but, in ten yearsâ time, this Parliament will adopt a splendid report to the effect that the demands have been fulfilled, irrespective of the fact that everyone knows that that is not the case.
The peoples of Europe are opposed to Turkish accession to the EU.
The strongest opponents are the Greek Cypriots, who are the European people that has most recently been at war with Turkey and the northern part of whose country is still occupied by Turkey.
The people do not, however, count in the EU, which is ruled by a self-styled elite which, even if it has only 45% of the voters behind it, has no compunction about exerting its will over the people.
Cyprus is directly threatened with exclusion âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, is this the European Union or do some have expansionist ambitions beyond the boundaries of Europe?
That is a key and defining question which arises from Turkey's application for EU membership.
Turkey is not part of Europe, it is part of Asia: only a finger of land flanking Istanbul lies in Europe.
That does not make it a European nation.
You might as well say that Spain is African because it has some outposts on the North African coast.
It is a shameless agenda of expansionism which drives the EU in wanting to encompass Turkey.
Turkey itself has a shameful history of expansionism.
Witness its brutal invasion and occupation of Northern Cyprus.
Witness its genocide of the Armenian people.
Witness also, despite the massive inducements of pre-accession aid from Brussels, its intolerant suppression of religious freedom, in particular with regard to Christians.
No â Turkey is one country and culture that we can well do without.
Â Â  Mr President, many of us on this side of the House are very supportive of Turkey's EU membership.
Over the past 80 years enormous changes have taken place in Turkey; the process of reform has accelerated dramatically since the formal recognition in 1999 of Turkey as a candidate for the European Union.
Many of us also recall that Turkey has been a staunch ally in NATO for some 50 years and that during much of that time the country was subject to terrorist attacks by organisations sponsored by the Soviet Union.
Those of us who are supportive of Turkey are under no illusions about the challenges ahead and the work still to be done.
That is why we recognise that negotiations are likely to take 10 or 15 years.
The alarmists talk as if Turkey is going to join in a month's time.
Turkey has many very successful industrial sectors and a vibrant economy in many respects, but it is still a poor country.
The economic challenges are formidable but the potential rewards are great.
Much still needs to be done to improve human rights, but let us not forget that some extremist groups misuse the label of human rights in order to promote sympathy for their own cause.
It would be naive of those of us on the centre right in European politics to give any comfort to political groups that are closely linked to terrorists.
We could talk at length about Cyprus.
It is not Turkey that should be in the dock.
Turkish Cypriots, fully backed by Ankara, supported the United Nations plan which, among other features, would have phased out the non-Cypriot forces from the island, both Turkish and Greek.
Many say that Turkish accession would fundamentally change the nature of the EU.
If this means an end to the inexorable drive towards political integration and the end of the idea of some European state, then I welcome this.
I share concerns about free movement of people, but this is a problem wider than Turkish accession.
At this time, four days before the European Council meets, we need to send a strong positive signal to Turkey that it is welcome as a member of the European Union.
This signal will have wider positive reverberations.
Let us give the green light now to the opening of negotiations with Turkey, not grudgingly, but with enthusiasm.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that Parliament will send a clear message to the European Council of 17 December, a message to open negotiations with Turkey with a view to its accession.
That is the right response in keeping with the considerable progress that has been achieved in that country, as emerges from the Commissionâs thorough, in-depth report.
The opening of negotiations will, of course, involve a long time-frame as well as further profound changes both for Turkey and for the European Union itself.
In the current situation, that seems to be the only path that can be proposed.
I have heard mention of special partnerships to replace the prospect of accession if Turkey proves unable to take the Community on board.
Opening negotiations does not mean automatically guaranteeing accession to the Union, but mentioning other prospects at this point in time can only make our counterparts rightly suspicious about what the Twenty-Five genuinely want.
Let us try, therefore, to be clear and transparent and to give that country a real chance.
It will then be the political will of our current and future leaders, and especially of the Turkish people, that will decide the future of our relationship.
Let us not give any excuse to the opponents of democracy and secularity in that country, or we may bitterly regret it.
I would say to Mr Camre that my country has had the crime of honour and the annulment of the crime of rape through marriage as part of its legal system, but I would never dream of saying that it was due to our Catholic culture.
I therefore ask him to rethink that point.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this is an extremely important report that comes at a time when the leaders of the Member States have still not put the finishing touches to the conclusions from the weekend summit.
It is not easy to interpret what will happen if the President-in-Office of the Council is listened to.
That is why it is important for ourselves in the European Parliament to send out a strong and clear signal, and I hope that MrÂ Eurlingsâ report will be adopted with a broad majority.
Turkey is a long-standing issue on the European agenda.
Its membership is controversial in many countries.
This disquiet is something that we must, of course, take seriously.
We in this House, together with all the European leaders, have a major task in trying to explain the advantages of Turkish membership.
I personally am convinced that a democratically and economically stable Turkey would be a great asset to the EU.
Turkey could become a bridge between Europe and the Muslim world and provide us with significant opportunities to solve common problems and fight fanaticism and terrorism.
Our common Europe is not a Christian project.
It is a union of values, and Turkey is now working hard and single-mindedly to adopt these values.
Progress in Turkey is impressive and must be encouraged.
That is why, this weekend, Turkey must be given a date.
Those who are opponents of Turkey argue as if Turkey was to become a member tomorrow.
That is not, of course, the case.
The process will be a long one, taking perhaps 15 years.
In fifteen yearsâ time, both the EU and Turkey, as well as the world in general, will look different.
By then, the EU, and Turkey too, must change.
MrÂ Eurlingsâ report contains a long list of measures that Turkey must implement before its membership can become a reality.
These are non-negotiable.
They concern Cyprus, human rights and, especially, the situation of the Kurds.
The large Kurdish minority must be recognised and be given full linguistic, cultural and political rights.
A majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has approved this report, and I believe and hope that it will be adopted by a large majority in the vote on Wednesday.
Any decision at the summit other than that of embarking upon negotiations â negotiations aimed, moreover, at full membership â would be a major failure.
Â Â  Mr President, todayâs debate on Turkish accession, on which we have to decide, shows how weakened, unsure of itself and divided this House is.
The lines of division cut across every camp and every group, and ultimately reflect the insecurity of the public in the EU.
What is the source of this weakness and this insecurity?
Is it because we are late â too late â in thinking about, and becoming aware of, the fact that we are, by this decision, defining Europe, setting down its borders and giving European integration its final form, and that we are doing this without giving voice to it, without having talked to each other about it, without having consulted Europeâs parliaments, and without having conducted the necessary public debate?
Is it because we were unable to persuade most of the public to accept Turkey as a member?
Is it because the entitlement of Heads of State or Government to define Europe behind closed doors, out of sight of parliament and public, is more than precarious, and all the more so if you read the European treaties?
Defining what Europe is is a matter for parliaments, not for the Heads of State or Government.
For they did it, in 1999, behind closed doors, without consulting parliaments, without advice from the Commission.
That is no basis for such a dramatic step.
Are there really so few grounds for suspecting that some of its advocates want to use Turkish accession to finally smother the founding fathersâ conception of a European federal state?
And if we are to talk in terms of âlevers for democracyâ and âpeace dividendsâ, why are we not giving absolute priority to the accession of the Balkan states, which would transform a region constantly ravaged by crisis and war into an oasis of peace?
As for the last âlever for democracyâ argument, well, yes, if we can transform countries and states into democracies ...
Â Â  What exactly is Turkey today?
It is both first world and third world in one single state.
It may be possible to describe Turkey today in the same way as Count Mirabeau described Prussia, namely not so much a state with an army but an army with a state.
What could Turkey be or what should it be?
It could and should be a normal European state with wide-ranging guarantees of civil rights and guaranteed stable relations with neighbouring countries, whereby all of Turkeyâs neighbours must be given an internationally binding guarantee.
It must also, of course, be a state in which social rights are respected and in which trade unions can be freely established by those who wish to do so.
Furthermore, it must be a stable economic project, which will entail investment in the east of the country, and be able to banish the centuries of backwardness.
This means that Turkey must become European and not that Europe must become Turkish, which would result in the degeneration of the European project into a free trade area.
When Mr SchrÃ¶der recently called Mr Erdogan his friend, he meant that ...
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the ghosts of Adenauer, de Gaulle and Spaak were in the House, they would shiver merely at the idea of what we are debating here.
Not that we are deciding to allow Turkey to join the European Union.
It is true that, if the United States did not want Turkey to join Europe, no such question would be on the agenda today.
The question which arises therefore is institutional: are we an independent political entity or are we a trailer hitched to the American truck?
What is Turkey?
Since when has Turkey been in Europe?
Ask your own children.
Ask your children who study geography if it is in Europe or in Asia.
Ask the priest who married you if Turkey is in Europe.
Which brings me to the Eurlings report: the original differs from the report we are debating today just as the Holy Bible differs from the Koran.
And while we are on the subject of the Holy Bible, may I remind you of the multitude of races housed many centuries ago in the Tower of Babel.
It fell.
If you too wish Europe to fall, bring 80 million Turks with a different culture and different religion into Europe.
When de Gaulle built Europe with the other Europeans, he said that Europe was determined by her geography, her Greco-Roman culture and the Christian religion.
So now we are going to bring the Turks into Europe.
That will be a crime for Europe.
Do not commit it.
Â Â  Mr President, this week is undoubtedly an historically important one for the broader development of the European Union.
The European Parliament will vote on whether it supports the opening of accession talks between Turkey and the EU.
Leaders of the 25 governments of the European Union meeting in Brussels later this week will formally give the go-ahead â or not â to accession negotiations between the European Union and the Turkish Government.
Let us not underestimate the magnitude of this decision.
There is no acceptable middle ground when it comes to the issue of membership of the European Union.
A country is either a member of the European Union or it is not.
This is the crux of the matter.
I believe that a country seeking to join the European Union must clearly comply with all aspects of the Copenhagen criteria.
One must recall that the European Commission carried out an evaluation report on the progress that Turkey has made in its efforts to join the European Union.
In this report last October the Commission stated that the Turkish Government had brought forward a significant package of proposals this year which included the following: the abolition of State Security Courts, which would ensure that civil-military relations are brought into line with EU standards, the strengthening of the freedom of the press, the introduction of a constitutional clause on gender equality, and removal of all references to the death penalty.
In the last election my own party had a slogan which stated: 'A lot done, more to do'.
I believe that this is the case here.
More needs to be done, but a lot has been done and we must recognise that.
I support the terms of the today's report which states that the European Council should vote for accession negotiations with Turkey to begin without delay and the objective of these negotiations is Turkey's EU membership.
But there is also a realisation that further substantial political reforms are going to have to take place in Turkey before final accession negotiations can conclude.
It was intimated earlier in this debate that one of the reasons why Turkey should be kept out of the European Union is because Turkish people are not Christian.
Surely that flies in the face of the very thing that Christianity stands for.
Christianity is about being open and welcoming to people.
I believe that we should be open and welcoming and let these negotiations begin.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if Turkey really does achieve the legal, social and economic progress described in the Eurlings Report that is before us and moves further along the road that leads to democracy, then we should rejoice.
Turkey is one of the European Unionâs allies and partners, and has for some time enjoyed something akin to a privileged partnership, but this cannot in the least change the fact that it should never become a full Member State of the European Union and will never really be a European country.
If this House really wants to be the assembly representing Europeâs citizens, it will now have to send out a clear message, as a vast majority of the public â as we all know â is opposed to Turkey joining the EU.
If, then, we are now to begin accession negotiations with Ankara, we will be treating the will of the people with disdain.
We learn, indeed, from all experience of the EU to date that the commencement of negotiations means that they will be brought to a favourable conclusion sooner or later â generally sooner rather than later.
Nor is Mr Erdogan, the Turkish Prime Minister, leaving any doubt about the fact that the negotiations have, for him, but one objective, that being full membership without reservations.
Much has been said about âopen-ended negotiationsâ, but we know that Ankara is not interested in those.
Full membership for Turkey, though, would mean that this European Union would be massively over-stretched in geopolitical terms and would become involved in the hot spots of the Middle East.
It would be placed under financial and economic strain far in excess of its capacity; nobody would be able to fund Turkeyâs accession to the EU.
Moreover, Europeâs cultural identity, which has evolved through history would without doubt be fundamentally undermined by the presence of a Muslim Member State, and the mass immigration of millions of unemployed young Turks â which is a certainty â would result in a series of social and economic catastrophes âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, for the French members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the question is not about Turkey.
The question is: âWhat kind of Europe do we want?â
We have always wanted a political Europe in tune with world affairs, a Europe of integration and not of differentiation, a Europe of common policy and not of variable geometry.
Turkey is a great country, a great people and a major civilisation. It would be unrealistic, patronising and even degrading to seek to absorb, realign and weaken the historical greatness of that world.
To accept Turkeyâs accession to the EU is to accept the risk of Europe becoming a society of nations, a preacher unable to practise what he preaches; of Europe dissolving into a strategic alliance that used to be against Communism, and will in the future be against terrorism; of Europe being transformed into a kind of worldwide Euro-Asian trade organisation. In other words, there is a risk that Europe will become wide open and bereft of power.
The Europe that we want is not diversity at the expense of unity; it is unity in diversity, in the words of the draft Constitution maxim.
This about the European Unionâs Project; jumping the gun is not a project!
The EU is no longer accepted by its citizens.
Europe must be built by working with the peoples, not by ignoring them.
It is this concept of common interest between Europe and Turkey that led us to submit essential amendments to this House, in collaboration with our German friends.
I shall not detail them here, but I shall merely say that it is only by means of a privileged partnership that we can create strong ties between the futures of Turkey and Europe, without compromising either the European Project or Turkeyâs historical role between Europe and Asia.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must be resolute: let us dare to fight together through the fog of diplomatic conformism, to stare reality in the face and to propose to Turkey a fraternal relationship of equals with the political Union of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I should first like to congratulate Mr Eurlings on the quality of his report and in particular on his ability to listen.
I feel that the compromises that we have reached, as my group has said time and time again, are perfectly acceptable.
Having listened to these debates, however, I do wonder âÂ indeed, Mr ToubonÂ â what we want for Europe.
Today I have heard the best and the worst and I should like to say this to you now.
We have managed to influence a democratic transformation in Turkey, with the will of the Turkish people, but without tanks, without rifles and without arms.
As we have said, it has been a democratic revolution.
We have managed to propagate the European democratic model by peaceful means.
In my opinion, the challenge that we have almost âÂ not completely, but almostÂ â overcome was a major challenge and let me say that I am proud of that Europe, the Europe that feels no fear in its belly, the Europe that does not say âI reject that cultureâ.
We are aware that much remains to be done.
We are aware of the Cyprus question.
We are aware that human rights must continue to improve.
We are aware that the question of the Kurds remains.
We are aware that there are womenâs issues.
We are aware âÂ and on this issue I appeal to my Turkish friendsÂ â of the problem of the Armenian genocide.
Acknowledging these problems will make you greater, not smaller.
I should also like to say, however, that those of us who want open and transparent negotiations also want a complete partnership for Turkey with no restrictive clauses.
Turkey is, certainly, MrÂ Toubon, a great country, a great culture, and we should be honoured to bring it into the EU, provided that it fulfils the Copenhagen criteria, but only the Copenhagen criteria.
Â Â  Mr President, the real question before us is simply âWhat Europe do we want?â
Do we want a simple free-trade zone or do we actually want to build a political Europe destined to play a leading role in the world?
It is that question and that question only that the Heads of State or Government must answer on 17Â December.
From Council to Council, from summit to summit, crucial decisions for our future have been taken without our Heads of State or Government ever spending a day, or even a few hours, debating the core issues relating to those decisions.
This is not an example of our institutions functioning responsibly.
We cannot continue to make decisions on the future of our Union on the quiet, almost mechanically, without involving the peoples of Europe in the debates.
We are told today that we have gone too far to turn back, yet at the same time we are told that there will always be time to address this question in ten or fifteen years.
This is entirely inconsistent.
I am a committed European and I feel that we must build a political and democratic Europe in which the citizens will finally take part. The more Europe continues to embark on unlimited enlargement, the greater the risk that it will be permanently weakened.
One thing that I do know is that the world needs Europe.
The balance of the world depends on Europeâs existence; democracy and peace depend on Europeâs existence.
Let us not throw away that chance.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, as has been mentioned, the majority of human rights activists in Turkey â Leyla Zana among them â are of the opinion that a positive decision on the Turkish application to join the EU will contribute to an improvement in Turkish policy on ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities.
They have good reasons for saying this.
Human rights activists in Latvia were of the same opinion when discussions on Latvia's candidacy for membership of the EU were held.
Unfortunately, Latvian human rights activists are now highly disillusioned.
It is true that under pressure from the European institutions some changes were made in legislation concerning problems essential for minorities.
However, these changes were cosmetic.
For example, improvements to the law on languages were intended to benefit only one particular linguistic minority: English-speaking businessmen.
We see the same urgent cosmetic steps taking place in Turkey.
For example, the Turkish Government has allowed private language centres to open, offering courses in Kurdish, Romanian and other tongues.
A private language centre is something essentially different from what we would recognise as a school â a term used in Mr Eurlings' report.
My country, Latvia, became a Member State of the EU, in spite of the fact that the Latvian authorities did not recognise the rights of linguistic minorities.
It was a mistake for EU institutions not to use Latvia's accession process to promote the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria.
This history must not be repeated in the case of Turkish accession.
We hope that in 15 years Turkey will fulfil the political criteria completely.
We call on the Commission to use every opportunity to urge the Turkish Government to recognise the Kurdish minority in the country and to create the conditions necessary for this minority to be respected and protected.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Communist Party of Greece opposes the European Union and its enlargement and, in this sense, we do not agree with the accession of Turkey, not for ethnic, chauvinist or cultural reasons, but on the same political grounds on which we also disagreed with Greece's accession to and its remaining in the European Union.
Nonetheless, we wish to raise certain very serious issues about both the policy of the European Union and about the Eurlings report.
The Council texts to date, like the aforementioned report, fail to mention or hush up both the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the occupation of part of an independent Member State of the UN, which is now also a Member State of the European Union.
The Turkish Government also provokingly refuses to recognise the Republic of Cyprus and to withdraw its recognition of the pseudo-state.
We ask you, if this were happening in France, Britain, Italy or Germany, would you open negotiations with such a state?
Whatever happened to equality between the Member States of the European Union?
Secondly, Turkish governments have raised new issues of border differences with Greece which have been clearly resolved under international treaties, and the only problem which remains to be resolved is the demarcation of the continental shelf in the Aegean.
The European Union legalised these claims during the course of discussions, with the decision taken at Helsinki.
Turkey's aggressiveness in the Aegean is becoming bolder by the day, with dozens of airspace violations.
Thirdly, the report refers to very important progress with democratisation; Mr Eurlings was obviously misled when he went to Turkey and is no longer listening to us.
Perhaps Mr Eurlings visited some other country rather than Turkey?
There have been limited rather than material changes ...
Â Â  MrÂ President, the June List does not view Turkeyâs geographical position or its Muslim religion as obstacles to membership of the EU.
Turkey is important for Europe.
We welcome the fact that Turkey is drawing closer to the EU and working to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.
We must not, however, close our eyes to the fact that both Turkey and the EU must change before full EU membership is possible.
Turkey must draw a line under its past and acknowledge the Armenian genocide.
It must give its minorities full human rights.
It must achieve a level of economic development such that full membership does not release tensions that may threaten the internal market.
The EU must also change.
The common agricultural policy must be abolished, and structural policy must be revised before Turkey, large and poor as it is, can be absorbed.
Decisions that have already been made mean that it is all but impossible to bring about a comprehensive reform of agricultural policy until after 2013.
To ensure grass-roots support, membership negotiations should, moreover, only be embarked upon once the issue has been debated in the Member Statesâ election campaigns over the next few years.
Finally, the issue of the EUâs constitution must be solved before we begin to negotiate concerning Turkish membership.
Full Turkish membership is a very long-term issue, requiring major and sweeping political and economic changes in both Turkey and the European Union.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, the question has been phrased incorrectly.
It is not a matter of whether Turkey does or does not already meet the EUâs requirements.
It is a matter of whether we want a Muslim Turkey in a Europe that was built on Christian values.
There has been talk in this House of the progress made by Turkey.
As a psychologist, I believe the fate of every single person is important, but I know that not everything that is important for people can be measured.
The emotions and feelings of Europeâs citizens are also important, and most of the latter are opposed to Turkey joining the EU.
I have been observing Muslims in Brussels for 20Â years, and I would not want such a large country to have any influence on the fate of my country, Poland, within the framework of the European Union.
In 50Â years our worlds may be ready to meet, but no earlier.
We should provide assistance to Muslims in their own countries, and help bring about the rapid creation of a state of Palestine, as that nation has suffered greatly at the hands of Israel.
This is something I am in favour of, and something that urgently needs to be implemented.
