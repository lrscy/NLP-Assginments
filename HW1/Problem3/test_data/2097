This could be the case in either Syria or Lebanon.
All this when we are striving to bring the temperature in the region down rather than allowing it to rise.
Further, I feel all or most honourableÂ Members would agree that the UnitedÂ States might possibly become less engaged, and that this could have a negative effect on the situation.
MrÂ Poettering made it quite clear that the forthcoming election campaign in the UnitedÂ States is likely to result in the UnitedÂ States becoming disengaged, if I may resort to an English term.
Every effort must be made to pre-empt this.
On the contrary, it is imperative for the UnitedÂ States to remain committed to the process.
The EuropeanÂ Union will certainly maintain its commitment.
The Union cannot become a mere observer of a deteriorating process, nor can it simply become a sleeping partner in a process sliding down an increasingly slippery and difficult slope.
MrÂ Poettering also referred to Iraq.
I should like to follow up on this.
I have visited all the countries in the region, and it has become clear to me that the issue of Iraq has a bearing on the Palestinian problem.
I would venture to suggest that if discussions were held with any Arab political leader at the present juncture, that leader would speak of a process deemed by the Arab world to be a Western campaign against Arabs.
Great care is needed to ensure that Arab political leaders do not perceive this process as a move against the Islamic world.
They must not see it as an attack by the Western world on the Arab world.
It is therefore important to reiterate time and again that this is not a fight against particular civilisations or religions. Rather, we are engaged in a struggle to defend the values of peace and stability in both areas.
MrÂ Cohn-Bendit rightly said that we are involved in what could be termed an incremental process.
This so-called incremental process began with the Oslo process, and the RoadÂ Map is a further stage of it.
MrÂ Cohn-Bendit suggested the solution might lie in electric shock treatment.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am inclined to doubt that there is currently sufficient political energy in both parties and in the international community for strong electric shock treatment to be an option.
Only today we have witnessed another difficult and complicated debate in the United Nations Security Council.
The purpose of the debate was to adopt a common stance regarding the situation in Syria.
No agreement was reached.
I am therefore of the opinion that there is currently insufficient energy to permit the application of electric shock treatment.
It is perhaps incumbent on us Europeans to generate the energy required.
As I see it, a verification process is the first thing to set up.
The RoadÂ Map will not implement itself.
It will be well-nigh impossible to see the RoadÂ Map through without a verification process in place.
It is therefore important to ensure that any verification mechanisms are such that they can be implemented immediately.
This was also discussed at the NewÂ York meeting.
I should now like to refer to the situation that is likely to arise this morning.
A new PalestinianÂ Government will probably be in place, led by MrÂ AbuÂ Ala.
This government is entitled to our support if it complies with our requests.
We need to insist it wages a determined war on terrorism, and that it pursues its reforms.
These are essential features of a State.
We are doing all we can to ensure that a PalestinianÂ State is established as soon as reasonably possible.
One key feature of a State is that it should have a single financial system.
The necessary effort in this direction has been made.
The FinanceÂ Minister has brought this about.
Another key feature is that the State should have control over arms.
PrimeÂ MinisterÂ AbuÂ Ala must therefore be urged to ensure his government takes all possible steps to control the security forces and allow only legitimate weapons.
It is also important to urge the IsraeliÂ Government to improve living conditions for Palestinian citizens, and to call a halt to the building of the wall.
I was moved by MrÂ Poetteringâs emotional account of what a wall can mean to individuals who have experience of being kept apart by one.
Israel must also be urged to tackle the matter of the settlements seriously.
The latter is not something new in the RoadÂ Map.
It featured in the Mitchell report several years ago.
I think I have outlined what I feel we can and should do here and now as Europeans to try and overcome the present crisis.
In December we should be in a position to conduct a final review.
It will then be possible to consider how best to go forward into the coming year, in full awareness of the parameters of the solution.
I am confident that the latter are known to all.
They are not very far removed from those mentioned by some honourableÂ Members who took the floor in the House today.
I should therefore like to thank the House for its cooperation.
We all need to keep our eyes wide open and our determination well alive. Only then will it be possible to control the situation that is unfortunately unfolding in a land so close to our hearts.
I was asked how the MiddleÂ East is to be dealt with within the security strategy.
These people are our neighbours.
Their land adjoins ours.
The issue must therefore continue to one of our main concerns.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you.
It will be my pleasure to communicate any further information to Parliament personally, as soon as we are in a position to do so.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have some very brief remarks on some of the points raised in this debate.
On the issue of a peace-keeping force â mentioned so eloquently by Mr Poettering and also, in a different context, by Mr Cohn-Bendit and others â we support anything that bears the prospect of hope.
However, it is clear that both parties need to agree.
Unfortunately, we do not see this happening for a number of reasons: the Israelis mistrust of international involvement, the impossibility of separating parties as a result of settlements and the lack of a guarantee that the international force will not be drawn into conflict.
On the Syria Association Agreement referred to by MrÂ Belder, the agreement will help draw Syria into a more constructive engagement and will give us an opportunity to discuss the issues of mutual concern.
It is clear that all countries must actively comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1373.
The Association Agreement will include a clause on cooperation against terrorism.
On the issue mentioned by Mrs Vachetta and others of the sanctions against Israel, I am afraid to say that economic sanctions have a rather bad track record of success.
They simply do not work.
What works is engagement and dialogue.
The Association Agreement with Israel provides for exactly that.
That political dialogue allows us to raise all issues of concern.
We believe that suspending the agreement would deprive us of this opportunity.
Mr Von Wogau referred to the ring of friends.
Our policy is one of openness and inclusiveness This is not a political condition, but it is clear that the ongoing conflict will not allow our partners to reap the benefits of our new initiative.
Finally, Mr Howitt mentioned the situation of the EU programmes on the ground.
Given the circumstances on the ground it has indeed become very difficult and rather costly to deliver our assistance, particularly as regards infrastructure projects and humanitarian aid.
We are more successful in keeping our software projects going, particularly as far as institution-building and reform are concerned.
I should like to express the Commission's appreciation for this highly interesting debate.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrÂ Monti.
Â Â  Mr President, according to the agenda, we were due to have a debate on the situation in the Middle East and yet, apart from MrsÂ Kuntzâs speech, only Palestine has been discussed.
As far as I am concerned, Palestine is not the Middle East.
In French it is what we call the Near East.
It seems that there is a Middle Eastern country that has completely disappeared from our radar screens; Iraq.
I am not seeking to force a debate on Iraq, but personally I had prepared a speech on that country.
I would simply like to ask a question which I feel is relevant to this House, which is so mindful of human rights: what exactly do we know today, in terms of international law, about the fate of the former head of the Iraqi diplomatic corps, MrÂ Tariq Aziz?
This is an extremely relevant question, perhaps to be debated at our next meeting.
Â Â  Thishas been noted,MrÂ Gollnisch.
You will be aware that honourableÂ Members take the floor to say what they feel to be appropriate.
It does seem that Members wished to discuss the problem of Israel and Palestine at this stage today.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  . â As I observed on a recent visit to Palestine, the Israeli Government is still building settlements and its wall of shame, despite criticism and protests.
It has persisted in the military occupation, in destroying infrastructure, housing and other installations, in carrying out targeted killings, and in holding more than 7Â 000 Palestinian prisoners, almost 340Â of whom are children, in Israeli jails.
It has continued to violate the most fundamental rights of the Palestinian people on a regular basis, attacking Syria and conducting a campaign of genuine state terrorism.
It is with frustration and indignation, therefore, that one hears speeches by Members of this House demanding respect for the Rule of Law.
How can one demand that PresidentÂ Arafat and the Palestinian Government take steps to combat acts of terrorism while the Israeli military is occupying Palestine?
The European Union must table initiatives and practical measures.
The Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the EU and Israel must be suspended, as requested in the EPÂ resolution on the âSituation in the Middle Eastâ, of 10Â AprilÂ 2002.
The Commission and the Council must table an initiative within the UN, demanding that the UN negotiations be concluded, recognising the Palestiniansâ right to dignity and to their own independent state, and sending international observers and a UN-backed peacekeeping force to intervene.
Â Â  Again today the hypocritical âdefendersâ of human rights and the oppressed are silent.
Apart from hollow proclamations, not a word of support for the Palestinian people fighting for human dignity for the whole of mankind in the face of imperialist brutality.
They reject proposals to end the funding and arming of the butcher Sharon.
They prohibit any pressure on Israel to end the occupation and its attacks, which are the sole cause of the hardships of the two peoples.
Solana, as his master's voice, condemns the Palestinian resistance, while calling on Israel to show restraint and generosity.
He also cites the famous road map which was signed by the Palestinian Authority with a gun to its head and which is being trampled underfoot by Israel, to exert more pressure and coercion on the Palestinians to make new concessions, basically to start a Palestinian civil war.
Not a word about the satanically inspired wall designed to choke Palestine or about the criminal settlements and the cynical threats against the elected President Arafat.
We denounce this policy, we express our undivided support for the Palestinian resistance and President Arafat.
We stand by the Israeli communists and all those in this country who, like the 27 pilots and hundreds of Israeli soldiers and officers, are fighting to stop Sharon's cannibalistic machine.
We call here too for a front of solidarity for peace in the Middle East and for reconciliation between the two peoples in two independent, sovereign states.

Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject we are dealing with is not politically controversial; on the contrary, it has to do with the safety of air travel, which is a matter of concern for us and for all travellers.
Although we are not experts, we know about air travel and have experience of it.
From that experience we know that not all airlines and not all aircraft are equally safe.
Some companies, who are not too fussy about safety, can still, these days, change over to other airports where less stringent monitoring is in force.
That shows the need for a Community safety policy for airports.
In any case, the Commission estimates that, even if the likelihood of an accident is unchanged from in 1996, it should necessarily follow from the observable growth in air traffic that, by 2015, there will be a serious accident happening every week.
The likelihood of an accident varies widely among different regions and continents.
Did you know that the airlines with which you fly in Africa, Asia, South and Central America, are far more likely to meet with accidents â at least twice the world average?
The risk is lowest in Western Europe and Australia, but highest in Eastern European countries â 50 times the risk in Western Europe.
This directive is therefore absolutely necessary if internationally applied safety controls are to be harmonised.
The continued absence of a Community policy is to be regretted; this is still a task for the Member States.
It is regrettable too that the Member States and the airlines are afraid of supplying the public with the information that we consider necessary.
Â Â  MrÂ President, pursuant to RuleÂ 144(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that this report be referred back to committee. This is for the reasons I adduced yesterday as rapporteur, namely the need to adjust the report to the interinstitutional agreement.
Â Â  Pursuant to Rule 144, I will therefore give the floor to one speaker in favour and to one speaker against.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am in favour of this referral, but I should like to point out that this has become a precedent, because we debated in this House a report that had not been brought up to date and was then referred back to committee for the vote.
I think this is a very odd procedure to say the least, and one that I hope will not be repeated.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a very simple matter.
Both paragraph 11 and our amendment in its original form mention the possible budgetary consequences of 'the' increase in the number of agreements in the near future.
The problem we have is, first of all, that we cannot know there will be an increase and even if we could predict that, we cannot know what the increase will be.
Therefore it is only logical to change the word to 'any' so that it would read: 'Calls on the Commission to draw up a sound financial chapter concerning the financing of the fisheries agreements which should take into consideration the possible budgetary consequences of any increase in the number of agreements in the near future'.
I hope that is clear to the House.
Â Â  I would like to thank the Members who took part in the vote.
I would ask you to remain in the House because, in a few minutes, we will welcome the President of the Republic of Latvia, a country that will soon be a member of the European Union, for a formal sitting.
Explanations of vote will take place after the formal sitting.
Â Â  . To make speed-limiters mandatory in a wide range of vehicles, effectively imposing a speed limit of 62 mph or less throughout the EU, is far too prescriptive.
The main aims of the proposal â to improve road safety and reduce environmental pollution â are worthy ones, but there is not sufficient evidence that this is the best way to achieve them.
Conservative MEPs also fear it is inevitable that, in due course, there will be calls for speed limiters to be introduced for private cars, which really would be far beyond what would be acceptable for most people.
Â Â  Speed limitation on-board systems for vehicles transporting passengers and goods have proved very useful in raising road safety standards, reducing the seriousness of injuries sustained as a result of accidents and reducing levels of air pollution and fuel consumption.
For these reasons, I fully support this proposal for a Parliament and Council directive.
It aims to broaden the scope of the harmonised requirements relating to speed limitation devices or similar speed limitation on-board systems for all motor vehicles of categories M2 and M3 designed for transporting passengers.
This will help make the road system safer and more sustainable, which is crucial to the execution of future transport policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, our vote in favour of the solidarity fund to cover the requirements of countries and regions struck by natural disasters comes with two hopes or two recommendations.
First, we hope that with the forthcoming 2004 financial year the fund may be suitably expanded, or at least index-linked, as Mr Turchi assured me he would propose; since the fund is so meagre, it is completely inadequate to meet the needs of the recipient Member States, as has already been seen this year.
With regard to our second hope, setting up the fund is a first, concrete step forward, but it is not enough in itself.
It is not enough to think about funding countries struck by natural disasters if we do not also think about a serious forecasting and prevention policy.
We believe the time has come for the Union to think of setting up a European Civil Protection Agency with the remit of coordinating and managing risk prevention and emergencies among Member States.
Recent painful examples in Europe remind us that catastrophes and disasters can be supranational, and yet one cannot rely on the generosity of volunteers or the competence and resources of just the country immediately affected.
Europe should be able to have adequate human, financial and technical resources available, ready to take prompt action.
This may be an ambitious objective, but it is not unachievable.
After all, every citizen, and not just every European citizen, has a right to safety that I believe is physiological rather than constitutional.
We therefore bring the problem to the attention of the Commission and Parliament in the hope that we shall not remain its only proponents.
Â Â  I could only vote in favour of this report, which confirms the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in Portugalâs favour by granting it EURÂ 48.539Â million â in other words, the exact amount requested by the Portuguese Government â to deal with the effects of this summerâs devastating fires.
This amount will allow emergency measures to be set in place for the communities stricken by the consequences of the fires, which killed 18Â people and destroyed more than 403Â 000Â hectares of woodland.
It will help alleviate the social costs incurred by the loss of jobs and sources of income, and the environmental impact of the fires.
It will help restore productive potential in the affected areas.
Aid applications such as this are overly complicated.
The Commission, therefore, should review the regulations governing the mechanisms by which funds are allocated by the Solidarity Fund, which was created precisely in order to respond effectively to emergencies.
The Commission should make these Community administrative procedures more flexible and simpler.
I should like to conclude by reminding you that forest fire monitoring and prevention measures need to be devised, and appropriations for the Forest Focus programme increased.
Â Â  . The Portuguese delegation of the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the European Parliamentâs decision to grant Portugal EURÂ 48.5Â million from the Solidarity Fund, to help with the recovery of the huge tracts of woodland and agricultural land destroyed in our country by this yearâs fires.
We would like to emphasise, nonetheless, that this amount falls far short of what is needed, given the scale of the tragedy.
In this connection, we would remind you that during the various budgetary debates after 1999 the Portuguese socialist delegation proposed repeatedly that a fund of this nature be established, and we vigorously support CommissionerÂ Barnierâs intention to review current regulations to allow them to respond more adequately to natural disasters on this scale.
Bearing in mind the modest sum available from the Solidarity Fund, we appeal to the Commission to make all possible use of the flexibility clause, as this is a case, so as to allow money to be reprogrammed from the Structural Funds and from rural development, in order to support Portuguese rural society through an integrated programme to recover from the effects of this disaster.
Â Â  . I support and have voted in favour of MrÂ ColomÂ iÂ Navalâs report, which authorises financial payment from the Solidarity Fund to Portugal.
The scale and severity of the tragedy which struck our country justify appeals for EU support.
The Commissionâs first response was confined to EURÂ 30Â million, which CommissionerÂ Barnier himself recognised as falling well short of expectations and requirements.
I welcome the European Parliamentâs display of solidarity, its support for Portugal and the negotiating skills of the Portuguese Government, in particular those of the Secretary of State for European Affairs, DrÂ CarlosÂ CostaÂ Neves.
The EURÂ 48.5Â million in aid for which we have voted today is a fairer and more fitting amount than that previously provided.
Â Â  The repercussions of the forest fires which swept through Portugal this summer are far from over.
The heavy rains have brought landslides and floods which have threatened to worsen the scale of the catastrophe, over and above the environmental consequences in terms of soil erosion, and the severe socio-economic problems experienced in areas of the interior of the country where woodland was the main source of economic activity.
The figures do not convey the depths of the suffering of our communities, although they do illustrate the scale of the disaster, which caused the deaths of 20Â people, laid waste 5%Â of Portugalâs total land area and almost 11% of our woodland areas, leaving 45Â 000Â people deprived of any source of income, and costing a total of more than EURÂ 1.3Â billion, almost 1.12% of Portugalâs gross national income, in direct damages.
We therefore welcome the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund to provide EURÂ 48.5Â million for Portugal, after the Commissionâs latest adjustment in the light of new information received, in accordance with our direct request in the Committee on Budgets.
We would remind you, however, that more should have been done, as we proposed.
The amount of aid is at odds with the scale of the tragedy, and this raises the issue of assessing and revising the current criteria for mobilising the Solidarity Fund.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs proposal to award such widely varying amounts of aid from the SolidarityÂ Fund is the result of the very different assessments of the damage caused undertaken by the governments concerned and submitted to the Commission.
Those regions affected by the disaster are set to receive less than a fifth of the amounts Portugal and Italy are to be awarded following the fires and the earthquake.
This is due to the GovernmentÂ ofÂ Spain adopting a mistaken strategy.
It understated the extent of the disaster.
Consequently the regions affected will receive far less from the Community than they are entitled to.
The EURÂ 8.6Â million in question is the only additional sum Spain is to receive further to the disaster.
The only Community aid received to date resulted from reprogramming funds previously allocated to Spain.
In the light of research such as that undertaken by the BarrieÂ deÂ laÂ MazaÂ Foundation, this is a derisory amount.
This research sets the damage at between EURÂ 4Â 000Â million and EURÂ 6Â 000Â million.
According to the GovernmentÂ ofÂ Spain it is only EURÂ 436Â million.
The accident was comparable to the disaster.
Then, the UnitedÂ States estimated the damage at USDÂ 10Â 000 million.
Â Â  . As you know, Portugal was scourged from north to south this summer by a plague of fire on a scale never before seen.
In all, more than 400Â 000 hectares were consumed by fire.
Apart from the economic losses, valued at EURÂ 1Â 372Â billion, we also regret the loss of the 18Â victims who died and the sources of income and homes of 45Â 000Â people.
Apart from the human and economic consequences, this tragedy has also brought social and environmental costs.
We have now voted in favour of this proof of the European Unionâs solidarity, to be given to the affected communities through the Solidarity Fund.
I would like to join the Secretary of State, MrÂ Costa Neves, in sincerely thanking the European Commission and the European Parliament for their speedy and efficient processing of Portugalâs application for Solidarity Fund assistance.
The amount contributed by the Solidarity Fund will be EURÂ 48.5Â million.
I can only point out that this amount equals 8.5% of the total damage suffered.
Finally, if I may, I will agree with the rapporteurâs observation that the damage caused by this disaster could, in part, have been avoided by means of adequate and effectively-implemented prevention measures.
For this reason, I support the increase in the budget for those elements of the Forest Focus programme dealing with prevention policy.
Â Â  The Solidarity Fund is of a different nature from the other funds, and should provide compensation for part of the public costs incurred as a result of the disaster.
Financial assistance given in order to alleviate large-scale natural disaster scenarios, such as the fires that ravaged the communities of southern Europe, should go towards the speedy re-establishment of normal living conditions in the affected areas.
Decentralising the financial management of such assistance is of the utmost importance, since, as we know, elected local authorities are closest to the disaster and feel it most.
In the specific case of the fires in my region, the mountains of the western Algarve, it would make perfect sense if the relevant local authorities were asked to take part, together with civil society organisations, in the programming and management of these funds.
My suggestions include, amongst other things, measures aimed at reorganising land use, reforestation using indigenous plants and mobilising small investors, with the help of tax and/or other incentives favouring the installation and maintenance of preventive equipment in woodland areas.
Â Â  . The aim of this report is, amongst other things, to enter into the budget the EURÂ 48.5Â million mobilised to assist Portugal in accordance with the provisions of the Solidarity Fund in the wake of the tragic forest fires which swept through Portugal this summer.
The Solidarity Fund was mobilised quickly, and this amending budget was adopted in one single reading.
That is very welcome, since it ensures more rapid assistance from the EU budget following the applications presented.
The amount now approved, however, is clearly insufficient given the costs of the direct damages, more than EURÂ 1.3Â billion, and, in particular, given the total costs of the eligible damages, around EURÂ 104.3Â million.
It should be remembered that when Commissioner Schreyer was questioned in the Committee on Budgets, she expressed her willingness to review the sums allocated to Portugal if the damage estimates were to rise.
This would be done principally through an amending budget.
The Commissioner has kept her word by issuing this amending budget once the Portuguese Government provided further information.
It is now the governmentâs turn to assess the current situation as regards the consequences of the forest fires, taking particular account of the effects of the rains in the fire-affected areas.
Â Â  .â As a Portuguese, it is with great sadness that I recall the terrible, nation-wide disaster that caused the deaths of a score of people and destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of forests and farmland, while 45Â 000 people lost their possessions and their jobs.
The direct damage suffered by Portugal amounts to almost EUR 946.489 million, a sum well over 0.6% of GNI (in other words, more than EUR 718.12 million).
On 4 August 2003, following the tragic summer fires in Portugal, the Portuguese authorities announced their intention to submit to the Commission a request for mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund.
The request was officially received on 13 August and additional information was submitted by Portugal on the 22 of that month; at a public hearing in September, Portugal stated that it was asking for Solidarity Fund intervention to the value of EUR 48.5 million.
In view of the fact that, in its September resolution on the âeffects of the summer heat waveâ, the European Parliament suggested that the Solidarity Fund contribution should be increased in the case of Portugal so as to be closer to the eligible amounts, estimated at EUR 94 million âŠ
Â Â  In spite of the good intentions displayed, the âBetter Law-Makingâ report and interinstitutional agreement are unconvincing.
Indeed, the fine declarations concerning respect for subsidiarity are in contrast to the Conventionâs proposals, supported by the European Parliament, which entrust ultimate control to the Court of Justice.
In a democracy, it is unacceptable for the Court of Justice to decide whether opposition by the national parliaments to a proposal by the Commission is valid.
In addition, the mechanism of the interinstitutional agreement, respect for which depends upon the good will of the institutions, is in itself an infringement of the legal quality and certainty ostensibly sought by this exercise.
The CPNT MEPs of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities are unable to approve these documents.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the Frassoni report on âBetter Law-Makingâ.
While awaiting the entry into force of the European Constitution, which will bring unquestionable advances when it comes to the transparency of Community procedures and respect for the distribution of competences and for the principle of subsidiarity, I believe it is necessary to improve legislative practice in the framework of the treaties currently in force.
From this point of view, the interinstitutional agreement between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament is good news, for it offers greater clarity and coherence while respecting the powers, procedures and general principles of our positive law.
Too often, the documents adopted by our Assembly are still difficult to access by the uninitiated. We can do better.
The interinstitutional agreement opens the way to realising an ambition of the kind already referred to in the White Paper on Governance.
It now remains to give practical expression to that ambition.
Â Â  .â I believe it is essential to improve the coordination of the law-making process.
I therefore agree to a great extent with the interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to improve the quality of law-making through a set of new initiatives and procedures.
Of these, I would like to highlight the establishment of indicative timetables for the various stages leading to the final adoption of each legislative proposal, and the attempt to ensure better synchronisation for the treatment of dossiers by the preparatory bodies of each arm of the legislative authority.
I welcome the reference to âself-regulationâ, which does not come within the Unionâs mandate and allows private partners to adopt common guidelines among themselves and for themselves at European level.
The draft agreement also addresses the issue of better transposition of Community law into national law, whereby the institutions undertake to ensure that all directives include a legally-binding time limit for their transposition that is as short as possible.
In my opinion, the result of this agreement is quite well-balanced and achieves the objective of improving the quality of Community law-making.
I therefore voted in favour of it.
Â Â  By envisaging the space industry only in terms of struggle in a competitive market, basically with the United States, this report has an entire symbolic dimension to it.
It obviously wants increased access to public funds, that is to say to taxpayersâ money, in order to help European businesses retain, or acquire shares in, this market.
In the interests, moreover, of still greater efficiency, it recommends orders in the military sector, something that, in addition, would enable manufacturers to benefit from the knowledge already acquired in this area and would move in the direction of establishing a European military force independent of that of the United States â a military force which some people consider vital to conducting operations that they refer to as âpeacekeepingâ, but which are nothing other than operations for defending the interests of European manufacturers and financiers.
By its clarity, such a report is like a confession: the aims of the European institutions are none other than to mobilise knowledge and public funds in the interests of European private capital, in the space sector as elsewhere.
We can obviously only vote against a report so obviously marked by these preoccupations alone.
Â Â  I have supported, and voted in favour of, this report which acknowledges the efforts made by a number of European states to ensure that Europe now has policies concerned with space.
The results obtained are impressive.
For all that, if, now, there is a desire to avoid serious difficulties and a situation in which, in the end, only the law of the strongest continues to apply, rapid progress needs to be made towards a controlled communitisation, as is being done in the field of research.
It is not a question of âdoing in place ofâ, but of enabling European added value to be brought to bear.
Space will be ever more present in all aspects of peopleâs daily lives.
Europe needs to be in space.
Space will always be an engine of industrial innovation.
Europeâs industrial future also depends, therefore, upon our investment in space.
Those are just a few of the reasons why I have supported this report and voted in favour of it.
Â Â  I have voted with satisfaction and relief in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Bodrato, concerning the Green Paper on European space policy.
Satisfaction, because what is at stake is European autonomy: a Europe that is sovereign in strategic terms must have its own military and spatial capacities.
Relief, because this vote shows that the European institutions have become aware of the concerns of manufacturers and politicians faced with the recent economic deterioration of this sector and the increased strength of our international competitors.
Europe will take up the challenge of space if it takes strong measures in response to the White Paper to be presented in December and if manufacturers engage in restructuring in order to become more competitive.
If this is to happen, we shall need a boost in public investments. Otherwise, our big groups will not retain their high profiles in terms of technology and human resources, and we shall lose skills.
Following the crucial support given to the Galileo programme and to Ariane V, this vote by the European Parliament shows that the European Union knows how to defend its vital strategic interests and, over and above that, wishes to contribute to the knowledge of a universe about which the human race cannot remain indifferent.
Â Â  .â We uphold the view that a space policy based on cooperation between Member States should be clearly and unambiguously founded on the non-proliferation of weapons, the non-use of space for military purposes and a rejection of the arms race in space.
We have therefore always denounced and criticised the United States for proposing to set up a National Missile Defence system (NMD), which will militarise the use of space and set off an arms race, with dire consequences for the future of all humankind.
This report not only fails to criticise the militarisation of space, but even attributes a central role to a âEuropean agency for Armaments, Research and Military Capabilitiesâ, proposing a partnership between it and the European Space Agency and stressing the âdual nature of [âŠ] civil and military activitiesâ in space.
The resolution also supports the military use of satellite systems in carrying out what it euphemistically terms âpeacekeeping operationsâ, which means paving the way for war operations, thus going against the spirit of United Nations General Assembly Resolution NoÂ 49/74 of 15 December 1994 on prevention of an arms race in outer space, and in particular Article 4 thereof.
We therefore voted against the resolution.
Â Â  As a consequence of the decline in the telecommunications sector and the tough competition surrounding launchers, the European space industry is now in such a serious economic position that its survival is threatened.
This, together with the fact that the EU is facing its biggest enlargement ever, involving ten new Member States, and the fact that its resources are limited, shows that the EU should focus its activities better and devote itself to fewer specialist areas.
For that reason, I have voted against the report.
Â Â  Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) 4064/89on the control of concentrations between undertakings sets out the guidelines according to which the Commission is to assess whether a concentration between undertakings is or is not compatible with the common market.
Instead of the current model, which mainly concentrates upon whether the companies would acquire a dominant position, we recommend a more flexible model (what is known as the SLC test), according to which a concentration between undertakings must be prohibited if it may contribute to a weakening of competition or the creation of a monopoly.
Â Â  It is exhilarating to see the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the nation states struggling in their attempts to regulate their sacrosanct competitive market.
The concentrations that everyone aspires to control are only, in fact, the logical outcome of this competition in which the biggest fish naturally devour the smallest.
Whether it is the Commission or the nation states that pretend to control these battles between financial sharks is of no importance from the workersâ point of view.
In any case, capitalist groups already dominate the economy and know how to influence and, at worst, disregard or circumvent the pathetic decisions taken by the European institutions.
What the report calls the âcontrol of concentrations between undertakingsâ has no purpose other than that of defending the interests of certain capitalists against those of others.
At no time is it a question of controlling concentrations in such a way that they are useful to society and do not harm employees and consumers.
At no time is reference made to the dramatic consequences for the populations of these factory closures, restructurings and social plans accompanying the concentrations.
It is to express our absolute rejection of the reportâs concerns that we have voted against it.
Â Â  .â The trend towards increasing concentration and centralisation of capital is inherent to the capitalist system and is driven by the primacy of competition and the growing liberalisation and internationalisation of capital.
The emphasis on this strengthened intercapitalist competition, connected with the constant revolution in production processes generated by technological development and economies of scale, leads to the law of the survival of the fittest, throwing competitors out of the marketplace and creating markets that are more and more oligopolistic or even monopolistic.
Competition policy, particularly the control of concentrations, is an attempt by the system to self-regulate and to avoid the vicissitudes of economic cycles and the negative influences of dominant or concerted positions on the markets.
Evidently, however, it cannot reverse the general trend.
In view of current liberalisation processes and the extent of market integration, however, there has been strong pressure to amend Regulation No 4064/89, which was seen to be too restrictive of the need to create strong business groups that could compete internationally.
The Commissionâs proposal thus takes a step forward with new concepts of concentration on a Community scale.
The rapporteur wants to go even further.
He wants a narrower concept of concentration, in the sense of restricting control or opposition to a concentration to a minimum.
We also reject this report on these grounds.
Â Â  The Della Vedova report reflects the ideology of the Commission, adopted in its own way by the liberal majority of this Parliament.
Indeed, the real problems posed by the acceleration of the global movement towards concentrations between undertakings are treated exclusively as threats to competition.
The known risks for consumers (price rises, lack of transparency etc) or for the employees of these companies (such as stock market redundancies, the abandonment of activities and the transfer of production to companies offering least in terms of social benefits) are not taken into account as such.
As if free competition had demonstrated that it was up to dealing with these risks!
In France, the latest concentrations between undertakings â from Vivendi to Air France, from Alstom to PÃ©chiney â have shown how, in terms of their concerns, national and European institutions are getting it all wrong when it comes to the things that are needed.
For us, it is, however, these very things that go to the heart of the general interest.
Taking them into account would certainly make it worthwhile revising the procedure for the European control of concentrations between undertakings, but the option followed in this case is still hostage to the âhealthy competitionâ dogma.
That is why we have voted against this resolution which, with its blind alleys, is an insult to the employees concerned and, more generally, to all citizens.
Â Â  In carrying out its work on revising competition law, the Commission is proposing here a thoroughgoing change to the regulation on concentrations.
This initiative must be fully welcomed.
For several years now, European companies, now joined by the Community judge, have been emphasising the shortcomings of Regulation 4064/89.
The unduly long procedure for investigating concentrations and the imprecise nature of the notion of dominant position were only two features that were clearly not such as to permit the carrying out of operations rendered more and more necessary in the interests of the global competitiveness of European companies.
The Commissionâs proposal, enriched by the amendments adopted by Parliament, should normally enable the big European industrial groups to hold their own and compete on equal terms with their American competitors.
In applying the new wording, the Commission will still have to demonstrate genuine European ambition and set aside the approach, couched in narrow accounting terms, that has again recently prompted it to refuse certain industrial mergers.
A legal text is nothing independently of the interpretation given of it.
I therefore hope that the Commission will embark upon its own cultural revolution and, in particular, abandon this procedural zeal that has done so much to harm companies and European employees.
Â Â  .â Like the rapporteur, I welcome the European Commissionâs intention to carry out a wide-ranging review of the Community anti-trust or competition system, within which this proposal for a regulation is another important step.
Several recent decisions by the European Court of Justice have pointed to the need to clarify and simplify competition rules, especially in view of the competitive environment in other parts of the world.
In general, both the courts and the business community are stressing the need to take account of the requirements of a free and dynamic market, which should not be excessively burdened by long and cumbersome procedures for transactions which are in no way illicit, but are part of the normal functioning of a free market.
Regulation of the various aspects of Community competition law â particularly rules on state aids, concentration operations, abuse of a dominant position or concerted action aimed at distorting the market â should never lose sight either of the requirements of an open, free economy that wants to be regulated or of the right level of Community intervention in companies and the Member States, which, as we know, is governed by the principle of proportionality in this area.
Since the rapporteur succeeded in introducing both these concerns, I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  The Commission has consulted the European Parliament on the proposal for a Council regulation on the control of concentrations between undertakings.
The Commission wishes to assure itself that there will be no distortion of competition in the common market.
Steps should therefore be taken to prevent dominant positions and oligopolies because these are in danger of leading to a rise in prices, the regulation of production and a reduction in quality.
In these respects, the Commissionâs proposal was clear and vigorous.
Many of the rapporteursâ amendments were aimed, however, at softening the Commissionâs proposals, with the justification that concentrations between undertakings are entirely lawful in themselves and cannot be compared with cartels.
The rapporteur believed, therefore, that the Commission should not be given the same powers of investigation in the matter of concentrations between undertakings as in the matter of cartels.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believes that the Commissionâs more stringent wordings are better than the main thrust of Parliamentâs adopted amendments.
That is why I have voted ânoâ in the final vote.
Â Â  The resolution may criticise the situation concerning the transmission of data to the USA, but it accepts its legalisation.
We have a series of international police state measures to which we are adding a new one.
The Council of Ministers for Justice has decided to allow police surveillance on the territory of other Member States of suspects from the territory of the police conducting the surveillance.
This is allowed for a wide range of crimes, whereas before it was only possible for offences which resulted in the extradition of the suspect.
These crimes, apart from terrorism, murder, kidnap, taking hostages, trafficking in human beings, transporting explosives and transporting toxic waste, also include theft, offences of a serious sexual nature and smuggling drugs and psychotropic substances.
The French and German police will only need to request authorisation from the Greek authorities or notify them of the surveillance.
Thus, soon the cafÃ©s in Omonia Square and Syntagma Square, especially in the run-up to the Olympics, will look like a scene from an Ian Fleming or John Le CarrÃ© novel.
The French policeman will be watching a pickpocket, the German policeman will be watching a junkie and the Greek police will just be looking on.
We saw this with the murky Van affair, where foreigners conducted surveillance and which was linked to the 17Â November affair, and now we shall see them âlegallyâ imposing complete chaos and a Euro-police state and subverting national sovereignty.
Â Â  I abstained from voting on the resolution on transfer of personal data by airlines to the American authorities in the case of transatlantic flights, devised with a view to tracking down terrorists or perpetrators of serious crimes.
In the interests of protecting private life, the European Parliament is, indeed, requesting that these transfers be deferred until an appropriate international agreement has been concluded.
The intention is laudable, but the reasons behind it exaggerated and the result out of proportion.
The reasons are exaggerated because the resolution overestimates the risks (this data is not all that personal since the interested parties have already passed it on to the airlines) and tends to restrict the categories of criminal sought (why accept this data in connection with tracking down terrorists, but not murderers or rapists?)
The result of European reluctance would be to prohibit airlines from passing on all the data concerned, something that would put them in an untenable position, and to complicate the crucial fight against terrorism.
I therefore think that our proposals should have been the other way around: accept transfers of data for a transitional period, at the expiry of which a fair and transparent international agreement should be concluded.
Â Â  .â In reacting to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the European Union showed its solidarity with the United Statesâ goal of preventing and fighting terrorism.
No matter how noble the goals may be, however, the ends cannot justify the means.
The USA has been adopting a large number of measures to strengthen border controls, such as the requirement for airlines to transfer Passenger Name Record (PNR) data.
In March this year, the European Parliament considered it unacceptable for such data to be transmitted if there were no assurance of an adequate level of protection and compliance with existing Community rules.
The Commissionâs conclusions indicate that it is not possible to consider the data protection provided to be adequate (the objective that would justify obtaining and storing data remains unclear; the amount of data seems excessive and disproportionate; the period for which data are kept is excessive; no obligations have been accepted by the USA; and there is no means for appeal either by passengers or by the EU itself).
It is therefore essential that any transmission of data in contravention of Community rules should be stopped.
We have to determine which data may be transmitted and ensure that there is no discriminatory treatment and no retention of data beyond a passengerâs stay.
Passengers must be fully informed in advance and must always have access to a swift and efficient appeals system.
Â Â  .â The current situation, whereby the United States authorities have access to transatlantic passengersâ personal data (PNR, or âPassenger Name Recordâ) from computer booking systems (APIS, or âAdvance Passenger Information Systemâ), is unacceptable.
This situation infringes the right to personal data protection, including the current Community directive, as in fact this resolution states:
- the objective remains unclear; there is a risk that the data could be used for other purposes, including transfer to other services of the US administration;
- the number of items of data required (39 elements) is incomprehensible and out of proportion;
- the retention of data (6/7 years) is unjustified;
- passengers have no effective means of control or extra-judicial appeal.
US threats to withdraw landing rights from airlines that do not comply with their demands are equally unacceptable.
We demand that the right to personal data protection should be fully respected and that we should not give in to US demands by trying to establish derogations from the rules that exist in Europe.
The compatibility of the proposed introduction of so-called European Union passports containing chips with these same rules remains to be debated, however.
Â Â  .
It is vital that we do everything possible in the fight against international terrorism and major criminality and this requires a sensitive balance to be struck between registration and individual freedom.
Our allies in the United States are heavily committed in the fight against terrorism and we should do everything reasonable to support them.
This resolution could impede their efforts and the British Conservatives cannot therefore support it.
Â Â  The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution because it does not include the amendment which we proposed calling for a ban on the collection and transmission of personal data on passengers to third parties, as demanded by the citizens and, in part, by Article 6, paragraph 2 of Council Regulation 2299/98.
There are, of course, questions in the resolution as to the advisability of the measure, the introduction of biometric elements in the new passports of EU citizens and the terrorism agreement signed by the Greek Presidency of the ÎU with the USA, but only secondary and insubstantial corrections are proposed as to if records will be kept for three or for six years, if there should be fewer than 39 elements and if passengers will know and agree to have their details on record.
It is as if protecting privacy were a personal rather than a social and political matter.
This is yet another attempt to give pseudo-democratic coverage and cultivate self-delusion as to the role of the ÎU and the European Parliament in the global imperialist system.
What is important to the grass-roots movement is not if the ÎU is playing first or second fiddle, but that, together with the USA, it is carrying out an orchestrated attack on fundamental human rights and democratic freedoms.
Â Â  . Dictatorships are keen to detain critical foreign visitors at their borders or send them straight home from their airports.
The United States, too, has a tradition of barring those regarded as enemies or as dangerous influences.
The most effective way to get into the US as a suspected person is to have oneâs visit enforced by means of an extradition order by an American judge.
Visits of oneâs own free will are already in practice affected by the attempt to demand thirty-nine items of personal data on each and every passenger on transatlantic flights, including the choice of meals as a means towards determining whether someone is a Moslem.
On 20 May, I was one of those who took part in the protest against this at Schiphol airport in the Netherlands.
Europe cannot prevent the US from refusing entry to visitors from abroad, but that does not mean that the EU itself must cooperate in collecting data of this sort within Europe for the Americansâ purposes.
Such cooperation is and remains contrary to European standards on the protection of privacy.
I am glad that the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has lent its unanimous support to a ban on the transmission of data by airlines and automated booking systems, if this discriminates against those who are not US citizens, the data is kept for long periods and if information or review procedures are not in place.
Â Â  The European Parliamentâs resolution concerning the huge mortality rate for bees is fairly disappointing for, once more, it confines itself to evoking only a possible link between these phenomena and the use of certain pesticides, Gaucho and Regent, for the treatment of seeds.
It proposes that new studies be carried out and a committee of experts put in place.
As for the urgent provisions, it is content to request, in a very vague and allusive way, âpreventive measures to be taken to tackle the use of new generations of long-residue neurotoxic productsâ.
In the course of the debate prior to this resolution, held on 25 September, I had considered that, at present, the latest studies carried out, like the practical experience of beekeepers, reveal the existence of a direct link between the death of bees and the use of these insecticides.
That does not mean that other causes, like the general pollution of the towns and countryside, cannot have an influence.
These causes must not, however, serve to mask the influence of these insecticides.
Their use must therefore be suspended, at least provisionally, as a precautionary measure.
Not wishing to add my voice to that of the supporters of a wait-and-see policy, I have nonetheless voted in favour of this resolution which, moreover, has been improved along the way by an amendment by Mr Souchet.
Â Â  .â We support this proposal for a resolution in general, taking account of the difficulties that beekeepers in the European Union have been facing for years, with the decline in the bee population and the resulting loss of income, aggravated by climate-related constraints, the presence of diseases such as varroasis, and difficult market conditions.
In addition, the bee population has been declining in certain places at the same time, one cause being the use of systemic neurotoxic pesticides to treat the seeds of certain crops.
Hence it is necessary to find a solution to compensate beekeepers who are suffering major losses of bees.
These difficulties were aggravated this year in Portugal as a result of the severe forest fires that swept through the country.
It is estimated that more than 5Â 000 hives, especially in the Algarve, the Beiras and TrÃ¡s-os-Montes, were destroyed by the fires.
The direct losses come to roughly EUR 500Â 000.
This does not include the damage arising from the loss of future earnings and the destruction of the surrounding areas, which affects the foraging of the surviving populations.
I am therefore delighted at the adoption of our proposal for the Commission to carry out an overall assessment of the damage and to devise the requisite Community support measures.
Â Â  I should like to thank all my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who have helped find a consensus with a view to presenting, today in plenary, a resolution in response to the oral question to the Commission and in response to the debate that took place on 25 September in Strasbourg on the difficulties encountered by European beekeeping.
This resolution is very balanced, as evidenced by its unanimous adoption by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I hope that this unanimity will finally encourage the European Commission to follow up the requests we have made in our resolution. I hope it will cease to ignore the fact that, for years, beekeepers have had to face severe problems connected with losses of their bee populations, amounting in some cases to more than 80%, and with a sharp decline in honey production, leading to significant loss of income.
More and more beekeepers, in all regions of the European Union, are giving up beekeeping.
An interesting but difficult profession, young people are not prepared to make it their own.
Moreover, beekeeping â which has always been practised by many people not only as a source of income but also as a hobby â no longer has the same attraction, particularly because of the difficulties resulting from new diseases.
Â Â  Beekeepers keep on sounding the alarm. Bee populations have been falling for years in proportions that put pollination at risk.
Why has this health disaster occurred?
No doubt the acarid varroa parasite is partly responsible, as in Germany where, in 2002, it destroyed 40% of the bee population.
Bayerâs Gaucho (imidaclopride) pesticide and BASFâs Regent (fipronil) pesticide bear a very heavy responsibility for these excessive mortality rates, however.
The German company, Bayer dared in vain to sue the former vice-president of Franceâs Beekeepersâ Union for âdefamationâ in June 2003.
The facts speak for themselves. When melliferous, sunflower, maize or rape crops are treated with these pesticides in the vicinity of bee colonies, the latter show serious behavioural problems and die .
The precautionary principle therefore requires that, at the very least, these two neurotoxic pesticides be urgently withdrawn in anticipation of serious , and no longer , studies involving biologists specialising in the life of bees and representatives of the beekeepers.
It is necessary right now to compensate the beekeepers who have sustained losses and to put an end to the unreasonable imports of foreign honey, which is sometimes adulterated and always offered on a dumping basis.
Â Â  â We agree with the motion for a resolution because it makes an effort to address the acute problems of apiculture.
We cannot preclude the possibility that the new generation of insecticides applied mainly using the method of immersing seeds is harmful to the environment and public health, especially when these preparations are used in different countries and after germination in order to combat certain plant enemies, with the result that their residues are greater during blossoming and in the final product.
That is why controls should also be carried out of post-germination sprayings so that we can improve our knowledge of how these preparations behave so that suitable measures can be taken to protect the environment and public health.
Â Â  I am very happy that the resolution drawn up by Mrs Lulling and myself, following the alarming information forwarded to us by European beekeepers, has been adopted with a large majority by our Parliament.
This resolution has the virtue of setting out clearly the problem of the serious consequences for the health of bees and for the human diet of using the new generations of molecules with powerful neurotoxic effects in the coatings of widely cultivated seeds.
By presenting it with two main requests, Parliament asks the Commission to overcome its inertia.
The resolution recognises that the current approval protocols applicable to plant protection products are no longer at all adapted to the new types of molecules appearing on the market and requests that they be updated by providing for specific new tests in connection with the health of bees and the risks of food contamination, given the scientific studies reporting on possible transfers of these molecules to the whole food chain.
The resolution also requests compensation for beekeepers who have suffered large losses in production, as well as aid in reconstituting the devastated bee populations.
The ball is now in the court of the Commission whose objective should be to support European honey production.
Â Â  We welcome the trend whereby the European Union is setting aside the traditional fisheries agreements in favour of new fisheries partnership agreements with third countries.
The old fisheries agreements were insufficiently generous towards countries that transferred fishing rights to the EU.
The new partnership will hopefully lead partly to more sustainable fisheries that take account of third countriesâ local needs and partly to these countriesâ having the opportunity in the future to exercise control over their fisheries themselves.
Â Â  .â I voted for the excellent own-initiative report by Mr Arlindo Cunha on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, which underlines the importance of a more active Community policy geared to signing international fisheries agreements.
These agreements, indeed, give the Community fleet access to third countriesâ waters, which is of vital economic importance to my country.
I must also point out the specific importance that these agreements generally have for the outlying and outermost regions of the European Union and the fact that, as the report states, they provide direct employment for 30Â 000 people, as well as an even greater number of indirect jobs in ancillary and processing industries.
These agreements, which account for 20% of the total Community catch, have also been an incentive for the development of the local fishing industries and, insofar as they help boost economic activity and trading volume in the co-signatory countries â developing countries, as a rule â they may prove to be additional valuable instruments for cooperation and dialogue with the European Union.
I agree with the concerns expressed by the rapporteur that these agreements should be governed by the same criteria of sustainability, conservation of fish stocks and precaution that prevail in fisheries in Community waters, particularly the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Food and Agriculture Organisation â 1995)
Â Â  .â ( The common fisheries policy and the Unionâs development cooperation policies, through their consistency, complementarity and coordination, must respect the principles of sustainable development while unfailingly contributing to poverty reduction in the countries concerned.
Traditional fishing by local communities in coastal areas must be protected and preserved because it is essential to the process of harmonious development, while helping to encourage other activities such as tourism and employment.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to remind the House that during the last part-session in Strasbourg, I spoke on two occasions about Membersâ freedom of access to the House.
We all know about the budgetary situation for the car pool.
Some Members have found that when they are very short of time, they cannot get a car; they have to take a taxi and then downstairs, even though they say that they are Members, they cannot come upstairs, which takes up more time.
This was why I was not present for the first roll-call vote today.
I would urge the Bureau to address this issue of Membersâ freedom of access to the House, regardless of whether the situation arises because of a demonstration or for other reasons.
This is an important issue.
I read the minutes of the Bureauâs meetings regularly.
I read about colleagues who write letters whose content may or may not be important, but I have seen nothing to indicate that certain interventions, notably from Mr Posselt and myself, have been discussed by the Bureau or that we are being offered a reasonable and acceptable answer.
Â Â  Thank you for that information, MrÂ Wieland.
It is not the Bureau but the College of Quaestors that is responsible for these issues.
Obviously, I shall pass on your comment to our friends, the Quaestors, as well as to the President.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(1)
Â Â  â I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 9 October 2003.(1)
Â Â  â The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 15 October 2003 has been distributed.
The following changes have been proposed:(1)
As regards the report by Mr QueirÃ³ on defence equipment (A5-0342/2003), I have received a request from the UEN Group to refer this report back to committee pursuant to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I have asked for the floor on a point of order. On behalf of my group, I would like to request that a report be referred back to committee, pursuant to RuleÂ 154 of the Rules of Procedure.
The facts of the matter are that, following the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy a report was adopted on Community defence equipment policy for which I am rapporteur and which is on the draft agenda for this coming Wednesday.
The Conference of Presidents had decided â and herein lies the problem â that this report should be drawn up pursuant to RuleÂ 162(a) of the Rules of Procedure, which is to say, according to the procedure for enhanced cooperation between Parliamentary committees.
Under these circumstances, the Committee on Foreign Affairs was responsible for commenting on the basic texts, and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy was responsible for delivering an opinion.
For reasons linked to how this rule â a recent one, incidentally â was interpreted, the reworded report is incoherent and different from the one adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
With a view to overcoming this difficulty, I would now like to request that the report be referred back to committee.
Our aim in making this request is not to change what has already been approved in committee, or to call into question the Committee on Industryâs status.
As I said, we wish to enable the opinion of the Committee on Industry to be coherently incorporated into this report in order to preserve the integrity of the report as a whole, which could not be done in time.
I appeal to my fellow Members, therefore, to support my request in this instance, since my sole intention is to help solve this problem â which, incidentally, has arisen through no fault of my own â in a constructive fashion.
â Following the referral back to committee, I have received a request from the PPE-DE Group and the GUE/NGL Group to include, after the debate on the Brok report on Wednesday, Council and Commission statements on the forthcoming EU-Russia summit, including the situation in Chechnya, without motions for resolution.
Â Â  â Mr President, the EU â Russia Summit is to be held next week and in Chechnya there have just been elections, which, with the best will in the world, cannot be regarded as quite the sort of presidential elections we in the West are accustomed to.
On top of everything, Russia is a big superpower, or at least a big country, which is close by to us, and whose affairs we have not really spoken about too much.
We have discussed issues much less directly relevant to us in separate debates here.
The situation regarding the war in Chechnya has not changed, and it demands a debate.
For that reason, I propose a separate debate on it and I, for one, am very much in favour of that.
With all due respect to these other proposed debates, they are rather less relevant to us in terms of their subject matter.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that anyone could suspect our group or me personally of being opposed to a debate on Chechnya.
Nevertheless, if we are going to have a debate on Chechnya, I think that it should be on the basis of a resolution.
This does not make any sense: everyone is aware of the situation.
For our part, we propose that there be a debate on Chechnya, on the basis of a resolution, at the mini part-session, that is to say in a fortnight's time. In any case, if it is topical issues that we are talking about, we ought to have held this debate, and voted on it, at the last mini part-session, whereas now Bolivia actually seems to me to be the most topical issue on which Parliament ought to adopt a position on the basis of a resolution.
We do not therefore wish to debate Chechnya without a resolution and propose that we do so at the mini part-session, with a resolution.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it may be possible to reconcile the two positions: firstly, we would accept the joint proposal from our two groups to debate Chechnya on Wednesday afternoon and secondly, we would defer the point on Bolivia to Wednesday evening, which means that it would be addressed in the presence of the Commission only.
Opting for this solution would, I think, enable us both to express our views on Chechnya and also say what we think about the bloody repression in Bolivia, which, I would remind you, has led to the deaths of almost eighty people in the space of one week.

Â Â  Mr President, last Friday, there was an extremely serious incident in Rome, prejudicial to freedom of information in the European Union: a judge ordered the searching of the premises of a major newspaper and the seizing of news material.
I am speaking as a journalist to a President who is also a journalist.
The police spent 13 hours at the newspaperâs premises and seized a great deal of material, although the alleged offence is only libel by a newspaper article.
The Italian judiciaryâs decision failed to take into account the decisions of the Council of the European Union and of the European Court of Justice, which have ruled on a number of occasions in favour of journalistsâ right not to reveal their sources.
In this regard, I would mention Recommendation R-2000/7, issued to the Member States on 8 March 2000 by the Council of the European Union, and the well-known Goodwin judgment also comes to mind, in which the Court of Justice enshrined the professional secrecy of journalists in law.
I would also mention the very recent judgment No 33400 of 15 July 2003, which lays down that searches carried out in workplaces to find journalistsâ sources constitute a serious violation of freedom of expression; again, the investigatorsâ aim of identifying the people responsible for information leaks from the law courts is not sufficient to justify the use of such methods.
Mr President, I have already tabled a question seeking to safeguard freedom of information both in my country and in the European Union as a whole.
I call for the European Parliament to intervene in this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, I had the opportunity to be in Romania last week, where I observed the preparations for the referendum.
Allow me to say that the referendum has made a mockery of the application of democratic rights.
Never have I seen so much fraud in the run-up to a referendum as I have in Romania.
For example, people taking part in the referendum were promised that their gas and electricity bills would be paid for by the state, and mayors are being offered free trips to China if they actively support the referendum.
Two hours before the polling stations closed, the turnout was only 45%.
Moreover, and this is perhaps the worst of all, there was also talk of restricting freedom of speech.
You do not always have to agree with the views of certain parties, but if you notice that the view of an important opposition party, namely the PRM, is simply removed from the website by government bodies, then Parliament needs to mount an inquiry in order to investigate the irregularities that have occurred during the organisation of this referendum.
It would be a good thing if we were to act on this, since Romania has, after all, applied to become a Member State.
Â Â  Mr President, on Thursday, 9 October, you informed us of the fact that you had received the common position on the revision of legislation on medicines.
This is important legislation, and if the common position is adopted, the effect will be a significant increase in the price of medicines in a number of countries, not only in the present Member States, but also in the countries that will be joining the EU with effect from May 2004.
The Public Health Ministers of the ten accession countries recently lodged a complaint against the common position and against the way in which it has been arrived at.
The accession countries have negotiated the treaties and have taken decisions on the basis of the old legislation.
This new legislation is a slap in the face for the governments and peoples of the ten new Member States.
Indeed, it is putting them to great expense without them having any say in the matter.
This is not exactly an example of proper governance.
The question is now how we in this House should respond to this.
We must at any rate find a way of taking proper account of the interests of the new Member States.
Rule 76 of our Rules of Procedure stipulates that in the common position, reference shall be made to the committee responsible and to the committees asked for their opinion at first reading.
Given the potentially major implications for the new Member States, it would also be advisable to seek the opinion of this Houseâs Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy at second reading, since this committee is probably best placed to formulate the interests of the new Member States.
I therefore urge you, in these special circumstances, to seek the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy.
Â Â  â That will have to go through the appropriate procedures.
You have correctly identified the route that needs to be followed in order to deal with the matter.
Â Â  Mr President, I am delighted to see that at the European Council meeting in Brussels last week, the 25 Heads of State and Government joined together in congratulating His Holiness, Pope John-Paul II on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his Pontificate.
His Holiness is one of the extraordinary figures of the 20th and 21st centuries and we now stand on the threshold of re-uniting a Europe which was divided for nearly half a century.
The Pope played a significant role in helping to bring down those barriers and close the final sad chapter of World War II.
I hope, Mr President, that you will send a message on behalf of this House and join with the European Council in congratulating Pope John-Paul and wishing him well as he continues his work for peace throughout the world.
Â Â  â Mr Hyland, I communicated sentiments of a similar sort on behalf of the House last Thursday.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to respond to what MrsÂ Corbey has just said about the second reading on medicines and draw your attention to the fact that we have some very tight deadlines to respect and that the price of medicines is not taken into account in this second reading; indeed it was not in the first reading either.
I do not think therefore that we should confuse all of the issues; above all, we must not fall behind schedule, given that the Italian Presidency ends in December and that our work will be completed at the end of April.
I wanted to draw your attention to this point: it is essential that we have European legislation in the field of pharmaceuticals as soon as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, in recent days, 22 people drowned off a Sicilian island, Lampedusa.
They had come from Somalia and paid USD 1 200 each to come and die in an attempt to reach Europe.
Since the beginning of the year, 7000 refugees have come ashore on Lampedusa, all fleeing in desperation from places that are not far from Europe.
It is a tragedy in which we may well be able to offer nothing more than routine and resignation.
At the Brussels Summit, a number of major European countries refused point blank to consider whether European quotas for legal immigration might be appropriate.
The Italian Presidency declared that strategic measures combating illegal immigration must be organised at European level rather than Member State level.
We agree with that, but we can only lament the fact that the Presidency has not be able to overcome this reluctance and achieve something more effective in the summit conclusions than a study on the relationship between legal and illegal immigration, which will certainly be useful as a study but is a wholly inadequate instrument if Europe is to respond properly to the tragedy.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that, with the change in funding for the European documentation networks and the closure of the documentation departments in the representations in the Member States, which are being merged with the corresponding departments of the European Parliament, there is a problem with informing and updating European citizens.
Under no circumstances should information and documentation be downgraded, especially in the run-up to the forthcoming European elections.
That is why I am asking you to make sure that their proper functioning is safeguarded for the coming period.
Â Â  â Perhaps the Member concerned might like to liase with my office on specific elements of that request.
But let me assure you that this concern is very much in hand in the Bureau.
There is an active and determined policy to focus on the issues you have touched on.
Â Â  Mr President, I had hoped to catch your eye a bit earlier because this concerns next week's agenda, but I hope you will agree to take the point now.
It concerns the proposal to have a statement from the Commission on Thursday 6 November 2003, entitled 'Ford workers laid off in Genk'.
Having worked in the automobile industry for nearly 30 years, I have tremendous sympathy with the workers in Genk and many other employees including those, in my own constituency, who are involved in restructuring of this kind.
But this is a very specific statement.
My understanding is that the Ford Genk plant will remain open: this is a question of adjusting production by taking off a shift because Ford wants to match production to demand.
If we had a debate about every instance of that across the European Union, we would be here debating those issues every day of the week.
So, can I ask you â and I hope I will have colleagues' support on this â to broaden this statement so that we can all be included, particularly those like myself who have constituents involved in motor vehicle manufacturing.
Could we ask the Commission to make a statement about employment prospects in the EU automobile sector?
That would allow colleagues with an interest in Genk to make their points.
In that case the Commission does indeed have an interest, but I would merely suggest to you that the Commission has no business or interest in how one company wishes to adjust output to demand.
We would, however, like to hear about the prospects for a crucial sector.
So could I ask you, Mr President, on behalf of myself and others, to request the Conference of Presidents to invite the Commission to make a statement on that basis.
It would be far more satisfactory for all of us to be engaged in that debate.
Â Â  â Mr Harbour, I can raise that matter with the Conference of Presidents since there is still some time, but it is not at my personal discretion to change the agenda as adopted by the House.
Â Â  â Mr President, my speech, too, concerns the distressing incidents which, I am afraid to say, are becoming more and more frequent along the Italian coasts.
In Lampedusa, as another Member has said, they are continuing, even now, to take stock of how many victims have been claimed by the latest boat to sink or by what was, at all events, a genuine tragedy.
Laying the blame at the door of the Italian Presidency would appear to be an unimaginative and certainly unusualway of addressing the issue; it may be that the blame lies with the countries which have not taken on board the recommendations and undertaking of the Italian Presidency, those countries which refuse common rules to control immigration, withdrawing into the ivory tower of their sovereignty.
However, we, too, have responsibilities, Mr President, and it is with regard to those responsibilities that I want to ask you intervene.
Parliament is processing dossiers on combating the trafficking of human beings and illegal immigration, on common asylum rules, on integration measures and on aid to third countries to enable them to mount information campaigns and dissuade their citizens from leaving.
These dossiers are still at a standstill.
We need to avoid the usual rigmarole of amendments and speed up the process: a crisis must be met with an urgent response, not with the usual irresponsible gentle pace of those who prize bureaucracy above the effectiveness of measures.
Â Â  â Since two Members have now touched on this issue, I should like to make a brief comment.
Since Tampere in October 1999, the European Commission has brought forward a number of proposals for directives.
In every instance so far, the European Parliament has delivered on time.
But in six cases where we have done our work, the Council of Ministers has thus far failed to do its work, as I pointed out on behalf of the Parliament at the European Council meeting last week.
Some of these issues have been outstanding on the Council's agenda for more than two years.
Yes, there is a problem, but that problem is not in this Parliament, it is with the Council and the Member States.
Â Â  â Mr President, in the European Union there is a network of so-called rural , which basically provide European citizens involved in this issue in rural areas with information on agricultural policies.
There are 138 in collaboration with public and private bodies, none of them profit-making, and they have been very surprised by a decision of the European Commissionâs Directorate-General for Press and Communication, of 29 September, which withdraws the aid they were receiving to meet the operating costs of these rural centres or .
I believe that this Parliament should express its concern, because one of the most important resources we have for coming closer to the citizens is currently being seriously hindered by this Commission decision.
I would ask you, therefore, to intervene in relation to this issue and to ensure the good functioning of these centres, for the sake of informing citizens in these rural areas and the European Unionâs agricultural policies.
Â Â  â We can follow up on that, as you request.
Â Â  Mr President, the operation to criminalise pacifist action is continuing in Greece with the referral to the courts of 5 peace fighters who, with thousands of others, expressed the opposition of the Greek people to the dirty imperialist war against the Yugoslavian people.
One aspect of the fight was the blockade on the columns of NATO vehicles, in which the 5 peace fighters also participated.
Although tried and acquitted, they are being brought to trial again on 29 October.
Recently, cadres of the All Workers Military Front trade union movement who opposed the violation of workers' and employment rights, the sentences imposed on strikers and the pronouncement of almost all strike action as illegal and abusive, were also convicted.
We have seen and are seeing similar trials against farming trade unionists.
This is an effort to terrorise the grass-roots movement and halt its development.
It comes within the framework of the abolition of employment and democratic rights and freedoms and the imposition of the new order of big business in all sectors.
Such action must be condemned categorically and measures must be taken to overturn any attempt to curtail democratic rights, which holds a gloomy future in store for us.
In all events, they will come up against intensified reaction by the workers and our peoples in general.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to focus my fellow Membersâ attention on a certain important question of major significance for the future of this institution: the matter of the Membersâ Statute.
I understand that last week the Committee of Permanent Representatives referred Parliamentâs proposal for a new Statute back to Parliament for further debate.
I would now like to ask here in plenary how Parliament intends to proceed from here so that we may have a new, more transparent and coherent Statute approved before the elections, and what procedure it intends to use to debate this issue so that we may switch to a new and even better system in the forthcoming parliamentary term after the European Parliament elections.
I would like to hear your opinion, as President, on the matter.
Â Â  â And so you shall, but not immediately.
It deserves some reflection.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, a large number of prospective immigrants drowned recently in the waters off the coast of Sicily.
When, I wonder, will the institutions of the European Union forego their callous and reprehensible indifference to tragic deaths such as these?
Moreover, when, I wonder, will we ourselves, the Members of this Parliament, observe at least a minuteâs silence for these poor souls who were looking for a better life in our countries?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like, as one Member has already done, to draw your attention to a letter that has been sent to the various Info-Points Europe, informing them that they are to lose their funding from the Commission.
At a time when our democratic deficit is making itself increasingly felt, should we not be welcoming this kind of organisation, a network which functions to general satisfaction, because it is actually a tool for raising awareness about the European idea, notable for its proximity to the public?
In fact, at the very moment of enlargement, on the eve of a crucial year for Europe, essential and vital resources are being withdrawn from our best information relays.
We must also note that this stands in complete contradiction to the new information strategy that was adopted in 2002.
If the administration considers the entry into force, on 1Â January 2003, of the new financial regulation to be reason enough to withdraw these funds, then it should also be aware that it is shaking the confidence both of associations about the work that can be done and of the public authorities, who represent us in this field.
I should therefore like to know how it might be possible, even before 2004, to envisage a way of supporting this network and subsequently perhaps to consider alternative ways in which it might continue to function.
Â Â  â Regarding the points made on information policy, I will discuss the matter with the Vice-President who deals with this, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca.
He is also the interlocutor for the European Parliament with the Commission on the issue of information policy.
We can then come back to the colleagues who have asked these questions.
Â Â  Mr President, on Saturday afternoon once again thousands of people filled the streets of San Sebastian in a massive response to the arrest of eight prestigious members of the Basque cultural world, in what could be considered a new round of repression aimed at the two main pillars of Basque society: its language and culture.
On the orders of Spain's , all those arrested are still being held incommunicado in Madrid, at the headquarters.
Among those arrested last Thursday at 3 a.m. was Mr Joxemari Sors.
When the only Basque daily was closed down eight months ago, he wrote an open letter to the Spanish judiciary saying that the newspaper had nothing to hide, but much to reveal if called upon to do so.
The defencelessness of those working to promote the Basque language and culture clearly shows the authoritarian character of the so-called young Spanish democracy.
Â Â  â Mr President, it never ceases to amaze me that a Member of this House, who belongs to an organisation declared illegal as a result of being an extension of the terrorist group ETA, who is subject to legal proceedings in France, who is apparently using the funds allocated to honourable Members in an irregular fashion, should, taking advantage of his status as a Member of this Parliament and protected by the freedom that implies â a freedom over which the terrorist group ETA rides roughshod on a daily basis â try to justify the unjustifiable.
I would have hoped, Mr President, that he would have condemned the latest attack by ETA which took place this weekend, but it is clear that, from a person whose positions are morally repulsive, who has not been able to condemn the murder of a six-year-old girl or any of the crimes of the terrorist group ETA, it is impossible to expect any comments or behaviour other than the type he has demonstrated here.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, last week, there were presidential elections in Azerbaijan.
The reports now coming out of Azerbaijan and Baku are very worrying.
The OSCE believes that electoral fraud took place.
The opposition leaders were harassed and, following the election, people were killed in riots.
News is now emerging that thousands of opposition members have been imprisoned.
I want to call upon you to protest most vigorously, on behalf of Parliament, against what is now happening in Azerbaijan.
If Azerbaijan wants to become a respected, democratic state, the country must fulfil the most fundamental condition of democracy and hold free and open elections.
That is something you should convey to the newly elected president, Ilham Aliyev, who is also Vice-President of the Council of Europe.
I say this as a friend of Azerbaijan.
I am a committee member of the Azerbaijani-Swedish Friendship Association.
Â Â  Mr President, could you please pass this message on to the authorities in Azerbaijan.
That would be very useful because they listen to us in Europe â they want to be a part of Europe.
Â Â  â I am happy to do that.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, various Nobel Prizes have been awarded recently to scientific and literary luminaries, but one in particular deserves a mention here.
The Nobel Peace Price was awarded to an Iranian lawyer, MrsÂ Ebadi, who has campaigned tirelessly, boldly and courageously for human rights and womenâs rights in her country.
This prize constitutes a huge boost in the struggle for the emancipation of women in Iran, and in the struggle for democracy against the theocratic rule of the mullahs in that country.
MrsÂ Ebadi, therefore, was welcomed by thousands of people, thousands of democrats singing her praises.
It was thus unfortunate that Iranâs supposedly reformist president, MrÂ Katami, should have belittled her, telling her that, when all was said and done, the Nobel Prize was not as special as all that.
Iranian society as we see it today, therefore, is in ferment.
It is a society striving for democracy, fighting a battle for freedom, democracy, human rights and womenâs rights in Iran.
MrsÂ Ebadi can now take up a commanding position in this battle.
MrÂ President, I would be grateful if you would congratulate MrsÂ Ebadi, because this Nobel Prize deserves a mention here, since it has been awarded to someone engaged in a great cause, one of the causes of this House, the cause of democracy, rights and freedoms.
Â Â  â The applause speaks for itself.
I will indeed communicate with the recipient of the prize on behalf of Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, under Rule 122, I should like to say just one thing about Mr Salafranca's comments a few minutes ago.
First of all, he did not trust my words, so I am not a trustworthy person for him and I am very proud of that.
Secondly, he did not say I was lying so what I said was the truth, the plain truth.
Thirdly, he said that I am outlawed under I do not know how many circumstances, by I do not know how many courts in Spain and France.
We are certainly outlawed in Spain, by the young Spanish democracy I mentioned.
But I am sorry, Mr Salafranca, I have no problems outside Spain.
It seems that there is a slight difference regarding the notion of democracy between Spain and all the other countries in Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Gorostiaga has referred to the possible problems I may have inside and outside Spain.
I would like to say to him â since he has mentioned it and since he has referred to this event â that my private car has been blown up in Barajas airport by his friends from the terrorist group ETA.
I will repeat what I have already said, moreover: Mr Gorostiaga has never once spoken out in this House to condemn the crimes, murders, extortion and shots in the back of the head carried out by his friends and cohorts in the terrorist group ETA.
I believe that position to be morally repulsive and gutless.
Furthermore, it is shameful, Mr Gorostiaga, that you should enjoy the freedom associated with being a Member of this House â a freedom over which your friends from ETA ride roughshod every day â and that you use it to make your totally disgraceful outbursts.
Â Â  â The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0343/2003) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position with a view adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation concerning monitoring of forests and environmental interactions in the Community (Forest Focus) (8243/01/03 â C5-0292/2003 â 2002/0164(COD)) (Rapporteur: EncarnaciÃ³n Redondo JimÃ©nez).
Â Â  â Mr President, when approximately a year ago we voted here on this Parliament's report at first reading and we achieved a sufficient majority to support the thesis I was advocating, I felt as if I had the strong support of the whole of Parliament.
I was advocating that this Parliament needed to demonstrate political firmness in relation to the proposed Forest Focus Regulation, which the Commission was presenting as a replacement for the two former regulations on pollution: combating pollution in Europe and combating fires in Europe.
The proposed law presented by the Commission added to these two objectives â âpollutionâ and âfiresâ â the study of biodiversity, climate change and carbon retention.
The Commission said that all of this had to be done with less money â with EUR 51 million â and that, furthermore, the prevention aspect of combating fires would be transferred to rural development.
In this way, this Parliament abandoned codecision for a mere opinion, without being able to control whether these programmes were going to be complied with or not, since they were being left to the Member States and were being transferred to a regulation whose control by Parliament was reduced to an opinion.
This Parliament was not therefore politically able to accept that proposal, nor could it accept it when the Councilâs common position was communicated and discussed and a small effort was made, of half a million euros, increasing the sum from EURÂ 13Â million to EURÂ 13.5 million, which represented a minimal effort in terms of assessing our forests.
It is not sufficient to say that we believe in them, but rather our support should be reflected in a greater budgetary increase, in a greater effort, since this is the only regulation we have for our forests.
We have held numerous meetings, both with the Council and the Commission, in order to reach an agreement and in order that this may become a significant commitment, and this is going to be achieved tomorrow in this Parliament, God willing.
A proposal has been received from the Council and accepted in Coreper, which takes account of those principal and priority needs which Parliament had described at first reading.
Article 1 places the prevention of fires on an equal footing with the other objectives of the Forest Focus Regulation.
Article 13 sets a budgetary increase, not the amount we would have liked, but sufficient so that we could reach agreement amongst all the Member States, increasing it to EUR 61 million until 2006; in Article 18, Member States are urged to present an assessment of the Regulation before the end of 2005, and the Commission to present new proposals from 2006.
By means of this agreement, reached amongst the majority of political groups in this House, I hope that tomorrow we will be able to close this regulation at second reading and provide political impetus for European construction.
It was very difficult for the countries of the European Union, especially those which have been ablaze this summer â in all corners of Europe, but essentially the countries of the south â to understand why prevention should not be included in this regulation.
The fact that it has been introduced on an equal footing is a cause of satisfaction for us and I would essentially like to thank the Commission, the Commissioner and Marie Claude Blin, for their efforts in reaching this agreement; I would also like to thank the Council, which has worked hard so that we may reach this agreement, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups, who have moved forward so that this agreement would be possible at second reading and so that we would resolve an issue which presented us with a serious problem: combating fires.
Â Â  . â Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, for her report concerning the Forest Focus Regulation on monitoring of forests and environmental interactions, and for her flexibility in presenting the compromise package designed to reach a second reading agreement.
I would like to recall what Forest Focus is designed to do.
The regulation aims to set up monitoring and reporting systems to help protect forests.
Sound political decisions have to be based on reliable information, and I firmly believe that we need harmonised and comprehensive long-term monitoring of forests at Community level.
This is also important so that the Community and Member States can implement activities agreed at international level.
In addition to this core task of monitoring, I want to reassure you that the Commission places great importance on the need to ensure the continuity of the measures covered by the two previous regulations concerning the protection of forests against air pollution and fire.
For this reason, since early summer, the Commission services have adopted a flexible approach in response to concerns expressed at the first reading stage by Parliament and the Member States.
I am pleased to say that the Commission can agree to the compromise presented by Parliament and by the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to start by warmly congratulating our rapporteur, MrsÂ Redondo JimÃ©nez, who has done an outstanding job, with the support, obviously, of Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
I say outstanding because, despite serious initial concerns, we have finally reached this compromise agreement with the Council.
The European forest is very diverse: from the forests of Scandinavia to those of the Mediterranean, the problems we encounter are completely different.
This summer, disaster struck southern Europe because of the drought and the heatwave.
It was therefore important to include fire prevention, which was not at all clear at the outset.
As MrsÂ Redondo JimÃ©nez has explained so eloquently, we need to consider all of the different facets of our forests: we need to look at them from an environmental point of view and take into account the problems of pollution, but we also need to consider their economic, touristic and social functions.
We need to compare different people's experiences and indeed take advantage of the good example set by the Scandinavian countries on forest management, but we also need to see our forests as part of our rural development strategy.
There is no doubt that a good number of Member States need to reflect on the future of their forests.
Fire prevention requires us to keep farming our land.
This should give critics of the common agricultural policy pause for thought.
The public should also be better informed in risk areas.
Finally, and above all, replanting of the forests that have been destroyed needs to be carefully thought through and species chosen that are appropriate to the land and climate and more likely to withstand fire.
We can therefore only welcome the new financial framework for 2003 to 2006, which provides for EURÂ 61 million, EURÂ 9 million of which will be allocated to fire prevention.
At last, we can exercise our full power of codecision because in 2006 we will also be evaluating what we have achieved.
The negotiations have, it is true, been very lengthy, but the result is important for Europe.
It is up to us to continue our efforts because, as our Commissioner said, this is an ongoing task.
Â Â  â Mr President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this important piece of work.
Forests are an important natural resource, and their sustainable management is vital, not only for natural diversity and ecological balance but also for our economy and prosperity.
It is important to establish a common database regarding the condition of the forests and the environmental pollution from which they are under threat.
This way we would be in a better position to ward off the threats and create a policy which will also safeguard our top quality forest resources in the future.
During Parliamentâs debate the prevention of forest fires was added to the group of activities to be funded out of the programme in the Commission proposal.
At the same time, Parliament has also been prepared to increase programme funding as part of the intergroup compromise.
The Council in its common position was strongly opposed to both these points: both the inclusion of fire prevention activities and an increase in funding.
The debates, however, have seen a clear convergence of opinion.
Parliament, and the Commission too, have worked hard to bring the Council closer to Parliamentâs position.
Now we have to see to it that there is consensus right to the end.
If Parliamentâs intergroup compromise is jeopardised in any way in tomorrowâs vote, the implementation of the entire plan will also be jeopardised, so I hope that the spiritual powers the rapporteur called upon will be present tomorrow in the vote.
As part of the compromise, too, the programme will cease at the end of 2006.
The Commission should put forward a proposal to continue with action to protect forests from atmospheric pollution and other phenomena that weaken them.
We nevertheless have to bear in mind how diverse the European forests are.
Fire prevention activities must be carried out by means of regional programmes in order to be able to address the most outstanding problems of each region and so that the activities involved are suited to forest types and climate.
It is also important that the people in a region can become involved in these programmes.
For this reason, when this programme work is undertaken in the future, these matters I think should be highlighted very clearly, and I believe that the Member States will supply valuable information before the Commission then puts forward its own proposal for after 2006.
Â Â  â Mr President, I must congratulate Mrs Redondo on the modification she has made in relation to forests.
My group and I are going to support her, and I would also like to congratulate Mrs WallstrÃ¶m on her speech.
She is always so concerned and sensitive in relation to all environmental problems, as she has demonstrated in her speeches on the Spanish state and its distribution of water.
I agree with the whole of the report.
I believe that the increase by millions of euros for the reconstruction of forests struck by disasters is extremely sensitive, but I believe that there must be democratic control in all the countries of the Mediterranean so that the investments of this Parliament in relation to information, prevention and repopulation are properly complied with, because otherwise we may find in a few yearsâ time that we have not moved forward, and that we are still affected by the atmospheric situation, by global warming and by bad management on the part of the Member States.
We have been talking about diversity of forests throughout the whole of the European Union and we therefore believe that we must create a common forest policy for the whole of Europe.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, climate change, the heatwave, and ecological delinquency: all these phenomena have brought catastrophe this summer, all of them need to be combated at every level, and this report is just one of many ways of doing so.
At the end of the day, the amounts at stake are modest and perhaps did not merit all of the political wrangling to reach this compromise.
Nevertheless, the Greens are satisfied with the compromise that has finally emerged.
In our view, this report could have been settled long ago, but we are reassured because the programme will, at long last, be able to be launched.
It could have started as early as 2002.
We also wish to remind you that the measures in this programme are transitional ones and that the countries that have not invested in fire prevention would be well advised to do so before the review in 2006.
We want the EU to find a happy medium at the next review, so as to strike a balance precisely between the two extremes: the countries of the North, which support subsidiarity in forest policy, and those in the South, which perhaps tend rather to knock on the door of the European treasury when problems arise.
Finally, where the projects are concerned, we would ask that one of the factors in the selection process be biodiversity, because although it is true that it is difficult to explain what biodiversity is, we are very well aware of how important it is in the forestry environment.
Reforestation, for example, should take the form of restoring the forest biodiversity that was damaged, if not totally destroyed, in the fires this summer.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to use this speech to welcome the progress made in the interinstitutional dialogue and the compromise which I believe has been reached.
As at first reading, our group strongly supported the amendments tabled in Parliament, especially those of MrsÂ RedondoÂ JimÃ©nez, whom I congratulate on her work.
These amendments concentrated on three central concerns of this new Forest Focus programme: the need to pay due attention to preventing forest fires, the need for the budgetary framework to be more open, and the need to pay clearer attention to the principle of subsidiarity.
We supported the bulk of the amendments, therefore, both those tabled by the Commission and the other proposals by certain fellow Members of this House, some of whom are members of my own group.
News of this compromise is welcome.
It follows on from the debate held here last February at first reading, and is especially pertinent given the heightened awareness of this issue in the wake of this summerâs disasters.
I would simply like to use this opportunity to remind you of some of the resolutions we have adopted recently.
In September the European Parliament insisted on the need to continue pursuing an effective prevention policy against forest fires, and reaffirmed that the Community should promote monitoring and prevention measures, especially within the framework of the Forest Focus Regulation.
It insisted on the need to reallocate to the European Union the same financial resources approved under RegulationÂ NoÂ 2158/92 on protection of the Communityâs forests against fire, particularly with a view to financing appropriate measures to prevent forest fires, such as lines, firebreaks, forest trails, access points and water-points.
Even more recently, during the October part-session, when we mobilised the Solidarity Fund, this point was reiterated.
I welcome the fact, therefore, that the Council and the Commission have finally become more open to Parliamentâs continual requests and have allayed one of European public opinionâs great concerns.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, first of all, I wish to convey my thanks to MrsÂ RedondoÂ JimÃ©nez for the sound work she has done on Forest Focus.
Allow me to make it clear that we fully support that part of the regulation concerning protection against forest fires.
I nonetheless consider the new parts of the regulation concerning soil strategy and the monitoring of biodiversity to be issues for each and every Member State.
Forestry production in southern Spain and northern Scandinavia cannot be compared with each other.
Finland and Sweden together account for 40% of European forestry production, and that is the backbone of the biggest export business in these countries.
Sweden has a forestry law that is a hundred years old this year.
Most forests are now certified, which means that forest owners themselves take responsibility for biodiversity.
Responsibility at local level is best.
The European Union cannot, on this issue, be controlled in its entirety from Brussels.
The Member Statesâ national forestry strategies and laws must be all-embracing, and the individual forest owner must have control of what he rightfully owns.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, as you know, countless regions of southern Europe were severely affected this summer by unprecedented forest fires.
In its resolution on the effects of the summer heatwave, adopted on 4Â September, a substantial majority of this House voted in favour of an amendment tabled on the initiative of my colleague Mr Savary, with the support of thirty-one Socialist Members, of whom I was one, insisting that the European Union be granted the same financial resources as it had under the regulation on protection of the Community's forests against fire, in particular so as to fund appropriate facilities to prevent forest fires, such as firebreaks, forest tracks, access points and water supply points.
Allow me therefore to express my delight that the Council, thanks I might add to the perseverance of our rapporteur, MrsÂ RedondoÂ JimÃ©nez, is now finally acknowledging, at least to some extent, that our arguments are valid.
We will in fact be asked to vote tomorrow on two amendments that partially meet our concerns.
We therefore note that a step has been taken in the right direction.
For all that, is it sufficient?
Forest fires should remain one of our political priorities, one of the symbols of the solidarity between northern and southern Europe.
I very much hope, therefore, that during the Commission's evaluation exercise in December 2005 the issue of an independent, European budget line, devoted to preventing forest fires, will again be raised, and that this will be done in close cooperation with all of the stakeholders, first and foremost the foresters.
We ought therefore, without prejudice of any kind, to consider whether the choice that is being made today is not to the detriment of a general safety policy, a policy that had proved to be very effective and was a visible sign of the European Union's presence in our regions.
Â Â  Mr President, the change in the definition from "forest ecosystems" to "forests" is a step backwards scientifically, in that "forest ecosystem" is scientifically a much fuller term.
In addition, a forest ecosystem does not qualify as such merely by reason of the fact that it measures half a hectare; a set of criteria and preconditions are needed in order for an area to qualify as a forest ecosystem.
Moreover, the report makes no reference to forests which have shrubbery and where trees account for less than 10%.
Tens of millions of acres of forest ecosystem in my country, which are today protected by Greek legislation and are a basic protected factor, according to recent announcements by the government on the bill which, basically, brings Greek legislation into line with the proposed directive, are in danger of becoming the object of exploitation, with incalculable consequences on the forest ecosystem, on the subsoil, on water retention and on preventing floods and enriching the water table.
Any so-called forestry policy to date â and I quote my country as a typical bad example â has failed to address the basic problems of forest ecosystems; on the contrary, they have contributed to the privatisation of the forests, hence the large number of arson attacks, given that we are talking about fires, the rapid appearance of big business and speculation in ecosystems of huge size and importance, such as national trust lands and so on, and appropriations and changes of use, in the aim of stepping up speculation by making use of them for tourist and housing purposes.
Finally, mere lip service is being paid to a greater interest in forest ecosystems; in fact, the application of more general policies and economic options is hardening, with more suffocating control and complete indifference as to the peculiarities and actual requirements of the forest ecosystems of the Member States, again serving speculation by big business.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to thank MrsÂ Redondo JimÃ©nez for her splendid work in drawing up the report on the Forest Focus programme.
It is excellent that the European Union is taking this important step to improve the condition of our forests and support a better and diverse forestry policy in all the Member States.
For the Nordic countries, and Finland in particular, forests are especially important for recreation and the economy but also for nature conservation.
The forests in the EU Member States are very different from one another owing, for example, to local natural conditions.
The social significance of forests and the principal reason they are needed also vary in different parts of Europe.
Last summer we saw what sort of massive destruction forest fires cause.
I am glad that Parliament has now also given attention to forest fire prevention in addition to monitoring activities.
In particular I would like to express my support for Amendment No 19, which concerns the status of the Standing Forestry Committee.
In my opinion, the Standing Forestry Committee should be involved in this programme and take account of coordination of forestry issues at EU level.
The forthcoming enlargement of the EU will also mean the coordination of forestry policy will have to be improved.
There are big differences between the current and the new Member States with regard to the forest ownership structure, and in the promotion of private forestry, for example, we Finns could be active in offering expert help to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, on the basis of our experience.
Amendment No 4, which emphasises the multifunctional role of forests, is also welcome in my view.
This is important, just as Amendment No 15 regarding compliance with the principle of subsidiarity is, because they both highlight the differences between forests and our regional and climatic conditions.
The scheme quite rightly supports national forestry policies in Member States whilst respecting the specific ecological characteristics of the remoter regions of the EU.
In future we have to stress the primary importance of national measures and the rules relating to the management of forests.
The creation of norms and regulations governing the management of forests must in future, I think, fall within the powers of decision of each Member State.
In this respect I also want to support the view of my colleague, Peder Wachtmeister, that the sustainable use of forests and decision-making in forestry matters are above all the responsibility of the forest owner.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, our forests are an invaluable and irreplaceable part of the heritage of humanity and of all living things.
Protecting and preserving them is essential to our survival.
We all know how important forests are to the planetary balance, to biodiversity and to economic activity, not to mention the aesthetic and environmental benefits they bring.
Europe is concerned about the future of its forests and must start by using the way it protects its woodland areas to set an example.
This applies from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia, since the problems of our forests know no frontiers.
The Forest Focus Regulation seeks to draw on the experience of two previous regulations in order to create a long-term monitoring system designed to assess the state of the European Unionâs forest ecosystem.
It also reveals lofty ambitions, aiming to embrace fields such as pollution, climate change, biodiversity, natural resources and soils.
This is all well and good, but the regulation did have two weaknesses. The first was the cut in the total funding for achieving these lofty ambitions, a cut rendered scarcely less swingeing by the compromise obtained.
The second weakness was the sacrifice of the fire prevention measures recommended for rural development programmes.
The reintroduction of the fire-fighting dimension appeases us: progress has undeniably been made.
The Commission promised that when it presented its communication on forestry strategy, as it is scheduled to do by the end of this year, it would include a proposal on plans for protection against fires.
It goes without saying that that was not enough for us.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, our particular sensitivity to the issue of fires is understandable.
The images of last summerâs towering infernos, which left a swathe of destruction in their wake, especially in Portugal, are still very vivid for us.
The memory of such flames cannot easily be snuffed from the mind, or from the landscape.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, forest fires are indeed a scourge which destroys thousands of hectares of woodland throughout the European Union every year, especially in southern countries.
As we know, not only was this year no exception to that rule, but the situation reached tragic proportions in southern countries, and especially in Portugal, where 20Â people died, 45Â 000 lost their sources of income, and it is estimated that more than 11% of woodland was consumed by the fires.
The total cost is more than EURÂ 1.3Â billion in direct damages.
This disaster provides ample proof that the European Union needs to promote measures for fighting forest fires, particularly at the level of prevention.
A large majority in the European Parliament used the resolution of 4Â SeptemberÂ 2003, on the consequences of the summer heat wave, to indicate that that was its understanding of the situation.
That resolution asked not only for more funds to bolster the Forest Focus programme, but also for the inclusion in that programme of adequate prevention measures consonant with the actions laid down in RegulationÂ NoÂ 2158/92, which expired on 31Â DecemberÂ 2002.
I would also like to remind you that not all the fire prevention measures included in that regulation are covered by the forestry-related actions laid down in the recent RegulationÂ NoÂ 1999/1257, on rural development.
I mention this because continuity is important in relation to prevention measures, which are even more urgent under the present circumstances.
The rapporteur rightly reiterates her insistence on including the prevention-related amendments tabled at first reading and then rejected by the Council.
She also asks for an increase in the amounts for financing the Forest Focus programme.
These are positive proposals which should be adopted once more by this Parliament and which I support.
Moreover, I regret the fact that the final compromise does not consider all of these measures together.
I feel that the need to preserve the heritage of our forests, combined with the high-risk situation of many woodland areas, means that the Council must accept these amendments, tabled by Parliament, on prevention and financing.
Â Â  Mr President, first I wish to congratulate Mrs Redondo on her work and efforts and on the passion with which she has supported the obvious.
No wise man would deny that the value of forests is priceless.
They have an environmental, a climatic, a health, an economic, a social, a cultural and, still more, a historic value.
So when you have something which is priceless to look after, it is unacceptable to make comprises as regards the economic dimension of what you have to look after and the measures you take.
Allow me to remind you that, 5Â 000 years ago and more, the ancient Greeks had put the care of the forests into the hands of the gods, while we compromise on what funds we shall make available â more or less â to save and look after this priceless, God-given treasure.
In all events, we must nonetheless be decisive in recording both the state of the forests and the information which is needed so that we can identify the cause of fires.
We must fight the causes at their root if we are to be able to save the forests.
We need to make an effort to increase citizens' sensitivity in the approach to and use made of forests.
We must make provision for measures which will not allow fires to break out or to spread if they do break out.
We must look after the forests and, finally, we must realise that forest fires do not obey the Schengen regulation.
They pass borders without any control and the fires themselves have no borders.
That is why there must be very close and very efficient cooperation between countries which belong to the European Union and others which do not belong and we must help each other to bring about the best possible result.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in the wake of the fires which ravaged Portugal last summer, laying waste more than 10%Â of the country, it has become increasingly obvious that the disaster could have been avoided, to a great extent, by means of effective prevention measures.
It brings to mind the old proverb, âprevention is better than cureâ.
During his visit to the regions affected by the fires, CommissionerÂ Barnier himself drew attention to this consideration.
It has become abundantly clear that we need monitoring systems, but above all that we need to guard against the causes of woodland decline.
Only by studying the causes and their effects will we be able to mount a relentless campaign to fight the fires.
The prevention measures, therefore, aim to reduce the size of the affected areas, fight the causes of fire and monitor our forests.
The European Union cannot content itself with monitoring the fires and taking action after the disaster has occurred.
What is needed is a real prevention policy.
The task, then, is not to impose unwanted measures on Portugal, but rather to devise tangible, robust courses of action that are compatible with the national forestry strategy currently being devised.
I would argue, therefore, that prevention should form an integral part of the Forest Focus programme, regardless of the regulation on rural development.
When dealing with an issue as important as forests, one of Europeâs treasures, one cannot consider skimping on a few pennies.
With a view to financing these prevention measures, therefore, I have already proposed increasing the amounts in the European Unionâs general budget, by means of the financial perspective for the period up to 2006.
No preventive measure can truly come into operation unless it is supported by adequate financial resources.
Finally, I could not end this speech without congratulating the rapporteur, MrsÂ RedondoÂ JimÃ©nez, for the sensitive manner in which she has dealt with what is a most delicate issue for Portugal.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for all their interesting and important comments.
Mr Folias, you are absolutely right that we cannot trust the gods to take responsibility for the forests.
This summer's events â with such huge forest fires in Portugal and other countries â demonstrate that.
I can, of course, see the link to climate change, where I guess the gods are crying over what we are doing to this planet and to our climate.
A second reading agreement is needed to ensure the continuity of the measures which have been carried out over a period of more than 15 years.
A loss of one year over the monitoring of forest fires and the air pollution effects on forests would of course mean an information gap which can only be filled after several years of additional efforts.
This must be avoided.
The compromise approach would give the European Commission the time to reflect â together with Member States and stakeholders â on ways in which forest fire risks might be minimised, and on the possibilities of improving prevention measures in the most appropriate way after 2006.
In this sense, I would encourage Members of the European Parliament to support the compromise proposal which aims to reach broad consensus.
I should like to thank both the rapporteur and all Members once again.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (Î5-0335/2003) by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the quality of bathing water.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the hot summer weather all over Europe saw bathing sites visited by tourists and by local people who enjoy the pleasures of bathing in clean water.
Unfortunately, there are some risks linked to bathing in natural waters.
Bathing waters may be contaminated by bacteria which originate from households, hotels or maybe office buildings.
Agriculture may also be a source of contamination and cattle and livestock can pollute rivers and lakes.
As a consequence, where they are placed at risk bathers may contract gastro-enteritis, ear or eye infections, or even more serious illnesses.
To reduce the risks related to bathing, a bathing water directive was introduced in 1976.
This directive has performed particularly well, and nowadays almost 95% of Europe's bathing waters conform to the quality standards it laid down, as opposed to only 60% ten years ago.
Still, we have to look to the future.
The current bathing water directive is based on health and hygiene standards from the 1960s and these have since evolved.
Social standards have also changed and these days public information and involvement have become cornerstones of good governance.
The legislative-style approach at the heart of the 1976 directive is outdated, since it is based only on monitoring and on measuring, not on the proactive and sound management of bathing waters.
These are just a few of the reasons why the Commission organised the long and thorough public and stakeholder consultation and came up with a new proposal for a bathing water directive which seeks a common and comparable level of protection for all EU waters and all bathers, whether in major tourist resorts or in traditional local bathing sites.
This new proposal supports the concept of beach management and public information and participation, but most of all it stands for stricter health standards, thanks to which our children will be able to bathe in safer waters, reducing risks of illness linked to bathing.
Â Â  . Mr President, as the Commissioner rightly stated, the current bathing water directive, dating back to 1976, is out of date.
It is an inflexible directive based on obsolete data.
However, we have to admit that this old directive is popular among Europeans, and indeed, the Commissioner was right to point out that it has been successful.
It is clearly thanks to this old directive that much of the bathing water that was polluted not so long ago is now much cleaner.
The proposal for revision, submitted by the Commission, is more flexible; it takes the inflexibility out of the existing directive and is, as such, an improvement.
Of the nineteen parameters that were required for measurement in the old directive, only two remain, which is actually adequate to achieve the result that is required.
Since 1976, which is before the European Parliament was directly elected for the first time, our thinking about the environment, but also about issues such as subsidiarity, has, of course, fundamentally changed.
We should, therefore, question whether the Union should, in fact, decide about what the quality of bathing water should be, whether Europe is better equipped than the Member States to do this, and whether there is a cross-border effect.
During the initial discussion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I called these aspects into question and I have to say that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy answered 'yes' to all of those questions and affirmed that it is necessary to uphold such a directive and to improve it.
My own group does not agree with this and has therefore tabled an amendment.
In any case, this forces us to revisit this question of subsidiarity.
Moreover, the committee itself was also somewhat confused.
After all, in the directive, reference is made to the interests of tourism, but this also touches upon an internal market directive, while surely, as everyone knows, we are dealing here with a directive that should actually protect public health.
However, the legal basis of the directive is the environment.
In short, there is confusion all round.
In actual fact, I am wondering whether it is not simply the case that we are keeping this directive, not because of a need, but simply because it is there.
The provision of information is crucial.
There is no doubt in my mind too that here lies an essential European task, namely consumer protection and information which should be more easily accessible to bathers and users of bathing water.
This can be done via the Internet, but I myself do not always have my laptop on the beach, so alternatives will need to be sought to make it obvious to bathers whether the water is clean or not.
In this context, the system of smileys, for example, proposed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, strikes me as excellent.
It should be up-to-date information, that is, not last year's information, but current, weekly information, because this would actually be of some use to bathers.
This information must be universally accessible.
We could copy the example of the blue flag.
Although this is not an EU initiative, it is nonetheless a well-known, popular and effective system.
The drawback of the blue flag is that it is only introduced upon application and as such, cannot be found in bathing sites that have made the conscious decision not to apply for it.
In addition, blue flags cost money.
The question is whether the quality of bathing water will improve purely on the basis of this improved information.
Take the blue flag as an example, and see how it upsets bathing sites when they lose their blue flag.
Would this not have a better effect than tightening the standards all the time?
The proposed higher standards are, in my view, rather open to question anyway.
Both the EU's own scientific committee and the World Health Organisation take the view that it is, in fact, impossible to establish scientific standards at international level, given the huge national differences.
As a result, the higher standards are somewhat questionable.
Above all, I feel sorry for those governments who say that they are in favour of higher standards as long as they do not need to adhere to them.
I understand that this is also an argument that is heard in different quarters in the Council.
I think this is wrong.
If they say that they want stricter standards, fine.
But they should, of course, adhere to them too.
Those stricter standards mean that, for example, in the United Kingdom, or in my own country, the Netherlands, 30% of the bathing water that is still considered good would then become 'bad'.
What will the Commission do then?
Will we be inundated with infringement proceedings?
Will we be closing beaches?
Are we not more likely to run the risk that such beaches will simply no longer be designated as bathing water, while people continue to swim in it?
The public health effect is therefore not achieved by prescribing higher standards.
As far as this is concerned, we would have also preferred a cost-benefit analysis by the Commission.
Where, for example, are all those sick tourists now on which these higher standards are based?
According to scientists, these sick tourists should be around, but we have not seen any of them, not even a glimpse.
The question is whether we have found a solution to a problem or whether we have created a problem for a solution that was there all along.
It remains, of course, to be seen whether the new Member States can meet these old standards, never mind the new ones.
Finally, I should like to say that I am pleased with the compromise tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
It leads to better information to bathers and to other recreational users, better bathing water quality and also to deregulation and simpler legislation.
Together with the improvements introduced by the Commission, I think that, on balance, we will arrive at improved legislation after all, on the understanding, of course, that Europe should legislate in this area.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, bathing water is making waves.
Every year, at the onset of summer, the Commission draws up, on the basis of the 1976 directive, the survey of bathing waters.
Not only does the European public take note of this information, but over two million visits are also made to the relevant websites.
It is an established fact that bathing waters have become substantially cleaner right across Europe.
In 2002, despite positively diluvian rainfall and flooding, as much as 98.5% of Europeâs coastal waters complied with the directiveâs specifications.
There are several reasons why it makes sense to revise the directive after over a quarter of a century.
Scientific and technical knowledge have expanded at breakneck speed, any revision is to draw on the experience of up to twenty-six years of applying the directive in practice â dependent on the length of time the country has been a Member State of the European Union, the water framework directive is to be harmonised with the bathing water directive, protection of the health of bathers is to be further improved, and, last of all, the simplification of the existing laws is worth striving towards.

My group shares the Commissionâs intention to improve the quality of bathing water.
Bathing should be promoted as a sensible leisure activity, as should the use of bathing waters for tourism in all our Member States.
It is evident from what is now many years of experience that the greatest dangers to human health when bathing are presented by faecal matter finding its way into bathing waters as a result of inadequate treatment of waste water or from stock rearing.
The new rules are intended to reduce from 19 to 2 the number of parameters to be measured and to treat intestinal enterococci and as leading indicators; these two standards are to be made substantially more rigorous, but, by way of contrast, chemical parameters are disregarded and are no longer to be measured, as they are governed by other directives.
Samples are to be taken less frequently if a constantly high level of water quality is found over a period of three years.
The quality of bathing water is to be ascertained on the basis of changes over the past three years and no longer on the basis of one single year, so one-off eventualities â such as poor weather conditions â will be less markedly apparent.
These factors would also reduce the costs involved in implementing the directive in the Member States.
Our group also sees it as important that the provision of information on water quality should be improved, and that it should be more extensively disseminated via the media and the Internet.
With that in mind, we endorse the Commissionâs objective and also the amendments tabled to that end.
Our amendments, however, are intended to bring about objectivity and simplicity and, above all, to avoid further increases in costs; hence, we do not want leisure activities to be included, and the management policies required strike us as every bit as over-the-top as the newly-introduced bathing water profiles These measures will help make matters simpler in so far as they dovetail with the water framework directive; otherwise, our group takes the view that the principle of subsidiarity requires that local and regional circumstances be taken into account and dealt with in a flexible way.
Some of the Commissionâs proposals already run counter to these considerations, but a number of amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy even more so, and so we want to vote against these items.
I see it as important that all the Member States have gathered a great deal of experience, and I take the view that we should stop trying to reinvent the wheel.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all, I should like to say thank you to MrÂ Maaten for his constructive cooperation on this matter.
I should also like to say thank you to the Commission, which I think has come up with a very balanced proposal for the new bathing water directive which takes account of developments over the last 26 years.
I think it is right to limit the number of parameters, and I also think that the correct limit values for bacteria content have been found.
I also think that we in the committee have adopted some improvements, and I should like to draw attention to a few of these.
We have secured a sound context in the shape of the water framework directive and, above all, we have ensured that there is reliable, comprehensible information for people, including bathers, about the quality of bathing water without our rushing into having enormous flag displays on our beaches.
I also think it is right also to include other leisure activities, such as windsurfing, in the directive.
A lot has happened in the 26 years since the first bathing water directive was drafted.
I think that the new directive has been designed in such a way, and with such a code of practice, as to enable the individual Member States reasonably to administer it.
The last thing I want to emphasise is that a majority of us in the committee reached the view that the bathing beaches or bathing waters concerned must be those that attract large numbers of bathers so that, in this case too, we support the Commissionâs definition of what kind of bathing waters we are talking about.
I think that this rule too is one that the national authorities will be able reasonably to administer.
I should like to warn against two of the amendments tabled.
The first is Amendment No 19 on transitory contamination.
It is a proposal whereby the authorities would now be able to disregard water samples, even if they revealed contamination and health hazards, if the same authorities simply choose to characterise the contamination as transitory.
The arrangement would mean that bathers would be in danger of being told that the bathing water in question was of good or excellent quality, even if the water were in reality contaminated.
This would be an impairment of the directive, and I hope the proposal is not adopted.
I understand that transitory contamination is partly a Scottish problem, and I think that, if there are problems on some Scottish beaches, these should be solved in Scotland, rather than have the reduction in bathing water quality extended to the whole of Europe.
The second proposal to which I wish to draw attention is Amendment No 76 concerning the definition of bathing water.
It is a definition that would lead to the authorities having to go out on a daily basis to count the number of bathers on the beaches.
There would have to be more than 100 bathers a day for at least 20 days a year.
I think this amendment should be rejected for a number of reasons.
First of all, it would involve giving unduly detailed direction to the Member States in a way that would be entirely contrary to the principle of subsidiarity.
Secondly, it would, in my view, be practically impossible to administer.
Who on earth would count the bathers every day out on the beaches of Europe.
I would say that, if this proposal is adopted, we shall simply be a laughing stock throughout Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, the quality of bathing water has improved.
The water is better and cleaner in the Netherlands and in the rest of Europe.
A new bathing water directive is now before us with less red tape, with only two parameters left, but with stricter standards, which is to be welcomed.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has struck sensible compromises.
Mr Maaten, the rapporteur, wanted, and still wants, to abolish this directive.
Fortunately, the Liberals are on their own with this view.
Europe is more than a market and currency.
The Netherlands will need to make an effort to comply with both the old and the new directive, and take action instead of moaning.
Thanks to the warmer climate, people will swim more frequently and other types of water recreation will also be introduced.
The amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are good, except for Amendment No 19.
For the sake of a few hundred Scottish sheep, there is a huge loophole in legislation.
Intensive farming in the Netherlands also suffers from the spread of disease during heavy rainfall.
In the Netherlands, the cows became ill and measures were taken.
This should be our response, and not an enormous loophole in what, let me add, is also sound legislation.
Â Â  Mr President, this is an appropriate time to discuss the Commission proposal.
The old directive took account of pollution levels that, fortunately, no longer exist.
Ninety to ninety-five per cent of bathing water complies with the standards.
It is time we moved the bar up a few notches and looked for new challenges.
Accordingly, I support the tightening of the standards and do not back the rapporteur's proposal to weaken them.
After all, even with these new standards in place, 1 in 20 bathers fall ill, so the standards are certainly not too high.
The Commission proposal also contains less successful features, one of which is the definition of 'bathing water'.
Water becomes bathing water when a large number of bathers are in it.
It is not clear what constitutes a large number.
The Spanish costas are peopled by tens of thousands of bathers, the Finnish lakes by a few individuals.
Yet, both must fall within the scope of the definition.
The Commissioner could perhaps explain how this should be done in practice.
Attention still needs to be given to how the public are to be provided with information.
The Commission's website is, in itself, a good initiative, but who takes their computers with them to the beach?
This is why the placing of signs with information at the relevant locations â although labour-intensive in terms of maintenance â is the best solution, because it will reach the highest number of bathers.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on the conclusion in his explanatory statement.
He states, namely, that proactive water policy has a positive impact on the well-being of recreational water users, and I could not agree with him more.
He also ties this in with a better provision of information for the recreational water users.
I think that the directive should definitely be revised in this area.
Casting my mind back, however, I notice that we still have problems with the old bathing water directive.
I still remember the nightly debates in the Dutch Lower Chamber, when we discussed the introduction of the then directive.
It has to be said that, at present, infringement proceedings are still pending against the Netherlands by the European Commission, because the quality of our inland bathing waters is not up to standard.
There are also major discrepancies in Europe.
In the Netherlands, there are 557 designated inland bathing waters, in Great Britain only eleven; there are nine in Ireland and four in Greece.
Stricter quality is now being enforced â I have nothing against stricter quality â and Parliament would like to extend the directive's scope to include all forms of recreation.
However, if we want to protect all recreational water users who ingest water at European level, then I think we are going one step too far, even if I would want to give these tourists, these recreational water users, these bathers nothing but the best quality.
With these higher standards, I think that many of our bathing waters will no longer receive the 'bathing water' label, at any rate not in the Netherlands.
I think, then, that we should all take another good look at the amendments and ask ourselves how much we would exactly stand to gain from them.
Things have to improve, we need better information and more streamlined legislation, but I think that the introduction of higher standards at this moment in time, given the proceedings that are still pending, is taking matters too far.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Commissionâs proposal for a directive concerning the quality of bathing water will be an improvement on the current situation, as has been said here, but there are still problems attached to it.
The question remains as to how we take account of the fact that bathing waters and bathing facilities vary from one European region to another.
In the Commission proposal a bathing site falls within the scope of this directive when a large number of people go there.
It has already been said here that it is quite difficult to say what a large number actually means: a large number where there are a lot of people, or a large number where, for example, there are 20 kilometres of beach per inhabitant and public right of access?
How, moreover, do we define a bathing site and ensure that attending to measurements and water quality does not become too bureaucratic?
My friend, Torben Lund, here thought it absurd to have a proposal that defines a bathing site according to how many bathers go there, and according to which the authorities must define it as a bathing site.
In my view, it is just as absurd for the Commission to take Finland to court because measurements have not been carried out there with respect to some beach that everybody knows to be clean, and where the quality of the water is even known to be excellent, just because the definition of a bathing site has these problems associated with it.
I hope that this kind of flexibility is brought to the directive in the proper way, but at the same time I hope that these issues of public health with regard to the citizens of Europe are also taken proper account of in this directive.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, what constitutes good quality bathing water, and who should decide?
These are the kinds of questions that arise from the Maaten report on the proposal for a directive concerning the quality of bathing water.
Bearing in mind that neither public health nor tourism are Community competences, but remain the competence of the Member States, does Europe have to legislate on this matter and on what basis?
In my opinion, the only argument in favour is that the public is better informed.
But why make the microbiological thresholds more stringent while not providing for any threshold for chemical quality?
It is also important to underline the difficulty of compiling an inventory of all sources of pollution, particularly in estuaries, which are located at the outlets of very large catchment areas drained by rivers.
Why extend the directive to water sports and other recreational activities?
Is the intention, in the long term, to ban surfing, windsurfing, kayaking and rowing because the water is deemed to be unsuitable for bathing?
These activities are often enjoyed in places other than in bathing water and sometimes out of season.
Why centralise the data on the Commission site, which seems to be costly and of limited benefit?
Who takes their computer with them on holiday to find out whether they can bathe within microbiological safety limits?
Local radio and the traditional display signs, which are easy to update, are, in my view, quite sufficient to inform the general public.
Finally, the proposal to define a beach as a place usually visited by more than 100 bathers for at least 20 days during the bathing season is bordering on the ridiculous.
Who is going to be counting?
As usual, of course, no one is mentioning the cost of the measures or the substantial economic impact that a ban on bathing would have.
It is not up to the directive to set out the cases in which bathing will be prohibited, as this decision should be the exclusive competence of the Member States.
Even if it does make waves, we should respect subsidiarity, all the more so when the WHO has just published a practical guide to bathing water which could serve as a reference for the Member States.
That is why we will be supporting the proposal to reject the directive.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur on the work that has been done on this sensible and welcome proposal.
We should bear in mind that it is a bathing waters directive, not a recreation directive, so we should not venture into the deeper waters of boating and deep sea diving: we should instead restore it to what it started off as â a bathing water directive.
It is also right that we look at seasonal bathing and do not try to cover the whole year.
We should look at places where bathing actually takes place and where that is so designated by a Member State.
It is sensible to simplify the two key tests relating to public health â on gastro-enteritis and e-coli.
It is important too that there be flexibility where temporary and atypical pollution takes place.
That is an improvement that has come from the committee.
We should also be careful to give proper attention to the cost/benefit analysis because some quite large sums of money are involved â the cost to my country would be EUR 8.8 billion, albeit over 25 years.
We should bear in mind that public information is important if we are going to have public confidence, and the blue flag has gained that confidence: we should be careful not to damage it.
I am pleased we have not gone for the multicoloured flags.
I gather that we are now going to consult on smiling faces: if we end up with the happy, smiling face of Mrs WÃ€llstrom looking down on Brighton beach, I am sure that will be a boon to mankind, but it must stand alongside the blue flag.
Lastly, the question of radioactivity is perhaps not one for this measure, as one of the amendments suggests.
There are, after all, rocks with natural radioactivity close to beaches and we do not want everyone to have to go swimming with a Geiger counter in their swimming trunks, or indeed swimming trunks that turn black if they meet any radioactivity!
Â Â  I would like to concentrate on an important amendment which has been mentioned in this debate, namely Amendment No 19 on the conformity and control of transitory contamination.
It is critical for me as a Scottish representative in the House.
In south-west Scotland, the Irvine and Aire river valleys are particularly susceptible during times of heavy rainfall â in flash floods during the summer months, for example â to failing to meet the micro-biological standards for good quality during those few, rare days.
This does not mean that beaches in Britain are hotbeds of pollution.
It means we need flexibility in measuring and sampling to deal with these natural occurrences.
Amendment No 19 introduces a two-part system of management action.
Its purpose is to bring the Commission's proposal into line with the approach adopted in World Health Organisation guidelines for recreational use.
The guidelines acknowledge that the tighter standards proposed by the WHO would be breached under some circumstances, i.e. heavy rainfall, and include an allowance to discount samples during these periods, provided that management measures are in place to protect bathers.
The amendment encourages authorities to take preventive action where possible to protect bathers from exposure to pollution.
The Council of European Municipalities and Regions has also backed Amendment No 19, and local government wants to see bathing water quality improve by introducing more flexibility into bathing water rules.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Commissionâs proposal contains some good features in the form of more stringent requirements concerning bacteria content, with a maximum of 500 Escherichia coli per 100 ml and 200 intestinal enterococci per 100 ml.
The sampling frequency recommended by the Commission is not, however, sufficient and undercuts the current arrangements in Denmark.
The bathing season is set at three months in Denmark.
The Commissionâs proposal would mean the number of samples we take each season falling from ten to two.
In the quest for clean bathing water, it would clearly entail a reduction in safety.
It is, however, with pleasure that I am able to observe that quite a few of the amendments tabled by the liberal rapporteur, Mr Maaten, disappeared in the course of discussion by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mr Maatenâs jolly proposal concerning definitions of bathers and bathing water and a colourful range of star-spangled flags on the beach has fortunately disappeared.
It saves Parliament from becoming still more of a laughing stock in the eyes of the public.
The rapporteurâs report gave rise to 124 supplementary amendments by fellow MEPs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but the many amendments to Mr Maatenâs proposal also show how a political group can waste a huge amount of MEPsâ time.
