I hope that we will still be very much alert and that we will be able to remember what was said here today.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, solidarity with the victims of the atrocious attacks is the first emotion we expressed - and rightly so.
But I welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission set to work at full tilt to formulate proposals.
We now have globalisation of terrorism.
Everyone is vulnerable.
But we can also turn our vulnerable world into a safer world.
That is the challenge.
However, it requires multilateral cooperation in a global fight against terrorism.
This is the positive element that I am trying to glean from the fact that Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has been invoked: that it is seen as a sign of solidarity.
I am not in favour of a blank cheque for any old military action which would claim more innocent victims and would create resentment and frustrations. I would rather see an invitation to enter into consultation and dialogue across the oceans, even though there is the risk of it not being seen in that light.
We should be aware that our people are anxious, that many people fear that we will simply be dragged along by a war machine.
We should realise that we must explain what our intentions are.
We must make this vulnerable world safer by providing political solutions to endless conflicts such as that in the Middle East.
We must bring hope to large parts of the world that have to live in despair.
Without a fair world order, stability and peace remain a distant dream, and there will always be a breeding ground for terrorism.
We are delighted with the unanimous will that has been expressed over the past couple of days and that has been echoed by the Council and the Commission on this platform.
We now look forward to action, rather than words, for as regards providing Europe with the resources to achieve these goals, some of our Member States have in the past persisted in throwing up barriers.
How long have we been waiting for the cooperation necessary to turn Europol into an effective instrument? This was called for back at Amsterdam.
According to Mr Vitorino, the extradition of terrorists is the cornerstone of the fight against terrorism.
But it remains to be seen whether we can all agree.
The President-in-Office of the Council listed various instruments for the prevention of terrorism, but will we ever succeed in monitoring the flow of capital which feeds terrorism worldwide?
Will we ever want to, and be able to, exercise effective control over the arms trade?
Or will the economic arguments prevail tomorrow once more over the arguments for security and prevention of terrorism?
For terrorism exists, fanaticism exists, injustice exists.
There are many weapons which terrorists have not yet used but which are at their disposal thanks to our technological society.
Mr President, there is no cause, not even a just cause, which can justify the killing of innocent civilians.
Terror does not pave the way for justice: it is the shortest road to hell.
We condemn and deplore this appalling crime; we utterly condemn those who planned and perpetrated it.
Our empathy with the suffering victims, with the pain of their families and the pain of the entire American people at difficult times such as this is no less than the expression of our total commitment to preserving the unique nature of the human race.
These are not my words but some of the things Palestinian intellectuals, politicians and ministers such as Mr Yaser Abed Rabbo, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi and Mr Mahmoud Darwish have said.
They are powerful statements, and they give us hope for they come from people who live and suffer under the Israeli military occupation.
At times like these, we must all - people, States and institutions - act with the utmost responsibility and determination to remove terrorism from the face of the earth and put a stop to the globalisation of poverty, injustice and war for ever.
'Words must replace arms' as Mr Solana said.
Therefore, no words must be allowed to provoke hatred or promote the 'dead or alive' cowboy culture: as the women against war say, between killing and death there lies a third way, which is life.
No one must be exempt from training in love of peace and respect for the law, especially Heads of State.
Today, a glimmer of hope for the future has come from Palestine and Israel with the announcement of a truce. It is a faint chance, I know, but it is vital that we do not let it go.
The European Union has contributed to the possibility of dialogue being resumed.
The Union' s political role must grow and, if and as this role grows, the Union must uphold the law with increasing determination.
Just as we told Mr Arafat that he must be resolute in controlling terrorism, so we must make it quite clear to Mr Sharon that he cannot continue to get away with seizing Palestinian land, building settlements, killing and besieging Palestinians in villages or, as he did yesterday morning, destroying the Gaza port which is still under construction and funded by the countries of the European Union.
We must take tangible action, reassuring the Palestinians that they will have a safe State to live in and assuring Israel that nobody is questioning its existence, that it is its colonialist settlement policy, not its existence, which is in question.
Yesterday, in the Lebanon, I and an Italian delegation met President Lahoud.
He stated quite clearly that he rejected terrorism, but he stressed emphatically that resolution of the Palestinian issue and development of political and economic cooperation with Europe and the Arab world are essential.
We must believe in our own ability to bring peace and respect for the law.
Madam President, in the fight against terrorism, everyone has to understand that there have to be rules in a democracy and that those who violate laws and destroy freedom and security have to be punished.
In April, Commander Massoud came to the European Parliament seeking support for his opposition to the fundamentalist Taliban regime.
We welcomed him as a friend, just as we empathised with the victims of the fundamentalist regime in Algeria and the other countries where citizens, politicians and journalists have been massacred, even including Spain.
Now, Commander Massoud is dead, killed by a suicide terrorist attack just a few hours before other terrorists caused the absurd, appalling, atrocious carnage in the United States.
Clearly, terrorists and fundamentalists had planned a precise sequence of events, the first step being the elimination of the most powerful opponent to the Taliban regime.
If we genuinely want to combat and eradicate terrorism and its bases, its economic power and its message of hatred of democracy and freedom, we must give our full support to the Northern Alliance now: what we denied Commander Massoud when he was alive we owe to him now he is dead. We owe it to the men and women who are fighting for freedom.
We owe it to all those who are combating terrorism and fundamentalism in the world.
We also call upon the European Union to think again about whether it needs to establish effective border controls, even suspending Schengen temporarily, and, in any case, as President Pasqua has already said, to stop giving aid to those countries which harbour, fund and protect terrorist and criminal organisations.
We call for regulation of the use of the Internet, for rules to be established at last, for, as we know, the lack of rules governing the use of the Internet make it easy for terrorism to gain support and operate at international level.
We call for the headquarters of those organisations which claim to be fighting religious wars, advocate violence and tolerate their members perpetrating terrorism to be closed.
Lastly, Mr President, we call upon the European Union to have the courage to hold a Euro-Mediterranean Conference to discuss our commitment to peace, where we can work together and defeat those continuing to sow hatred and violence.
Mr President, I too feel that our response to large-scale attacks must not take the form of a crusade against Islam, but certain things need to be said.
I would point out, in any case, that one of the organisations with which Osama bin Laden is linked is called the 'International Front for Fighting Jews and Crusades' .
I would also point out that part of the influx of billions of dollars of funding dispensed every year to Muslim charities and aid organisations is ultimately used to finance fundamentalist terrorism.
In addition to this, the profits from banks, Islamic businesses and financial institutions, located in tax havens, which are now, at last, regulated and identified on the international market as well, help to support the international Jihad terrorist force.
Here in Europe, there are Islamic centres and mosques which have been providing hospitality, screens and even false passports for fundamentalists connected to terrorist groups for years and continue to do so today. There is documented evidence of this.
Such complicity is a fact and I certainly do not think we can take a few general statements disassociating their authors from Osamar bin Laden as evidence of the conversion to peace and respect for human rights of these wings of the international Jihad force present in Europe.
I support Mrs Garaud' s call to realism this morning at the Conference of Presidents, when she called for a responsible international policy ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, according to a Chinese proverb, when a wise man points at the moon, the fool looks at his finger.
The European Union would be well advised to give some thought as to the meaning of this proverb because it is very difficult to actually see the relation between today' s debate and the unprecedented attacks on the United States, which took place on 11 September 2001.
Was the United States saved because of its police force or federal intelligence system?
It has one, of course.
The United States is the most powerful country in the world and this patently did not enable it to predict or prevent the events of Tuesday 11 September and we really cannot see what Europol can do in this matter, other than to strengthen the European Union, which once again is undoubtedly showing that its sole concern is its own power, that it has absolutely no interest whatsoever in the root causes of the problems and that it is only concerned by its return to a position of power.
If we - who claim to represent all the people of Europe - had to consider one subject, then it should be our failure to take responsibility and that we are responsible for leaving the United States alone to face the rest of the entire world, when our nations have over 1 000 years of diplomatic, historic and military experience...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, first of all I would like to emphasise the deep sympathy we feel for the victims of last week's attack.
Right now, before any military action takes place, we are already witnessing a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting many thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan.
The United States has announced that it will lift restrictions on intelligence agencies and give them a free hand to recruit criminals.
I quote Vice President Cheney: "To be able to penetrate these terrorist organisations, you need to have on the payroll some very unsavoury characters."
When President Bush declared war - and in fact this is a case of the rich versus the poor, which is the underlying struggle here - he said the war must be won with the tools of action.
The tools used should be the tools of justice, that is, not by suspending the rule of law or suppressing liberties, but on the contrary, by maintaining them.
Mr President, Madam Minister, Commissioner Vitorino, honourable Members of this House, if we fight the wrong war, we will lose.
Mr President, we will never forget the attacks against the United States, which we utterly condemn.
We share the grief of the civilian victims and their families and we share the values of our great ally - democracy and individual freedom.
Terrorism creates a state of mind.
It provokes outrage and reaction, so we must be united, we must be determined and we must be vigilant.
However, in addition to our united political reaction, we must adjust the European Union's diplomatic standpoint.
In the context of the current budget process, we must reassess the EU's vast aid programme, in particular, if states were involved in that terrorism in any way.
The EU is perceived as pro-Arab.
I regret this.
We should be pro-democracy.
War has been declared and we should unequivocally stand by our American allies.
My party and group are committed to giving our full support, in particular to the British Government, its partners in the European Union and to our NATO allies.
The scale and nature of the outrage we witnessed in the United States last week gives us a warning of what else the new millennium might bring, so we must look pragmatically at what we need to do together.
We should learn from each other as much as possible about how to deal with the security of our people and how best to reduce the tensions which lead to political violence and terrorism.
As far as possible, our electors should be allowed to get on with their lives, but we as politicians cannot rest while terrorism lives.
Mr President, I was in Washington last week leading the European Parliament delegation responsible for our relations with the United States Congress and we started our pre-Commission briefing at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, 11 September 2001, just after the first plane had hit one of the towers and just before the second.
Needless to say, our briefing did not go on for very long and we, like so many in the United States, were soon sitting in front of television sets, shocked and silent.
That was the mood in America in Tuesday.
By Wednesday, people were angry and frightened, understandably, and so were we.
Later there was much more thoughtfulness and a more considered response.
The many messages from the European Union, and indeed from the European Parliament, plus the many personal messages of support and solidarity, were very much appreciated.
We were able to fulfil part of our delegation duties, we met members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the Congress and had some very useful, although very sad discussions with them.
The question they put to us was: How will Europe help us?
Will Europe support us?
That was really most difficult.
It would have been premature and inappropriate for a partial delegation to respond.
Of course, we did not know how we should respond.
I made a statement to Congress on behalf of the delegation which was lodged in the Congressional Records and I hope with your permission it can be lodged in our own Parliament records as well.
This statement stressed, apart, of course, from the natural sympathy that we wanted to express, that this had to be tackled by the United States of America and the European Union and many other countries in partnership.
It is becoming ever clearer that the response must be measured and proportionate, and the consequences for all must be anticipated and planned.
There is a clear need for major diplomatic and political initiatives to maintain cooperation with those countries nearest to any possible targets or military action and those at most risk from the consequences.
We may be facing terrible times ahead but it is essential that we have the courage as well as the compassion to consider carefully the alternatives.
I would like to express my thanks to the many here, including the President, who expressed their concerns for our safety and well-being and particularly to my fellow MEPs, including Mr Belder, Mrs Peijs, my two vice-chairman, the other MEPs, the Parliament staff, Council and Commission staff interpreters and particularly the Commission staff in Washington.
They were endlessly kind in what was a most difficult week.
Mr President, the attacks in America remind me most of the attack on the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo in June 1914, when a terrorist, who appeared from nowhere, struck at the heart of the Habsburg Empire, a superpower deemed invincible.
That fatal incident elicited an overreaction, which led to the First World War.
It is of the utmost importance to combat international terrorism.
It is equally important for this to be done collectively, forcefully and - I emphasise - with well-considered restraint.
The European Union itself must also set to work. Commissioner, thank you, you are not the problem, neither is this Parliament.
I would address my former colleague, the Minister of the Belgian Presidency. Tampere was two years ago.
I would urge the Belgian Presidency to abolish the right of veto in the Third Pillar. If not, we will remain bogged down and unable to tackle terrorism effectively.
Mr President, I was part of the delegation which visited Washington last week.
I saw the dismay, horror and despair caused by the attack, and I shared and felt this sorrow and despair.
I still feel strongly for the families of those still missing.
After listening to the debate here, I have put away the script for the speech I had prepared.
Instead, I would like to talk about something which has come to me while I have been listening to this discussion.
I am deeply concerned both about what has happened and about the reaction caused by the events in the US and in Europe.
I am convinced that, at the same time as we ourselves feel the horror of this event, there are millions upon millions of people out there in the world who have actually rejoiced in this act of terrorism.
I believe that many poor people in Asia, Africa and other parts of the world have rejoiced.
We have read about young people in Palestine celebrating this act of violence.
I do not believe they were alone in this, but that there are millions and millions of people out there in the world who have reacted in this way.
This fills me with incredible horror and fear, as it means that we are facing a world in which there are millions of potential terrorists and perpetrators of similar outrages.
We must begin to ask ourselves whether we are now witnessing a sort of social warfare.
Does this bear any relation to colonial uprisings?
From my childhood, I remember the Mau Mau uprising, which was described as a terrorist insurrection.
We all remember the Vietnam War, for example.
Is it a social war which, in one way or another, lies behind recent events or which is being declared through them?
In that case, ideas about mass bombings in the Middle East or about preposterous police checks on a huge scale are meaningless.
Our only chance, in that case, is a huge policy of transformation and redistribution, a policy which removes the desperation and despair in the world which feed and create terrorism.
Otherwise, we shall never be safe, despite carpet-bombing and despite all the security services in the world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the United States of America and the free world have been taken by surprise by the absolutely barbaric wave of attacks that has destroyed the lives of thousands of men, women and children from more than 60 countries, murdered in appalling circumstances of horror and brutality.
Once again, therefore, our first words must be, like those of so many other speakers, words of solidarity and condolence, and we must turn our thoughts to all these lives cut short and to the suffering of their families.
Such attacks completely exceed all the bounds of the imaginable and confirm the fears that the fanaticism of terrorist groups will neither give way nor weaken in the face of any considerations of compassion, which makes us fear for the worst for the future if not enough is done to combat or eradicate such fanaticism.
The last thing we want to see is a new rift between East and West.
We can quite easily distinguish those who freely and peacefully practice the Islamic faith from those who, quite intolerably, take a medieval concept of holy war as the inspiration for attacking citizens, communities and states across the world who simply wish to live in peace.
We must, therefore, respond vigorously to those who are responsible for these appalling acts, which are genuine acts of war against the free world; not only to those who were directly involved in carrying out the acts but also to those who have given shelter to, protected, funded or encouraged these people.
In this context, the European Union has enormous responsibilities as a community that acts as a trustee of the universal values of life, freedom, peace and security.
Apart from stimulating relationships of trust, cooperation and cultural dialogue with all Islamic communities and citizens that share these universal values, in an attempt to involve them in an active commitment against terrorism and the threat that this represents, the European Union and its Member States must establish, between themselves and internationally, new and more effective forms of cooperation in the field of gathering and processing information by police forces, in harmonising judicial and legal systems and finally, in the field of common security and defence, which will help to guard against and allow the harsh punishment of anyone who encourages this new form of world threat or their agents.
We wish to express our expectation and, I would say, our hope, that today' s debate and the conclusions of next Friday' s European Council will be a decisive step forwards in the long and difficult fight against international terrorism. This is a fight that we must see, now and for as long as the threat lasts, as our utmost priority for European, Atlantic and world-wide security.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to a great many sound proposals and seen that there is some convergence too.
However, I have to say that, as long as the European banks accept terrorists' deposits and increase their capital, we are not combating terrorism; as long as arms are sold to different countries (according to geopolitical interests) which accept the role of the askaris of one or other power in turn, we are not combating terrorism.
Madam President, I believe that, for as long as we talk about 'war' on a daily basis, peace will not be possible.
The whole world is afraid because of the vehement statements - and I understand the emotions and the political situation - of the American President, whose reasons of State we acknowledge and for whom we express all our support and sympathy.
However, we hope that the word 'war' will be targeted against very specific fringe members of the Arab world, for the Arab world as a whole does not deserve to be treated as criminal because of the criminal actions of a tiny, criminal minority of delinquents who are stateless because of their own intentional, senseless, barbaric lunacy.
Mr President, on behalf of my party, may I offer my deepest condolences to the people of the United States.
With our very special relationship and with hundreds of British still missing, we too share their desperate feeling of loss.
My first observation must be to my own Prime Minister, who of course was instrumental in the release of over 400 convicted terrorists.
We must fight terrorism in all its forms and we must say 'No' to any more appeasement.
I would also like to urge the Council and Commission not to use this opportunity to further the project of European integration.
The peoples of Europe will not forgive politicians putting their self-interest above the security of the people.
However dark and uncertain the future may be, we must stand firm behind the USA as that noble country did for us in our darkest hour.
Our commitment to the defeat of terrorism must be no less than theirs.
Mr President, this terrorist attack in the USA affects us all, unfortunately, and not only because there are probably hundreds of Europeans among its victims.
Thirty Austrians alone are missing to date.
Europeans should be seen unreservedly offering solidarity and cooperation in response to this terrorist attack, and the European partners should refrain from imposing conditions.
The EU Member States, Spain and France, have, without doubt, set a standard here, both sending politicians to the USA at a very early stage.
I wish to appeal to the Austrian political parties to lay their so-called neutrality completely aside, as there can be no neutrality between terrorists and innocent victims.
Just as important, in this international joint endeavour, as the working relationship of the democratic countries with each other will be their cooperation with moderate Arab States and with those with Moslem majority populations.
The most important foundation for a successful counterstrike this time will be effective international solidarity.
And as for those who offer us their pacifist fantasies and words of wisdom about military restraint, I should like to invite them to New York, so they can visit the school my children go to and talk to the children who have lost their fathers or mothers or, indeed, both parents in this attack.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, solidarity in speech must now give way to solidarity in action.
In Germany, the Christian Democratic parties - the CDU and CSU - feel, in any case, that we have obligations towards the Americans in our joint resistance to terrorism, too.
American action was decisive in the reconstruction of our country and the recovery of our unity.
So we must share with them the burden of combating terrorism.
Mr Vitorino's proposals are a first step on this road, and the right one.
They are not, however, short-term measures.
They will become effective in 2002 at the earliest.
Right and proper as they are, we can and must do more.
We can, for example, make Europol better equipped than it is at present.
Europol urgently needs an agreement with the USA, within the framework of laws currently in force, on the exchange of data in the fight against terrorism.
Such arrangements have previously foundered on our making our data protection provisions into the measure of all things.
Our protection of data has therefore been of more use to the terrorists than it has to their victims.
We must make it possible for Europol to become immediately operational.
We must at once put in place whatever joint action teams are available.
Wherever terrorists are being investigated, Europol must be on the spot and promoting the immediate exchange of data between the investigators and those working in Europol headquarters.
These opportunities already exist, and we must seize them.
It can be done within the framework of the laws in force and does not require us to wait for the incorporation of directives into national law.
Mr President, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no excuse for any terrorist act.
Terrorism is, above all, contempt for life, contempt for the life of innocent citizens, sometimes even contempt for one' s own life.
If all citizens have a duty to stand in the way of terrorism, it is not sufficient merely to arrest and pass judgment on the perpetrators and organisers of terrorist acts.
More than anything, we need to improve the conditions which give rise to terrorism: poverty, underdevelopment and ignorance are fertile ground for all kinds of fundamentalism.
It is a paradox that any unforeseeable event can easily be explained after it has happened, but it is not sufficient just to explain the world, we have to change it.
The world economy is in bad shape.
After the attack on the United States, it risks getting even worse, particularly if there is prolonged military action.
Europe, in order to be able to help others, should tackle its own economic problems.
We should welcome the cut in interest rates, and it is also true that the ECB could have better prepared the markets.
These measures would have prevented many stock market crashes.
If there is no balanced growth in the long term, no stabilisation of public deficit, such a shock from the exterior that is unforeseen and unforeseeable should lead Europe to bring automatic stabilisers into play for all EU countries.
This is not economic laxity but good economic sense.
This good economic sense is demonstrated to us by our American friends.
They have just decided on a substantial aid package for their civil aviation.
Does this mean that Europe will now complain to the WTO about this distortion of competition?
Or will she also establish a policy to support those economic sectors weakened by this terrible shock?
Luckily, we have the euro.
Without the common currency there would have been turmoil on international money markets, pushing certain currencies such as the Deutschmark to the top and others seen as weaker to the bottom, with the breakdown of the internal market into the bargain.
There is not only Europe, however. There are poor countries that have a greater risk of suffering from any economic turnaround in a recession that is still a possibility.
Our main priority should be to aim for the true integration of all countries into world trade.
Globalisation, often discredited, only in fact affects a severely limited number of countries.
Four fifths of world trade takes place between thirty or so countries.
There will be no development without trade.
Any economy, in order to be able to export, should create endogenous growth, itself creating greater equity within a country.
In order to permit this endogenous development in poor countries, the problem of third world debt needs to be resolved as soon as possible.
It is only by eradicating poverty and ignorance that we will definitively defeat terrorism.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, international terrorism is threatening to multiply its actions and the brutality of the techniques it employs too - the atrocities in the United States were evidence of this, I am sad to say - while other serious threats such as chemical or nuclear weapons are still present.
Coherent, common European reactions of defence and response are vital, and the Council and Commission statements have set us off in the right direction.
However, there is still a complex issue to be resolved in international legal systems or, if you prefer, international law: the attitude to be taken by institutions such as the European Union or even the United Nations to States which tolerate and collaborate with terrorist groups.
There can be no allowances or half-measures such as have hitherto been conceded in these matters.
In any case, nothing will ever be the same and Friday' s extraordinary Summit will certainly be able to address this issue.
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe and the European Parliament are standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States at this dark time in human history, which is certainly the darkest moment since the end of the Second World War.
We are standing by the United States not least because the victims of the various attacks include a large number of Europeans, many of them Italians.
It was not just the symbols of the economic and collective freedom of the West that were the targets on 11 September: we have all been affected.
Europe must take the lead in the new political phase which has opened after the recent tragic events.
Starting with Parliament, our institutions must play a prominent role in the coming weeks and months.
Together with all the countries of the world, the Union will be summoned to the front line, and the decisions we are called upon to make will have to focus on certain major questions including, most importantly, identifying those responsible.
This is vital if the United States and the allies who decide to support it are to be able to react against terrorism in the way that they must, but the aim of the action taken must be to strike those responsible for the atrocities in New York and Washington.
If we are to win this war against terrorism, Commissioner, we need a thorough reinvigoration of the secret services sector.
In order to do this, in addition to enhancing Europol, which we advocate, it appears increasingly necessary to create a sort of supranational intelligence service.
This was discussed at the Summit between the Italian and British prime ministers, a project seeking to create an organisation which can expose and help combat terrorism in all its tentacular ramifications.
The strategy and international action taken must, of necessity, include all the Arab countries.
It must be clear that the battle currently being played out is not between the West and Islam: it is between the whole world and the lunacy of terrorism.
That is why we attach great importance to Russia and China' s declarations and see the positions of Yasser Arafat and the Israeli government in taking certain decisions which facilitate encouraging steps towards peace in the Middle East as positive.
A military and intelligence response must, in any case, be accompanied by an incisive Union policy in the areas where there is worst crisis: an action intended to extinguish the flames of desperation and intolerance.
The possibility of financial speculation initiated by terrorists on stock markets throughout the world and the crisis experienced by many airlines which will lead to thousands of job cuts demand a raft of measures from the international community to protect the economy as well.
Mr President, Europe and all its institutions are called to undergo a great test.
However, we are all convinced that people will decide en masse for what is right and the values of freedom, democracy and tolerance which we all now uphold will ultimately prevail; we are sure that the European Parliament, the institution which represents the people of Europe, will, from Friday onwards, certainly do its part.
Mr President, there is no doubt that the whole of the European Union stands together with the people of the United States in utterly and totally condemning those who carried out those terrible atrocities in the United States and in expressing our deepest sympathy to the families who lost their loved ones in these terrible atrocities.
The European Union and all democratic societies in the world should join together with the United States in seeking to bring to justice those guilty of those atrocities and in doing so, ensure that they target the actual terrorist organisations and their members, not the communities in which they live with the danger of innocent people suffering.
Generally, terrorism is found in areas of conflict resolution where unfortunately many of those involved believe in what they are doing.
The European Union can play a major role in solving conflict resolution in the different parts of the world by sending to those areas of conflict not an army but a philosophy of peace based on firm principles.
It is often forgotten, that the European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution.
Who could have forecast 60 years ago where we all are now?
Who would have forecast all this in 1941, with the second world war raging and millions being slaughtered.
If our parents and grandparents had said "Don't worry, your grandchildren will be sitting together in a parliament of a United Europe", nobody would have believed them.
But it has happened, and how and why it happened is crucial.
For that reason the European Union, rather than having an army, should set up a Commission department of peace and reconciliation with a Commissioner of peace and reconciliation to spread this philosophy.
Firstly, in all areas of conflict you have divided peoples.
Violence has no role to play in healing the divisions.
Dialogue is the first step.
Secondly there is the principle of respect for difference because all conflict is about difference, whether of religion, nationality or race.
Thirdly, you need to create institutions which respect those differences, and the fourth element is working together in the common interest.
Those are the principles at the heart of the European Union that solved the worst conflicts in the history of the world and are the principles that should be at the heart of conflict resolution in any area of conflict.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has up to this moment been more vulnerable in every respect than the USA, and will remain so for as long as cooperation between Member States in both the legal and operational aspects of counter-terrorism is not optimised.
Admittedly, we have Europol as an institution whose remit covers terrorism among other things, but Europol is powerless if not all Member States comply with the Convention, supply in due time comprehensive information for the analyses required and subsequently make aid available to their fellow Member States.
Europol is toothless if it has insufficient personnel at its disposal, and at present a mere 12 Europol staff are pursuing inquiries into terrorism in Europe.
Europol is also toothless if the technology it needs is not made available to it.
A package of measures is therefore urgently required, and quickly.
I therefore want the Member States to be exhorted to adhere strictly to the Europol Convention, in particular Article 4, and a mechanism to be introduced to compel the Member States to supply this information.
Secondly, we must provide a budget sufficient to equip a centre of operations with an appropriate number of analysts to engage in investigations into terrorism.
Counter-terrorism demands, thirdly, that we set up joint investigatory teams within the framework of collaboration between Europol analysts and representatives of the Member States.
We welcome the accelerated initiative of Mr Vitorino's two framework decisions as a new and urgently needed legal basis with which to effectively combat terrorism.
Europe, above all others, has demands made of it.
Europe is called, now, to be more than decisive in taking a stand in the face of terrorism and taking action to counter it.
Such is the demand of the moment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the attack of 11 September on the WTC and the Pentagon strikes at the very heart of our democracy.
The key aim of the new terrorism is to instil fear into us, to throw our world off balance and at the same time to exploit the helplessness of others in simple black-and-white terms.
In a nutshell, this is an attack on our world, the whole world, and on our international rule of law, and this is precisely what I should like to uphold.
Terrorism has become global and also employs, therefore, global, modern technology and international, criminal structures.
That is why it requires a worldwide response.
For example, a higher level of cooperation among our secret services and the infiltration of terrorist networks spring to mind.
We can no longer afford to work at cross purposes as separate states.
Instead, we must take joint action and in this new coalition of action, we must go beyond usual concepts.
International financial consortia and multinational businesses too must cooperate.
The production of drugs and oil in regions of conflict and the trade in 'blood diamonds' facilitate the financing of illegal activities, of conflict and of war, and are in turn closely linked with the terrorist networks.
We must discontinue the funding of, or cooperation in, the trade in raw materials, where this feeds conflicts and where it provides a breeding ground for terrorism.
In this way, we can immobilise the funding of terrorist networks extremely effectively.
This new war also requires a continued effort in the exchange of economic and criminal intelligence, even if this means that for reasons of security, some public services become more expensive or slow down.
Our desire to live in an open democracy that is accessible to everyone makes us vulnerable.
But our strength lies in cooperation.
This applies overall, irrespective of race, religion or nationality.
We can see through every terrorist attempt to divide the world into their world and ours, to antagonise groups or religions.
Terrorists are not nourished by religion or ideology.
Their hunger is called power.
Their weapons are fear and destruction.
They do not want peace in the Basque Country, Liberia or the Middle East. They simply want civilian victims.
That is why we are on the side of America and of every peace-loving individual who wishes to support this international order.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we can see that the response to this terrorist act is being prepared, and I believe it is being done with great care.
The United States is dealing with this business calmly and attempting to solve the problem in a multilateral context, including cooperation with NATO.
This indicates that all is being done with calm deliberation.
I believe that, for this reason, we must also make it clear that there is no reason for us to evade our responsibilities and obligations, not simply because of our gratitude and not only in order to guarantee the future of transatlantic relations, but because it is in our most fundamental best interests.
Terrorism is taking on the dimensions of a war and resulting in destruction the like of which we knew only in wartime; it is this terrorism that is in a position to strike in the same way at Brussels today, London tomorrow and Madrid the day after tomorrow!
The combatants are already in our midst, and so nobody can steal away.
Nobody, I believe, should look for an alibi, a reason not to join in when the action really does start; and, when it does, it will involve the taking of steps which we must develop on the basis of a new definition of security policy: military action involving the application of all foreign policy instruments, for example the prevention of alliances in favour of the other side, and in conjunction with internal security, about which Mr Vitorino and many in this House have already spoken.
On this last point, it must be clear that cross-border measures can be put in place against cross-border terrorism and that the best national legislation and the best national police can do nothing without cooperation in this sphere.
Let me finally say just one thing: nothing justifies terrorism, but we must still make it our concern to remove the root causes of support for it.
We must, therefore, play our part in removing the breeding-grounds for terrorism in the Middle East and in many other regions
Mr President, the terrorist attacks of 11 September have meant that our debate on the need for Community action to combat terrorism is now extremely topical.
We are still overwhelmed by the horrendous pictures, the horrendous truth and their grave consequences now and, we imagine and fear, for the future.
Quite apart from the effect on the economy or on world political relations, however, thousands of people have died, thousands have lost their parents, children, spouses, friends and loved ones.
I would like to dedicate my first words to those people who are suffering, to the victims: they, the victims, must be present in our future deliberations and decisions.
Because we owe a debt to all of them.
We will have to act so that justice is done and in order to prevent, through action or omission, more innocent victims.
We know that something has to be done, that there has to be a response, a just, democratic, proportionate response, but a response nevertheless, because terrorists cannot be allowed to have, or believe they have, impunity and because we are obliged to assure the citizens that, living under the rule of law, we have the necessary instruments to defend their life, freedom and security.
I cannot and will not ignore the fact that I am Basque.
I would rather have not had this experience in this field, I would do anything not to have had it, but I have.
I know that international cooperation is the right approach, that the initiatives presented today by Commissioner Vitorino are the right approach: political cooperation, judicial cooperation, police cooperation.
Joint responsibility in dealing with terrorism is our main, most effective, political response.
Ladies and gentlemen, terrorism - as has already been said - has no borders, no homeland, no religion and no ideology.
It has a common objective and method.
They have never wanted peace.
They have always sought to destroy us, to destroy democracy.
I therefore say to them that what the Commission has decided today, what has been approved today, is historic.
Allow me to describe it as such.
The necessary step has been taken to move on from solidarity, which is necessary but insufficient, to common action by all.
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, and thank you to all of you for this decision.
Mr President, immensely rich Ã©lites, members and accomplices of which have enjoyed university training, are attacking our financial, economic and security institutions.
This horrific tragedy requires a response.
The citizen asks the government to take action.
In terms of external policy, the European Union is able to do this because we increasingly speak with one voice.
The value of our input in the eradication of breeding grounds for terror has increased by leaps and bounds, as will be seen, I hope, in the near future.
As regards internal policy, we still cannot manage to speak with one voice.
Basically, the 'every man for himself' mentality still prevails.
Fortunately, the Commission has realised that this is not acceptable.
Mr Vitorino, I would like to commend you on the fact that you, and the Commission, have realised that speaking with one voice on behalf of the European Union is absolutely necessary.
Within the space of one week, you produced a detailed plan with proposals which are both practical and also truly necessary.
This will be rewarded in the form of the citizen' s trust.
I hope that none of the Member States will dare to distance themselves from this critical plan, inviting the outrage of its own citizens in doing so.
Needless to say, justice is important in this context, for we are dealing with a crime here, with whatever fine motives it is presented.
This is also evident in Northern Ireland where agreements contain terms which are used incorrectly and which are an insult to anyone who takes their religion seriously.
We have reason to be pleased with the Watson report which provides an initial impulse to the Parliament' s endeavours and may be supplemented with propositions concerning the preparation of crimes which are committed elsewhere, that is, outside the European Union.
We trust that the Commissioner will not accept draft framework decisions which contain weak formulae such as we now see from time to time and which have absolutely no meaning whatsoever.
The real added value must lie in the fact that it becomes clear to the citizens that the European Union, as such, takes charge where guaranteeing internal security is concerned.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we must also draw conclusions as regards civil aviation.
We need to take steps to prevent similar terrorist attacks again taking place in or from the air.
In the immediate future we need increased security for air travellers, preferably at international level.
Let us each, though, start with our airports at home.
We need stricter checks on luggage and hand luggage.
We need tighter checks on airport workers.
Above all, it will not be enough for controls at airports to be more stringent today and tomorrow if, in six months' time, they have been relaxed again in certain parts of Europe.
No, we need strict controls on a permanent basis.
Looking at specific cases, there is probably a need for armed flight attendants on certain routes, and we must consider the need to secure the cockpit against terrorist attacks, for we must prevent aircraft becoming the biggest weapons in the world.
Although the safety of passengers is our primary concern, our secondary concern is that, at present, the number of passengers carried by airlines is showing a massive decrease.
We must keep an eye on this situation.
Is the number of passengers falling as a consequence of the terrorist attacks, or because of market conditions or structural factors?
As we read in today's newspapers, certain governments are demanding subsidies and yet more subsidies, but these cannot be the solution.
My group rejects subsidies for airlines.
We must give thought to how we can help them.
We can do this by coming to an agreement on code sharing and by permitting the restructuring of the companies, along with mergers and acquisitions.
This would be a more elegant solution, keeping them competitive, but we must not pay out subsidies indiscriminately
The situation can, of course, change.
If the USA supports its airlines to the tune of massive amounts, then we will have to see what effect that has on the transatlantic market.
Under such circumstances, we will not be able simply to leave our airlines on the outside looking in, but let us be clear-sighted about this.
First of all, however, we need increased security for passengers.
Mr President, on Tuesday we awoke in astonishment to a manifestation of a new form of totalitarianism.
The Nazism of the past, the Stalinism of yesterday and the Islamic fundamentalism of today all had and have in common a most profound contempt for human beings, who they intend to subject to their plans for world domination.
On 11 September, it was not only the freedom but also the dignity of the human being that was attacked in New York and Washington.
Those who financed this monstrous attack deliberately sacrificed the lives of their own people with the sole objective of killing the largest number of innocent victims possible, in order to put terror firmly into their opponents' minds and to rekindle the flame of their supporters' fanaticism.
The resolve shown throughout the world proves that they did not succeed in their main objective, but the subsequent celebrations that took place in various locations show that the second objective could well have been achieved.
Faced with this menace, we will naturally be obliged to review our common defence policy, but we should also be working toward the implementation of a new world order that allows Europe, in particular, to be increasingly engaged in the resolution of regional conflicts which, in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, and in Africa, do nothing to stem the flow of blood around the world.
In order to combat fundamentalist terrorism, we should mainly focus our efforts on increased assistance to all supporters of moderate and tolerant Islam, whether they be in power or in opposition.
In Afghanistan, for example, we had no idea of how to respond to the urgent request from Commander Massoud to destroy the hornets' nest that had developed in his country.
We should support his partisans in the Northern Alliance, the sole representatives of the recognised government in Afghanistan, and help them in any way we can to overthrow the barbarous Taliban regime.
To combat fundamentalist terrorism we need to completely restructure our own defence mechanisms.
Europe does not have the means.
The American Congress and Senate have just allocated USD 40 billion to the President of the United States.
What amount of money, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, do you have today to demonstrate, other than through fine words, our desire to stand shoulder to shoulder with the American people in this fight that has been forced upon us?
Ladies and gentlemen, today everything has changed.
I hope that in the adoption of our 2002 draft budget at second reading we will know how to draw the right conclusions.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, I represent a country which has a unique and close historical relationship with the United States.
We very much appreciated the support we received from that country in eliminating violence on our own island.
What happened in New York and Washington is not new.
Attacks on economic, political and security targets resulting in major civilian casualties have been the hallmark of international terrorism.
They have been experienced in Ireland, Britain, Spain and other European countries: that is why we share and understand the pain of those who have suffered.
We in Ireland hope that this atrocity will precipitate a change in the way representatives of organisations responsible for similar atrocities in Ireland are treated as celebrities in parts of the United States.
Hopefully, it will also undermine their fund-raising capabilities, particularly when their paramilitary wing still retains the weapons of terrorism and mass destruction and fraternises with other terrorist leaders.
The major issue facing democratic leaders is how to respond to this latest atrocity.
When I listen to the language currently being used by President George W. Bush, I must say I am somewhat apprehensive.
To talk about catching 'dead or alive' may well be the language of cowboy movies, but it is not the language that should be used by a world leader at any time, and certainly not during times of crises.
The revulsion that followed last week's events, provides the impetus to unite everyone in support of democratic ideals in the fight against international terrorism.
Handled wrongly however, it could plunge the western world into a conflict with the Islamic world with catastrophic consequences for everyone.
Therefore the response must be well thought out and proportionate.
It must not result in unnecessary civilian casualties creating another generation of terrorists.
We have a unique opportunity to rid the world of the evil of terrorism and underpin democracy.
Future generations will not forgive us if we squander that opportunity.
Mr President, in the United Kingdom we have unity of purpose at this tragic time.
We are reassured by the solidarity with the United States expressed by political leaders right across Europe.
Previously, the enthusiasm of so many European politicians for European integration has been fuelled by anti-Americanism.
There must be no more of this.
Seldom has the need for Euro/Atlantic unity been more vital.
I trust that European Union leaders will make sure that there is no backsliding by any European governments when the going starts to get rough.
In previous crises, the resolve of some has quickly crumbled.
It would be singularly inappropriate to use this crisis to promote and accelerate the integrationist agenda of the Union, in particular the essentially separatist elements of European defence policy.
Our motive must be serious action against terrorism, not just seizing an opportunity to extend EU competencies.
On the internal front, I hope that the proposed European Union common definition of terrorist crime and associated legislation will be sufficiently robust to allow effective action at last to be taken against large numbers of terrorist front organisations throughout Europe.
I have to say, I doubt it.
The problem is that too many terrorists have their apologists and masquerade in other guises.
Ways need to be found to prevent terrorist support groups from carrying out what are still regarded as legal acts in our countries, such as recruiting, indoctrinating, broadcasting and fund-raising in order to sustain illegal acts elsewhere.
Specifically, it is time for the seven European Union countries which have not yet done so, including the Belgian Presidency, to ratify and implement the UN Convention for the suppression of terrorist financing, so that the black money networks which sustain terrorist organisations can be closed down.
Democratic society needs to protect itself and be able to deal with real dangers.
In recent years, it has been progressively disarmed.
Mr President, I firmly condemn terrorist acts.
Terrorism is abhorrent, whatever adjectives you use to describe it and whatever ideological label you attach to it. I too feel that we must establish very close cooperation with the United States and form an extensive world-wide alliance of all the countries that wish to be part of it to combat terrorism.
The world-wide anti-terrorism alliance must certainly address military issues to ensure safety, but it must also address all the possible forms of terrorism which exist, which range from financial to banking terrorism, and from economic, food contamination and environmental terrorism to electronic terrorism and terrorism in the form of computer hacking.
The debate between the European Parliament, the OSCE and the WEU, which met at the assembly of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, focused largely, on the one hand, on the need to speed up the process of democratising those countries and, on the other, on the upholding of human rights. These are the two fundamental pillars for eradicating poverty and underdevelopment through the rational use of economic resources.
Henceforth, the European Union must stipulate the upholding of human rights and the implementation of democracy as firm conditions in all its external relations.
This stipulation is fixed and unconditional because it guarantees the protection of the dignity of every citizen in the world.
The European Union must encourage respect for every religious faith and, at the same time, it must require all faiths to condemn and abhor terrorist acts, to make a clear distinction between civil society, which is free to practise any religion, and terrorism, which cannot claim to have any religious justification.
I support the idea of convening a Mediterranean Forum condemning terrorism, supporting the Middle East Peace Process and reinvigorating the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
Finally, Europol and Eurojust must, together, become effective European tools, concentrating on enhancing the European corpus juris and thereby creating a basic legal reference framework which will serve as the basis for European civil, penal and administrative law.
Mr President, I share and express my sympathy for the United States and for the other victims of this terrible incident.
As a former Northern Ireland minister, I have been a terrorist target and I have faced the TV cameras surrounded by the wreckage of a terrorist incident.
I know, therefore, how important it is to get both the response right and also to protect the general public as far as is possible in a democracy.
Like my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, I am chiefly concerned about aviation and the mostly ordinary people who rely on it.
As a member of the Committee on Transport, I have written to the chairman of that committee asking for early consideration of the implications for this important industry.
First of all, security at airports and on aircraft; secondly, the control of congested airspace in view of the likely increase in military activity, the dangers of hostile incursion into European civil airspace and, of course, as he said, about the continued viability of European airlines.
It is vital that we are consistent in our approach to public safety and to the collective peace of mind throughout the Union.
We must not overreact, exacerbating the understandable fears of the traveller and threatening their civil liberties, but we must get it right and we must do so immediately.
We must act alongside our friends and allies within the United States of America and in international organisations such as the ICAO.
To get it right will require work and effort and a commitment: As Mr Van Orden said, we want to make certain that we are saying and doing the same things in six months' time as we profess to do now.
In conclusion, the message is quite simple: Terrorism must not be allowed to win.
Any attack upon civilians is abominable, and the sabre rattling we are hearing in Washington - the President uses expressions such as 'crusade' - is therefore also abominable.
It is monstrous because we know that a military intervention will, in any case, destroy civil society and create the best possible breeding ground for further terrorism. Our most important task is to remind our allies in the United States of the need for caution and considered action, for terrorism is not to be combated through military action.
With regard to the proposals tabled by the Commission, I would just say that these do not contain what is necessary to prevent terrorism, whose roots go much deeper.
What is proposed is neither necessary nor adequate to stamp out terrorism and does not even begin to pinpoint the fundamental causes, which is what is important.
Let us steer clear of these military metaphors and this talk of battles, crusades and waging war.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened carefully to the many speeches in this debate and believe that a number of very valid points have been made.
Needless to say, the events of last Tuesday were a kind of wake-up call for Europe.
As many of you have already stated, it is true that we will need to take decisive action in future in order to remove the inconsistencies between the first, second and third pillars of integration, in other words the second and third pillars within the entire European construction.
Some may appreciate in these circumstances that a plea for this does not point to an institutional compulsion, but rather to a concern for the effectiveness of the Union' s actions.
In this connection, I have taken a careful note of the invitation which your Member and my friend, Mr Jan-Kees Wiebenga, addressed to me.
I would like to tell him to go ahead straight away with the good work by convincing his own political party and his own government to abolish any veto with regard to the Third Pillar.
That would be a huge step in the right direction.
As far as our cooperation with the United States is concerned, I have, on behalf of the Council, said that this must be stepped up and will need to go beyond the usual forms of cooperation.
Together with many of you, I hope that the American request for aid from Europe, as repeated by various Members here today, will remain just as clear in future and that provision will be made for a balanced cooperation, by means of which we, on an equal footing, inform, support and help each other as much as possible in all the actions which are necessary to combat international terrorism.
As some of you have already stated, I would, on behalf of the Council, like to underline that it would be a terrible mistake to view the events of the past week as a kind of conflict between two civilisations, or worse, a conflict between philosophical-religious world visions.
Radicalism is nobody' s monopoly, unfortunately, and neither is fanaticism.
What happened last week is so horrific on account of its sheer scale and the large number of victims involved.
Those images will be etched in our minds forever, but unfortunately, every day, we are once again faced with expressions of blind fanaticism, much closer to home, which cannot be ascribed - as happens - to certain world visions.
I would like to warn against this most emphatically.
We must not go in that direction and we must, on the contrary, ensure that all sources of conflict on our own continent, but also elsewhere, are brought within peace processes as soon as possible.
Like many of you, I have the Middle East in mind but not only the Middle East.
I am also thinking of the Balkans - yesterday, in Parliament, a conference was held on the Stability Pact relating to the Balkans - and Africa - I talked this afternoon abut the programme of our Presidency concerning Africa.
As I already stated in my first speech, the European Union is growing into a global power quicker than many had envisaged and slower than many would wish.
That brings with it additional weighty responsibilities.
I hope that in the next couple of weeks and months, we will prove worthy of those additional weighty responsibilities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is grateful for your contributions to this debate.
I shall certainly convey to President Prodi and to my colleague Christopher Patten the questions for which they are directly responsible within the Commission.
For my part, I should simply like to emphasise three points. The first is to say that I fully share the idea that the strategy on terrorism should not be caught between the various pillars of the European Union.
There must be a global strategy that harnesses various instruments, such as conflict prevention policy, of course, the development of a political dialogue with the most problematic regions under the common foreign and security policy, of course, development aid policy, of course, but also, and let us be quite clear on this point, security policy and police and judicial cooperation policy.
We cannot ignore the deep-rooted causes of terrorism, but we cannot allow the slightest ambiguity to remain and we therefore state that no cause justifies the use of terrorism and violence that sacrifices innocent lives.
The best way of combating terrorism in the name of democratic values, therefore, consists of using the weapons of the law, cooperation between police forces and cooperation between the courts.
It is worth emphasising, however, that there are clearly some issues which we must look into, such as the funding of terrorism, the need to rigorously apply the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the need to adopt effective mechanisms to combat money laundering and the tax havens that provide financial support for terrorist groups and the United Nations Convention on arms trafficking. In other words, we need to implement the Palermo Convention on organised crime.
These are many ways of proving, within the framework of the United Nations, that the people who died on 11 September did not die in vain.
In other words, that States have learned the lesson and that they are willing to give incontrovertible proof that they are improving cooperation in the fight against terrorism.
The second issue that I wish to address concerns aviation safety. I am pleased to say that the Council of Ministers for Transport has decided that a working group will present an initial report on 15 October, not only on the most immediate safety measures that are being taken in airports and in aircraft but also on the need to conclude an agreement, especially with our American partners, on rapidly defining measures to improve the safety of air transport.
I also wish to say that these issues will be discussed by representatives of the European Union at the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which opens on 25 September.
With regard to political decisions - for example, the two framework decisions that the Commission has just approved - it is quite clear that unanimity could prove to be a tricky obstacle to overcome in Council.
The Commission has already, on several occasions, expressed its sympathy with the idea that methods of decision-making under the third pillar should be streamlined and simplified.
However, over and above the issue of unanimity, the Commission' s political position on the fight against terrorism is clear: no State must block decisions. Nevertheless, no State can opt out of the fight against terrorism.
The effectiveness of the framework decisions also depends on their being implemented uniformly in all the States of the Union without exception, because we do not want a single haven for terrorist or criminal activities to exist within the European Union.
To this end, I hope that the appeals of this Parliament and of public opinion are sufficiently strong to enable us to reach the compromise formulas necessary to improve police and judicial cooperation, which are the legitimate methods for combating terrorism in a democracy.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
Future of cohesion policy
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the future of cohesion policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since 1988, regional policy has enjoyed undeniable success.
This success is not purely coincidental.
It is the fruit of a major policy decision that favours solidarity, a decision that has resulted, in budgetary terms, in the appropriation of more than a third of Community expenditure for economic and social cohesion.
During this 2000-2006 programming period, the Commission adopted, on 31 January, the second report on economic and social cohesion in accordance with Article 159, subparagraph 2, of the Treaty.
In addition to being a pertinent account of the studies carried out and the statistical information gathered in the field of enlargement, the report contains conclusions and recommendations that should encourage debate on the future of regional policy.
Economic and social cohesion is a real issue that we should be concerned with from now on, for we have to provide answers for the next programming period starting 1 January 2007, a time when enlargement to include new Member States will be a reality.
With regard to the statistical information in the second report on cohesion, one fact stands out in our minds: enlargement will bring a challenge twice as large as the one we are currently facing, for the figures indicate that regional disparities are set to double.
In relative terms, regions that are lagging behind in their development and those which are having problems with restructuring will be greater in number and this effect will be multiplied when we are 27 Member States.
In addition, due to a simple mechanical reality, a certain number of regions in the current European Union will no longer find themselves on the list of problem regions although their true economic situation has not really improved.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our attention needs to be focused on two crucial questions.
The first question is whether enlargement is conceivable without a powerful structure and cohesion policy.
The second question is how the policy on economic and social cohesion should in future continue to focus on regions that lag behind current Member States developmentally, and what are the objectives that need to be met.
Both questions were extensively dealt with during the informal Regional Policy Council which was held recently in Namur on 13 July last.
With regard to the first question, everyone has accepted that enlargement will bring with it a substantial increase in needs in terms of social and economic cohesion.
That was also clearly underlined in the Commission' s second report on economic and social cohesion.
The figures in the report speak for themselves.
Following on enlargement, discrepancies will become more pronounced in two ways.
Firstly, the section of the population in regions with a Gross Domestic Product per capita that is less than 75% of the current EU average will double, and that means that the number of inhabitants that fall within the scope of present objective 1 of the Structural Funds will increase from 19% in the EU of Fifteen Members to 36% in an EU comprising twenty-seven Member States.
Secondly, discrepancies will increase in extent.
Today' s average Gross Domestic Product per capita in the underprivileged regions stands at 66% of the EU average.
If one adds to this the less developed regions of the candidate countries, the average Gross Domestic Product per capita drops back to less than half of the EU average, to only 77% to be precise.
On the basis of the above data, one can conclude that with enlargement, the cohesion problem doubles in terms of its original scope and its original extent.
Poverty and inequality are persistent problems and we realise that we will need to fight them for a long time yet to come.
Even if the candidate countries were to grow faster than the amalgamated countries have done in the past ten years, even then, the current level of the Gross Domestic Product per capita would imply a convergence process spanning at least two generations.
Even with the Irish rate of growth of the past ten years, it would take twenty years to reach 90% of the Gross Domestic Product per capita of the fifteen EU Member States.
It is from that perspective that today' s priorities and objectives of our regional policy must be viewed.
Even the management itself of the outlined package of measures is an important element, in the sense that we should not overlook the fact that at present, most candidate countries do not have appropriate structures in place to manage properly the regional policy in the way we in most cases propose.
Having said that, during the informal Council in Namur, we were given a clear signal that it is necessary to continue to support the current underprivileged regions in the European Union.
The present objectives pertaining to the underprivileged regions, both in the Member States and in the candidate countries, must be supported in a fair manner.
That will inevitably need to go hand in hand with an even more efficient deployment of Community resources.
There is therefore unanimity as regards the continuation of the present regional policy concerning those regions which continue to face structural difficulties.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the coherence of the actions to be taken, the Fifteen support a strengthening of this coherence at all levels, particularly between the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, with a more specific focus being given to interventions.
Furthermore, requests for additional assessments, particularly on the efficiency of the current system, have been drawn up by certain Member States before they are prepared to advance further in the determination of procedures and mechanisms that will govern the future of economic and social cohesion policy.
These procedures and mechanisms will be the subject of a global proposal from the Commission in 2004, in its third report on economic and social cohesion.
In any case, it is clear that projects and action supported by the economic and social cohesion policy are particularly important to European citizens.
This contributes to the process of bringing citizens closer to European institutions and policies.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, by publishing the second report on economic and social cohesion, has paved the way for an important debate on the future of the European Union' s structural operations policy.
The Council, during the informal meeting on regional policy that took place in Namur, listened very carefully to the presentation made by Commissioner Barnier.
The Council then debated the issue in a calm atmosphere where everybody had the chance to speak and be heard.
The discussions focused on questions of substance, in a climate that was generally positive.
However, no definitive option has yet been decided on.
To do this, the questions asked in the second report need to be looked at in much greater detail.
The Commission will continue its analysis and will encourage debate by organising working parties for each issue.
The results of this will be used in the drafting of a third report, expected in 2004.
At this point, it will be sent back to the Council and Parliament, on the basis of the Commission' s proposals, to be used at an earlier stage in the development of the future framework of cohesion policy.
Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I can personally bring you up to date, as I am sure you were hoping I would, on the great debate we started on 31 January in this very place, when I came to present you with the second report on economic and social cohesion that the Commission had just approved.
On that occasion we, in addition to this presentation, started a debate that I said, and I am anxious to repeat on this very occasion, would be sincere, objective, without any issue being taboo, on one of the great Community policies at the very heart of the perception that we have of our European Union, for it relates to the policy of solidarity.
Since 31 January, the debate has been stoked by new contributions.
I am thinking in particular of the Cohesion Forum of 21 and 22 May, organised right here thanks to the European Parliament, in agreement with your President and with the support of my colleagues Anna Diamantopoulou and Franz Fischler.
At the same time, enlargement negotiations are progressing with all candidate countries.
Enlargement, as you know, is one of the main themes of this debate.
I would like to reiterate now that we must make a clear distinction between accession negotiations, which are based on the application of the acquis communautaire in new Member States, and the reform of structural policies for the period following 2006.
The debate that I am inviting you to participate in mainly focuses on the period after 2006.
We are, of course, not calling into question what current Member States receive from the Structural Funds from now until 2006.
Your Parliament, in requesting the Commission to give its opinion, wanted to take stock of this debate.
I would like to thank you, therefore, for this opportunity and thus quickly mention certain points.
Firstly, the forum we held on 21 and 22 May was an opportunity for genuine debate, paving the way for other such moments.
Since 31 January, the presentation of conclusions from the cohesion report has been, for both myself and my colleagues from the Directorate-General on Regional Policy, a priority.
You can be sure that I will fully participate in this debate, week after week, at ground level.
Last Friday in Helsinki, for example, I met the twenty Finnish regional Presidents. Tomorrow and the day after, in Oporto, I will attend an assembly of the conference of peripheral maritime regions, where we will discuss this future cohesion policy.
In this way, the debate should spread, should move away from the political centre in such a way that it provides firstly the Member States and then Brussels with a certain number of ideas, requests, proof and guidelines.
The 21 May forum was a very important moment for me and one that taught many lessons.
It brought together a number of ministers, several former prime ministers, current prime ministers, representatives from regions and towns, not only from the fifteen Member States but also from the candidate countries, and many very high-level contributions.
I would like to bring to light three aspects of these contributions and the discussion that Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck mentioned earlier, that I held in Namur with the fifteen ministers in charge of regional policy, on the invitation of the Belgian Presidency.
Firstly, the interest the future of this policy after 2006 arouses in all Member States and candidate countries, and the insistence of many on the truly political dimension of European solidarity.
This is not solely a question of money.
It is also the expression, as you very clearly stated, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the Presidency, of possibly the most concrete, the most precise and visible of the values upon which the European Union is founded.
The proof that our Union is not just a large free trade area or single market, but also a community of solidarity that should one day be a political force.
Secondly, I have had no negative feedback regarding the enlargement process.
There is concern, of course, but also a sense of the European Union' s historic obligation and interest in both new and old Member States in assisting in the long-lasting and balanced development of the whole European continent.
Thirdly, I have also measured the importance, in order for this debate to succeed, of not forgetting the needs of regions in States that are current members of the EU.
I would like once again to state my conviction: we are not of the opinion that by admitting very poor regions in Eastern Europe - Estonia, Slovenia, Poland, Bulgaria and others - into the European Union, that regions that are poor or that are experiencing difficulties in the north, the centre, the south, not to mention the outermost regions, will become rich as if by waving a magic wand.
After enlargement there will be problems and needs in the EU as it currently stands.
So, ladies and gentlemen, here we have what constitutes, when all is considered, strong encouragement for the maintenance of a cohesion policy that is suited to the new economic challenges and future geography of Europe.
My second point concerns procedures for the future.
As you know, the Commission has committed itself, following requests from the Council in June, to provide it with a regular report on the development of its work on future cohesion policy.
This information, which I must give to the Council, I must also, naturally, give to the European Parliament.
I will propose to the Commission that it adopt the first of these regular interim reports at the very beginning of next year, in January, as soon as we have new statistics available. These statistics will explain, update and clarify the information that is already available in the cohesion report.
I would like to point out that these new statistics, supplied by Eurostat, will involve, for example, the GDP per capita in 1999, and unemployment statistics for the year 2000.
Therefore, the more up-to-date these figures are, the more serious and objective the debate will be.
This interim report for the month of January will therefore contain an update of figures and analyses from the first part of the cohesion report devoted to the situation of regions, but it will also present the results of different studies that we have commissioned, as well as lessons learned from the great debates and seminars that have been organised.
I can give more details regarding the additional studies commissioned: we have commissioned a study of the situation of the islands, as well as a study on the macroeconomic impact of Structural Funds.
With regard to this macroeconomic study, I shall be very eager to provide you with information on the impact of these Structural Funds in terms of the direct impact of the use of these funds in net contributing countries.
I also plan to commission an additional study on the situation of mountainous regions or regions that have long-term natural handicaps.
In order to stimulate this debate, seminars will be organised during the first half of 2002 on each of the ten Community priorities that have been identified in the cohesion report, with the participation of experts from the Member States and regions who we shall invite in accordance with the various issues.
My third point involves, whilst still talking about the future, the basis of the debate.
On the subject of the basis of the debate, I would like to express, or state once more, three convictions.
My first conviction is that within the coming context of this EU enlargement, the Member States and regions will feel the need for more Community cohesion policy and not less.
I do not think that a form of unravelling or renationalisation of regional policy should be the way to respond to this requirement, to this need for cohesion in an enlarged EU where there will be - and the figures speak for themselves - more disparities than today.
But I am equally resolutely in favour, while reaffirming this need for cohesion and planning these new cohesion and regional policies, to find, with your help, a way to achieve more decentralisation, simplification, and less bureaucracy.
As far as we can, I will, using current European procedures, be anxious to search for and propose all means of moving further towards simplification and decentralisation.
My second conviction is financial in nature.
Even if the financial debate is, strictly speaking, premature today, I am not the only one to consider, as I already said here in a personal capacity, that a financial effort that would globally represent any less than 0.45 % of EU GDP would, in my view, call into question the credibility of the future cohesion policy.
I think therefore that I can state once more that, in my opinion, we cannot, without calling into question the credibility of this cohesion policy, fall below this threshold of 0.45 % which is a threshold universally accepted by the Heads of State and Government in Berlin.
My third conviction is that future cohesion policy should be fair and non-discriminatory.
It should, therefore, be directed towards all regions that have structural difficulties of whatever nature and deal with questions in a heterogeneous fashion, that is to say, regions that are very backward in terms of development, that happen to be mostly in candidate countries, as well as regions within the current Fifteen that have not truly succeeded in the process of true convergence and for which it would be a good idea, at an opportune moment, to find some means of fair treatment, so that they are not penalised by a purely statistical or mechanical effect linked to a threshold or to new methods applied within the framework of the enlarged EU, in order to deal with the problems of certain areas which have particular handicaps or certain worrying social issues such as equal opportunities or the situation of urban areas.
In conclusion, Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that the report we shall put forward at the beginning of next year will take its inspiration from the results of the great debates held in the second half of this year.
This is just the first of the meetings I have proposed to hold with you.
There will be others before I present you with the third cohesion report in 2004.
It is in this frame of mind that I shall be entirely available today and in the forthcoming weeks to listen to your suggestions, your recommendations and your criticisms.
Mr President, I do not think anything impressively new can come out of this debate on regional policy quite simply, in my personal opinion, because the time is not right, it is not newsworthy, if you like.
In all events, given that many of the Members are interested in this particular subject and given that regional policy accounts yet again for 35% of the budget, this confirms, I think, just how important it is to the European Union and, in this sense, there is perhaps some point to the debate.
The second point I wish to make is that perhaps it would be a good idea at some point - and this is certainly the intention of the Committee on Regional Policy - to discuss the state of progress of projects and programmes under the Community Support Framework in individual countries, because I personally am not at all convinced that everything is going swimmingly in every country, not through any fault of the Commission's, but through the fault of certain Member States.
I do not wish to speak of dramatic delays but I am sure that certain countries are having problems.
As far as the future of cohesion policy is concerned, a debate was started following the second cohesion report by the European Commission and I think that certain conclusions are already obvious, that is, that far more regions will need to be covered, that in regions in the Member States which are already covered there will appear to be an artificial increase in GNP, which does not mean that they will automatically become rich, as the Commissioner has said, and that it goes without saying that more appropriations are needed but that it does not go without saying that it will be easy to find these appropriations.
As far as I can see, the conclusions are more or less obvious.
First, we must not leave things in the lap of the Gods, we must not take decisions at the eleventh hour, because we could bring the European Union to what may well be an explosive situation.
Secondly, we need to concentrate from 2006 onwards on those in real need.
Thirdly, we must not create shock waves in regions which stop being covered, because that will give rise to euro-scepticism in these regions.
Having said which, I have two unpleasant things to say, one of which is unpleasant for the poorer countries and the other of which is unpleasant for the richer countries.
For the poorer countries, I think that we need to find ways of making the most of appropriations by introducing suitable mechanisms, incentives and, if necessary, sanctions so that the money actually goes somewhere.
And for the richer countries, we need to rethink the overall logic of the Community budget so as to find a way of increasing appropriations, because there will be a huge increase in requirements and regional policy will, as the Commissioner has said, have no credibility whatsoever if we fall below a certain point.
Mr President, Commissioner, you will be aware that the Regional and Transport Committee has started its deliberations on social and economic cohesion via the second cohesion report and that this report launches the debate on how we face up to the challenges of regional funding and structural policy in an enlarged Europe.
However, whilst I am grateful for the Commissioner's statement today, my group is still disappointed with the Commission as it appears that it has not used its right of initiative and has not engaged itself fully on this topic.
It raises the question as to what the real proposals of the Commission are.
Commissioner Barnier referred to the meeting in May in which many Members participated, but again nothing concrete seems to have come out of that meeting.
On our side of the political divide, we recognised at an early stage how sensitive this issue could be and indeed our experience of Agenda 2000 was the catalyst that told us this.
But then Commissioner Wulf-Matthies facilitated a common position with Parliament and so we feel that the time is now right for us to start work with the Commission as it becomes more active, positive and decisive.
My group has discussed in detail the questions that you have posed.
The main points emanating from our discussion revolve around the principle of keeping the concept of social and economic cohesion and its most representative instrument, namely the Cohesion Fund.
But a thorough discussion is required on implementing the goals of the cohesion policy before we make any decisions on the future financing of structural aid.
At the moment, we are facing a number of great challenges and any discussion on the implementation of Cohesion Fund has to include other areas under the umbrella of sustainable development, such as employment and agriculture.
We must continue to ensure that the poorer regions that presently receive structural aid are not mistreated in the future and that Community initiatives, such INTERREG and URBAN, are retained.
We also question whether 1.27% of the Community GDP, as was decided on in Agenda 2000, is enough with regard to the new Cohesion Fund.
In launching this debate, it is our view that our discussions would have been more fruitful and more meaningful if the Commission had come forward with ideas of its own so that it could act as a facilitator of those discussions.
We know that it is an important issue.
At the moment, we are left with a series of questionnaires, but we can give the Commissioner a guarantee that our group will be fully involved in discussions in the coming months.
Mr President, the debate on the future of the cohesion policy is a very timely one.
I wish to thank the Commission for its willingness to share this debate with Parliament and, at the same time, for the visits undertaken to Member States. They are very necessary.
My concern is not just how regional policy can be made to work effectively both in the present Member States and in the countries that have applied for membership but also the continuation of structural policy in the present Member States in the next Structural Funds period.
Structural Funds policy is currently managed in too cumbersome a manner.
Now is a good time to consider, for example, how we might learn from the delay in the preparatory procedures for programmes for the next period.
How can we become more effective, achieve better results and reduce bureaucracy?
In this connection I would also like to enquire what the Commission' s position is regarding what enlargement means for the overall funding of structural policy.
Is the Commission prepared to increase structural policy appropriations during the next Structural Funds period should the situation regarding European economic and social cohesion so demand?
At the same time I would also like to communicate to the Commission that a funding model for enlargement is not acceptable where those having to pay would be the poor regions of the existing EU countries, where there are still lasting problems owing to difficult natural conditions, long distances or sparse populations.
The EU must also show solidarity in the future so that new money with a new financial instrument can be found for the new challenges of structural policy, where those that pay would include those central regions that will be the first to benefit economically from enlargement.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cohesion policy is indeed the greatest challenge facing the Community in the context of enlargement.
At the same time, cohesion policy will be the litmus test of whether stability can successfully be maintained in an EU of 27 Member States and, moreover, in all its parts.
The tendency has, however, prevailed in the Member States not to assess the success of cohesion policy in the less favoured areas, but rather to evaluate success in terms of how much they end up getting for themselves out of each negotiation.
Clearly, this must change from 2006 onwards!
Stability and the successful development of an enlarged Union will be guaranteed after 2006 only if common objective criteria rather than the protection of possession constitute the precondition for the allocation of funds.
This means that a new, common cohesion policy must be tested in its entirety against the old policy.
The second report on cohesion contains some good proposals, but it perpetuates many of the cohesion policy's errors and is no radical programme of reform.
I will say a bit more about the proposals.
I think it right and proper that all regions of the enlarged Union should be assessed on an equal basis provided there is no simultaneous impact on regions which are currently being supported.
So I wholeheartedly support the principle of phasing out.
Increased decentralisation and the promotion of partnership must, however, apply also to the acceding countries in the accession funds - and right now - so that their authorities get some practical experience of them.
Phasing-in the acceding countries into a decentralised structural policy as early as 2002 is also necessary in order to pool experience.
Even in half measures, an integrated regional policy is the only thing in which donors, too, can have confidence.
Quality must therefore come before quantity!
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I consider the policy of economic and social cohesion to be one of the European Union's undoubted achievements, attesting as it does the principle of solidarity between the highly-developed regions and the weak ones.
Of course, on further analysis of the way structural policy has worked to date, it has to be said that it has a lot of inadequacies.
Firstly: The divergence between Member States may well have decreased, but the differences within them - between highly-developed regions and weak ones - have increased.
Secondly: The unemployment rate in the weak regions has not significantly decreased.
Thirdly: The average per capita income of the wealthiest regions, which make up 10% of the Union's population, is still 2.6 times higher than in the regions in which 10% of the poorest inhabitants live.
Fourthly: The underdeveloped regions still do not possess self-supporting economic and social cycles.
They therefore have enormous problems when it comes to actually reducing the amount by which they lag behind the developed areas.
Fifthly: You yourselves can see that the commitment appropriations yet to be settled totalled almost EUR 42 billion at the end of 1999, in other words the Structural Fund's input for specific projects is inefficient!
This means that other measures, even other projects, must be deliberately chosen, something which can, of course, only be done in collaboration with the Member States.
Whatever the shortcomings, the enormous amount of change cannot be overlooked.
Differences would otherwise be markedly greater.
This also means that we must carry on with the Structural Fund policy.
You have just said, Mr Barnier, that there must be no taboos.
Too true!
All the Member States said more or less the same thing at the informal meeting in Namur, and proposals were submitted.
But sooner or later, we must get to the point. At some juncture, it will have to be said that these proposals cost X amount of money, and we must either make it available or we have to admit that we are not going to.
This cannot be put off for ever and a day.
You will be aware that the upper limit equals 1.27% of GDP within the financial perspective for 2000 to 2006.
Where are we in real terms?
At 1.06%.
You can hardly call that putting real structural policy into practice! It is also because of Parliament...
(Interruption by Mr Jarzembowski) No, I am not only accusing the Commissioner; we put up with this sort of thing all the time!
Not my Group, though; we have always submitted the relevant amendments.
Perhaps, Mr Jarzembowski, the PPE-DE Group would like to join in next time, then we should almost make up a majority!
In the context of this discussion, we must also of course bear in mind that there are very special regions.
I regret to have to say, Commissioner, that the border regions programme imposed by the Commission is utterly inadequate!
Perhaps we will have to give some thought to doing something similar...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Commissioner, the Cohesion Fund was created in order to prepare the structurally weak countries of the EU for economic and monetary union.
The cohesion countries have substantially caught up over the past few years and they all participate in EMU.
I would therefore observe that this objective of the Cohesion Fund has been attained.
Despite this, Agenda 2000 decided that the Cohesion Fund should continue.
Would it not have been consistent to let the Cohesion Fund expire, not abruptly perhaps but by its being phased out?
The eastward enlargement means that the EU's present cohesion policy cannot be continued with any longer.
We all know that eastward enlargement will not be for free, and this must be said frankly.
Apart from that, I too believe that much is going wrong with our cohesion policy as regards efficiency, administrative costs and this policy's vulnerability to deception.
What the cohesion policy needs is a fundamental debate about its strengths and weaknesses, that is, about its possible reform.
I know that this is a difficult debate, being about our patrimony.
But it is also about a quite fundamental question: what, in the EU, does solidarity mean?
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too will take up your suggestion that this issue should be discussed without taboos.
I do not believe that there is actually anybody in this House who is opposed to a cohesion policy.
The question we must ask ourselves is whether a cohesion policy would not be better conducted without a Cohesion Fund.
There are two problems, the first being that, if the accessions were to take place, then, logically, all the acceding States, being the poorest countries and States, would have to join the Cohesion Fund.
You cannot say that there is a regional policy for all, a Cohesion Fund for four countries and all the rest can fit in somewhere else!
No, so if the Cohesion Fund were to be maintained, it would have to apply to all the acceding countries.
It is my personal view, however, that cohesion policy can be carried on better through the medium of general regional and structural policy and without a Cohesion Fund, as the Cohesion Fund seems to me to suffer from the drawback that it turns its attention to States rather than to regions.
It is not the States that we want to support, however, but disadvantaged regions.
It is for this reason, Commissioner, that I believe this issue should again be considered very carefully.
I believe, secondly, that we too should, as you have always said, distinguish between substantial reforms and the question of how much money we want to end up spending on them.
We must, in my view, come to a quick decision about the substance, as the acceding States have a right to be told before 2002/2003 what the cohesion policy situation is going to be if they are Members by then.
Commissioner, I am not sure that I understood you right: I find your model good in itself.
You are saying that there are standard criteria for all regions - one or two, shall we say - then there is phasing out for the regions that used to be supported but no longer can be because of the new criteria or simply because there is no more money.
The question now arises: by what criteria should support actually be given in future?
I myself would be prepared to talk in terms of one or two, or even three, criteria.
I have, though, the slight suspicion - which you hinted at earlier - that there will subsequently be ten.
So one takes a look to see what criterion fits the region.
Oh look, there are a few mountains, so this is a mountain region.
And this place has island status, so we shall call it an island region!
I think it better to take any old percentage - GDP plus, perhaps, the unemployment situation, for example.
If one takes that a step further and says that the balance of the sexes or the standard of education of men and women are to be counted as general criteria, then - if I may say so - things get a bit jumbled.
So please let us carry on our discussions, as you said you would.
We are on your side and look forward to continuing the debate with you.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I wish to express my support for those who have said that this debate must not be about the safeguarding of possession, but about aid for those who need it most.
I also want to say frankly that, in my considered opinion, nobody must close his eyes to the fact that enlargement is going to present us all with great challenges, those of a financial nature among them.
The Germans learned their lesson through reunification, when the citizens were told at first that it would involve no fiscal burdens for them.
This was demonstrably false.
Let there be no misunderstandings - of course we want enlargement.
But we must squarely face the consequences for structural policy.
We should not simply be told 'as you were' , and I do not believe that we will be.
If we are not to forfeit the trust of people in the affected regions, we must point this out clearly, honestly and at an early stage.
If there is not to be a rude awakening, we must explore the possibilities of full support for the candidate countries in building up their infrastructure and, at the same time, concern ourselves with continuing to bring the weakest regions of the Fifteen up to the average.
The success of this will depend on making certain changes which would have been required even without enlargement.
First, there is the fact that the cohesion countries can point to very variable results from the catching-up process, and it is evident that the greatest successes were achieved where the actors were on the spot and shared a commitment to maximising the efficiency of the support.
Moreover, project evaluation needs further improvement and efficient management needs greater rewards than in the past if the effectiveness of the means employed is to be assessed.
Last but not least, there is no getting away from the need for closer dovetailing with the other EU policies, in particular the common agricultural policy.
I believe that both targets can be reached through the decentralisation and simplification that Mr Barnier has mentioned.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would firstly like to say that I am in favour of the two reports, which provide us with a good analysis of the application of both the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds in 1999.
On the basis of the analysis contained in these two reports, I would like to refer to three points.
The first is obvious: the cohesion policy comes within European Union policy and a fundamental element of that cohesion policy is the funds which we are discussing here.
The regions which are at a lower level than the European Union average cannot do without these funds, with or without enlargement.
It is therefore inherent to the European Union' s cohesion policy that the least-developed regions of the Union receive funds and resources so that they can try to eliminate the current territorial imbalances.
As has been said, there is still a budgetary margin in the Union which can be used to meet these needs.
The second point is that these reports refer to 1999.
There are a series of criticisms about application, which should be taken into account.
Let us hope that in 2001, thanks to the action of the Commissioner and his team, the restrictions and shortcomings pointed out may be eliminated.
Thirdly, we must bear in mind that the series of statistics analysed and the studies done on the long-term application of the funds in the European Union, with very few exceptions, demonstrate that in the least-favoured regions the level of imbalance in relation to the European Union average has been reduced.
Therefore, since we are talking about the future application of these funds, this must be taken into account in the Union' s new policies in this field.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like all of you, I am very pleased that both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner responsible for territorial policy have agreed firstly that it will be necessary in the future, with enlargement, to have a dual cohesion policy, although it is of a minority nature: the cohesion policy for the regions belonging to the fifteen current Members and the supplementary cohesion policy for the enlargement countries.
I also note that they agreed on an issue which seems to me essential and in no way hypocritical: there can be no political Europe without an economic Europe, there can be no political Europe without a cohesion policy.
That is also the case in the current States, and the European Union must assume these responsibilities in the future.
How can it be done?
How can it be achieved and with what instruments?
We clearly have to improve the current application of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.
We only have to look at the differences between Ireland and Spain, in terms of results over past years, or between Portugal and Italy or Greece, if you will allow me.
The application has been different, and as such Ireland has made extraordinary progress and Portugal has taken better advantage of the Structural Funds than many other States.
This has not been the case with Spain, Italy or Greece, where, while State income has come closer to the Community average, this has not been the case in their internal regions, which indicates that the Funds are being badly applied, possibly because the State has taken advantage of the funds intended for the regions or because the policy of additionality has not been applied in the State.
Mr Barnier, you have said, and you had said previously, that the Structural and Cohesion Funds cannot be below 0.46% of Community GDP.
I would remind you that this is the level they had in 1999 and that in 2006 it will be 0.31%.
If in 1999, in view of the result, we had not managed to eliminate differences between the regions of Europe by means of these Funds, we must therefore be much more ambitious than you are proposing, although you have done so in a very positive way.
Mr President, Commissioner, the question before us is what line our cohesion policy should follow in the new perspective that is opening up with enlargement.
There are two parts to the response: on the one hand, the principles on which cohesion policies are to be based from 2006 onwards must be established and, on the other hand, the priorities must be set.
In my opinion, there are two principles which must underpin cohesion policy: firstly, equal opportunities, and secondly, regionalisation.
Modern economic theory teaches us, with a wealth of detail and supported by considerable empirical evidence, that the success of local development policies is strictly linked to an increase in the power of individuals to take autonomous decisions and to the projects for implementing regional policies which are acceptable to those voters.
In the same way, talking about regionalisation is the same as defining economic policies at local level so that they respect and appreciate the different assets of each region, and so that the local government institutions, subject to monitoring by the electorate making them politically accountable, can take collective decisions backed by genuine democratic support.
The achievement of these goals certainly requires a different type of statistic on the state of the economies, at both local and national and Community level.
Data on per capita income are no longer sufficient to assess individuals' opportunities for access in the European regions; we need much more: we need indicators which measure the degree of access to resources, indicators which measure the level of economic freedoms, which measure the level of fundamental human rights, which measure, in short, the quality of life.
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the cohesion policy is an integral component of the European Union.
The European Union will not make progress in growing together if solidarity does not always play some part.
We all know that those who are stronger and richer must help those who are poorer or not yet as strong or in the process of catching up.
We are talking today about what was to be seen over the last few years and, of course, also about the conclusions we must draw from that for the years to come.
Today, I want to take a look at the current state of our cohesion policy, in other words: how are we spending the money we have allocated to this truly vital EU policy?
Right up to Agenda 2000, we used to have the stormiest debates about how much money was to be spent.
If, though, we now look at how implementation is actually proceeding, we cannot but have grave doubts as to whether this is being taken seriously enough.
The new aid period began last year, so, of course, things cannot move as fast at the outset as they can halfway down the track, but it must be pointed out all the same that implementation is proceeding at a wretched rate in the various fields.
There is simply no other way of putting it. This has been a frequent topic in the Committee on Budgets, and even the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has taken it up and will continue to discuss it.
Looking at current discussions in the context of the Budget consultations - and here I must address my remarks to the Council - we see that the Council has allocated only 1% for next year's new liabilities, and that is then supposed to be converted into payments.
One per cent of all we are prepared to commit, that is supposed to be paid out!
We are producing a backlog, of the sort that we often used to have.
We are piling up funds rather than fast-tracking aid, and fast aid is good aid, because we want many countries and regions no longer to need aid when enlargement actually comes about.
If we really want to help them out of their plight, if we really want to make room for the new countries who want to join us, we must give aid fast and in concentrated form, in other words: there must be appropriate follow-up here.
I call upon the Commission - which has already submitted proposals on this - but also upon the Council, to follow up words with actions, for cohesion is only any good as and when it actually reaches people, and that needs to be as soon as possible!
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will first address a word of thanks to you, Commissioner, for your lucid words and your declaration that, in the context of economic and social cohesion, both the new problems of the candidates for accession and the continuing problems of the present 15 Member States are being appropriately taken into account in various regions.
Secondly, a word of thanks also for emphasising again that there are no taboos in this discussion.
We are at the beginning of this discussion process and, in this discussion, we should explore in depth all the options for auditing the Structural Funds.
Holding 27 countries together economically and socially is a quite different matter from maintaining the cohesion of 15 of them.
The solid fact is that the accession of 12 new States will substantially increase the disparities in the EU.
On the one hand, the new Member States will have to be given priority, whilst on the other, the present beneficiary countries must not be denied a degree of continuity.
We are well aware that the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Fund can still only be temporary measures and cannot be made part of the patrimony.
However, regions must not lose their Objective 1 status after 2006 solely on the grounds that enlargement has brought an improvement in their relative position and without their having achieved sustainable development.
I see the cohesion policy as being credible only if the financial means are apportioned on the basis of objective criteria applicable to all, with the criteria of national and regional prosperity forming the bases.
The pending review of European regional policy must therefore throw up some solutions, and that is the whole point of the discussion process that is now beginning - to treat on an equal footing the situations both in the new Member States and in the Objective 1 regions of the present Member States.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in view of what one Member said, I believe that this is a very appropriate time to discuss economic and social cohesion.
Let us hope that this notion transcends European borders and is applied to other regions.
This would probably be a solution to many conflicts.
While it is true that this is a good time for the debate, I must also recognise that, at least in my opinion, the responses from the Council and the Commission are unsatisfactory.
Firstly, I find it difficult to believe that we can talk about social and economic cohesion without making the least reference to the single market and all the policies of the European Union.
We are currently negotiating the Sixth Framework Programme, a programme which from the outset does not fulfil the cohesive conditions required of it by the Treaties.
Economic and social cohesion demands that we take it into account in all our policies.
Mr President, Mr Barnier asked this Parliament certain questions in this report.
When we asked the Council these same questions, it indicated that this was not the appropriate time to answer them, but Parliament has the right to ask the Commission and the Council these questions so that we might know their opinion, before producing our report.
I profoundly and fundamentally disagree with the Council' s attitude, and to a lesser extent with that of the Commissioner, because I believe that certain fundamental issues must be clarified immediately.
We are talking about how the 2006 project is going to affect various regions in the future.
If we do not do so we will constantly be talking in theory about this issue and we will never bring about the reform necessary for economic and social cohesion in Europe, because we will be looking askance at one another: some of us talking about how we have to remove the Cohesion Fund, others saying that certain regions have to leave it.
This confusion will prevent us from getting down to a thorough analysis of the issue.
Mr President, honourable Members, as we all know, the European Union considers that economic and social cohesion between the regions is quintessential to life and has quantified this objective by setting a minimum cohesion target of 75% of the average per capita income of the 15 Member States.
At the same time, and quite rightly too, our European Union has decided to integrate new Member States whose per capita income is demonstrably lower.
Is it logical, is it ethical and, hence, is it acceptable in the final analysis for the second objective to be achieved at the expense of the first? By which I mean that enlargement will reduce the new average per capita income considerably.
The upside, of course, is that at least everyone realises that cohesion policy cannot continue with blinkers on as regards the 75% target and hence various scenarios have been proposed and are being debated, scenarios which may provide a way out but which are not a fair solution.
It therefore makes sense, it is obvious in my book, to retain the first objective even for the enlarged European Union. In other words, all Member States, old and new, must exceed 75% of the average per capita income of the present 15 Member States.
That would be consistent.
Naturally enlargement will need more money than it appears to have.
So those who need to should take a realistic view of the new situation, they should approach it with an open mind, they should take a long-term view of the cost-benefit ratio of a revised, ambitious regional policy and they should not disappoint regions which continue to require help from Europe, from the Europe of their dreams, the Europe they believe in.
We must realise, as did Demosthenes, one of the great figures of ancient Greece, when he said in ancient Greek, "... money, without it nothing we need to do can be done."
And if the decisions have already been taken, well decisions are made to be revised.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Marques and Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n pointed out in their respective reports, the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds are of fundamental importance to the development of most EU regions, both in terms of infrastructures and from the point of view of social integration.
The fact remains that, despite the budgetary aid granted, European regions are far from being on an equal footing in terms of development. My colleague Mr Fruteau is especially concerned about the outermost regions.
You will therefore understand that this current context of enlargement makes me fear that the European Union has its attention exclusively focused towards the East, which would be disastrous for a good number of European regions that are current beneficiaries.
Please understand me: I am not trying to call into question the pertinence of enlargement, which, of course, means the consolidation of peace on our continent, which in these difficult times, is a noble and fragile objective.
On the contrary, I am thinking about the conditions in which it can succeed.
I am, in fact, one of those who think that the success of enlargement will be the result of the strengthening of cohesion.
But this cohesion has a price that should not be paid by the EU' s poorest countries.
In concrete terms, Commissioner, I hope that the eligibility criteria of Objectives 1 and 2 will be very carefully revised in order that the poverty of some does not lead to the end of hope and the impoverishment of others.
Enlargement is a great challenge.
It is one of solidarity.
It will not be surmounted unless it is understood and accepted.
Let us not forget this fact.
Mr President, the statements we have heard from the Council and from Commissioner Barnier and the speeches of all the Members have confirmed without a shadow of a doubt that cohesion policies are one of the fundamental pillars of the Union and that enlargement requires us not only to continue to pursue these policies but also to consolidate them.
However, I feel that the crucial issues are different and I will list some of them.
Firstly, are the instruments we have used in recent years to regulate what are becoming increasingly marked imbalances still sufficiently up-to-date?
Can generic indicators such as the GDP or simplistic percentages such as 75% continue to be the only parameters for clarifying and classifying eligibility?
Is a fictional blanket paradigm in which the same measures are adopted across the board for subjects and contexts which are only similar in terms of statistics, still viable?
Secondly, do the key principles of subsidiarity and additionality have the same meaning today as they had 20 years ago, when the European Union had a different institutional system?
Is the idea, put forward in recent days by Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Italian Prime Minister, of far-reaching innovation leaving the European Commission power over major strategic investments and decentralising regional development actions really so unrealistic and impossible?
It is my genuine hope that the participants in the debate held over the forthcoming months will have the courage to address these issues as well.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, cohesion is a fundamental pillar of the European Union.
In fact, there can be no political cohesion in the European Union without economic and social cohesion, despite what some of the federalists may think.
On the other hand, however, there can be no economic and social cohesion without political cohesion, as hard as this may be for some nationalists to swallow.
Cohesion policy, which has played a key role in recent years, will have an even more crucial role to play in future, as a result of enlargement. Cohesion policy is really a prerequisite for enlargement' s success.
This goes without saying.
Nevertheless, Mr President, there are certain paradoxes inherent in enlargement: by making the European Union poorer in terms of average per capita income, we will be making the countries that are currently the least favoured richer as if by some form of numerical magic.
This is a problem.
What my country, Portugal, and other cohesion countries cannot accept is, as a consequence of enlargement, being relegated to the margins of cohesion policy and becoming the victims of the statistical machinery that automatically places them over the critical threshold of 75%.
With this in mind, I feel that future cohesion policy must not stray from the following principles:
firstly: increasing the budgetary resources earmarked for cohesion; we cannot evade this issue, despite what Mr Walter has said;
secondly, guaranteeing that the interests of the current least favoured regions and countries are not touched and that a fair method will be found so that they continue to benefit from the level of support they receive today;
thirdly: a thorough reform of the common agricultural policy and greater protection of the rural world;
fourthly: the definition and implementation of a development strategy for Europe that relieves the congestion from current urban centres, which are dense and concentrated, to the benefit of the whole of Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate has essentially been an exploratory and orientation debate concerned with future developments in structural and cohesion policy, as you expected.
I listened to it very carefully.
We will, of course, take good account of the observations you have made.
However, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on this occasion I am going to limit myself to just this brief reaction.
Mr President, like Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, I also listened very carefully to the observations made during the debate, which will be of no great surprise to you.
Personally, I myself had hoped, at this stage, at the very start of the debate, for a great deal of frankness, criticisms, as I said earlier, and suggestions.
All the same, if you would allow me, I would like to say that I was disappointed by the remarks made by Mr Simpson earlier.
I think they are particularly unfair.
In a different way, Mr Izquierdo Collado has also shown a degree of impatience.
With this in mind, I would ask each one of you, however, to be fair to the Commission.
Since Mr Simpson wanted us to hark back to the past, by citing the name of a woman for whom I have a great deal of respect and friendship, my predecessor Mrs Wulf-Matthis, I would like to remind you of the timetable of the previous debate on the Berlin agenda.
The forum that opened the debate for the Berlin agenda took place in 1996 for a 1999 European Council meeting opening the 2000-2006 agenda.
Three years beforehand!
If I had worked to the same timetable, it is not in January 2001 that I would have set the date for the start of the debate, it would be in two years time, in 2003.
You cannot seriously be telling me today that the Commission is not aggressive enough, that you are waiting for us to make proposals.
We are opening this debate two years early without taboos, without waiting for enlargement to have taken place.
Once more, therefore, I would ask you to be fair with the Commission, and, when the time is right, after I have listened to you, listened to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the regions themselves and the Member States, you can count on me to show how bold I can be, how aggressive I can be if I have to, and to make tough proposals.
But do not ask me today to conclude a debate that has only just started, two years in advance in relation to normal procedures.
I have shown transparency.
I have shown openness with the European Parliament.
And I find it quite unfair that you have come here today to reproach me.
Having said this, I would like to say to President Hatzidakis, to Mrs Schroedter, to Mr Duin, to Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm and to Mr Markov, who have, if I have understood them correctly, insisted more in their speeches on current management, that I agree with many of their remarks, to their calls for better take-up, the respect of commitments, the concern for true partnership in the regions.
And I am, with the Directorate-General team, extremely concerned to ensure that the words found in the regulations - partnership, good take-up, rigour, parity, as well as others -become reality.
In a few days time I shall appear, President Hatzidakis, before your Committee to tell you where we stand on 1994-1999 and on the subject of take-up that I hope is now finalised for the previous period, where there were still funds that were not used before 1994, and also to raise the alarm on the implementation of commitments and the first take-up of appropriations in the current period.
I will make a very clear and very objective point to the Committee on Regional Policy.
Mr Markov has once again raised the issue of border regions.
I recognise, Mr Markov, that the response we gave with Mr Verheugen is not entirely satisfactory in relation to the problems of border regions, but once more in this particular case, do not ask me today for more than I can give, for we work within a framework of which you are well aware, which you have approved, which is the Berlin framework.
I have my own financial framework, which I cannot deviate from.
I shall use all the margins of flexibility and manoeuvre possible, but I am, until 2006, obliged to work within the Berlin framework, and I cannot deviate from this.
Mr Pohjamo, and others, brought up the subject of the financing of enlargement.
Mr Pohjamo, I have to tell you that it is not for the Commission to make decisions on this matter.
It is for the Council, the Council of Heads of State and Government in 2006, based on the proposals we make, and whilst we are on this subject I would like to say, as I could have said later to Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, Mr Walter, Mr Mastorakis and Mr Pittella, who talked about the aims and values of the EU as set out in this cohesion policy, I would like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that in 2006 we will only make the right financial decisions if we first have a true and worthwhile political debate and if, naturally, within the framework of this debate and after this debate, the Commission, playing its proper role, puts forward proposals that are courageous and strong willed.
You can count on myself, Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Fischler to put forward the positions and proposals that will follow whilst adapting and reforming cohesion policy.
But allow me to tell you that in order to succeed with this challenge in 2004 or 2005, I need true political debate beforehand.
I need you to provide the proof right here, in your countries and in talking to people about the usefulness of this regional policy, the need for it, its effects.
If we do not provide this proof, then we should fear the ultimate financial decisions when they are made.
I would invite you, therefore, in your political groups, amongst yourselves, between countries and regions, to participate in this debate, to react to the initial course led by the Commission and to make proposals yourselves.
Mrs Raschhofer, you said we need to make reforms.
I do not know if we have understood each other, but the debate is taking place for that reason and I am hoping that it will pave the way for reforms.
In your speech, you used a word that I cannot ignore, because we must be very careful with the words we use.
You talked about fraud.
Personally, I am extremely strict.
I am also ruthless on this question of rigour in the management of Structural Funds.
There are probably errors.
There are probably delays.
There are often irregularities.
But I have not observed in the reports from the Court of Auditors and the Parliament' s own Committee on Budgets and Committee on Budgetary Control, that they have revealed many cases of fraud in relation to the management of Structural Funds.
As for errors, delays or irregularities, we will progressively reduce these by taking the attitude I have just pointed out.
Mr Jarzembowski has himself also started to participate in this debate, which I thank him for.
So that there is no misunderstanding, when I mentioned the territorial dimension of the future policy, you will also see, Mr Jarzembowski, that in the cohesion report, I pointed out the title 'Unity, solidarity, diversity for Europe, its people and its territory' This is perhaps an idea that we can incorporate into the new and future Objective II policy, if there is still an Objective II policy, as I hope there is, that rather than creating a bit of bureaucracy, a bit of zoning, we should decentralise this policy using several European priorities we shall choose together.
For each of these priorities, there could be a financial instrument in service, several financial instruments for the various major objectives that you have hoped and prayed for: assisting regions that have long-lasting natural handicaps, assisting urban policy, assisting cross-border cooperation.
These are a few examples of territorial objectives.
We can also find thematic goals such as the information society.
Mr Korakas, you also called for more confidence and regionalisation.
I agree.
I will make proposals in the new 2004 agenda for increased simplification and regionalisation, but, for me, the limit is to not permit the unravelling or the dismantling of this Cohesion policy which is one of the great and one of the strongest Community policies at the heart of European solidarity.
Mr Berend, like others, has made a criticism, which I accept or at least understand, on the current criteria for per capita GDP.
I am open to this type of criticism.
But I would like to say that up to this point the criterion seemed the most fair and the most objective to me.
It is accepted by all Member States.
We have reliable statistics from the instruments we have been supplied with.
And before this is changed, we should think hard so as to be as fair and as objective as we are with this criterion of per capita GDP.
Mrs Darras, let me make it clear that when the time is right, I will put forward a regional and cohesion policy that will involve all EU countries.
Naturally, we shall concentrate, as we have today, on the poorest regions and countries, for this is the true meaning of cohesion, created so that we can opt out of such a scheme when we are successful.
I am not at all of the opinion that I should create a policy that would ignore other regions that have fewer difficulties but have specific projects and problems all the same, sometimes areas where there is much poverty.
I will therefore, when the time is right, propose a policy that will involve, with different degrees of intensity depending on the level of development, all regions in Europe and all countries in Europe, while endeavouring - I am responding here to Mr. Lage - to treat all of these regions even-handedly, in particular so as to avoid, Mr Lage, the mechanical effect that I myself raised in the cohesion report and the statistical effect that could, if applied without due care and attention, penalise regions currently within the EU.
Mr President, I would like to make a short personal statement in relation to the Commissioner' s comment, which I think was inappropriate and particularly unworthy of a Commissioner who normally deals with Parliament and each of its Members in an excellent way.
Perhaps there has been a misunderstanding.
All I have done, Commissioner, is ask you the same question that you asked Parliament.
You cannot therefore tell me that I am being impatient.
In January, in the second report on cohesion, you asked Parliament which of the four criteria it thought we should adopt.
Parliament asks the same of the Council and the Commission.
Secondly, Commissioner, we have enlargement to deal with.
We are talking about another time and another era.
I would like you to know, therefore, that all my comments have been made in a constructive spirit, not only today, but for many years, while fighting for cohesion in this Parliament.
Mr President, it is intolerable that people should embark on another debate when the speaking time has expired and the Commissioner has spoken.
I would ask you to prevent this in future, otherwise I too would like to speak for another two minutes.
As it is, I can only say that the Commissioner has replied very well to all our questions and that we are very grateful to him.
The debate is closed.
Cohesion Fund (1999) - Structural Funds (1999)
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism:
A5-0248/2001 by Mr Marques, on the Commission' s annual report on the Cohesion Fund 1999 [COM(2000) 822 - C5-0109/2001 - 2001/2058(COS)];
A5-0247/2001 by Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, on the Commission' s 11th annual report on the Structural Funds (1999) [COM(2000) 698 - C5-0108/2001 - 2001/2057(COS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission report dealing with the activities of the Cohesion Fund in 1999 proves that, as in previous years, it is continuing to pursue the most immediate objectives for which it was created, which are to provide the so-called cohesion countries, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland, with economic infrastructures in the areas of the environment and transport.
In these two areas, for example, the Cohesion Fund has been crucial to the creation of infrastructures that are essential to the development of my region.
Only in 1999, it funded the extension of Madeira' s airport and a major solid waste treatment plant.
We have further grounds to be satisfied with the activity of the Cohesion Fund in 1999.
The physical and the financial execution of the projects that have been supported, the distribution of appropriations between the environment and transport, compliance with Community environmental legislation and the distribution of appropriations by beneficiary countries have all continued to respect the Fund' s operational rules.
Furthermore, no situation involving fraud or duplication of funding between the Cohesion Fund and any other Community fund was uncovered.
Because everything ran to plan in 1999, because this is the last year of the 1993-1999 programming period and because the Commission report provides a broad overview of developments that have taken place during this period, I feel it is more important to focus my speech on the contribution of the Cohesion Fund to achieving economic and social cohesion, of which it is a fundamental instrument.
It should be pointed out, incidentally, that the principle of solidarity, a real pillar of the project of European integration, has seen better days, specifically as a result of the two duplications of financial resources granted to structural policies in 1986 and 1992, whose aim was to enable the cohesion countries to better cope with the pressures unleashed by the huge internal market and by Economic and Monetary Union.
In June 1999, however, when the Heads of State and Government had to decide at the Berlin Summit on the Structural Funds to be allocated for the 2000-2006 period under what came to be known as Agenda 2000, there were no further duplications.
There was even a visible decrease.
It was at that Summit that national self-interest supplanted the European interest of a more cohesive and balanced Europe, which had such tireless champions in Jacques Delors and Helmut Kohl.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, however, the proximity of enlargement and the need to correct the enormous regional imbalances we will see as a consequence make it imperative that we give new impetus to economic and social cohesion policy.
We are convinced that the Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Michel Barnier are equal to this challenge.
We must also consider the fact that giving new impetus to cohesion policy is necessary, not only to deal with the countries that are expected to join the European Union in the near future, but also, even following enlargement, to maintain the fight against the lack of cohesion that still exists in the current European Union of fifteen countries.
As a matter of fact, regional disparities within the current Europe of fifteen could even increase as a result of the pressures produced by the enlargement process, specifically in the relationships between countries on the periphery of the Union and those at its centre.
In other words, countries such as Portugal, for example, may become more peripheral and the current centre, which includes London, Paris and such places, may be increased even further because it will become the centre of a Europe that is economically integrated from the west almost to the eastern border. We must remember that excessive regional imbalances constitute an economic and political threat to the European Union.
They are an economic threat because, unless we are able to take full and more efficient advantage of the resources of the most depressed regions, the entire European Union will lose out. They are a political threat because the European Union cannot succeed if it is underpinned by stark territorial and social inequalities.
Europe must have cohesion or it will not work.
Not enabling Europe to work is the great risk that we would run if we went ahead with the totally unacceptable idea of renationalising cohesion policies.
We therefore feel that the creation of the Cohesion Fund by the Treaty of Maastricht has been fully justified. This is, as a matter of fact, clearly demonstrated by the balance of the first operational period of the Cohesion Fund between 1993 and 1999.
The Cohesion Fund, we can now say, has been a major factor for real convergence, and has provided a strong incentive for the beneficiary countries to comply with the nominal convergence criteria laid down at Maastricht.
We must, therefore, oppose any attempt to abolish the Cohesion Fund.
We must also draw the lessons of this first period of operation to improve the effectiveness of the Cohesion Fund even further.
Mr President, Commissioner, the figures provided by the Commission in its 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds - confirmed by the Second Report on economic and social cohesion - show that, despite the budgetary effort made in the 1994-1999 period, the considerable social and territorial inequalities that existed prior to 1994 still remain. The major initial regional differences have remained the same or have increased.
Proof of this is the fact that the average per capita income of the 10% of the population that lives in the most prosperous regions of the Union is still 2.6 times higher than that of the 10% of the population living in the least-developed regions. Territorial inequalities that existed within certain States that have Objective 1 regions, such as Italy, Spain and Greece are also still very much in evidence.
In contrast with this situation, we have seen a strengthening in recent years of the area between London, Paris and Hamburg.
This is a huge central region, which accounts for only a seventh of Europe' s surface area, but for one-third of its population and which enjoys almost one-half of its total income, in a concentration of cities and employment that threatens the sustainable development of the European Union.
Unfortunately, nothing suggests that these trends are likely to change over the next few years.
The budgetary forecasts approved in Agenda 2000 for the present period are extremely restrictive, which means that, whereas in 1999 the percentage of the European Union' s GDP dedicated to cohesion policy reached 0.46%, in 2006 it will not exceed 0.31%, a return to 1994 levels.
These figures are extremely worrying.
Furthermore, one need only look at the experience of German reunification to understand that, if we do not do everything that we can to remedy the situation, the problem will get worse when the enlargement States join the Union.
Given these circumstances, we must be aware that when we talk about Structural Funds policy, we are not dealing with 'just another' EU problem.
On the contrary, we are talking about a fundamental issue, in that the direction of political Europe depends to a large extent on positive developments in cohesion policy both with regard to Objective 1 territories in the current EU that still need it and to the new Member States that will require budgetary funds that must not be additional or supplementary funds.
Unless this is precisely the decision we take, we will see the unacceptable paradox of the much-needed cohesion policy for the new States being paid for with money taken from the budget that is today earmarked for the least developed countries of the Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow the European Union to take a step backwards in territorial and social development policy.
Political Europe would not be what it is today without cohesion policy and it would be hypocritical and irresponsible to call for the one whilst refusing to provide the economic resources to make the other possible.
In this context, I think that we cannot delay taking a decision that will ensure an increase in the Union' s budget for the next programming period that is considerably higher than 1.27% of the Community GDP.
Mr President, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities sees the European Commission's initiative to mainstream action to support equal opportunities between men and women as an important element in this report.
This initiative has a political and a symbolic side.
It highlights the fact that equality between the sexes is a necessary dimension of our endeavour to achieve economic development with social and regional cohesion.
However, our committee is disappointed that this presentation is regionally based and does not contain accurate data which allow us to assess both women's access to Structural Funds and the impact of Community initiatives on promoting equal opportunities.
Under the new regulation which applies to the 2000-2006 programming period, mainstreaming equal opportunities for women and men is a priority aim and the Member States are obliged to conduct an ex ante evaluation of their programmes from the point of view of gender equality using indicators and statistics.
We should take this opportunity to stress that indicators and statistics need to be broken down by gender, something which the European Parliament has called for repeatedly.
However, we should also stress that we are calling on the European Commission to ensure that the principle of gender equality is duly taken into account and that statistics are kept - not just during programming but throughout the whole monitoring and intervention procedure - on the increase in female employment, the provision of quality, viable new jobs and the creation of infrastructures which allow family and working life to be reconciled.
And, finally, we want to stress the importance of coordinated action between the European Commission and the Member States on informing regional agencies and all entitled beneficiaries of the possibilities of implementing equal opportunities through Structural Fund measures.
.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, 1999 was the last year of the first operating period of the Cohesion Fund, which was created by the Treaty of Maastricht.
It was a fully justified and important instrument, not only of economic and social cohesion, but also of support for the countries which had the greatest difficulties in fulfilling the stability and convergence programmes which lead to the introduction of the single currency.
That fund has been an important factor in terms of real convergence and a strong incentive for compliance with the Maastricht criteria.
Aid has been directed towards the creation of infrastructure, transport and environmental projects.
99% of the aid envisaged was granted, which is rather a shame, since 100% should have been achieved, although that was almost achieved at the end of the period being analysed, that is, in 1999.
The recent reform of the Structural Funds is adequate to significantly simplify the planning, implementation and funding of the interventions and the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has asked for the interventions to involve better assistance for national administrations.
We feel it will be very important in the future to consider a breakdown by gender, which would permit specific actions aimed at the promotion of women.
The financial contribution is lower than that contained in the proposal of the Commission and the European Parliament.
It is regrettable that this will hinder the achievement of the employment objectives, particularly in view of the fact that all the Member States and European institutions are committed to decisive action in favour of employment, agreed at the Lisbon Summit.
It is a positive thing to include amongst the objectives the achievement of equality between men and women in employment programmes, since it is one of the fields in which women clearly participate less than men.
It is therefore satisfactory that the Commission has decided, in accordance with Articles 2 and 141 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the future to integrate gender into all Community policies and actions with a view to adopting horizontal positive action measures.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of annual reports is to carry out analyses over a limited period and draw conclusions from them.
This 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds relates to a year which is undoubtedly very important for the development of the European Union's cohesion policies.
My group supports the rapporteur on some of the proposed measures and options to improve the management of the Structural Funds, such as speeding up the implementation of approved measures, concentrating assistance in areas whose development is lagging behind or improving on-the-spot checks to combat what is still a very high level of fraud.
However, we also have some criticisms. We should point out that we do not endorse some of the conclusions drawn by the rapporteur, such as the overly negative assessment of the Structural Fund results during the planning period and the failure to meet the regional policy objective of harmonising living conditions, which has supposedly only been achieved in part.
I would say to the rapporteur that he has adopted the wrong approach to European structural policy, whose task is solely to reduce disparities and which I believe has generally achieved this goal.
In fact, there will always be a discrepancy between living conditions in the rich and poor regions of the EU, and even within Member States.
We are daydreaming if we expect harmonisation from the structural policies.
We should not confuse achievable goals with a wish list here.
My second point of criticism is that despite all the significance of 1999, the 11th Report is an annual report and not a storehouse catalogue in which all the concerns and problems faced by the European Union in the past, present and future have to be rolled out yet again.
If reports are to achieve anything, they must focus on specific priorities, as we all know from our years of practical experience here in Parliament.
This is precisely what this report does not do.
As I said, the rapporteur's conclusions are not necessarily wrong, but much of what is included in the report really does not need to be there.
That is why we believe that some of the points raised in the report need to be amended by the plenary.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports we are discussing confirm some of my concerns regarding the execution of the Structural Funds for the 1993-1999 period but, alas, also regarding the new programming period which will end in 2006.
The most striking example is the vast sum of resources which were not spent during the 1993-1999 period and must be used before 31 December this year.
I feel that it is right and important to send out a clear warning two months or so before the expiry date.
We need enthusiastic commitment but, instead, there are regions and States who are irresponsibly disregarding the impending danger of wasting these funds.
Then there is the fact that it would be useful - so to speak - to learn from the errors and delays which occurred during the 1993-1999 period and avoid repeating them.
Mr Mastorakis has already quoted some Greek to you and I am going to quote some Latin: errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum.
This is a well-known saying but many appear to have forgotten it.
The statistics for the year 2000, with which Commissioner Barnier is familiar, do nothing to allay our fears.
Despite the increasing endeavours of the Commissioner himself, the innovations contained in the reform of the Structural Funds are being incorporated slowly and laboriously.
Parliament must seize this opportunity too to reaffirm its right and responsibility to act.
Parliament, which is the body directly elected by the citizens, cannot remain silent if a fundamental instrument for the development of the Communities and their cohesion is not being properly implemented.
We must therefore work shoulder to shoulder - Commission, Parliament, Council and regional and local players - to bring about rapid acceleration and to finalise the payments to projects which enhance the competitiveness of regions, particularly those which are most disadvantaged and underdeveloped.
We must make it clear to everybody that the quality and size of the expenditure, the profitability of the various objectives and the results achieved by the different beneficiaries will be the crucial factors for defining the European Union' s future cohesion strategy.
Mr President, the first thing that the annual reports on cohesion policy for 1999 point out is that the results have been very poor.
During the eleven and seven years, respectively, which these Community Funds have been operating, the average per capita income in Spain, Greece and Portugal, which in 1988 stood at 68%, has risen to 79% of the European average in 1999.
In other words, it has increased by an average of one point per year.
At this rate, it would take 21 more years for the whole of the European Union to achieve an equal level.
I have serious doubts about the political will to eliminate the differences and the genuine solidarity of the governments of the Union.
And I say this because, as Mr Nogueira has pointed out, in 1999 the Funds of the cohesion policy for 92-99 represented 0.46% of GDP, while those from Agenda 2000 until 2006 will only represent 0.31%, that is to say, they will be reduced by 15 points.
Furthermore, there are some who do not intend to increase their contributions but nevertheless, through these reduced amounts, expect to show solidarity with the new Eastern States which will be part of the enlarged EU.
Mr President, if we are really committed to equal opportunities, solidarity and a genuine united Europe, we must stop being miserly and we must all give more money, especially the richest amongst us, for the benefit of the poorest.
Mr President, there is absolutely no doubt about the major role that has been played by the Cohesion Fund in the development of trans-European networks and in environmental operations in the four beneficiary States, and it is certainly very important for the convergence of the economies of the European Union.
The results achieved, however, are not the same across the board, and it is worth exploring the reasons for this.
In reality, strangely, there are bureaucratic problems and mechanisms which are still poorly defined, particularly as regards the time frames for the disbursement and use of the funds: this applies to the Cohesion Fund, of which all the appropriations for 1999 were not used, and it applies to the Structural Funds, which did not achieve the 100% expenditure target both because the majority of the resources were committed only just before the end of the programming period and because of the slow rate of disbursement of the appropriations available. These factors make the process much more burdensome for those implementing the programmes.
The delays certainly do not contribute to the overall improvement in socio-economic and employment conditions in the regions concerned.
In this sense, a crucial moment for both funds is the evaluation, not just an ex ante analysis but also, most importantly, an ex post evaluation, which is no use if it is not carried out within the correct time frame, the correct time frame being before the programming of the subsequent operations, which cannot be carried out rationally if the final evaluation of the previous programmes cannot be taken into account.
Moreover, the evaluation is necessary in order to verify that the principle of additionality is being respected according to the clear indications of the Court of Auditors, which should be observed.
Linked to this is the point that it would be beneficial if the Commission were to provide clearer, more comprehensive information of an essentially social and economic rather than accounting nature on the evaluation of projects, highlighting whether the aim of reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions has been achieved; the European Parliament needs to receive this information in due time, not - as has happened this time with regard to the Cohesion Fund - two years late, for that clearly makes it impossible to correct shortcomings and reprogramme operations in useful time.
And this is an operation that is becoming still more necessary in view of the now impending enlargement.
Finally, we must demand a more active role for Parliament in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the operations and the goals pursued.
Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that over the years, the Cohesion Fund has helped to make less developed regions within the Union stronger.
However, it would be a mistake to think that we do not need to question the current level of the Cohesion Fund.
The impending accession of a number of new Member States alone would prompt this.
I welcome the fact that Mr Marques has outlined the goals, means and conditions of the Cohesion Fund.
The fund was set up to help Member States meet the convergence criteria with the EMU in mind.
There is no ambiguity in this respect.
The Structural Funds, on the other hand, are designed to help meet other goals.
The accession requires us to evaluate and revise the structural policy, including that of the Cohesion Fund, but in my opinion, not so many changes are required.
It is important, however, for the fund only to be used for the purpose it was intended.
If that is the case, the existing system has many successful years ahead, even following the accession.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, I would briefly like to point out, in relation to the reports that we are currently debating, and as we have seen previously, that we are holding a great debate with an important future in terms of the construction of Europe and also the construction of an enlarged Europe.
We are dealing with Funds which were established at a particular moment when our objectives involved a policy of economic and social cohesion.
On the one hand, this policy has clearly been successful but, on the other, we also see that differences remain, as the reports demonstrate.
Does this mean that this policy has failed?
I would say rather that it means that the policy is not only successful for the cohesion countries, for the poorest regions which are receiving significant aid, but also for other regions, in the wealthy countries, which do not receive the aid.
In the end there is widespread movement throughout Europe and, by means of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, those regions of the richer countries end up benefiting from the aid, because technologies are being bought, because investments are being made by those countries in which technological progress is being made.
That is perhaps the reason why the differences are being maintained, after the large amounts of aid and the great investments which have been carried out through the Cohesion Fund.
We are now facing the problems relating to enlargement.
Does the Cohesion Fund need to be modified?
Will the poorer regions stop receiving it?
