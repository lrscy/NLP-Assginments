In other words, structurally, the document is not integrated.
It does not refer to the economy and it completely ignores industry.
Furthermore, I do not believe that the issue of population is sufficiently dealt with.
The emigrations we have from North to South in Europe are creating stress in terms of sustainable development, just like the African emigrations.
That is something we must deal with, ladies and gentlemen, on the basis of sustainable development.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of the Social Democrats I can say that I agree with the Commissioner that we must at long last move from words to deeds in the matter of policy on sustainable development.
There needs to be a proper action programme for sustainable development as part of EU policy.
Sustainable development must be genuine and be capable of measuring the principle of penetrability, which relates to all the European Unionâs political goals.
Policy instruments, for their part, need to adapt to these goals.
So it is unacceptable that projects that harm the environment should at present be supported with massive amounts of money, considering how aid is channelled for projects that improve the environment.
The decisions already taken should also be implemented.
The Council decided years ago now that aid that harms the environment should be gradually withdrawn. That has not happened, neither gradually nor in any other way.
EU-wide environmental taxes have also been talked about in several contexts.
We know that their introduction will require consensus, but we need a step forward in the right direction.
The Council has also taken decisions that Europe-wide energy taxes should be introduced.
The Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which the Council and Parliament adopted in the codecision procedure, will provide an opportunity for the introduction of Europe-wide environmental taxes.
A condition of a genuine environmental policy is that the economic policy instruments in legislation and other legislative acts go hand in hand.
In this way a favourable situation can be achieved, in which society develops eco-efficiency and environmentally friendlier technologies in an economically rational way.
In this respect, we are coming to a crossroads as far as the Lisbon Strategy is concerned, which is to say that the environment is also a good thing for the economy, and its development is a means of getting the wheels of the economy turning.
Â Â  Mr President, the renewal of the Sustainable Development Strategy is very welcome, but it must become more focused.
The need to have better coordination with other cross-cutting strategies like Lisbon is well established, but we also need to have better coordination within the sustainable development strategy itself.
We need to think clearly and recognise that some of our sustainable development policies could potentially conflict with others.
For example, we are committed to a European target for biofuels and I very much support this, but the sustainable development strategy also includes a commitment to sustainable forest management and to halting the loss of biodiversity.
A badly thought-through expansion of biofuels could result in virgin forests being destroyed and habitats lost.
A properly thought-through biofuels policy would mean European vehicles running on biofuels from certified sources only.
So I would beg the Presidency in this regard simply to use the strategy as a starting point for much more detailed work on sustainability.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we have only borrowed the earth from our descendants.
We all know that any form of politics that lacks responsibility towards this principle imposes a hurdle on the next generation that cannot be overcome.
Jacques Delors declared as early as 1993 that in order to meet future challenges the European Union has the urgent task of restructuring the economy in a way that is ecologically and socially fair, and of orienting it towards a sustainable strategy; MrÂ PrÃ¶ll has confirmed this once again.
Jacques Delors stated that, essentially, models of development must be achieved that are based on low consumption of non-renewable resources and that are reproducible in the long term.
In 2001, the Swedish Presidency responded to these findings with the Gothenburg Strategy.
Now, five years later, we see that the new Commission has chosen to ignore all of these findings that are so important to our survival.
Instead, it has returned to completely outdated notions.
This is evident from resolutions in which unimpeded growth is invoked as being the key to solving all the problems of today, while the third dimension - the preservation of ecological foundations - is no longer mentioned and the necessary balance between three dimensions is negated.
The earmarking catalogue in the regulation on the Structural Funds includes, for example, a total variable of 71 for the environmental dimension.
The Commissionâs new slogan, that the Lisbon Strategy must be pursued in the direction of unimpeded growth, is simply wrong, because it is short-sighted, it lacks solidarity and it is irresponsible, because acting in this way shifts incalculable costs onto the next generation.
We are glad that the Council does not take this line, and we welcome the Austrian Presidencyâs new strategic approach.
We hope that this will be adopted in the next few days and that it will genuinely be implemented in terms of concrete political action.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the website on sustainable development that was started by the Commission on the 30Â May is well-meant and very interesting - the same goes for the two other websites on climate change and climate control - but that does not lessen my criticism of this Commission communication.
It does not contain a Sustainable Development Strategy, but a catalogue of measures introduced, individual problems and intentions.
In taking this view I simultaneously endorse the main criticism expressed by the Social Platform.
I also agree with this network that the cardinal problem here is the definition of political priorities.
However, I would like to go even further and say that sustainable development is the democratic realisation of a social model, one in which each and every person can live independently and with dignity.
In my view, sustainability means that on the ground, in Europe and around the world, more and more people increasingly have access to the conditions that are necessary to ensure peace, protection from violence, democracy, social security, unspoiled nature, education and culture.
The Sustainable Development Strategy must therefore set out three priorities: the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals; the combating of poverty and social exclusion in the EU; and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and global warming. That means disarming, demilitarising and democratising economic relations and our societies as well as redistributing and redirecting flows of resources through structural change, restructuring the energy economy and of course reorganising the social division of labour.
Â Â  . Mr President, these questions show the European social model in flashing lights.
However, the European social model is a mishmash that pleases no one: a bit of free market here and a bit of welfare state there, mixed with a little green posturing.
The EU dictates that one size fits all and, judging by the identical wording of these group questions, one size does appear to fit all.
However, in the Independence and Democracy Group, we realise that one size will never fit all.
I am free to say that my party, UKIP, can never support the Lisbon Strategy, because it is the failed strategy of a Commission that has no legal right to dictate economic policy to my country.
It is for this reason that the EU can never impose a sustainable development strategy on Britain.
There is, however, a PPE-DE one-sizing problem.
Last September, David Cameron was quoted in the as âfighting to end the EUâs damaging social roleâ and leaving it to focus on âmaking the single market work properlyâ.
Yet we now have a Tory MEP, Mr Bowis, asking how the EU will enhance its social role in economic policy.
No wonder Mr Cameronâs pledge to leave the PPE-DE Group has become such a huge joke.
Or, as I always say, âEU must be jokingâ.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
It will be essential to make the management of the new development instruments consistent with the Lisbon Strategy by providing for short-, medium- and long-term planning in order to achieve the objectives that have been set, namely efficiency, effectiveness and economy, focusing particularly on growth but without forgetting environmental protection.
In our opinion, Europeâs sustainable development policies have a vitally important role to play abroad, especially in developing countries, since in many cases it is precisely in those countries, where, unfortunately, there are no economic alternatives as yet, that the indiscriminate exploitation of resources occurs.
The new policies must therefore be based on a feasible project for sustainable development that all peoples in the world can enjoy without distinction.
For the worldâs sake, Europeâs institutions need to send out signals of political convergence based at last on solidarity and aiming at reducing the indiscriminate exploitation of non-renewable resources.
At the same time they need to commit themselves to promoting research and development in the field of environmentally sound technologies.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, when the Lisbon Strategy was reviewed, you decided to keep it separate from the sustainable development strategy. I think that this was a mistake.
These two tools are more than complementary; they are inseparable from one another.
That is why, at present, the impression created is of your adopting an ideological stance without taking action.
It cannot credibly be proclaimed that sustainable development is one of the three pillars of the Lisbon Strategy unless the necessary bridging clauses are created.
As for the content of the action platform presented after considerable delay by the Commission, I have to say that I was disappointed in it.
We were expecting more substance and more proposals.
Sustainable development now sounds hollow.
Commissioner, I may be somewhat jumping the gun and anticipating our institutional agenda, but your work programme for 2007 will have to take up this challenge.
I would ask you to be firmer, more incisive and more audacious in your dealings with the Council.
Yes, the Commission must be audacious and courageous, as it is not being at present.
It forever censors itself, confronted as it is with a paralysed Council that has nothing more than good intentions, never translated into action.
Where energy is concerned, it should be emphasised that nuclear energy is no longer taboo, but it must be accompanied by renewable sources of energy.
When it comes to biofuels, Member States â in particular, France and Sweden - are known to be working on these, but on different systems.
What has become of harmonisation?
No progress is being made.
Where are the practical proposals?
They are there in peopleâs minds but, unfortunately, that is where they remain.
As for the Council, I am inclined to tell it to rationalise the instruments available to the EU: the Cardiff process on the integration of environmental aspects into other policies, the Gothenburg sustainable development strategy and the recently revised Lisbon Strategy.
Frankly, hand-to-mouth policy needs to take a back seat in favour of visionary policy that considers tomorrow and makes sustainable development a key factor for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, my main problem with the Commissionâs environmental proposals is that they do not correspond with the objectives of the Sixth Environmental Action Plan.
As far as traffic is concerned, the Sixth EAP stressed the decoupling of transport goals and GDP goals.
However, the Commissionâs new strategy does not propose legally binding measures and deadlines.
It is all very well to speak about wanting fewer private cars and more environmentally friendly public transport, but without legally binding measures these are only empty words.
If we want to have less air pollution and more public transport, we have to act.
As the rapporteur on urban environment, I propose legal measures and targets to increase the rate of environmentally friendly transport.
I hope that the Commission and the Council will return to the policy of clear targets and measures.
Listening to Mrs GrossetÃªte, I also hope that the PPE-DE Group will support my amendments and my report about having binding measures and targets concerning the urban environment and traffic.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to rural development.
It is important that we do not lose sight of rural spaces as a whole as an aid to economic development.
This means that in financial respects too we must ensure that sufficient means are available.
Unfortunately the so-called second pillar of rural development for the period 2007 to 2013 has been reduced by EURÂ 20Â billion in comparison with the proposal by Parliament and the Commission, and that reduces possibilities of development.
That is why we must surely make use of the optional modulation system of 20%, I mean by redirecting funding from the first to the second pillar.
We also have to ensure, however, that we give our support to the international development of rural spaces.
In order to do this we need a fund that can be accessed on an international basis for rural development projects, in a similar way to the existing European one.
Only in this way will there be a chance to develop rural spaces as a whole.
Â Â  Mr President, sustainable development is a nice idea.
It has the pleasant aroma of the Norway of DrÂ Brundtland, who invented it 40 years ago.
It is a notion from the good old days, from the Club of Rome, from zero growth.
It is a new version of the old idea of PastorÂ Malthus.
At the banquet of humanity, there is not enough room for all of the generations.
We must therefore restrict ourselves, because the ice is melting, the water is rising, the greenhouse effect is going to suffocate us, the sun is going to burn out and raw materials are going to run out because the Chinese are consuming everything.
In fact, the only thing that is sustainable is under-development.
Look at Africa!
The only sustainable thing is poverty, which is a socially transmitted disease passed on from generation to generation.
Development, on the other hand, is purely provisional.
The stone age did not come to an end because of a lack of stones, but because of the invention of bronze.
The oil age will also come to an end, not because of a lack of oil, but because we will move on to the age of fusion or of hydrogen.
In short, sustainable development is an absurd notion, dreamt up by the rich to explain to the poor that, in order to save humanity in the future, they must go without today.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, sustainable development is something obviously desirable that we all seek.
Who could possibly be opposed to it?
Strategy and approach have great significance for the future prosperity of Europe and the world where these issues are concerned.
They are linked together rather than integrated.
The resolution originated in Gothenburg five years ago and emphasises certain components needed for turning the Sustainable Development Strategy into a reality.
More emphasis could have been placed on the way in which strong economic development can increase the opportunities for creating smart technology.
Innovative environmental solutions too may require investment if they are to be profitable.
The administrative dimension is emphasised to an unnecessary degree in the resolution, which sometimes shows too little appreciation of the realities of the business world.
Most of the resolution can be implemented, but the market perspective should not be lost.
I say this in my capacity as the person appointed by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to take responsibility for this issue in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
When the leitmotif of the resolution was the merger of the Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy, we had difficulty voting for it, but we now think that there is an acceptable compromise.
We are not opposed to the strategy.
On the contrary, we unreservedly support sustainable development in trade and industry, environmental work and society in general.
We cannot, however, encourage a merger of the Lisbon and sustainability strategies right now, since the former, unlike the latter, is already in use.
We are not, however, closing the door to such a merger for ever.
Following the review that has now been carried out, we think that the resolution has acquired a tone that we can, in general, support.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great satisfaction that I note that the motion for a resolution recognises that growth and sustainable development are not opposites but, on the contrary, preconditions of each other.
Sustainable growth is the only growth we can afford.
The fact that the motion for a resolution extends sustainability to include areas in addition to the environment also constitutes great progress.
The environmental and social dimensions should be integrated into our understanding of sustainability as elements of equal value.
In that connection I should like to emphasise that sustainable development also involves equality between the sexes.
Women at present earn less than men throughout Europe and are not represented in decision-making bodies to the same degree as men â be it in political, economic or public life.
Any strategy on sustainable development must take account of this inequality and of the fact that social problems affect men and women in different ways.
The common goals of both the Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy cannot be achieved unless the issues of inequality and of the better use of both menâs and womenâs potential are addressed.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we all know that it is no longer a time for lamenting the consequences of our mistakes.
The world ecological crisis is hitting us full in the face and I will not list the problems arising within this context.
We here are well aware, more than anyone else I am sure, how urgent it is to act and to make courageous and wide-ranging political choices.
And what are we seeing, since this is what is important?
That the Commission and the Member States use and abuse the rhetoric on sustainable development, sometimes cynically, to justify non-sustainable policies.
I shall take the example of biodiversity, the common theme of our very survival, as you know very well, MrÂ PrÃ¶ll.
Since we have waged a real battle here to obtain budgets for biodiversity in the financial perspective, since we have said that the Natura 2000 programme would be taken into account in the Structural Funds, an argument used to justify not creating a new budget line, could you tell us âÂ and this question is for the Commission, which is not listeningÂ â why biodiversity has not been included amongst the priorities of FEDER and why biodiversity has not been provided with any budgetary contribution?
I would therefore really like to know who is sabotaging sustainable development in these institutions?
And if there is sabotage, how much faith can we have in the strategy that you are presenting to us?
Â Â  Mr President, in connection with the motion for resolution tabled before us, please allow me to say a few words about the relationship between sustainable development and energy economics.
The document rightly points out that energy production and consumption is one of the key factors in achieving sustainability.
We are also right when on this basis we reformulate â like we have done so many times in the past â our goals in respect of increasing energy efficiency, reducing the proportion of greenhouse gases or even supporting renewable energy resources.
At the same time, it is obvious that we are lagging behind significantly in respect of the further development of the sustainable development strategy adopted in 2001 in Gothenburg.
Therefore, it is worth considering why we are in this situation.
I am convinced that one of the important obstacles to achieving our goals may be the lack of an efficient market economy environment.
The motion for resolution encourages us to exchange national experiences, and therefore, if you allow me, I will illustrate this with a Hungarian example.
In Hungary, where the extent of utilisation of renewable energy sources is, unfortunately, one of the lowest in the European Union, the long term operation of polluting energy production facilities is protected by monopolistic situations and contracts that contradict market logic.
As a result of these contracts, coupled with the unpredictable regulations concerning the compulsory electricity acquisition quota of the state, which also contradicts market logic, the utilisation of wind energy, for instance, is rendered practically impossible.
And while this practice is in use, the chances of achieving our goals concerning sustainable development are very slim.
Therefore we need to develop an efficient, competitive and cost effective energy market, because without this, an environmentally sustainable society remains an unattainable dream.
The Gothenburg strategy will only become real if this is achieved.
In this hope I support the motion for resolution, and trust that we will be able to return to this issue when Parliament debates the development of the Common European Energy Policy.
Â Â  Mr President, the Lisbon Strategyâs objectives are mistaken.
We now have growth without jobs, so it is the wrong way to obtain more employment.
We are also aiming at the wrong goals.
With people now earning approximately EURÂ 12Â 000 per year, the link between increased income and greater happiness is ever more tenuous.
Instead, the result is increased stress, more environmental damage, wider social disparities and more injustice.
Sustainable development is not only about the environment.
Achieving it involves, rather, seeing the environment as being inseparably linked to social conditions.
Today, everyone is talking about sustainable development, and tomorrow we are to vote on the Seventh Framework Programme that allocates EURÂ 4Â billion to research into nuclear power.
More money is also going to research into carbon-based energy and to research into other non-sustainable forms of energy.
Why is that the case?
The UN Climate Panel has shown that we can only achieve the Kyoto objectives by halting the subsidies to fossil fuels.
People listening to us are amazed.
Why do we not take the relevant decisions?
It is because the lobbyists from the big companies obtain their cherished short-term growth solutions, which are inimical to sustainable development.
We must listen more to our audience and less to our lobbyists.
Then, we shall obtain sustainable development.
Â Â  â Mr President, since last December the Commission communication and other contemporary publicity channels have been confirming the speed of global changes and the new dangers, as well as the opposing trend towards permanent and balanced three-dimensional development which links economic growth and quality of life with social integration and environmental protection.
Therefore, by proposing the framework of the basic principles of the European Union sustainable development strategy in a manner which supplements the Lisbon Strategy and is divided into six basic sectors, an attempt is being made to integrate sustainability into European policymaking, both in the form of an internal dimension and by including the external repercussions of decisions and choices on the planet as a whole.
Today, we in the European Parliament want our motion for a resolution to exert an effect on decisions by the other institutions.
We are confirming our political and humanitarian sensitivity and our awareness of our responsibilities towards future generations by advocating an effective evaluation of the repercussions on the sustainability of all EU initiatives.
The resolution is clear.
We welcome the Presidency's interest, but we are calling for a single, cohesive and concise framework which will rally public opinion and policy-makers around common aspirations.
We hope that the general objectives will be supplemented by specific, people-orientated measures, which is why we must be sure to define progress indicators to measure the benefits to man as an undeniable and unique value.
Economic prosperity, high living standards and the ecological repercussions from the uniform dissemination of objectives on the potential of the natural world only make sense if they serve present and future citizens.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, at the end of this debate I would like, as a summary, to give an overview of the items and goals that we have tried to coordinate with the Sustainable Development Strategy during our Presidency and on which we now want to reach a decision in the next few days.
I would like to give my very heartfelt thanks for your suggestions and also for the speeches and the debates that we have had here together.
Our aim with the Sustainable Development Strategy has been to put sustainable development for Europe at the top of the political agenda and in doing so to make Europe an example for others.
We have been keeping all the Council configurations busy, and in recent months we have tried very hard to work through the essential points with the European Parliament and now to present them as a strategy.
This strategy is, in our view, the result of very wide-ranging discussions and ambitious negotiations.
Seven key challenges with goals and measures have now been clearly set out in the strategy, and this will enable the European Union to confirm even more clearly our role as a frontrunner in international cases.
The most important chapter is of course - and this will also enable us to measure, to a certain extent, the success of the Sustainable Development Strategy in the coming years - a strong and clearly structured chapter on implementation, which provides for responsibilities and competences regarding the monitoring of progress in implementation and very clearly addresses all EU institutions and political levels, EU-wide, national, local and regional.
I also regard â and we should do this together â the Sustainable Development Strategy as complementary to the Lisbon Strategy.
Both strategies strive, with differing priorities and timescales, towards sustainable development.
We want to demonstrate, too, that quality of life and high levels of environmental quality and social cohesion are important factors in safeguarding long term competitiveness.
Sustainable development is a central factor in innovation: it creates opportunities and the potential for intelligent growth and better jobs.
Sustainable development is anchored in the treaties; it is an overarching objective for all European policies.
It confronts us, however, with huge challenges, above all in institutional terms.
On an EU level we do not yet have appropriate structures with which to discuss this horizontal issue in the corresponding committees or to better coordinate the opinions of different committees.
During the negotiations on the EU Sustainable Development Strategy we finally attempted an ad hoc solution with the 'Friends of the Presidency' group.
At Council level we will be working, until the first review of the strategy, on possible options offering suitable mechanisms for sustainable development.
This institutional question concerns all EU institutions equally, and it would give me great pleasure to encourage a dialogue between institutions, one that goes beyond the decision on the Sustainable Development Strategy.
We regard the Sustainable Development Strategy not, as it were, as the end of the debate on sustainability in Europe, but as an important starting point in conjunction with the Lisbon Strategy in moving towards sustainable development in Europe.
I would like to thank you once again for your very constructive cooperation, not only â I am saying this as the Austrian Presidency of the European Union nears its end â in the field of sustainability, but also for all of the constructive cooperation between the European Parliament and the Presidency.
For me personally and in my areas of competence, discussions have always been very fruitful and successful.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I wish to thank everyone for this very interesting debate. The debate shows that this subject is a central issue for Europe and that it is a priority which the Commission believes can contribute towards improving the quality of life and preserving resources, especially for the benefit of future generations.
It goes towards improving the economic, social and environmental dimensions of our way of life.
The Commissionâs proposal has emphasised and given added relevance to the underpinning principles of our sustainable development policy.
Moreover, we have given ourselves clear objectives with correlative actions to reach these targets.
Concerning the need to be more ambitious, and the call for new targets, I need to underline that the essential thing is to produce results.
Investing in new targets may not be too difficult.
However, it is much harder to get people to make and accept the changes needed to achieve those targets.
We are meeting our existing targets, but the real challenge is to ensure that we do so.
We are therefore proposing a new approach aimed at making the difficult changes across society that are needed for sustainable development.
Having said that, I agree that setting new targets is also important.
However, any new targets need to be established through a proper process involving impact assessments and full stakeholder consultation, so that we have the acceptance and the commitment of those who need to work in order to achieve those targets.
I would also like to say something about the integrated approach frequently mentioned during the course of this debate.
Sustainable development is about a coherent approach to policy-making.
It requires an integrated approach, and in practice this means the Lisbon Strategy working hand-in-hand with the sustainable development strategy â two strategies working in parallel and in coordination towards the overarching objective of sustainable development.
The Commission disagrees with the idea of merging the two strategies, but agrees they should be used in parallel towards achieving the overall goal of sustainable development and that they should be complementary, both in scope and in terms of governance.
The Commission agrees that they can go hand-in-hand, though this does not mean that they have to be integrated.
This can be achieved through sound and effective complementarity between the two, and that is what the Commissionâs communication seeks to achieve.
Concerning governance and monitoring, improving the governance of the European Unionâs sustainable development strategy is key to pushing forward progress.
That is why the proposal for the review of the strategy proposes a new improved governance process.
The Commission will report on progress every two years.
Let me assure you that in doing so it will draw on the full range of sustainable development indicators.
Eurostat has made good progress in developing indicators and this work will continue.
The aim is not to name and shame, but to assess where we are, how much more we need to do, and in which areas, in order to enable us to determine where we need to act and to allow clear communication to electors and stakeholders on where we need to change and on our approach to this.
Concerning the international dimension, sustainable development requires a global approach.
The European Union should maintain its position as a world leader in sustainable development through its action at home and by addressing the effect of this.
It must also engage with others to achieve the commitments made at Johannesburg and the Millennium Development Goals in order, as has been said, to allow developing economies to leapfrog, to avoid old-fashioned unsustainable patterns of development and to use clean and innovative technologies.
This is essential, for example, in the drive to limit climate change. It is also why the global dimension is an integral part of the reviewed European Unionâs sustainable development strategy and why that strategy advocates an integrated approach to development and external policies.
In conclusion, the Commission hopes that the interaction between us in this area can continue and intensify in the months ahead.
Â Â  To wind up the debate, a motion for resolution(1) has been tabled under RuleÂ 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is a statement by the Council and a statement by the Commission on the increase in racist and homophobic violence in Europe.
Â Â  . () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this issue that we are now dealing with in this plenary is one that we consider to be particularly important.
Whenever the security and dignity of a citizen of the European Union is threatened, then we are all threatened.
The credibility of our Union and its principles and institutions are at stake here.
The Union â and this was made very clear in this morningâs debate â is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and basic freedoms and constitutionality.
This is anchored in the founding treaties, and since then it has been restated in numerous institutional agreements and in numerous legal acts.
We must therefore consider acts of racist and homophobic violence as direct provocations, and we must take decisive steps against them.
We must not allow people who are citizens within our own Union to feel like outsiders, and neither can we allow it, if people from other parts of the world who come here have experiences that contradict our values completely.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, the Union has â with directives on equal treatment laid down in the year 2000 â created a set of instruments to prevent or rather to combat discrimination across the Union, whether on account of ethnic background, religion, or of sexual orientation, among others.
On the basis of these two directives, the Community Action Programme to combat discrimination 2001-2006 was set up.
In doing this, the European Union makes it very clear that in dealing with this matter it will not limit itself to passing legal statutes, but will take sweeping measures in order to implement anti-discrimination policies.
You know these measures, I do not need to go into detail here.
I would, though, especially like to emphasise the great significance that we all attach to the activity of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in this context.
For those in positions of political power, its findings provide an important basis for decisions.
Allow me to continue here a point that I already made this morning.
We believe that it would be a fair acknowledgment of these efforts towards equality and against discrimination and racism, if we were to create a fundamental rights agency, a separate agency that tackled these issues.
The concern of this agency would be to ensure that we, in the Member States, in the institutions and in official bodies, observe the rules that we have in the European Union, rules that have become part of the .
This is not about carrying out general human rights investigations and setting ourselves up in competition with other institutions, in particular the Council of Europe.
It is, rather, about the fact that we, as a Union, need an institution with the job of implementing measures that were decided here.
I repeat what I already said this morning, namely that in my opinion this planned human rights agency would fulfil this task.
Civil society â our fellow citizens â wants and needs this agency.
We know that in the field of combating forms of intolerance, below the level of the Union, there are a great number of worthy national initiatives, both public and citizensâ initiatives.
These initiatives are striving to promote awareness, to bring different groups together in order to remove prejudices or, in the case of young people, using educational means to prevent prejudices from ever arising, which I regard as particularly important.
They deserve our full support.
Where we have to recognise, however, that positive initiatives, education and awareness are not enough to stop violence or its precursors â intolerance and incitement â then our Member States must make use of legal proceedings in order to protect their citizens.
The States of the European Union have criminal law procedures that are thoroughly appropriate for dealing with the challenges of racist and intolerant patterns of behaviour.
The Austrian Presidency of the Council believes that a European framework decision on the combating of racism and xenophobia would be an important signal and an important step towards the completion of the relevant European instruments.
Work on such a framework decision began in 2001, although there are still problems, due to the Member Statesâ historically developed criminal law systems.
Work here is difficult, and until now a definite result has not been achieved.
In the light of the serious and dangerous challenge represented by racist and homophobic violence, decisive leadership is needed from those in positions of political power â especially from the Presidency of the Council.
The President-in-Office of the Council, MrsÂ Plassnik, I myself, and other representatives of the Austrian Presidency, have been and are trying to provide this leadership.
Thus on 21 March of this year, on the 40th International Day for the Elimination of Racism, MrsÂ Plassnik declared, among other things, that: âThe worldwide struggle against racism is by no means won â in the EU, too, there is no cause for self-complacency.â
Earlier, on 17Â March, at an event dealing with this very issue, I myself said: âThe contribution of local and regional bodies to the protection of minorities and to measures against discrimination is particularly essential.â
I also drew attention to the situation of the Roma minority, who are unfortunately often targets of discrimination and racist violence in the European Union.
On 5Â May, the national Austrian day against violence and racism, the President-in-Office of the Council commemorated the liberation of Mauthausen concentration camp as well as the people from over 30 European nations who were brought by the Nazis to Mauthausen, where they were degraded, tortured and murdered.
That should remind us where intolerance and racism lead - and this European Union must ensure that it never happens again.
Honourable Members, I would like to give my heartfelt thanks â and also personal thanks, since I have been working on this issue for many years â to this House, for having put such an important item on the agenda; and I would like to assure you that the Council greatly appreciates your dedication in this matter and that it will be working with you hand in hand.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a matter of principle, the Commission opposes all form of racism and xenophobia and will continue to channel all its efforts into the fight against these phenomena, as laid down in the Treaty.
Today more than ever, this task should be a priority at all levels â international, European, national and local.
The Commission is bitterly disappointed that the Member States have yet to adopt the Commissionâs 2001 proposal for a Council Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia.
The aim of this proposal is to ensure that all forms of racism, including racism on religious grounds, are subject to punishment under criminal law in all Member States.
The Commission is once again urging the Council to adopt the proposal without watering down its effectiveness, and is striving to reopen the debate on the proposal, the adoption of which would be a major step forward in combating racist and xenophobic crime.
The Commission hopes that the seminar on the fight against racism and xenophobia, organised together with the Austrian Presidency and the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) and to be held on 20 to 22Â June, will lead to reopening the debate in the Council under the Finnish Presidency.
The Framework Decision is not the Commissionâs only initiative in the fight against racism and xenophobia.
For example, the Commission supports the EUMCâs work by gathering data on the extent and development of racism in the EU.
The fact that the EUMC is becoming a Fundamental Rights Agency will not have a detrimental impact on current activities, given that the fight against racism and xenophobia will remain a fundamental goal of the new agency.
On the contrary, I am convinced that this fight and our efforts will in fact be strengthened.
The Commission is also striving to ensure that the Member States fully and correctly implement the anti-discrimination regulations that have been adopted, and it is heading a series of programmes and initiatives such as the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All (2007), which will contribute towards the fight against racism and xenophobia.
The Commission has undertaken to continue and step up these activities, and it is determined to extend its future efforts in the fight against racism and xenophobia.
The Commission is also firmly opposed to all forms of homophobia. Homophobia runs counter to the principles on which the EU is founded.
It is necessary in this regard to point out that the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms expressly forbids any form of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.
The Commission would like to mention its statement of January 2006 in Parliament.
In the context of its powers, the Commission stands firm in the fight against homophobia.
A key element of that fight is combating discrimination and the EU has already taken steps in that direction, for example with the adoption of Directive 2078/EC.
The Commission is also aware that the legislative measures must be accompanied by further initiatives aimed at effectively combating discriminatory, derogatory, stereotypical and degrading behaviour.
To this end, the Commission is also contributing by means of information campaigns and initiatives such as the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All (2007).
All things considered, the Commission is convinced that the EU, which at its core strives for deeper solidarity between nations, must set an example in the fight against discrimination and must take a lead in the fight against all forms of racism, xenophobia and homophobia.
Ladies and gentlemen, I await your debate with interest.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is founded on a community based on the indivisible and universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity.
By coming together, our countries decided to uphold and to promote these values.
Each political group has decided to table a resolution to follow up the statements we have just heard; I personally have drawn one up on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Almost every day we see evidence that the fight against intolerance is far from won.
I would have preferred to deal with this subject in a different manner.
It is appalling that we still have to point out publicly that racism in our societies is intolerable.
Numerous racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and homophobic attacks have taken place in recent times in our countries, and that is unacceptable and intolerable.
While as citizens we must remain vigilant, as elected representatives we must stand firm and vigorously condemn this behaviour; to stay quiet would be tantamount to accepting it.
We must also adopt laws to protect our fellow citizens â political will is crucial in this area â and countries that have not laid down anti-racist and anti-discrimination laws must do so.
I shall repeat what I said yesterday in this House and what I have been saying for some months in committee.
The Council must immediately stop blocking the framework decision against racism and xenophobia, otherwise fine words and good intentions will serve no purpose.
Our respective governments must offer an example and move forward in this fight for equality, respect for others and tolerance.
As for the current situation, it is unfortunately necessary to point out that we are seeing a rise in far-right parties in many of our countries.
Although I personally am fully committed to this fight, I understand my groupâs reasons for not signing the joint text: this text clings on to ideological positions that have become obsolete.
These countries will not be moved forward along the path of rigorous respect for the Unionâs values by our condemning any particular current situation.
It is unacceptable to confuse individual cases of aggression perpetrated in Member States fighting against racism and homophobia with extreme positions openly adopted by some governments.
We must distinguish between these situations.
It is dangerous to lump everything together.
We must separate this issue from the debate relating to any particular motive.
The fight against racism, xenophobia and homophobia is not a matter for the left or for the right; that is something we must accept.
That is why the joint resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow seems to me to be a balanced compromise.
I shall end by saying that I very much regret that Parliament is reluctant to speak with one voice on this subject.
This is an opportunity missed, since I know that this is a fight that all of us here in Parliament share in.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I was elected into the European Parliament 12 years ago, I would not have thought it possible that we would have to have such a debate yet again.
We were considerably more advanced in Europe then than we are today.
It is an alarm call that, in todayâs European Union, we have to address the question of how we can combat and get to grips with increasing racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and hatred of minorities - whether of an ethnic, religious, or sexual nature.
That is why I, as leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, am making a statement in the name of all of the members of our group.
European social democracy â Christian Democrats in Europe, Conservatives, Liberals, democratic forces on the left and on the right â those who stood at the cradle of the European Union: they knew why there had to be a supranational solution to the conflicts at the end of the first half of the 21st century.
Therefore let us think back once again: what were their motives?
What had caused the European catastrophes of the First as well as the Second World War, but above all, the catastrophes of fascism and Stalinism too?
Hatred of minorities, a racist feeling of superiority, the exclusion of people who did not conform, the disabled, those of different sexual orientation, people who could be stigmatised as enemies, in order to channel general discontent and direct it onto scapegoats, those who came from somewhere else, who took our jobs.
I do not want to repeat all that here, you already know it.
These people with racial madness, religious madness, were the firebrands of the first half of the 20th century.
What, then, have we set up instead?
A solution based on integration, on a community of values and laws, and on basic rights for all: no matter what religion they have or whether they believe in God or not, no matter what race or skin colour they have; no matter where they come from, no matter what convictions they have or do not have, no matter how they wish to live their individual lives, whether on the basis of family, alone or in whatever partnership they choose, that is up to them.
What binds us together is that â in our richness, in our superiority - we can organise a society that says âyesâ to a community in which each person has his or her own place: Catholics and Muslims, Protestants and Jews, black people and white people, heterosexuals and homosexuals, heads of families and those who live alone.
Why should anyone turn race, sexual orientation, or belief into the subject of a political debate at all, except as a means to an end - namely, to succeed in oneâs own political aims by victimising a minority.
That is the most repulsive thing that European history has ever seen, and that is what led to this inhumanity.
We do not direct our criticism at any one country, because unfortunately we have the same phenomenon in all the Member States of the European Union - not only in the new Member States, but in the old ones as well.
The criticism that we are adopting here is not directed against peoples or states; it is directed against the intellectual deficiency of those who propagate such ideologies - no matter where they are in Europe.
They have no place anywhere, not in any society, and, I hope, not in this House either!
Â Â  Mr President, unfortunately this debate is indeed still necessary.
In the resolution you will find a list of names of individual victims, people who were killed only because of the colour of their skin or their sexual orientation.
In the 21st century in Europe that is barbaric and we should be ashamed.
I am, on the other hand, proud to be a Member of this House that stands up against those kinds of barbaric acts.
Intolerance is on the rise everywhere, and my own country is no exception in this regard.
I therefore welcome all the mass demonstrations we have seen all over Europe in favour of tolerance and equality and, most recently, the very successful equality march in Warsaw.
I was very happy to be part of that.
Tolerance, anti-discrimination and equality are not national, internal matters.
If it is anything, the EU is a community of values, and if we are a community of values, then we should be discussing these matters at European level and we will not accept that Member States hide behind the argument of subsidiarity, because that is only a pretext.
As I said in the debate yesterday evening, the EU needs an ambitious strategy to become the world champion of fundamental rights.
We should be just as ambitious in this area as we are when it comes to the economy and things like the Lisbon Strategy.
We do not need to weep crocodile tears: we need action.
We do not need to be timid and reluctant when it comes to intervening in matters that are going on in the Member States.
I am therefore very happy to hear that the Council will speed up the work on the framework decision and the Agency on Fundamental Rights.
I would very personally like to address a word to the President-in-Office and to call for the recognition of gay people as victims of the Nazi regime.
That has been mentioned before in this House.
I am also happy to hear that the Commission is willing to instigate infringement procedures and is considering a horizontal directive.
Finally, we should not hesitate to use an instrument we have at our disposal, namely ArticleÂ 7, in cases where a Member State or a Member State government fails to comply with EU principles.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the strong statements that we have heard from the Council, the Commission and my colleagues in the House, and wish that other politicians would be as clear and as forthright as they have been in their condemnation of racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other hate speech and hate crimes.
As has already been said this afternoon, the list in this resolution is a sad one, but it is not exhaustive.
We could have added the tragic murders of young men in the United Kingdom recently, and it is clear that no EU Member State is free from this hatred.
But I do not think we should be seeking to remove countriesâ names from resolutions.
This week, we took a very brave stance on GuantÃ¡namo; I think we should be doing the same thing when we come to look at what is happening within our own Member States and be absolutely clear that we are not going to tolerate that either.
It is very easy to be brave about third countries; it is much more difficult to be brave, in some respects, about your own, and I think that is a shame.
People on European soil have the right to live free from violence; they have the right to live in peace; and that, I believe, is unequivocal.
The political response of governments and other institutions to racist and homophobic attacks is crucial and sends very strong signals.
It took numerous deaths in the United Kingdom, and one in particular, before our police services realised that they were institutionally racist and set out to change that.
It is still a long, slow struggle but progress is under way.
If we are going to speak out, we also need to be critical of some of our media, which is also determined, it seems to me, to sow hatred rather than information and integrity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the continual homophobic attacks in Europe are a symptom of a crisis in democracy that this Parliament needs to address, above all when they take place in European Union Member States such as Poland.
The far-right Polish Government, which is suppressing the civil rights of the homosexual community, needs to realise that such conduct is incompatible with membership of the European Union.
The recent gay pride march in Warsaw was only authorised because of pressure from Europe.
Poland must understand that, if homophobic attacks continue, my group will not hesitate to call for possible political sanctions for breach of ArticleÂ 7 of the Treaty on European Union and of the fundamental democratic principles of the Union.
It is also crucial that the 2001 framework decision on racism and xenophobia be extended also to cover the crime of homophobia, a legal category that already exists in France and Belgium.
I am disconcerted by the Austrian Presidencyâs failure to move on these issues and I wonder whether it may not be due to the fact that MrÂ Haiderâs neo-fascist party forms part of the government in Vienna.
I challenge the Council, which is present here today, to say something in that regard.
I therefore hope that the Finnish Presidency will inject some civilised attitudes into this Europe that has fallen prey to dangerous new fiends.
Â Â  . Mr President, justice requires reason and prudence.
So while racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and dislike of Muslims or Christians are lamentable facts of life in certain European countries, we have to be very careful when comparing and generalising these phenomena in the course of political debate.
Otherwise, we may achieve the opposite of what we intended and contribute to aggravating rather than calming the conflict.
The motion for a resolution on racism and homophobia contains too many contradictions and unjustified generalisations and this can have just such an effect.
It is not right to throw racism and so-called homophobia and Islamophobia into the same pot.
That is mixing real discrimination based on race or religion with an opposition towards ideology, which is justified in democratic political discourse.
Our liberal colleague from the Netherlands is quite humble when it comes to assessing tolerance in her country.
Recently a paedophile political party was legalised there and I would like to ask: how much further will tolerance go in that country?
The post-Communists who are speaking so freely here would do better to look at their own record of tolerance instead of picking on Poland.
It is grotesque that this resolution juxtaposes regret over the lack of comparable data on the phenomena mentioned above and general judgments about the countries where they manifest themselves.
Why should Parliament publicise its sloppy work in this superficial draft of such an important document if we have been dealing with these phenomena for many years in committees within the Council of Europe?
In ratifying paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 11 in the current version, Parliament would simply lose credibility in the fight against racism and discrimination.
I would like to appeal to all those of you who are motivated by genuine concern for justice to avoid false comparisons and unjustified generalisations.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is an important day for the European Parliament because this debate, and especially the resolution potentially resulting from it, may create a new trend in the just fight against all kinds of racism and persecution of minorities.
However, let us for Godâs sake not allow it to become another weapon in the political campaign conducted by the left and the European liberals against the political parties that lean towards the right and countries where right-wing parties have come into power.
I strongly protest against the proposed formulation in paragraphÂ 4 of the resolution, which levels serious allegations at my country.
They are deadly serious allegations from a moral and political point of view and include xenophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia and a lack of tolerance in Poland.
One thousand years of Polish history surely prove beyond all doubt that Poland is the most tolerant country in Europe.
It is a country that will never allow its good name to be dragged through the mud with impunity.
We protest against the lies and hypocrisy of the left.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Schulz, together with his socialist colleagues, has joined the ranks of the Polish post-Communists in kicking up a fuss about the fate of homosexuals in Poland.
Does he know of any cases of intolerance towards homosexuals?
If not, what is all the fuss about?
Apparently a member of the League of Polish Families advocated the use of violence against gays.
This allegation is now the subject of a complaint filed by the member against the newspaper which printed the claim.
This Parliament would make itself a laughing stock if it were to protest against a statement that was never made.
We must check our facts first.
He said that the police should prevent illegal demonstrations, by force if necessary.
When the post-Communists were in power, illegal gay parades were protected by the police.
Now they are not.
We have a government that is determined to uphold law and order.
Yes, we are against promoting homosexuality in Poland.
We are against promoting immoral behaviour.
We clearly differ from MrÂ Schulz in our judgment of what is or is not morally acceptable.
He would be better off fighting intolerance in his own country.
I am old enough to remember German intolerance towards Poles during the Second World War.
There are still examples of lamentable intolerance in Germany today.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to support the statement made by MrÂ Gaubert, my colleague from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that this House has missed the opportunity to speak with one voice and to support the resolution he has drawn up.
This document highlights the kind of mechanisms that should be introduced in the European Union: constant monitoring of racist crimes, the introduction of a framework directive and the creation of an Agency for Fundamental Rights as soon as possible.
These should be priorities in our debate and in our resolution, rather than the slinging of mud at certain countries and cases, as seems to be happening here.
The European Union is trying to uphold the highest human rights standards.
That is the aim of the Agency for Fundamental Rights which is to be set up soon.
Already, a report is published annually by the Vienna-based European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia on the subject of racism and xenophobia in the European Union.
It is worth looking at the 2005 report.
Under pointÂ 5 on racist violence and crime there is an assessment of the situation in the 25 Member States.
What can we learn from this text?
In four European countries, including Italy, MrsÂ Agnoletto, there is a lack of publicly accessible official data on incidents of racist crime and violence.
Amongst the new Member States, the report states, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia collect official data on racist violence and crime on a broader scale than other countries.
We lack a unified European system for registering these crimes, and this makes it difficult to carry out comparable analyses of this phenomenon.
Over 52Â 000 incidents of a racist nature have been registered in the United Kingdom, thanks to an efficient system for recording such statistics, 6Â 400 incidents have been registered in Germany, 1Â 565 in France and 209 in the Czech Republic.
This disproportion shows how important it is to introduce a unified monitoring system.
The majority of the 25 European Union Member States, we read, have transposed the Anti-Discrimination Directive into their own national contexts.
In July 2000 complaints were filed at the European Court of Justice against four countries, including Germany, MrÂ Schulz, for not fulfilling their obligations concerning the directives on racial equality.
Â Â  Mr President, our duty today is to make a commitment, to speak out against this return to hate, xenophobia and homophobia.
All over Europe we are horrified to see odious acts and we are hearing hateful words and incitements to violence.
I would repeat: all over Europe.
It is therefore our duty to say âthat is enoughâ, that we will not tolerate any more such acts of violence, that these horrendous attitudes are contrary to our values and the foundations upon which we have built our Europe.
We must put an end to racist, xenophobic and homophobic crimes for good, whether they be against a man or a woman because they are black, against a young man because he is Jewish, against a young man because he is North African or against a woman because she is trans-sexual.
It is our essential duty to silence all of those who preach this vile ideology.
We all know where it leads: to the abyss and to horror.
Furthermore, we must stand firm against the incitements to hate expressed by Polish leaders against homosexuals.
To this end, I welcome the tolerance and the joy of living together shown by the Polish people on the occasion of the Gay Pride event in Warsaw.
This is my solemn appeal: let us stand up, for these are grave times.
All we have to do is count the resolutions that we have adopted on this issue to little effect, since the situation has only worsened.
We must now move on to actions.
The States must mobilise themselves against the hate that is re-emerging on their soil.
The Union must accept the seriousness of the situation and make this fight a priority.
We will not be able to say in the future that we did not know what was happening.
It is now that we must act, all of us together, urgently and without delay.
I would therefore call upon the Member States to reach an agreement on the framework decision on racism and xenophobia as soon as possible.
The time has come to act.
Â Â  Mr President, here we have yet another resolution condemning racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic acts, a resolution which is unfortunately justified given the exceptional and alarming levels of hate and intolerance that we have been seeing in the European Union for some years.
The facts are horrendous and they have been mentioned by previous speakers: racist attacks â all forms of racism taken together â are increasing dramatically.
ArticleÂ 2 of our joint motion for a resolution mentions the most recent ones: in Anvers, on 12Â May 2006, OulemataÂ Niangadou was murdered because she was black, together with little Luna for whom she was caring.
In France, IlanÂ Halimi was abducted, tortured and murdered because he was Jewish.
We could spend days discussing the causes of these barbarous acts. The first, in my view, is the fact that many of the arguments have become hackneyed.
There are those who use the âwe must not fan the flamesâ argument.
There are those who preach the infamous âquest for social peaceâ. There is also a certain culture of keeping quiet as well, increasing the sense of impunity felt by the perpetrators of these xenophobic acts, and above all there are the arguments that inflame peopleâs attitudes.
I shall give one specific example, though there are others, of this great tendency to resort to hackneyed arguments which paralyse people and prevent the public authorities from acting in good time.
In 2004, in France, the advisory committee on human rights stated that anti-Semitism was the cause of half of the physical and verbal attacks in the country.
Nevertheless, it has taken two years and the murder of IlanÂ Halimi for the French citizens to realise that a culture of anti-Semitism is proudly displayed in certain suburbs, amongst a minority, it is true, but a very active and particularly indoctrinated minority.
Two years too late, two years that should have been spent speaking out, condemning, integrating and bringing people together.
My custom is to end on an optimistic note.
I could, for example, mention RecitalÂ I and say that we must work towards educating people to respect others, to hold dialogue and to show tolerance.
It is an obvious and essential duty: knowledge with a view to recognising the full wealth and differences of others.
I shall end, Mr President, by saying that, in order to contain the increase in racism, we must begin, to paraphrase AlbertÂ Camus, by daring to call things by their name, we must identify who is provoking them, and we must have the courage to face the truth.
My constituency in the north of Ireland has seen a number of violent attacks on communities from other Member States and from further afield, as well as a consistent level of homophobic violence.
We also experience ongoing sectarian attacks, such as the recent murder of a 15-year old Catholic boy, Michael McIlveen.
It is absolutely vital that the Council now adopt the 2001 Framework Decision on Combating Racism and Xenophobia.
I would echo calls for the Finnish Presidency to restart work on this with all urgency and, as we have heard today, for the Council to adopt the decisions without watering them down.
National governments and other institutions must respond adequately.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe it is important that we all use this opportunity to highlight the unfortunate rise in racism at football matches in Europe.
FIFA, the worldâs governing body for football, has said that there has been a recent upsurge in discriminatory behaviour towards fans and black players, an escalation that has dovetailed with the signing by many European clubs of players from Africa and Latin America.
FIFA has stated that there is a deplorable trend in the increased level of racist attacks in Europe.
This is not in any individual country; it is everywhere.
It is unfortunate if people pick one place or country to highlight this.
Racist incidents that have taken place at European football matches include the following acts: monkey-like chanting, derisive singing, the hanging of banners that reflect neo-fascist beliefs and the tossing of banana skins on to football pitches.
In all, more than 30Â billion television viewers are expected to watch the World Cup that has just started.
I welcome the fact that FIFA is going to use that tournament as an opportunity to crack down on racist acts at football matches in Europe.
There are a number of things it intends to do.
Because of time constraints I will not list them.
However, I believe it is important for our own Commissioner for Sport, Mr FigeÄŸ, the Finnish Presidency, the EU and the European Parliament to look carefully over the coming months at how we can highlight this unfortunate trend.
I also believe that players have a huge role to play in this.
They are very influential with fans and they can have a hugely positive impact on getting people to stop that kind of behaviour.
Â Â  Mr President, racism is a result of people who want to rule over others as they are convinced of their own superiority.
Racist violence and other discrimination due to social background, old age, illness or religion cannot be combated using racist methods, especially here at the European Parliament.
That is why I strongly protest against the vilification of Poland, Poles and the Catholic radio station, , which has increased in particular since the right took control of the government.
The right has been ferociously fought by the international liberal socialists who, having the worldwide press under their thumb, tarnish the good name of Poles, accusing them of xenophobia, anti-semitism and homophobia simply because the majority of my compatriots believe in God and uphold traditional values.
The perfidious lie that has been spread by the anti-Catholic media is the alleged criticism of the radio station by the Holy See. is the only independent medium in Poland with a worldwide audience, something I wish applied to all media, which respects the truths of faith, defends life and real freedom and promotes truth, human dignity and human rights.
Poland was, and is, one of the most tolerant countries, where for many centuries those persecuted in other countries have been welcomed.
That is why adopting the resolution stating that there is anti-Semitism, xenophobia, racism or homophobia in Poland is a scandal, and would indicate that there is racism and xenophobia in the European Parliament.
As Polish Catholics we are offended by these insults and, not for the first time, feel discriminated against.
This is something that should not be happening, particularly here in the European Parliament, which prides itself on respecting the ideas of tolerance, democracy, respect for diversity and freedom of belief.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to join in the emphatic and unqualified condemnation of any kind of violence, of course.
In fact, we should come down hard on all perpetrators of violence, wherever they may come from.
That is beyond dispute.
Secondly, I should also like to point out, though, that violence committed by isolated individuals must not ever lead to a witch hunt on people and parties who have nothing to do with that violence and who, using only peaceful means, flag up the dangers and enormous problems of immigration that is on far too large a scale and that has grown, in fact, out of everyoneâs control.
Thirdly, I should like to add that this House is once again showing little evidence of reasonableness.
The joint resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow is simply not worth the paper it is written on due to its grotesque exaggerations and of it mixing up violence on the one hand and legitimate criticism of the unworkable multicultural society on the other. It is also, on account of its plea in favour of further curbing the free expression of opinion, worryingly undemocratic.
Â Â  Mr President, I have seen and heard homophobia vaguely, on TV and so on, but listening to some of our Polish colleagues speak here today, especially Mr Roszkowski, Mr PÄk, Mr Giertych and Mrs Krupa, well that is homophobia if anything is!
It is absolutely stuff!
I am glad that I have a of good, sensible, rational Polish friends, because if that is liberal history, then for goodness sake, I do not want to see what right-wing conservativism is!
Sorry about that.
To me this resolution is about four things. It is about the fight against racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and homophobia.
First, we already have a resolution on homophobia, which was signed by all of the political parties, and I am indeed very glad about that.
Second, it is clear that racist violence has increased in Europe and we cannot just sit down and watch it.
We need action.
We need action from the Commission, as Mrs inÂ âtÂ Veld said, and we need action, as many have said, from the Finnish Presidency.
My third and final point is that when I came here I thought that the resolution should not name any countries or political parties.
I am still trying to believe that it should not do so, but if someone wanted to put the country of Poland into this resolution, I think that after hearing this debate there is no question as to why it was done.
Because I am a big friend of Poland, I still think it should come out.
Â Â  Mr President, European history places a particular responsibility on the shoulders of politicians, the churches and civil society in terms of protecting tolerance and human rights.
This responsibility weighs especially heavily on the shoulders of the governments of European Union Member States, which should guard the rights enshrined in the European Treaty.
Unfortunately some, I repeat, some actions of the current government in Warsaw, especially those related to the League of Polish Families, are spreading intolerance and homophobia.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, RomanÂ Giertych, sacked the director of the National In-Service Teacher Training Centre because of its publication of an official Council of Europe guide entitled .
The Deputy Prime Minister alleged that the book, and I quote from the press, âencourages schools to hold meetings with gay organisationsâ.
RomanÂ Giertych is considering the need to shut down this institution, which has been in existence since 1991 and which is an important institution in Poland responsible for drafting and implementing educational programmes based on humanist values.
Fortunately, these actions by the government have roused another part of Polish society.
One hundred and forty thousand people have signed an Internet petition calling for the dismissal of the Minister for Education.
Teachers and pupils are protesting, and a new civil society is on the rise.
Â Â  We have defined homophobia as an irrational fear of otherness, a fear of something that one is not familiar with or that one does not want to become familiar with.
Opposition to homosexuality is simply a form of opinion based on inveterate prejudice.
It springs from the roots common to racism, xenophobia, hatred towards people of different beliefs and religions, and other phobias.
In the case of homophobia, what we are faced with is a traditional form of prejudice, often stimulated by the media and misused by populist politicians.
It manifests itself in a wide spectrum of actions, from hate speech and incitement against those who are different to calls for discrimination against individuals and actual inequality in legislation.
At times, such politicians can command widespread support, especially when they choose to link homophobia with nationalistic chauvinism, religious zeal, contempt for ethnic minorities and so forth.
Because such ideas can fan the flames of hatred, particularly in economically deprived areas, it is our duty to warn of the illegality of homophobia and acts of racism.
Eradicating prejudice is, however, only one of the objectives in educating people in tolerance towards those who are different, and can complement other types of education in tolerant behaviour.
The European Parliament can identify the dangers of homophobia, and expose its protagonists, but it is ultimately the responsibility of individual Member States to take measures to stamp it out.
Â Â  â Mr President, unfortunately, cases of racism and violence are increasing, both in terms of intensity and frequency, not only in Poland, but also, unfortunately, throughout Europe.
We need to condemn various racist crimes but, in light of both past resolutions and current Community legislation, this is not enough.
The legislation and daily administrative practices of the various Member States foster intolerance and discrimination to such a degree that we can talk of institutionalised racism.
The Member States need to apply practical measures to combat racism.
Public opinion-makers must not create a climate of racism.
Prosecution of groups that foster racism must be encouraged.
Racism is a multisided, multidimensional problem.
That is why composite measures are needed to combat it, measures which both prevent and cure.
We need to combat both racist perceptions and the social exclusion that fosters the development of racism.
Â Â  Mr President, we should take this opportunity and, at the same time as acknowledging the rise in racism, xenophobia, homophobia or any other kind of oppression, we should avoid putting a premature end to the discussion by stating that it should not be taking place at all.
Instead, we should think about the reasons for this increase, for it is this kind of reflection that has been lacking in this House.
There are a number of groups other than those mentioned today which are also oppressed.
I think that all Europeans in the European Union are being oppressed by having enlargement, in the form of Turkeyâs accession to the EU, forced upon them.
Another oppressed group is that part of society which has a traditional Christian outlook, which does not have anything against homosexuals but which is shocked by gay parades.
Why are parades necessary?
They are also a form of oppression.
Â Â  Mr President, I am saddened by what I have heard here this afternoon from our Polish colleagues from the League of Polish Families and the Law and Justice Party.
I have heard from them about the promotion of hatred, the promotion of discrimination, the promotion of evil.
We have heard family and religion used as a reason or an excuse.
There is no reason, and there is no excuse, for the promotion of hatred.
I have heard traditional values referred to.
What value is there in diminishing the lives of ordinary human beings?
There is none.
This House was built on the ashes of the Second World War.
When it was built we vowed that no minority would ever be scapegoated again.
We stand by that.
We will defend that.
I was in Warsaw on the march that your Government tried to ban.
Let me say to you: the reception that we got from those decent, ordinary people confirmed to me that your two parties do not represent those decent ordinary men and women of Poland!
Â Â  Mr President, we have a huge and inexcusable gap in EU action.
Our citizens must be very puzzled.
On the one hand we have good laws and a new strategy to outlaw discrimination against people as employees and consumers.
However, the EU is failing to outlaw hate crimes against people as people.
It is failing to delivery security from fear, even though we talk a lot about creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
President Barroso enjoined us this morning to be proud of Europe and its values.
So why is there a lack of action on hate crimes when Member States can agree criminal penalties for pollution crimes?
Is it complacency?
Is it ignorance?
Is it a lack of political will?
I hope to avoid any more high-flown rhetoric about a Europe of values while our leaders refuse to act.
MEPs are agreed, including, I am glad to say, Mr Gaubert for the PPE-DE Group, in demanding that action.
I would say to Mr Roszkowski that his mention of paedophiles in the context of sexual orientation is deeply misplaced and disgraceful.
Nothing suggests that paedophilia is more prevalent among homosexuals proportionately â indeed it is probably the contrary.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to draw up a joint response to the rise in racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic violence in our States, and to its consequence, the increasing expression of extreme-right views.
It is our duty to hammer home, day after day, this message that we must combat all forms of hate and discrimination on the grounds of ethnic, racial or religious origin or sexual orientation: a duty of tolerance, a duty to teach our children, a duty to remember our history.
That would be proof of our complete commitment to human rights.
Horror is never far away.
Recent tragic events have shaken our consciences and our people.
It was not so long ago that a world war founded upon hatred for others devastated our continent.
We must always remember that Europe rose from those bitter ashes, on the basis of values of peace and tolerance.
We cannot allow any weakness or concession, including in this Parliament.
We need strong responses, we must strengthen the legal instruments and rigorously apply those that already exist.
It is essential to re-launch the work aimed at adopting the Councilâs framework decision.
We must stand firm and offer an example, since that is what our values require of us.
In response to our Polish colleagues: it is possible to believe in God and not be homophobic.
Â Â  President-in-Office, if you have been subject to racial or homophobic violence you will never forget it.
When my parents arrived in this European Union from India, we were not welcomed with open arms: we suffered regular racial abuse and violence. You never forget it once it happens.
What I would say to my Polish colleagues, and to anyone else who doubts that action can be taken here in this House today, is that we want action.
The Council framework decision is at the heart of this resolution.
I would say to those colleagues who disagree about whether we should name individuals, I have to agree with it, because it is a deeply personal tragedy which you will never forget.
However, I would say this to the Austrian Presidency: you can make this happen.
It has been shelved so many times, but racist attacks can be solved, penalties can be increased, a political signal can be sent.
Will it stop the hatred?
No, it will not.
But you mentioned leadership, and leadership is what we seek today, because this scar on Europe today in 2006 is greater than when my parents arrived in this European Union in the 1960s.
That is a deep shame.
Let us do something about it.
Â Â  Mr President, it is with some dismay that I have studied the news that has reached us recently from countries both within and outside the EU.
It goes to show that there are very unpleasant and dangerous trends directed against homosexuals among the peoples of Europe.
One of the fundamental principles of a democracy is freedom of assembly, which is also safeguarded in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
This freedom is not always respected.
In Russia, the Gay Pride parade was refused permission to go ahead, something that quite clearly is not only a breach of the Convention but also an insult to those who wanted peacefully to exercise their democratic right.
We do not, however, need to look outside the EU in order to find similar examples.
It is enough to take a look at Poland, where, from right across the political spectrum, there is an ever-renewed stream of homophobic statements directed against Gay Pride parades and the like.
All this is entirely to be condemned.
Religion is frequently used as an excuse.
Certainly, freedom of religion too is one of the fundamental freedoms, but it should under no circumstances whatsoever be used as an excuse for oppressing others.
That is something we cannot accept, either among people in the Member States or among our fellow MEPs here in Parliament.
If, irrespective of the country we come from, we are to call ourselves democrats, we must vigorously condemn what is happening right now and do everything in our power to bring the oppression to an end.
The issue is so important, however, that it should be asked whether the European Parliament is the right forum in which to debate it.
What should not under any circumstances happen is for the issue of homophobia to be addressed for the purpose of making cheap political points.
Â Â  . () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my firm conviction that we can only be successful in dealing with this important issue â so essential to our own credibility â if we hold firmly to the values of this European Union of ours.
We must be reliable and speak out with a united voice.
It seems important to me and even vital that the institutions of the European Union, above all the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, are speaking the same language.
Personally I do not believe that we will make progress if we try to accuse each other and reproach each other for failing, more or less, to observe the principles of respect and tolerance.
We have to find a common language.
I have heard a great deal today pointing in this direction, and for that I am most warmly appreciative.
Mrs Lambert referred to something which I believe to be of crucial importance: the role of the media.
We had a EuroMed conference in Vienna ten days ago at which, amongst other things, we discussed the role of the media.
The consensus was that you cannot censor the media, you cannot tell them what to do.
We cannot aim for a code or law to regulate what the law should or should not do.
However, the media should have self-control over what it does, because it plays a crucial role.
As far as I am concerned, in a democracy the independent media plays probably the most important role in conveying everything that has been said here in favour of tolerance, in favour of the fight against racism.
That is very important.
To Mrs in ât Veld, I would say that this is an Austrian matter.
Ever since 2000 we have been working very vigorously on finding solutions for the Austrian Nazi victims.
There is absolutely no doubt that victims of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation are considered victims of Nazism.
To MrÂ Agnoletto, who unfortunately is no longer here, I would like to say that I very emphatically reject - and I do this with some personal emotion, too - the accusation that the Austrian Presidency of the Council is guilty - precisely on this question - of inactivity.
I think MrÂ Agnoletto has not really been following the events of the last six months of the Austrian Presidency.
I would particularly like to thank MrÂ Sonik for having emphasised the activity of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna, and for having stressed the important potential role that the human rights agency could play in precisely this area.
I call once again upon all Members to support the future Presidency of the Council in this issue, so that this European human rights agency can become a reality.
It would play an important part in the fight against racism and for tolerance.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, the concept of equality and tolerance has been part of European political thinking for centuries.
I recall a Papal bull from the beginning of the 10th century, which opens with the words: âDoes the sun not shine equally on all?â
Despite the existence of this concept, Europe has very often endured times of brutal intolerance, which have led to millions of deaths and peopleâs destinies cut short, not to mention those who have not been physically destroyed but who have lived under circumstances of intolerance.
Ladies and gentlemen, some historical events have been mentioned, and I feel that the experience of history is of vital importance.
It begins inconspicuously with gradual backsliding on standards of tolerance and equal opportunities.
Such barely perceptible beginnings eventually give rise to movements with real political clout, with the disastrous results that they bring.
That was why Europe established equal opportunities, tolerance and anti-discrimination as a cornerstone of its political thinking and of its political construction.
In my view this is the most important value that forms part of the European project, as all the others are rather instruments.
It is up to us to adopt effective measures at all levels wherever possible.
This fight is not only a matter for Europe, for the Member States or for the various levels.
No, ladies and gentlemen, this fight is a matter for every one of us as individuals.
I therefore feel most encouraged by the ideas which have emerged in this debate, and which show that in Parliament there is a strong desire to support the effective, proactive implementation of the ideas of equal opportunities, tolerance and the fundamental rejection of racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia.
Â Â  To wind up the debate, six motions for resolution(1) have been tabled under RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on
â the oral question (O-0014/2006 â B6-0225/2006) to the Council on small arms by MrÂ Brok and MrÂ vonÂ Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and
â the oral question (O-0015/2006 â B6-0226/2006) to the Commission on small arms by MrÂ Brok and MrÂ vonÂ Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Â Â  .
Mr President, as our colleagues in the Commission and the Council know â and I thank them for being here today â we take improving the mechanisms for controlling European arms exports and the strengthening and strict implementation of the European Union Code of Conduct on arms exports very seriously, and we are also great enthusiasts and promoters of the idea of one day having an international arms treaty.
Let us hope that that day is not too far away.
These are all issues that we have had the opportunity to discuss on other occasions and we will continue to deal with them in the future.
Nevertheless, today I would like to focus on a rather more specific issue: small arms and light weapons, which are currently the real weapons of mass destruction, to judge from their immense capacity to kill.
I will give just one statistic: every minute, one person falls victim to a firearm somewhere in the world.
By the time I finish this speech, therefore, there will have been five more such tragic victims.
As far as this issue is concerned, time is not money.
It is something much more important.
It is life.
You have some questions before you that were presented in writing by my colleagues MrÂ Brok and MrÂ vonÂ Wogau on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, respectively, whom it is my pleasure to represent here today.
These questions relate to the next United Nations Conference to assess and review the programme of action on small arms and light weapons that will take place in New York from 26Â June to 7Â July, and the position that the European Union will take at that conference.
Before getting into the issue itself, I would like to say that I am extremely pleased with the decision to include a representation from the European Parliament as an integral part of the European Unionâs official delegation at that conference.
This is unprecedented at this level, and it demonstrates the need to strengthen the mechanisms for dialogue amongst the three institutions and offers a perfect opportunity to establish a more coherent and more efficient European policy on arms control.
At the preparatory meetings that we have held so far, we have noted, on the part of the Commission and of the Council â and I have always expressed my desire for institutional cooperation â that there is a great shared interest in what I believe to be a very great and increasingly close cooperation amongst the three institutions.
I would therefore like to focus my questions on the following points: firstly, how does the Commission assess the preparations for the conference and how does it intend to ensure that the European Unionâs strategy on light weapons is taken into account within the European Union's foreign policy?
And, secondly, how does the Council intend to approach the negotiations and what results does it hope to achieve?
At this point I would also like, naturally, to draw attention to the resolution adopted unanimously in this Parliamentâs Committee on Foreign Affairs and which will be ratified by plenary tomorrow.
It contains the position that we, as the European institution directly elected by the citizens, would like you to take into account.
I would repeat that I am pleased to note that, in the talks we have held, there is a very high level of agreement as to the issues that should be discussed at the conference: the inclusion of ammunition in the scope of the programme, a better definition of the control of transfers, the monitoring and marking of weapons, brokering, the relationship between development and disarmament â something which I know not just we, but also the Commission, are particularly concerned about â and finally the establishment of guidelines for following up the conference.
I also believe that there should be more concrete measures for dealing with the possession of weapons and acquisition and, in any event, that is an issue that I would like us to discuss.
With regard to this final point, although you are well aware of this, I must point out that this Parliament has insisted on many occasions that we would very much like the Union to take the lead, at international level, on the adoption of an international arms treaty.
Although it is true that this is not the subject of the conference that we are talking about at the moment, we would like this conference to establish a basis for beginning to move towards that objective as soon as the conference is over.
I would like to remind you that this is a request that has already received masses of support at international level, as confirmed by non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International, Oxfam or Iansa, the promoters of the initiative.
With regard to the role of parliaments in general, and of parliamentarians in particular, I would like to stress the increasing importance of these institutions in the process, not just as legislators, but also and this is fundamental in terms of controlling the actions of their respective executives.
To this end, the Interparliamentary Forum on Small Arms and Light Weapons is doing extremely important work in terms of increasing the awareness and training of various parliamentarians with an interest in improving the mechanisms for controlling these exports.
If you accept these objectives, representatives of the Council and the Commission, you can count on us to be great allies.
Â Â  . () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to go into very specific detail about MrÂ RomevaÂ IÂ Ruedaâs questions and I will try to answer them one after the other.
I also want to thank you for your comments.
In fact we are allies, since the objectives of the European Parliament and the European Council are in line with each other.
As for the first question, on how the Council plans to cooperate with the Commission on preparations for a coherent and successful implementation of the Unionâs strategy, in connection with appropriate funding: the strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons and their ammunition, adopted by the European Union in December 2005, concentrates on extending the capacities of the General Secretariat of the Council so that it may conclusively apply the strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of these weapons.
The strategy also provides that the General Secretariat of the Council will proceed in this matter in close coordination with the Commission and the Member States.
In our view this is very important, because the strategy calls for coherence and complementarity between decisions of the European Union in the framework of GASP and measures taken by the Commission in the field of developmental aid, so that there is a coherent underlying approach to all projects and interventions by the European Union in the field of small arms and light weapons.
It seems to me that consistent policy between the institutions is of the utmost importance: only by being consistent can we remain credible to the world at large.
I can give a positive answer to the second question, as to whether the Presidency of the Council will ensure that it sends a delegation of the European Parliament to participate in the UN Review Conference 2006, in order to add a political and parliamentary impetus to the proceedings: I myself will lead the delegation and I am looking forward to it, because I think it is very important that the European Union raises its profile on an international stage.
The relevant Council departments have checked and approved the participation of Members of the European Parliament in this Conference, and I am pleased that Members will indeed be taking part in this Conference.
As far as I am informed, you yourself will be taking part, I am pleased to say, and other Members will also be able to take part.
In this way we will undoubtedly further emphasise the importance of this issue for the European Union.
As for the third question â as to whether the Council is to propose the European Unionâs 1998 code of conduct on weapons exports as a possible blueprint for the future Arms Trade Treaty, I can tell you that the Councilâs publicised support for the Arms Trade Treaty is not intended as an attempt by the European Union to impose its own standards on the rest of the world.
One could point out, however, that third states that strive towards modernising and completing their national export controls regard the EU code of conduct as an important reference document.
I know that I too am subject to this temptation.
If we think that we in the European Union have worked out some excellent rules, then of course we would like to see these rules adopted worldwide.
We have to be realistic here, however, and act as an example; if we act as a good example, then other states in similar situations will view our code of conduct as a guide.
In the framework of the Arms Trade Treaty, which represents an important project in humanitarian terms, as well as in terms of human rights, developmental policy and disarmament policy, the European Union is directing its efforts towards mobilising the widest possible supranational support for this.
One of our main concerns is to improve inspections of transfers of small arms and light weapons for the European Union as a whole.
Other major concerns are to make small arms and light weapons more traceable, so-called âmarking and tracingâ, tighter controls on the arms trade and punitive measures against illegal trafficking of ammunition.
We are very grateful for the support of the European Parliament in this matter and for the very close cooperation of the Commission, too; and I believe that at the Conference in New York the European Union will indeed give a good account of itself.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is set to play a central role in the UN conference aimed at looking into the issue of small arms and light weapons, although it will not take part in the talks on the formal documents.
Some countries have a political interest in implementing the Treaty but lack the resources to do so.
We are therefore channelling all our efforts into supporting practical implementation.
In 2005 alone, the Commission spent over EURÂ 16Â million supporting countries and populations affected by small arms violence.
With this support, we also helped implement joint EU actions in 2002 and the EU programme for the prevention and prohibition of the illicit trade in conventional arms, and contributed towards the implementation of the EU strategy on small arms and light weapons.
This formed the political framework governing the work of the Council and the Commission on this issue.
The Commissionâs contribution to the 2002 Annual Report on joint action in the area of small arms and light weapons includes more specific coordinating measures.
The Commissionâs ability to honour its commitments for 2007 will depend largely on the outcome of talks between the Council and Parliament on proposed instruments for funding Community actions.
To this end, the Commission has tabled some sensible proposals.
Whilst the Commission awaits a positive verdict on the main thrust of these proposals, its departments responsible for the policy on small arms and light weapons are working towards ensuring that awareness of the risks relating to illicit small arms and light weapons and of the preparedness of individual countries to address those risks forms part of the documents of their national and regional strategies.
The Commissionâs departments continue to work towards introducing into national and regional programmes standards and measures aimed at stopping the spread and accumulation of illicit weapons.
It is worth pointing out, however, that the proposed measures give recipient countries, to a greater or lesser extent, responsibility for defining aid and for specifying a number of key action areas.
Â Â  . Mr President, we support the principle of the proposed international arms trade treaty.
Small arms, in the wrong hands, prolong and exacerbate some of the worldâs most brutal conflicts.
However, we are under no illusions that so long as certain arms manufacturing nations remain outside the scope of international treaties, then oppressive governments, terrorists and insurgents and other organised criminal groups will continue to have easy access to weaponry.
The British arms industry already operates to some of the highest standards in the world and the British Defence Manufacturersâ Association has said that it warmly welcomes the principle behind the international arms trade treaty.
If other countries were willing to emulate the strict standards enforced by the United Kingdom, an arms treaty would certainly be a worthwhile asset and a boon to international security.
However, responsible countries such as the United Kingdom and other EU Member States will only achieve a hollow moral victory if other less conscientious nations rush to fill the gap in arms sales left by our absence.
The United Nations, and not the European Union, is the arena in which to pursue an international arms trade treaty and it must include as many countries as possible, and particularly China, if it is to have the desired effect.
Amnesty International has recently identified China as one of the worldâs major arms exporters, with increasing influence in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Chinese weapons have helped sustain conflicts and human rights violations in Sudan, Nepal, Burma and southern Africa.
I am reminded that China also continues to stockpile enormous quantities of anti-personnel landmines.
For many years I have worked to overcome the problem of anti-personnel landmines, but I have always sought to focus attention on the real culprits, who use such weapons indiscriminately and irresponsibly.
Usually, these have been armed rebel groups in developing countries which are supplied by non-Western countries.
I think it is important, therefore, that when considering the matter of small arms, we should take care not to become over-obsessed with our own authorities or legitimate traders engaged in transparent activities.
Instead, we should focus on terrorist groups and other criminal elements that are either sitting on stockpiles of weapons or continuing to obtain them from various sources.
That is the area on which we should now concentrate our attention.
Let us also work hard to bring China and other such countries into the scope of an international treaty.
Â Â  . Mr President, small arms and light weapons are weapons of mass destruction in the developing world.
It is estimated that they kill half a million people each year.
Their long-term impact on sustainable development is undeniable.
Fighting them means finding creative ways to bridge the gap between security sector reform and development assistance.
The latest reports by the UN Institute for Disarmament Research on European action on small arms and light weapons stresses that the EU should create more synergies between the relevant CFSP and Community instruments.
Also, fighting the scourge of illegal brokering should be a priority.
This Parliament has repeatedly expressed its disappointment at the lack of specific legislation in many EU countries, despite the adoption of Common Position 2002/203/CFSP.
Finally, the EU can play a decisive role in making sure that the review conference on the UN programme of action on small arms and light weapons is successful, and a follow-up conference must therefore be organised.
We are counting on the Austrian Presidency to steer that process.
Success would mean agreement on a global set of principles on arms transfers which, as a minimum, should ensure that all transfers are authorised through a permit or licence, that existing obligations and relevant international law are respected, that arms embargoes imposed by the UN Security Council are respected and enforced, and that the issuing of permits or licences should take into account the risk of exported arms being used in serious violations of human rights or international humanitarian law, including the risk that such arms might be diverted into the wrong hands such as those of terrorists and that this may affect regional or internal security and stability.
The UN review conference should, of course, start work on a legally-binding international arms trade treaty as soon as its work is complete.
I am very honoured to be a member of Parliamentâs delegation to that review conference.
Â Â  â Mr President, I welcome this motion for a resolution on the subject of small arms, although I must say that when you consider the damage these things cause, the term âsmall armsâ makes them seem much too harmless.
However, I should like to point out a few problems with this motion.
It says, for example, that transfer of weapons should not occur if there is a risk that they might lead to violations of human rights or that they might promote national or regional instability and armed conflicts.
To be quite honest: when is this not the case with weapons exports?
I think that the real problem is to differentiate between legal and illegal exports, because this is actually a grey area.
One should, therefore, not only take action against illegal exports, but also against legal ones.
Contrary to what MrÂ VanÂ Orden says, one should certainly look at Member States of the European Union as well, since countries like France, the United Kingdom and Germany are among the main exporters of small arms.
I will just mention the example of Nepal.
Weapons were exported from EU Member States to Nepal.
Now these weapons have been used, and we now have this problem, to which the Council responded by saying that no one could have known that events would unfold in this way.
It is precisely because we cannot know that we must ban legal weapons as well as illegal weapons.
Every weapons export is a threat to peace.
Â Â  Mr President, with 80Â million new guns manufactured each year, and one person killed by a gun every minute, the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons fuels conflict, crime and terrorism across the globe.
Five years after the UN programme of action was agreed, the forthcoming review conference must not just review: it must act.
It should recognise key gaps, such as the transfer of small arms to non-state actors and, ultimately, ways of reducing the demand for small arms.
It should address controls for licensed production deals, like that adopted for Austrian Steyr rifles in Malaysia.
As Mr Winkler says, Europe can offer leadership in this debate, demonstrating the effectiveness of our code of conduct on arms sales.
I hope the Council will offer new commitments to extend financial support to projects aimed at limiting small arms proliferation and their use â currently just EUR 2Â million in the CFSP budget â and by building on the proposals for an EU strategy for security sector reform, started under last yearâs UK Presidency of the EU and, indeed, at the Austrian Presidency conference on the western Balkans.
Last year European Member States, as part of the UN, agreed a tracing instrument for small arms that was neither comprehensive â covering guns, not bullets â nor legally binding.
This year EU representatives must show that we have the political will to go further to promote the proposal already endorsed by the Council and Parliament for a legally binding international arms trade treaty, and to ensure, both at the review conference this July and at the UN First Committee in October, a resolution to set up a working group to begin to make it happen.
Â Â  I have received one motion for a resolution(1) in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0224/2006).
The following questions have been submitted to the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in response to MrÂ Posseltâs question â one that has already been asked in this form â I can only confirm what I said before: there is no connection between different accession negotiations.
Of course, because of the fact of scheduling accession negotiations with several candidate countries, certain parallels may arise.
However, the accession procedures â the screening, the analytical test and, importantly, the negotiations â are of course carried out separately with each country.
I would like to remind you that one of the fundamental principles of the accession negotiations is that every negotiation is based upon the individual achievements of the individual country concerned, and that cross-connections can not be made.
The speed of progress in the negotiations depends solely on the extent to which the individual candidate makes progress in fulfilling the conditions for accession.
A parallel has arisen, although mainly for practical reasons, simply because the Commission produced the first screening reports on Turkey and Croatia at almost exactly the same time, and so they were dealt with at the same time.
Nevertheless â as was evident two days ago â they were treated completely differently and with entirely different results; and I believe that this connection may be broken again in the future â this connection does not exist in any case â if, for example, the European Commission proposes benchmarks to open the negotiation chapters for only one of the two candidate countries, and if these benchmarks are then confirmed by the Member States; or, if the two accession candidates fulfil these benchmarks at different times.
We stand at the beginning of these negotiations; our next concern is ChapterÂ 36 including other business; in other words, in practical terms and due to the rhythm of negotiations, the two are very soon likely to drift apart from each other.
Â Â  â () In theory, this principle of each country on its own merits has always prevailed, and yet in terms we have seen many cross-connections.
I would like to ask once again: will the Council insist that the Commission deals with these two â quantitatively and qualitatively so very different - countries differently during screening, and will the Council complete their formal separation, since, when one considers Turkeyâs recent threats on the issue of Cyprus, it is high time to do so?
Â Â  . MrÂ Posselt, there will be no formal connection, and there cannot be one.
There is no provision at all for such a thing, neither in the Rules of Procedure nor in Council practice.
Nor do I believe that it is appropriate to demand such a thing of the Commission.
Different rhythms of negotiation will come about automatically.
As you are so right in saying, the speed of progress and the starting positions of the two countries are of course fundamentally different.
Therefore - in practice - different speeds of negotiation are very soon bound to emerge.
Â Â  â () Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on the one hand you are right in saying that there is no connection.
On the other hand, however, it is precisely Croatia that is, at least in parts, surrounded by other candidate countries, potential candidate countries and others who still hope to become candidates.
To what extent could the accession negotiations with Croatia affect this entire region of the Western Balkans, which urgently needs stabilising?
Â Â  . I do in fact believe, MrÂ Rack, that the negotiations with Croatia have an important effect as an example to the many Balkan countries that â as I know from many conversations with their representatives â see Croatia as showing them the way.
Croatia is going on ahead of them and there is no doubt that the progress it has made in terms of economic and social policy constitutes an incentive to the other countries in the Balkans.
I would remind you that Croatia will be following Greece in holding the presidency of the South Eastern European Cooperation Process.
This too is important, in that it makes it more likely that Croatia will exercise influence as an example to the other countries in this forum, which comprises only countries from that region.
I personally have high expectations of the negotiations with Croatia, not least for the sake of the other Balkan countries.
Â Â  Since the statistics have, for some time, shown the Croatian economy to be making very good progress, the country would appear, in economic terms, to have been ready for accession some time ago.
The only problems appear to be with the sluggish implementation of laws relating to the EU, where the process is hampered by the requirement that proposals for legislation be sent first to the Commission.
Might it not be possible to give the Croatian Government some practical help with this?
Â Â  . I believe, MrÂ MÃ¶lzer, that we are doing that.
Croatia is getting very effective assistance from us, from the European Union, from Austria, from the Presidency, in its efforts, and we are in close contact on a very regular basis.
Nor do I believe that it is fair to say that the Commission is in some way dragging its feet in this regard.
The Commission is doing what it is required to do, and I also believe that the negotiations themselves are going very well.
It goes without saying that Croatia will continue to receive assistance from us at Council level as it endeavours to become a Member State of the European Union.
I can only agree with you that there has been not only an improvement in the economic statistics but also very much greater willingness on the part of the country and of its people and so the negotiations should not be too long drawn out; it is on that that we in the Council are building.
Â Â  . The Council wishes to inform MrÂ Evans that it thinks it necessary to obtain further expert information on this issue, which has to do with how it is determined whether a piece of legislation is both necessary and called for from the point of view of society.
The Council has therefore suspended negotiation on the proposal until such time as this information is available.
Â Â  . The illegal trade in human kidneys has become a multi-million-euro industry, with European patients whose lives are at risk desperately trying to find donors on the Internet.
In far too many cases they are just preying on poor people in developing countries.
For those donors the motivation is money, not the health and quality of life the recipients can expect.
In listening to your answer, President-in-Office, I would remind you that in too many cases that trade is linked to human rights abuses in the form of the involuntary removal of organs from prisoners due for execution in China.
Three years after this was voted in the European Parliament, an answer that you are seeking more information from experts is really not good enough.
I ask you to seek best efforts within the Council to unblock this very important proposal.
Â Â  . I personally fully agree with you and I am sure that many of my colleagues in the Council share that view.
I would like to point out that the proposal was taken off the agenda, not withdrawn.
It is a proposal that is important but needs to be studied very carefully.
But I have taken note of your sense of urgency and will certainly share it with colleagues in the Council.
Â Â  . MrÂ Mitchellâs question is, of course, very relevant to the present situation, and it is one that I am very happy to answer.
Over recent months, of course, the Council has considered this issue in very considerable depth and, ever since the start of diplomatic efforts at resolving it, has adopted conclusions on the subject, most recently on 15Â May.
It appears to me to be quite vital to underline the fact that one of its concerns in doing this was to present the European Union as maintaining a united front, for any sort of long-term effect on Iran is dependent on its being seen to do that by the outside world.
What that means is that the fact that these negotiations have, in the last few months, been in the hands of three Member States, should not conceal the fact that the Council as a whole, and MrÂ Solana, the High Representative, as well, have constantly been not only informed about them, but also involved in them, supporting them and endorsing the relevant conclusions.
We have repeatedly expressed our profound regret at the Iranian Government's failure to take the steps regarded as necessary by, in particular, the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Security Council of the United Nations and at its threatening, until recently, to continue to refuse to take them.
We have appealed to the Iranian Government to cooperate unconditionally with the IAEA.
The Council has not disputed Iranâs right to use nuclear energy in a peaceful manner in accordance with its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and, on the basis of the August 2005 proposals, reiterated in the February 2006 conclusions, the EU would be prepared â and it still is â to support the development of a safe and sustainable civil nuclear programme consonant with the principles of non-proliferation, provided â and this is the other side of the coin â that full account is taken of the wishes of the international community and its confidence restored as regards Iranâs intentions.
The Council is still determined to bring about a peaceful solution by diplomatic means, and I believe that it has communicated and reiterated that in very clear terms to the world at large.
The EU would welcome it if it were to be able to develop its relations with Iran on the basis of trust and cooperation.
A few days ago, as you will be aware, the High Representative, MrÂ Solana, presented Iran with an offer package from the European Union that was also endorsed by the other Members of the Security Council â something that strikes me as particularly relevant â and the initial responses to it can be described as cautiously positive.
We hope that this offer â which is a good one â will serve as a basis for achieving a peaceful resolution of this conflict, and that this potentially dangerous issue will very soon be off the agenda, so that we can achieve a comprehensive agreement and understanding with Iran, thus in turn making it possible for our relations with it to be developed in all areas.
Â Â  I welcome the efforts to resolve what the President-in-Office has described as âthese dangerous developmentsâ.
What sort of a precedent is this setting for other mavericks in the near neighbourhood of Europe, if somebody who threatens nuclear development, makes xenophobic comments about a nearby state and threatens international security is to get a package?
Could the President-in-Office tell us what is in that package?
What has been the outcome of MrÂ Solanaâs discussions and what response was received from the Iranians?
Could he give us some idea of exactly what is on the table and what is being offered to Iran in these circumstances?
Â Â  . The contents of this package are not openly known and it has also been agreed with Iran that the detailed content of the package will be treated confidentially for the time being, as long as these negotiations, which are at a very sensitive stage, are carried on.
As far as the reaction of the Iranian side is concerned, I have said that the package was not rejected, which already is progress, because as we know, in the past, that whenever the European Union and other international players have made an offer, this was flatly rejected by Iran.
Now this is being studied by the Iranian side and we can only hope, not only in our interests but also in the interests of Iran, that this offer will be accepted.
Â Â  When Mr Larijani first responded in public to Mr Solanaâs offer last week, he said that the package offer contained some ambiguities.
Can you give us any information about what those ambiguities are?
Have they been solved yet?
He also said that the European Union side has given weeks, not months, for a response.
When are we expecting a response from the Iranians?
Â Â  . You have practically given the answer yourself.
Firstly, it is not up to the Council to interpret what Mr Larijani said.
If there are any ambiguities, we have made it very clear that he now has a fairly short time â just as you said, we are not thinking in terms of months but in terms of weeks â to clarify what these ambiguities are and what is necessary in order to clarify the European Unionâs position.
So we hope to hear exactly on which points the Iranian side is seeking more information, which we will give to them.
I hope we shall be able to clarify those ambiguities to the satisfaction of the Iranian side.
Â Â  â Mr Winkler, the recurrent problem with the European Union in global political conflicts is that one or other of its Member States chooses to go its own way and tends to ally itself with the USA, thus going against European interests.
Can it be guaranteed that, in the conflict with Iran, the European Union will speak with one voice and that all its Member States will support it?
Â Â  . The answer I can give MrÂ MÃ¶lzer is a very brief one, and it consists of a firm âyesâ.
I was present for all the debates in the Council, the last of which was only a few days ago, and I can tell you that all the Member States, without exception, are endeavouring to come to a common position on this matter, the need for which is being questioned by nobody, and that the European Union is very much united on this issue.
Â Â  . Let me say at the outset that it is a most especial pleasure to be able to answer a question from my old friend MrÂ MartÃ­nezÂ MartÃ­nez, and I will readily do so, since, particularly over the past few weeks, the subjects of the strategy for Africa, combined with the issues of development and migration, have been right at the top of the European Unionâs agenda.
Migration has already been discussed this morning in the course of the debates on the future of Europe and on the preparation for the European Council, when I pointed out â as I do again now in response to this question â how important it is that we, when discussing migration, should concern ourselves not only with illegal immigration, important though that of course is, but also the necessity of turning our attention to the development policy dimension of this issue.
Migration was a very important topic at the troikaâs meetings both with the African Union and with ECOWAS, when it was confirmed that an EU/African ministerial conference would be held on migration, and agreement was reached with ECOWAS on the establishment of an working group on the subject.
We attach great importance to the European/African regional conference on migration routes to be held in Rabat on 10 and 11 July, at which we will be giving special support to Spain, and preparations for this are far enough advanced for it to be possible to adopt a joint action plan.
We also, in this context, attach importance to ArticleÂ 13 of the Cotonou Agreement, which makes mandatory the return of illegal immigrants and also makes provision for dialogue with the countries concerned, on which we, together with Mauretania and Senegal, have embarked.
Tomorrow or the day after, the European Council will be adopting a resolution in favour of pressing ahead at greater speed with dialogue with Africa, which, it is envisaged, will involve ten countries in the west of Africa and four in the east.
The intention is that these bilateral discussions and their outcomes should be backed up on a regional and Africa-wide basis, with a follow-up mechanism being established for the Rabat conference and a series of regional conferences held on this subject.
Turning to your question on development cooperation, I would like to observe that the European Unionâs monitoring report this year showed that the EU is steering the best possible course towards discharging the obligations into which it entered at Barcelona in March 2002 and increasing public development aid to the point at which it reaches a proportion of 0.33% of individual statesâ GDPs and 0.39% of the average across the whole of the EU.
I will take this opportunity to repeat that all the targets agreed at the Millennium Summit must, of course, be achieved.
These are obligations that must be discharged in full, and, of course, the individual Member States have their own.
Turning to the subject of the economic partnership agreements with groups of African countries, I am very well aware that the issue of such EPAs is quite fundamental in our dialogue with Africa.
A few days ago, in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, while negotiating the ACP Finance Protocol, we made a particular point of giving undertakings on this issue.
The Commission has declared its willingness to make funds available not only from the current European Development Fund but also from the next.
We are aware of the most especial importance of this issue of economic partnership agreements with Africa and with developing countries generally.
On the basis of the first general review, which is to be carried out in the second half of the year, we will be carrying out a complete analysis of the stage that negotiations have reached, and then we will be able to continue work without delay in what it is to be hoped will be a very efficient manner.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Winkler.
Your reply is satisfactory, of course. I simply wished to ask you how you believe it is really going to be possible to reconcile the commitments we have made and which you are reiterating with the financial perspective that we have approved, because it seems to us that the sums do not add up.
In other words, it does not seem to us to be viable to maintain those commitments within the framework of the financial perspective, with the cuts that it implies.
Furthermore, I would like to know whether you are personally going to be in Vienna for the meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly that we are going to hold next week, because that is where we are going to be able to talk to our African, Caribbean and Pacific colleagues about the issue of the EPAs, for example, and I would also suggest and request that observers from the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly be invited to the Rabat Conference, because I believe that the presence of these parliamentarians will haveÂ ...
Â Â  . I will take particular pleasure in being present at this meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Vienna, but it is unfortunate that my appearance there is scheduled for a day when other events are taking place, including the visit of the President of the United States to Vienna, so it may be rather difficult for me to reach the venue at all.
I will, however, do my best, and am already looking forward to meeting Members of your House and parliamentarians from the ACP states.
Turning now to the issue of financial resources, I would first like to point out that the European Development Fund is not part of the European Unionâs Budget; on the contrary, these resources are provided by the Member States from their national budgets.
I would also like to point out that the amount in this tenth EDF is equivalent to an increase of over 35% against its predecessor; even though there were renewed negotiations and discussions in Port Moresby concerning the sums involved, that is still a quite considerable increase.
What we are talking about here â and this is something that must be brought home to the public â is the sum of EURÂ 22.6 billion over six years.
I do believe that, in doing this, the European Union is fully discharging its obligations, not least its moral obligations.
Moving on to the agreement to increase aid to Africa by EURÂ 10 billion, the intention is that this should start in 2006 and run until 2010.
At present, it is probably premature to pass overall judgment on the European Unionâs keeping of this promise.
I do believe that the tenth EDF is a good package and contains sufficient funds for the needs of the developing countries in Africa, in the Caribbean and in the Pacific.
A very great deal will also depend â and this too needs to be emphasised â on how these funds are deployed, which must be done in an efficient manner.
It is a recurrent experience that the end of a period sees considerable amounts of money left over, and that means that we also have to improve the capacity for these funds to be used, which has to do not only with the amount, but also with the way in which these funds are used.
We are working on this, and so, in particular, is the Commission.
Â Â  Would the President-in-Office of the Council agree with me that there are selfish as well as selfless reasons for refocusing our effort on the developing world?
Within a generation there will be two billion more people on this earth, 90% of whom will be born into what is now the developing world.
We will indeed leave a terrible inheritance to our children if we do not ensure that the current situation changes.
On the other hand, these people could become our trading partners.
Is the Minister aware of Chinaâs activities in the developing world?
Is the European Union going to stand by and allow China to become the trading partner of the developing world within a generation?
Â Â  . Let me say to MrÂ Mitchell that, first of all, I do not feel qualified to make moral judgments here as to whether we are selfish or not, but, yes, it is very much in our interest to help those countries.
It is not only a matter of trade, it is also a matter of global security and it is a matter of migration, which we have talked about today and during the last month and will talk about again in the future.
There are many ways in which it is in our interests for those countries to develop.
There is absolutely no doubt about that and we should not do it just because we are so generous, although we must be generous and I think that we are.
As far as China is concerned, that is a very interesting point.
Just a week ago, I led a Troika mission to China and we had a very interesting political dialogue with the Chinese.
One of the issues we talked about was exactly that: Chinaâs activities, in Africa in particular but also in other developing countries, especially in the fields of energy and trade.
We said we are concerned that the values we share â and that we hope China also shares â as regards good governance and human rights are not respected.
So this is an issue that we are very much aware of.
We raise it in relation to our partners and we have raised it, and will raise it again, in relation to China.
Â Â  â There is no doubt about the fact that economic partnership agreements are a positive step in attempting to curb immigration as such, and illegal immigration in particular.
With this in mind, is consideration being given to coupling these agreements with provisions on the return of illegal immigrants?
Are you thinking along these lines?
Â Â  . I can tell you, MrÂ Rack, that the return of illegal and other immigrants is an open question, and I cannot say whether it will be formally tied in to the economic partnership agreements; the Commission is engaged in negotiations on the subject.
That this is something that both the Council and the Member States would like to see is not, however, a matter of doubt, and it is of course something towards which the Commission is also working.
Â Â  . The visa facilitation and returns agreements signed at the summit with Russia in Sochi on 25Â May â to which reference was also made in yesterdayâs debate on the Sochi summit â were negotiated with the intention of making it easier for people to keep in touch with each other and travel between the European Union and Russia.
That is not only in Russiaâs interest, but also in our own.
It is also the intention that this agreement should, in harmony with the timetable for the development of the single area of freedom, security and justice, ensure that people can cross borders lawfully and without problems and stay legally in both areas.
According to this timetable, these agreements â which must first, however, be ratified and implemented â are to be seen as a first step in a process aimed at making the free movement of persons, and their return, easier.
Furthermore, the timetable envisages the dialogue on visas with a view to examining the conditions for the introduction of bilateral exemption from visa requirements being moved forward, albeit as a long-term project without a definite point in time being specified.
The dialogue between the European Union and Russia on visa matters will be continued on this basis.
Â Â  Thank you for your answer.
I would like to ask you another question.
In the agreement signed in Sochi, there is a sentence saying that both parties reaffirm the intention to establish a visa-free travel regime between the Russian Federation and the European Union, so my question is: do you really believe that it is in the interests of the European Union to have a visa-free regime between the Russian Federation and the EU?
If yes, then what are those interests?
Â Â  . To be quite honest, I cannot answer this question today.
As I have said before, this is a long-term perspective.
There is no answer today, because there are many aspects to this question â there are not only aspects of external relations, but also questions of migration policy â and the situation will have to be closely observed both by the Council and the Commission to finally come to conclusions.
This is certainly a matter of years and is not something that we need to decide today.
Â Â  I would like to ask the minister a question.
During the Austrian Presidency, the European Union took the decision to raise the visa fee to EUR 62.
This doubtless will not affect ânew Russiansâ, but will reduce opportunities for ordinary Russian citizens, not to mention Ukrainians, Belarussians and residents of other non-EU states, to visit European Union states.
As it holds the EU Presidency, how does Austria view this step and what does it believe the consequences will be?
Â Â  . I will start with the issue of the increased visa charges, which have become necessary as a consequence of the introduction of biometric data, which have made the grant of visas and the processes leading up to it a good deal more complex.
However, I hope it will answer your question when I say that, in the discussion on the increase in visa charges, the possibility of derogations was conceded not only for the countries of the Western Balkans â who are a particular priority of the Austrian Presidency â but also for those countries to which the European Neighbourhood Policy applies on the grounds of the great importance of both of them.
The relevant legal act therefore includes, among other things, the provision that the visa fee for nationals of those states with which visa facilitation agreements have been concluded, of which Russia is one.
As you will be aware, efforts are being made to conclude visa facilitation agreements with other countries as well.
I have already had occasion to observe today that visa facilitation agreements with the countries of the Western Balkans will, if at all possible, enter into force next year.
There had previously been concern that the countries with which we want to maintain particularly close relations should not have to suffer the increase in these visa charges, which were to be â and have been â imposed for reasons that are objectively perfectly understandable.
Â Â  President-in-Office, I am in the process of trying to get a visa for Russia.
It is an extremely cumbersome process: it takes 15Â working days and it costs EURÂ 71.
For me, the most difficult regulation is that you have to have a passport photo in which you do not smile.
We cannot find any of those.
Nevertheless, my question â which is slightly dangerous, as I come from Finland, which has a border of 1Â 300 km with Russia â is: what is your educated guess about the timetable for a visa-free zone?
Â Â  . I would like to ask MrÂ Stubb whether he has ever tried to get a visa to the United States, whether smiling or not.
It is probably more difficult than it is to get a visa to Russia!
In response to your question, I am afraid I cannot make an educated guess.
I beg your indulgence. I really cannot give you an answer.
I am not the representative of the Council of the European Union for this area.
I am not in the business of speculation and I would prefer to refrain from any speculation on this point.
Â Â  As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together.
Does the Council agree that biofuel production must take place in a sustainable manner that does not endanger biodiversity, avoids conversion of natural habitats into intensively cropped land and ensures that the entire production cycle both within and outside the EU, including transport of the fuel, is at least carbon neutral, and what is the Council doing to ensure the certification of sustainable biofuel production?
What progress does the Austrian Presidency hope to achieve on the basis of the biomass action plan and the strategy for biofuels put forward by the Commission?
What potential benefits does the Austrian Presidency see for European agriculture in the increased use of renewable raw materials, including the increased use of biomass and biofuels?
Â Â  The issue of the sustainability of biofuel use is generally an important one in terms of the European Unionâs sustainable energy strategy.
The fact is that we have, during the Austrian Presidency, put down a deliberate marker to the effect that Europe must, in future, as a matter of fundamental political principle, make better progress where the sustainability of biofuels in concerned.
The action plan for biomass and the EU biofuels strategy involved us having communications submitted to us, which were discussed in depth and taken forward by the Council as appropriate.
The issue under consideration is how, in future, biofuels may be used as an admixture or as new fuels for general purposes.
We see it as an indisputable truth â and as one that we must join together in communicating throughout Europe â that the production of biofuels and bio-propellants of every kind, ranging across the whole spectrum from biodiesel to ethanol, cannot work if it is detrimental to the environment.
Here in this European Union of ours, the production of biofuels, too, must be founded upon the principle of sustainability.
Having visited plenty of environmental conferences over the last few months, I can tell you that it is also important that we should take care that consideration is given to the sustainability principle in the international trade in biofuels, which are produced using the whole range of methods and the most varied raw materials.
During the Presidency â and particularly at the meeting in March of this year â we have discussed how to take Europeâs energy policy in a new direction, with particular reference to fuels.
In a conclusion dated 8Â June this year, the Council and the Commission called for proposals to be made concerning the promotion of the cost-efficient and sustainable use of biomass for heating and cooling purposes, for the revision of the legal provisions applicable to animal by-products, for the use â since biogas is going to be a live topic in the future â of by-products from agriculture and food production to be promoted as a source of renewable energy, and for an evaluation of the possible extension of the rules on energy crops to all the Member States; these are the cornerstones for the way energy is to be organised in the future.
That is vital, particularly in the aftermath of the enlargement of the European Union to include ten new Member States.
The Commission has also announced its intention of submitting a communication on the energy crops rules by the end of 2006 â which I see as a key date â and that this communication would include practical proposals for this sector.
What I mean by that is that we, in the agricultural reform of 2003, with a view to sustainability and to the creation of a new source of income for rural areas in Europe, took steps to make use of 1.5Â million hectares of sustainable raw materials for the whole range of alternative forms of energy in all areas, and it has to be clear to us today that we are very far from making full use of those 1.5Â million hectares.
The potential is there, and may well become even greater, and we await with interest the results of the evaluation and the Commissionâs proposal, and, in both the Agriculture and Environment Councils, we will, over the coming months and years, have to give in-depth consideration to the challenges of a sustainable energy policy, for sustainable and renewable energy production is the key to Europeâs independence in energy and to its future projects in the field of energy production.
Â Â  Thank you, President-in-Office, I am very glad that the Austrian Presidency has been particularly active on that.
I should just like to come to the question of certification, which was in my original question.
This morning Commissioner Piebalgs mentioned, in a question-and-answer session, that there would be certification to underwrite the sustainability of biofuels.
Certainly there has been anxiety over illegal logging and certification being difficult to get right in practice, even if it looked good on paper.
I should be grateful if you could give me a little more detail on that.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a very warm welcome to you, and I would like to ask you whether the Council is giving consideration to how much more is to be invested in research and development in this specific area.
I am convinced that this type of energy production will create jobs in rural areas and thus help implement the Lisbon Strategy.
Is the Council Presidency in possession of approximate estimates as to how many new jobs this will create in rural areas?
Â Â  . If I may start, MrsÂ Schierhuber, with your first question, on the subject of certification and labelling, we are, in creating a new energy policy for Europe, right at the beginning, not only in Europe, but also around the world.
It will be for us to take care, by implementing certification systems, to ensure sustainable alternative energy supplies from other parts of the world, since all the things to which you have referred â the deforestation of the rain forest and the production of palm oil subject to social and environmental criteria â are things we see as undesirable.
A number of approaches are being adopted; in Austria, for example, we have defined cross-compliance conditions derived from agricultural reform as the basis for energy production and also for the admixture of biodiesel and bioethanol, the consequence of which is that anything produced subject to eco-social criteria and production conditions, and to European standards, can be added irrespective of which parts of the world it comes from.
Over the coming weeks, the issue will be surfacing in the WTO, too, of how certification and legal bases be implemented in such a way that they meet the requirements of international trade and the WTO, and this is where detailed scrutiny is going to be needed; indeed, CommissionerÂ Piebalgs is being no less energetic than the EU officials and those at national level with responsibility for this, in seeking clarity in this matter in order not to settle this issue as prematurely as some others have been, only for us then to suffer defeats on the legal front and thus lose the market.
Certification and labelling are core issues.
As regards your second question on research, development and the research framework programme, a greater emphasis will be placed on alternative energy in the infrastructure as a whole as part of the innovation and research strategy, from the extraction of the raw materials right through to production and use made of it in technology.
As is also envisaged in the sphere of research and development, we will apply a great deal more effort to moving this forward.
If I may turn to the jobs issue, what, according to the estimates, is going to happen if greater reliance is placed on alternative forms of energy?
As my own countryâs minister for agriculture and the environment, I enjoy the strategic advantage of being in an absolute win-win situation, in that the use of alternative sources of energy not only has the effect of bringing about a reduction in CO2, and thereby making a substantial contribution to achieving the Kyoto targets, but also makes full use of the resources in rural areas â particularly the more isolated ones in Europe â and creates jobs in them.
An extra 30Â 000 jobs â that is the figure indicated by studies carried out by the European Union and other bodies, if we are consistent in proceeding with the achievement of alternative energy targets.
Â Â  â The European biofuel strategy lays down objectives for the European Union and obligations incumbent upon the Member States.
However, there are serious discrepancies between the Member States in terms of technological progress, market size, scale of production and fuel market structures.
I should therefore like to ask the Council if this policy perhaps needs to be re-examined.
Perhaps the introduction of obligations runs counter to current economic and technological circumstances?
Â Â  You are talking about something that is true not only of European energy policy, but also of the ways in which the nation states perceive European targets and achieve them.
All I can say is that we can see from the optional 5.75% target for biofuels that more and more countries are now joining in.
Austria has achieved this target by means of binding legislation; the Hungarians are very definitely interested, and in Germany, too, this target is already the subject of legislation that is going through the system.
A lot is being done, then, and I am very optimistic about the likelihood of the Member States consistently achieving the targets we have set down both in the biofuels strategy plan and in the plan for biomass.
I will concede, though, that this is often not just a matter of political will, but also of the way in which trends in fossil fuel prices are consistently confirming that we are going down the right road.
In discussions with our counterparts, we always reiterate the point that strategies must not only be devised at European level, but also implemented by the nation states.
Some are going on ahead, while others are lagging behind, but, at the end of the day, we are all going in the right direction.
I am very optimistic.
Â Â  Biomass is a most important form of energy, accounting for 65% of the renewable energy used in the EU.
However, the total percentage of renewable energy used in the EU has remained at 6% since 1990.
Therefore, does the Austrian Presidency agree that any realistic common energy policy should include the use of nuclear power?
Â Â  .
I can do no other than agree with you that the push for renewable energy sources is certainly not a matter for energy policy alone; it must be supported by a policy on the supply of raw materials â that is to say, agricultural and forestry policy, biomass, and agricultural production â and by action in the spheres of environmental, economic and fiscal policy.
It has to be clear to us that what we need for input, for incentives to produce, is more stringently binding agricultural targets.
In addition, the Commission's proposal will be up for debate at the end of the year, and that is a very good thing.
We are evaluating where we stand and what we have the potential to do.
We will, in June â before, that is, our presidency draws to a close â be embarking on the debate on a forestry strategy for Europe and on the assessment of ways in which forests might be used in the future, and economic and fiscal policies at national level must also make allowances for renewable energies, whether we are talking here about green power, support for heating, support in terms of equipment and infrastructure or research and development.
This is a task for all of us together, but an enormous amount is happening on this front.
Â Â  â It is well known that it is at present somewhat more expensive to produce biofuels than to use fossil fuels, and it was for that reason the alternative fuels were given favourable tax treatment, the consequence being that annual increases of some 26% are to be reckoned with.
Will the mandatory blending that the Commission is launching not have the result that the oil industry will have increasing recourse to suppliers of cheap crude oil such as Brazil and hence put our European farmers at an even greater disadvantage in the future?
Â Â  . I do not see it like that.
Giving the answers is a matter for the European Union and for all of us.
I tried earlier to show how the issue of certification might be handled.
What we in Austria did about implementation was to make a mixture of 5.75% mandatory, and we will achieve that in October 2008.
We are a very, very long way down the road towards doing that.
Facilities for producing biodiesel and ethanol are being set up, and jobs created with them; in my own province alone, a new factory for ethanol is currently creating work for 180 people.
That is what we have done, and we take responsibility for it.
We have also made it quite clear in the specifications that the products mixed must be produced in accordance with European social, environmental and agricultural standards.
If it is possible for that sort of product to be manufactured in Brazil, then Brazil is in competition with us, but even if Brazil is in a position to do that, the long distance that the products have to be transported is one of the factors that blunt its competitive edge.
We are, then, in a position to respond to this, and we can do it by means of certification and by means of decisive action on the market, which we must evaluate and defend at WTO level.
What we do not want is to establish sustainable energy policy in Europe and then end up doing something like importing the products.
Our ten new Member States â to whose number Romania and Bulgaria are soon to be added â give us incredible potential, with a very large number of plots of land capable of being set aside for the production of energy rather than of foodstuffs, and the agricultural specifications have been chosen in such a way as to make this possible.
Â Â  Question No 8 by Earn Ryan has been withdrawn.
The Commission proposal for the Euro 5 regulation on pollutant emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles is not very ambitious, particularly as regards the limit values for nitrogen oxides for diesel cars.
What action has the Council taken on this issue, and what progress has been made during the Austrian Presidency?
Â Â  . The Austrian Presidency has already seen several debates on the quite crucial issue of how to minimise and limit the pollutants produced by vehicles in transit.
We started negotiations on the Commissionâs proposal with the aim of putting in place progressive rules, with a longer-term perspective, on exhaust gases, and with the intention that these rules would â crucially in terms of our discussions today on sustainability â not only satisfy the demands of environmental policy but also give European industry the security to plan its technical development in advance.
Both of these things can be achieved through stringent imposition, in the medium term, of threshold values for emissions from â for example â diesel vehicles.
It was with this in mind that negotiations were conducted at Council level, in the hope of achieving, in June 2006 â which is almost upon us â political agreement in the Council, on the assumption that such a thing would be possible in terms of the timetable, particularly in so far as it related to Parliament.
If I might give a brief summary, it emerged from the negotiations â which, in accordance with the Austrian Presidencyâs initiative, were accompanied by two specific information seminars for the Member States, the first, in February, discussing mainly the state-of-the-art environmental requirements for removing particulates from vehicle exhausts, in particular NOx from the exhausts of diesel cars, while a second is to be held on 22Â June â that a broad majority among the Member States have expressed themselves in favour of this objective, concerning which there are already to be definite and binding discussions in relation to the stipulation of Euro-6 limits.
We will, of course, be consistent in moving this issue forward.
It is absolutely vital that both air strategy and the implementation of Euro-5 and Euro-6 be discussed at the next Environment Council at the end of June.
We want to take an ambitious approach to these things.
In view of the discussion on the PM10 issue, on particulates pollution, particularly in Central Europe, and on NOx values, it is important that unambiguous rules be put in place, for it must be clear to us that what our industry needs is the security to plan ahead, and that it is, worldwide, in competition with other vehicle manufacturers, some of whom have already ventured some very ambitious responses.
As these matters progress, we want to move forwards for the sake of environmental safety and quality of life in Europe and also for the sake of the health of the people who live in the areas affected.
We will, then, endeavour to maintain this tricky balance between Euro-5 and Euro-6 as perspectives, as well, possibly, as Nx and PM10 as means of achieving environment targets, and, on the other hand, the desire to keep Europeâs automobile industry competitive.
