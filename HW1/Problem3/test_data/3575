President Prodi only referred to this briefly at the end of his statement, just now, but we would have liked the document to address this issue in more detail.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am familiar with the lengthy list of measures in the Commissionâs programme for 2004.
Nonetheless, as I see it, one intangible measure is conspicuous by its absence.
A way must be found to restore the harmonious balance between Parliament and the Commission.
It is to that strategic alliance that so many advances in the project of EuropeanÂ Union were due.
Nowadays we think of ourselves as citizens of a Union, not as mere consumers in a large market.
The concept of a consumer implies the existence of a market.
The concept of citizenship, however, demands and requires the existence of a Parliament as a .
Such a Parliament needs to be a functioning entity.
It must be able to imbue the project of integration with legitimacy.
It must also be in a position to audit the Commissioners appointed, to invest the Commission, and to exercise democratic control over the latter.
It has to be a Parliament capable of debate, rebuttal, ratification and rectification.
It must be a Parliament firmly anchored in the real world that is not vain enough to court stardom.
It must not adopt an arrogant stance either.
Such a Parliament is certainly called upon to cooperate with the Commission, as the latter is a key institution in the project for European integration.
Nonetheless, Parliament must also continue to play a vital and leading role in the future.
It is the political engine powering the whole project and disseminating progress achieved.
This vital cooperation between Parliament and the Commission must not prevent the Commission from continuing with its activities.
The Commission must always be governed by criteria of transparency, clarity, honesty and efficiency.
For its part, Parliament must also demonstrate a capacity to distinguish between the essential and the ancillary.
It must not succumb to the temptation of adopting a permanently hostile attitude to the Commission.
It must exercise its rights and duties, in other words, its responsibilities to the citizens, with a sense of proportion, responsibility and in a measured manner.
Sadly, MrÂ Baron, leader of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, has been found wanting in this respect.
It is unfortunate that he is absent at the moment.
MrÂ Baron raised doubts concerning the activities of MrsÂ deÂ Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission.
MrsÂ deÂ Palacio has a fine record of defending European interests.
Many have good cause to be grateful to her.
Further, she is irrevocably committed to the cause of the victims of terrorism and to the cause of freedom and the right to life in the BasqueÂ Country.
I have to say, MrÂ President, that I was surprised to hear MrÂ Baron speak of awarding so-called compatibility certificates when you consider he occupies a seat in this House whilst simultaneously holding a seat on the Madrid town council.
In conclusion, I should like to state that the measures proposed by the PresidentÂ ofÂ theÂ Commission are on the right lines, taking into account also developments in what has become known as the Eurostat case.
Even though I am of a different political persuasion, I have no doubts as to the integrity of the Commissioner in question.
There is a general reluctance to stick oneâs neck out for anyone these days.
Nonetheless, I am prepared to vouch for the honesty of the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat, and for the measures he has proposed concerning amendment of OLAFs remit.
These measures are on the right lines and aim to restore that strategic alliance and harmonious balance between Parliament and the Commission on which so much of the progress made in the EuropeanÂ Union project is based.
Â Â  â Mr President, many EU citizens consider bureaucratic Brussels as something that does not concern them.
The challenge which faced the newly-elected Parliament and the Commission in 1999 was to change this attitude.
Over the past couple of years, the Commission has published different proposals for administrative reform within the framework of the European treaties.The Kinnock reforms focused on human resources policy and a result-oriented budget.
Via the European Parliament, a whistle-blowing regulation was introduced.
Thanks to the White Paper on good governance, we obtained programmes for the codification and simplification of existing legislation.
Legislative programmes were said to be reduced by 35Â 000 pages.
As proposed by Parliament, an interinstitutional agreement was adopted on better legislation, containing proposals for alternative forms of regulation, with the option for Parliament and the Council to have a monitoring role as legislators.
The Convention subsequently resulted in a reduction in the number of types of decisions from twenty-seven to only six.
It also led to a clear and adequate distribution of tasks between Europe and the Member States, and a greater role for local and regional authorities.
We would like to give Europe back to the citizen, to adopt policy from the bottom up.
Accordingly, we are giving the national parliaments a greater role in order to help us in the European Parliament to monitor compliance with subsidiarity.
Keep things at a national level where possible and do at European level what has to be done in a European context.
We are therefore carrying out reforms both within and outside of the framework of the Treaties.
Thanks to these, Europe will be able to perform better and more democratically, for example in the area of cross-border crime.
What is irritating is that those achievements are sometimes at risk of being cancelled out by incidents such as Eurostat.
Quite apart from the matter itself, it is of major importance for the Commissioners' political responsibility for their officials to be 100% possible and clear, not soon but now.
The citizens and the European Parliament want a democracy, not a technocracy.
Thanks to the White Paper and many actions that have subsequently been taken by Parliament and by the Commission, better and more effective legislation and administration have been established to a great extent.
This has been done by guaranteeing access to documents for the citizens, by remaining committed to a modern human resources policy and a result-oriented budget, by working on announced impact assessments, for example in the economic, social and environmental fields, and by actually implementing the interinstitutional agreement.
Actions speak louder than words.
In a nutshell, we are working towards a recognisable and approachable European administration.
In this respect, the coming into being of the constitution will be crucial to the European citizens.
We need results in 2004.
There is no need for an electoral handbrake; this is not about winning the battle of Italy, but the battle of winning the hearts and minds of the European public.
We would ask Italy to launch into an energetic final sprint, and I know that Italians are experts when it comes to cycling and final sprints.
We would wish Mr Prodi and his Commission that success in 2004.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Council representative, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with everything Mr Salafranca has said on Eurostat and, in this opinion, I would point out the rightful need for a transparent response, which has been fully met by what the Commission has done and by the action plan presented today.
It is worrying that we should continue to exploit this matter for political ends, blowing out of all proportion a question which is certainly not central to the life of the Union, while the Iraq tragedy strikes once again, reminding us of our inability to act and, what is more, our hypocrisy in the face of a war which was started to combat terrorism but which has ultimately served only to fuel it.
We are not involved.
We do not have our finger on the worldâs pulse.
Our times demand a great injection of political measures, giving Europe a soul and making it more than a wounded, helpless giant that some people continue today to want to see caught in the vice of bureaucratic neutrality: we need more politics of the kind proposed in Mr Prodiâs document, which he has addressed as a European citizen to his own country, first and foremost, but which applies to the Union as a whole and to all its political groupings, including the members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Poettering, the many Christian democrats whom you should be representing as well, who cannot sit back and accept any shift to the right.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank MrÂ Prodi most sincerely for appearing before the CommitteeÂ onÂ BudgetaryÂ Control.
I should also like to thank him for addressing the House today and giving such a clear account of concerns for the future.
We strongly agree that it is necessary to work for the future and to improve on what has not been done well so far.
We are therefore glad to hear talk of reforming the reform, if I may put it like that.
In other words, despite reforms or attempts at reform some things have not gone well.
Further reform is needed.
We were also glad to hear MrÂ Prodi speak of increased transparency in the future.
Nonetheless, MrÂ Prodi, Members of the House also like to discuss what has taken place during these four years and what has not worked well.
Parliamentâs critical approach is aimed in fact at improving things in the future.
We hope it will be possible to avoid repeating some of the difficulties we are currently confronted with.
This is why we could have welcomed more detailed responses from you on certain issues, MrÂ Prodi.
We need to be confident that the problems currently causing us serious concern will not recur in the future.
We are concerned because we in Parliament wish to work with the Commission.
We want to cooperate to strengthen and improve European institutions still further.
What is needed is a strong Parliament alongside a strong Commission, MrÂ Prodi.
For this reason we in the Committee on Budgetary Control adopt a critical and demanding approach.
At the same time, it is of course a positive approach.
MrÂ Prodi, you must be in no doubt that our aim is for the Commission to become better and stronger as we go forward into the future.
After all, that is the message we have to deliver when we stand in the European elections.
We will be telling the citizens that they must vote in elections to the EuropeanÂ Parliament to promote still stronger institutions.
That is the positive message we must convey.
We would like to work with the Commission to get it across.
MrÂ Prodi, please bear in mind therefore that our criticism is always positive and is aimed at facilitating solutions acceptable to all.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that behind every legislative programme lies a political project.
From this point of view, 2004 ought to be the year that will allow us to reconcile two absolutely essential objectives of our Union: peace and prosperity.
In other words, we have no chance of successfully meeting any of the challenges that await us in 2004 unless we re-lay the foundations for prosperity on our continent.
The third objective set for 2004 by the Commission, sustainable development, is therefore absolutely essential in the light of the Unionâs current economic situation.
In this context my group dares to hope that the Commission will make employment a clear priority, because neither enlargement nor a new constitution will be acceptable to our fellow citizens unless we first turn our attention to the issue of employment.
To do so, we also need investment, both private and public, in human resources and we need a return to a level of growth that is sufficient to increase the quality of life of our fellow citizens.
We must not rely solely on variations in interest rates or on the outside world to deliver growth areas for the Union.
We might perhaps regret the fact, moreover, that the Commission has not, in its wide-ranging programme for 2004, addressed more explicitly the question of economic governance, above all given that the conditions in which the Commission is intending to prepare the spring summit, particularly as regards the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, do not yet appear to be quite clear.
We need to know under what conditions the new Commission will have to implement the follow-up to this strategy and with this in mind, it might perhaps be useful for the outgoing Commission to draft an assessment of the first phase of the strategy.
Lastly, it seems to me that the Commissionâs programme ought to give a higher profile to the issue of sustainable development.
I also note that despite a totally unrealistic number of new legislative proposals, some omissions can be observed.
Firstly, there is not a word about the second reading of the directive on investment services, when it is a text on which we have done a great deal of work.
I therefore dare to hope that we will be able to complete it before the end of this parliamentary term.
The same goes for the review of the Financial Services Action Plan and the extension of the use of the Lamfalussy procedure.
This Commission and this Parliament ought to conclude work on all of these dossiers in the course of 2004.
Let me finish by saying how surprised I am, MrÂ President of the Commission, that your legislative programme, which is so heavy and so crowded, does not even mention a framework directive on services of general interest, something that my group and this House as a whole have repeatedly requested, and for which the Convention also expressed a strong desire.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I turn to you, MrÂ President, in your capacity as chairman of the Conference of Presidents.
As you know, the parliamentary committees have been fully involved in preparing the legislative and work programme that MrÂ Prodi has just presented.
It is thanks to this interinstitutional dialogue that today we have a programme for 2004 that largely reflects the shared priorities of our institutions.
Nevertheless, there is certainly still room for improvement.
Although the Commission has not taken account of all the requests made by the parliamentary committees, experience shows that the reliability of the timetables could be further improved.
By way of an example, seventeen of the twenty-two proposals for codecision in the 2004 programme have already appeared in previous annual programmes and ought therefore to have been tabled long ago.
It is therefore essential for both parties to monitor this programme carefully.
In this context I would remind you that last year Parliament put forward the idea of having policy papers for each legislative area.
These would form the basis for more detailed programming and would also be entirely in keeping with the objectives of the interinstitutional agreement on âBetter Law-Makingâ, which requires the three institutions to both better coordinate and better synchronise their legislative work.
I would stress the three institutions because the Council is not currently involved in the structured dialogue.
At the next Brussels meeting of the European Council, the Councilâs first multiannual programme will be presented.
It would be helpful if the European Parliament could be informed of the programme in good time precisely so as to establish a constructive dialogue between the three institutions concerned.
I will also take the liberty of drawing your attention to the need to agree a procedure for an dialogue with the Commission for the year 2004.
We will be addressing this issue this afternoon in the Conference of Presidents.
But in my opinion it is essential that every effort be made to ensure that all of the stakeholders, including national parliaments and advisory bodies and, at the end of the day, the European public, have a legislative programme for the year 2005 in good time.
If it is true that the current Commission really will be able to present its political strategy and budget for 2005 to the Union before October of next year then it should also be able to present its legislative programme during the course of that same month of October.
Last year, I said here that I was convinced that, thanks to the structured dialogue, we were seeing the establishment of a genuine culture of planning and interinstitutional programming.
The experiences of these last few months and the prospects for the future are in line with the interinstitutional agreement on âBetter Law-Makingâ and fully confirm my optimism.
It is up to all of us to work on this together in the interests of our fellow citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this is the year in which it was planned to conclude the programme laid down at the TampereÂ EuropeanÂ Council.
In addition, in the short time remaining we need to integrate the ten new states into this objective.
The objective remains unfixed.
We have repeatedly expressed Parliamentâs concerns about the integration of the Tampere objectives in the acceding countries.
As regards the internal situation, I am very concerned at the length of listÂ 4 at this late stage.
This is the list awaiting decision by the legislator.
It contains the directive concerning conditions of entry and stay in the EuropeanÂ Union for reasons of work or study.
It also contains the decision to be taken on granting asylum status and the minimum conditions for people to request asylum in Europe.
The statute of long-term residents and the directive on family reunification should also be on the list.
Although a decision has been taken on the latter there are countless exceptions to it, to the extent that there is really nothing to choose between having this directive and having fifteen different sets of legislation.
True, this is a problem for the Council.
Nonetheless, it is also the Commissionâs responsibility to defend the programme it has itself proposed and to defend it strongly.
The programme is good, consistent and global.
The Commission must defend it as MrÂ Prodi stated a few weeks ago before the House when he spoke following the tragedy of the victims in Italy.
Sadly, that tragedy was repeated in Spain.
MrÂ Prodi, you can count on our support in defending the programme before the Council.
The Council is currently exerting strong pressure to establish disjointed measures regarding what it terms illegal immigration.
These measures are doomed to failure.
I am not making an ideological statement.
Rather, I am stating it is clearly impossible to take account only of the point of view of ministers responsible for home affairs in as complex and global an issue as immigration.
I urge you to put immigration in its broadest sense on the agenda for relations with our neighbours.
It has to be a factor in achieving stability and prosperity.
Immigration also needs to be linked to employment, as has already been the case.
You can count on our support over this.
There is also an extensive list of decisions outstanding in the field of cooperation over criminal issues.
Curiously, that list contains, amongst others, the directives on the protection of the Communityâs interests and combating people trafficking.
As I said, this is curious.
I appeal to you to deal with these issues as a matter of priority.
Once again, you can rely on Parliamentâs support.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission President began his statement this morning by saying that the Union is in a good state of health.
What planet is he on?
The Stability Pact, one of the foundations of our single currency, is in jeopardy, and the single currency is one of the pillars of this entire Union.
With his extremely ill-considered description of the Pact as the âStupidity Pactâ, the Commission President has himself contributed to its derailment.
Two major countries have blatantly departed from compliance with the Stability Pactâs rules.
Regrettably, this includes my own country, which pushed for the launch of the Pact in the first place.
How, and with what authority, does the Commission President intend to call these countries to order given that he himself has helped to undermine the Pact?
What is the Commission President actually doing to counter the threat to the Pact which also emanates from the Conventionâs draft?
Who actually authorised the Convention to delete the goal of price stability from the catalogue of Union objectives?
Price stability is the basis of the Unionâs entire monetary constitution.
In Germany, we lobbied for our publicâs endorsement of the single currency and the phasing out of the Deutschmark by assuring them that price stability and the independence of the Central Bank would be guaranteed.
We will feel cheated if the goal of price stability is now softened and price stability is put on the backburner.
That is why, Mr Prodi, we expect you to give Commissioner Solbes your backing on this matter, not stab him in the back.
As a second point, you mentioned the Lisbon strategy.
In ten yearsâ time, we will supposedly be the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world.
Is this anything more than empty words?
Believe me, Mr President, you will need to change your legislative culture in more ways than one if we are to achieve this objective!
Â Â  MrÂ President, Italy currently holds the Presidency of the Council, and a distinguished Italian, MrÂ Prodi, is President of the Commission. Consequently my first words must surely be words of condolence to the Italian people following the tragic events of recent days.
I should like to turn now to a subject MrÂ Prodi dwelt on at length, namely the issue of controls.
In modern organisations it falls to the administration of political power or of legislative power to exercise control.
MrÂ Baron, leader of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, referred earlier to the Casaca report on the importance of Parliament as a source of political power.
There are also the legislative controls.
As MrÂ Baron said previously, duplication of administrative controls must be prevented.
Administrative controls have their place within administration.
I do not believe, however, that the outstanding issues before us today can ever be adequately dealt with without an ordered system of political and legislative control.
Secondly, the Commissionâs legislative programme focuses on enlargement.
In this connection I am bound to reflect the very grave concerns felt by this House following the Commissionâs latest monitoring report presented by MrÂ Verheugen in plenary.
We wonder how many of the acceding countries really are in a position to transpose the Community between now and 1Â May.
In the event of one or more of these countries failing to fulfil the relevant requirements, we wonder too what measures the Commission intends to propose and what measures the Council intends to adopt to prevent such countries joining the Community.
I also have to say that this House was taken aback by the LatvianÂ Governmentâs decision to relieve one of its members of the duty of observer at the EuropeanÂ Parliament, because the member concerned had expressed opinions at variance with the official government line.
This is all linked to the issue of minority populations in the BalticÂ States.
The question arises as to whether these countries are meeting the fundamental Copenhagen criterion of having an open and functioning democratic system in place.
The legislative programme also contains a reference to the Unionâs new neighbours.
In particular, there is a suggestion of creating common areas for matters of justice and home affairs together with Russia and Ukraine.
I would remind you of recent events in those countries.
Leaders of industry have been arrested, imprisoned and tried.
It seems likely that this was done for political reasons, not for strictly legal ones.
One might well wonder how much we could have in common with governments of that ilk.
Finally, I should like to raise an issue touched upon by MrÂ Clegg and MrÂ vanÂ denÂ Berg amongst others.
I refer to the adoption of the interinstitutional agreement.
I note that the President failed to refer to this agreement in any way.
Though it is recent, this agreement is of major importance.
It would be appropriate for the Commission to provide the House with some information on the implications of this agreement for the Commissionâs legislative programme.
Â Â  Mr President, I would begin by emphasising some of the remarks made in this Chamber today regarding our concern about EU accounting.
That concern is more widespread than I can recall on any previous occasion.
Looking at Annex 3 of the Communication from the Commission, I am particularly concerned to see that the Prodi Commission is claiming great success in this area.
Its commitment to achieve a broad programme of internal reform includes agreeing a new financial regulation for the management of Community funds.
However, there is nothing new about the Eurostat crisis or the background to it, while the Court of Auditors has been unable to sign off the accounts for nine successive years
Let us not say that Parliament is suddenly completely in the clear over this.
Parliament has, notwithstanding the approach taken by the Court of Auditors, passed those accounts year-in year-out, so there is no doubt whatsoever that the Commission has been led to the view that these were not matters of sufficiently high concern to Parliament.
If that has changed I welcome it.
Why do I welcome it?
Because at this moment EU citizens regard the Commission as synonymous with negatives as regards fraud, maladministration and shoddy accounting.
I very much regret that and take the view that the European Union's image should be improved.
We look to the Commission to address that issue.
How can it do this?
Very simply by addressing the concerns that have been raised, by not disregarding those concerns and by taking action in relation to the position of the whistleblowers who have drawn them to public attention.
There are currently three such persons who have been suspended from their duties.
I call on the Commissioner to take action to ensure that those people who have drawn attention to the scandals relating to EU accounting, and whose current suspension is completely misunderstood by the people of Europe, are restored to the role of clearing up the EU's accounts.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to focus on the issue of culture, and I welcome the Commissionâs endeavours in the field of education, youth and culture, also for 2003.
For 2004, you list a work programme with seven proposals of interest to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
I must start by voicing criticism of the fact that these work and action programmes are always submitted relatively late in the day.
As a result, we are currently negotiating the programmes for youth, culture, organisations and vocational training.
We are under enormous time pressure and have to find solutions under these conditions. Otherwise, the programmes for next year will fail and will not be implemented.
No one wants to be exposed to this criticism and, above all, this responsibility.
The priorities of the Commissionâs action programme for 2004 do not necessarily lie in the area of education, youth and culture.
For specific reasons, it has other priorities, such as enlargement, parliamentary elections, economic security etc. Nonetheless, I would ask the Commission not to neglect education, youth and culture.
In the planning timetable for this year, the objectives set were far higher than actually achieved.
I am thinking, for example, of legislative proposals which should have been adopted in September or October, such as the Europass Training, European CV, etc. but which were postponed, may be adopted at the end of this year, and in some cases will be implemented in 2004.
The post-2006 training programmes are a case in point, which are a key aspect of cultural policy.
I therefore call on the Commission to adopt the pledged proposals to ensure that they can at least pass through their first reading in Parliament during this electoral term.
I wish to draw particular attention to the legislative proposals in the audiovisual sector, which are supposed to be submitted in December.
There is still no text submitted for the long-announced revision of the Television without Frontiers Directive.
What we have instead is an apparently never-ending consultation process by the Commission.
The accession of ten new Member States, stability and sustainable growth are undoubtedly important, but this does not mean that culture and education should be overlooked.
Education must be a priority for enlargement.
Topics should be interlinked.
The focus should not always be on economic and political linkage.
Culture and education must be integrated more fully, education as the basis for progress and development in the European Union, and culture as a prerequisite for community relations, dialogue and respect for cultural diversity.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to concur with the words spoken, to my great delight, by Mr Nassauer, namely that the implementation of the 2004 work programme is starting under a very dark cloud, particularly on account of the fact that the two key countries, France and Germany, which, in the framework of the EMU, invented the Stability Pact, have, five years down the line, pretty much forgotten the promises they made.
And that the architects of this pact have shifted from being strong to being weak, from being stable to being unstable, from being reliable to being unreliable, and from having a sense of responsibility to having no sense of responsibility.
These are the terrible facts that were also recently reaffirmed on Dutch television by the director of the Dutch Bank, when he also remarked that without a Stability Pact, there would not have been a euro and that we are even being taken for a ride by those who have drafted this Stability Pact.
It is under this cloud that further discussions on the EU's enlargement are taking place.
There are a few more countries waiting to join.
In my view, it is very important for us to doggedly persevere with honest and coherent policy, and also to remain strict with those countries in respect of the criteria, particularly where the issues of the rule of law, democracy and good neighbourliness are concerned.
It is unwise to treat the Balkan countries as if the race were already over.
Those countries will first need to prove that they belong in the European Union.
In addition, the introduction of criteria other than those previously agreed should be rejected, such as differences in religion, the size of the country or of the population, any strategic location, political benefits, the date of membership application, historical relations or economic benefit.
These are all elements which, naturally, occur to everyone sooner or later, but it would be extremely bad if these were to exclude or relativise the agreed criteria.
Mr Verheugen mentioned the need for more common foreign and security policy in the light of enlargement.
What is the Council's position on that?
Does it share Commissioner Verheugen's view that we, because of enlargement, should strive towards a common foreign and security policy with all the more urgency?
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eurostat affair is now a matter of public knowledge; it is a scandal and we cannot erase it.
What we can do, however, is learn lessons from it.
Firstly, this means that in future, the Commission must listen to Parliament, the directly elected assembly representing Europeâs citizens, instead of disregarding Parliamentâs reports out of a strange mixture of ignorance and arrogance.
Had the Commission listened, the matter would not have assumed such proportions.
Secondly, we have an obligation towards our citizens to rectify the things that have occurred during this period, that is, during our, and your, term in office.
We have put forward a number of proposals in this context.
The report will be tabled in this House shortly. It has already been adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Among other things, it raises the issue of the financial regulation, which you have not touched on at all so far.
For example, it addresses the fact that it is apparently still possible for firms to enter into contracts with the European Commission without being required to disclose details of their financial circumstances.
There are firms that have their company headquarters in the Bahamas and it is rumoured that some European Commission officials are behind them.
That must change.
Directorates-General can currently exist outside the scrutiny of auditors.
That must change too.
Eurostat is a case in point.
This is not good, and we must change this situation.
Thirdly, we propose that the financial regulation or the internal rules be amended so that internal audit capacities are subordinate to the Head of Internal Audit.
Had this been the case, the Eurostat issue would not have occurred on this scale.
We want a solution, MrÂ Prodi, and we want it now, not in one or two yearsâ time.
We must act now.
The things that have happened must be rectified, and then we can restore votersâ confidence.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to President Prodi for coming to the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning.
The plan of action that he presented to us needs some commentary, and I would like, in the first instance, to deal with the continuing failure to sort out the issue of communication between the administration and the Commission â by which I mean the Commissioners, even though I can see how many measures already exist on paper; the September 1999 code of conduct, the âCharter for Delegated Authorising Officersâ of December 2000, and so on. I do believe that what we need in this area is not new rules, but the application of the ones that already exist, and that is what I want to press for.
Secondly, it is clear that new mechanisms have to be created to do this.
President Prodi, let me warn you most urgently not to create even more bodies, but instead to strengthen the ones we have and implement reforms where these are needed.
I see little point in this new machinery to collect all the information on possible instances of fraud.
I see no point in having a body to uncover financial irregularities.
I do not see that there is any need to set up a management committee as a replacement for OLAFâs Supervisory Committee.
You have touched on a great deal, and there is good in that, but the issue of whistleblowing still has to be sorted out.
Reference has already been made to the fact that it is no longer a live issue.
There is so much for us to do together, and so I urge you, before you issue the communication, to take Parliament seriously, to talk with us, to have a look at the BÃ¶sch report, so that we do not go down false trails.
To do so would harm the European budget and hence the European taxpayer.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to begin, as did the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, by expressing my pleasure at the presence of President Romano Prodi in the meeting of that committee this morning.
This was a first positive sign, which we cannot ignore, that the Commission is now prepared to listen to us more closely than it has done in the past, and we must therefore note this fact.
I also wish to note something else that cannot be ignored and that is the fact that the internal hearings, both at central and Eurostat level, have worked well and independently.
This is an extremely positive outcome of the current reform.
Secondly, I wish to say that, where Eurostat is concerned, responsibilities must be defined, some mechanisms are working much more slowly than they should, but something is at last happening.
I also wish to say that I fail to understand why the Publications Service, the body financially responsible for allocating funds to Planistat, has to date taken no action, opened no enquiry and held no one responsible.
Why has the body that provided most of the appropriations misused by the company CSD â and this is a body that depends on external aid â not been called to account or been subject to any action, with everything carrying on as if nothing had happened outside Eurostat?
If the Commission wants to have us believe that it is going to take the principle of accountability seriously, it is absolutely crucial that it adopt measures concerning these two Commission departments.
Otherwise, we will not be able to take the Commission seriously.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr President of the Commission, have proposed increased stability and security as a priority for your programme, and that is only to be welcomed.
Among other things in relation to this, you propose taking steps towards the establishment of joint border control.
For that you have our entire support.
In so doing, you will ultimately be acceding to our demands, for we have always wanted the same high standards to apply on all our external borders after enlargement, and precautions need to be taken for that to be the case.
Last week, at a press conference, you again suggested establishing, at the very outset, an agency to take over the work of control and coordination.
This would be the sixteenth agency, and what we have learned so far about agencies can be summed up by saying that we have forgotten the names of many of them, we have forgotten what they do, and that we are most aware of them at the time of the Budget, when we notice â generally after they have been in existence for only a few years â that the outgoings are mushrooming.
All that comes into my mind is that we should propose setting up an agency to examine the other agenciesâ efficiency and consider whether we need any more of them.
What we would like is for the means of control and coordination to be set up within the Commission or in close association with it, for the sake of efficient external borders control.
We need control, we need coordination, we need the efficient use of resources, but under no circumstances do we have any need of an agency.
My second point is that you say that there must be tough action taken against illegal immigrants and something done to integrate those who are here legally.
In that you have our full support, but please take action once and for all; see to it that return agreements are in place, not just with Macao or Hong Kong, but with the states from which migrants actually come.
There is one thing you must not do, and that is, to offer the abolition of visas as a ; instead, provide something that will be more help, namely trade facilities and economic aid, so that emigration ceases to be necessary.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly, I want to draw attention to the absence of a number of issues in the social policy area.
Secondly, I want to stress the need to be careful not to damage our European institutions by blowing up into a major scandal matters which are important in relation to Eurostat but which, bearing in mind the prospective elections, might do untold damage to our institutions if pursued too strongly.
It is deeply regrettable that the Commission has still not come forward with the promised initiatives highlighted again and again by the European Parliament: the collective rights of employees, social security for atypical workers, protection against individual dismissal, revision of the working time directive and of the European Works Council directive.
The Commission also seems to be stalling on the other important areas, such as minimum income.
It has produced a detailed study on the costs of non-social Europe which concluded that, while the so-called costs of social policy are usually immediately visible, the benefits are more difficult to identify and quantify.
However, that social policy contributes to the quality of the labour market and the formation of social capital.
In view of the recent coverage of, for example, charges for wheelchairs at Dublin Airport by Ryanair, it is important that the Commission comes forward with the promised regulation on the contract between passengers and airlines, particularly for passengers with disabilities.
It is obvious from the opening speeches in this morning's debate that the election campaign is already under way.
I would ask Members to be particularly careful not to undermine the confidence of Europe's electorate by going over the top about scandals.
It is important to root out corruption, but we should be extremely cautious how we present this to our electorate.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by impressing upon us two mottos for the Commission and for our own work.
The first is this: âNot in the beginning is the reward, but only in consistent perseverance, the setting and achievement of objectivesâ.
And the second is this: âHe who does not take himself seriously will not be taken seriously by othersâ.
Although we went into the Convention aiming to make Europe more transparent, to bring it closer to its citizens and to make it more democratic, we have not yet made that a reality. The objectives are more relevant than ever.
So, Mr President of the Commission, he who would make Europe more transparent must be prepared to know his own tasks and pursue objectives in a consistent way.
What that means is that I am calling for greater earnestness, a more earnest approach to Parliament, to our resolutions, to our aims, to our fears and criticisms and to make our self-image as a corporate body a reality.
We get more and more proposals that actually ought never to have emerged from the Commission: on lines of credit for consumers; the Chemicals Directive; for the prohibition of discrimination, which flies in the face of economic reality; there is the harmonisation of duty on diesel, which has been thought through sector by sector rather than as a whole.
I urge you to take up your collegial responsibility; with specific reference to Eurostat and to the statements you have made today, I demand that you take your political responsibility more seriously.
With the Stability and Growth Pact in mind, I demand that you insist on compliance with the law.
We read in your programme your call for better coordination of the Member Statesâ economic and budgetary policies, but I can tell you that we have no need of better coordination; what we need is compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.
To do that would make for enough coordination!
I call upon you to take initiatives to strengthen the internal market, competition policy and social cohesion.
If you also put yourself at the head of projects to create a sense of European identity, that will play a part in making European policy domestic policy, so that the internal politics of the Council will not be able to block European projects, for which people at home will blame the Commission and Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, it is true that, with the European elections and the end of the term of office of this Commission approaching, the flow of history cannot be changed in the few remaining months.
Nonetheless, the Commission must obviously continue to see its job through to the end.
In the transport sector, I want to say that important work has been done over all these years: the single European sky, the two railway packages, the liberalisation of port services and the new proposal for the trans-European networks where, of course, I want to point out that the main issue is not so much the legislative proposal as funding, about which I personally have certain doubts.
In all events, I think that, in the transport sector, the main issue from now on is that we and the Commission need to join forces and convince the Council about certain issues which have been pending for about two years now, so that they can be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.
For example, the Meijer report on urban transport is a classic example and, what we need is to use the time from now until the elections in order to advance a number of other issues, such as the harmonisation of certain social dimensions in the road transport sector, the amended proposal for a regulation on action by the Member States concerning the terms under which public services are provided in the rail, road and internal waterway transport sectors and the ban on heavy goods vehicles at weekends, which is also an issue that has been dragging on for a very long time.
Similarly, as far as regional policy is concerned, although it is not a strictly legislative matter, I want to point out that the Commission needs to present the third report on cohesion as quickly as possible, so that the European Parliament has an opportunity to take a position on this very important issue before the European elections.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us consider the Eurostat affair.
I am very disappointed by the measures announced by President Prodi, which indicate that the will to really tackle these problems is absent.
Above all, I note the absence of changes in structure and personnel, for example changes to the responsibilities of the three Commissioners concerned.
Let me just remind you how this House, right at the beginning of this Commissionâs term of office, wanted to hold fast to the separation of the budget and budgetary control, precisely in order to avoid the conflicts of interest that face us now.
I find no trace of any serious reprimand for the three Commissioners responsible, making it clear that they were in breach of their supervisory responsibilities and of their duty of care.
That, Mr President, is something that every ordinary employee, in similar circumstances, has to guarantee in the course of his employment.
Thirdly, the controls must be made much more effective, as Eurostat is, in my view, a shining example of how all the Commissionâs checks and balances can fail.
It would have been easy for you to take at least one or two of these three possible courses of action, but you have taken none of them.
What this means, Mr Prodi, is that, for the second time since 25 September, you have failed to draw a line under the affair and regain the trust of Parliament and the public.
There is one thing that I will not under any circumstances allow you to get away with, and that is your assertion that the reform of the Commission will be completed only in 2004 and that a Eurostat case will no longer be possible.
Let me tell you that the opposite will be the case, as your reforms and the new Financial Regulation will weaken control still further.
As a result of the abolition of the independent auditors, the Directors-General possess power to an unparalleled degree.
Let me ask you this: is that really what you want?
Democracy needs control, and an entity as deficient in democracy as the Commission certainly does.
Â Â  Mr President I should like to thank President Prodi for coming here today.
This is the fourth time running I have been here to listen to his presentation.
Indeed, it is the fourth year running that his Commission has failed to get a positive statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors for its accounts, and the ninth time running that the Commission, as an entity, has failed to do so.
I am aware that no one in Mr Prodi's Commission accepts political responsibility for anything, but am sure there are members of the Commission who have political antennae and can sense the mood of Parliament when it comes to the problems found at Eurostat and in the accounting system.
I personally consider that MrÂ Prodi has weakened his position and the Commission's position by stepping into Italian domestic politics, which is something I am sure he should not be doing.
I think he makes the Commission slightly more impotent by admitting that Commissioners currently have no political responsibility.
With Eurostat he has shut the stable door too late, a long time after the horses have bolted, and is looking to blame the messengers rather than resolving the problem.
However, I would like to talk very briefly about the whistleblowers' charter, which is something I know MrÂ Prodi mentioned in the Committee on Budgetary Control's meeting earlier today, because his Commission's biggest failing has been the way it has treated some of the whistleblowers.
The Commission has been a kangaroo court.
It has suspended those who raise questions and problems and has actually rewarded those who have been involved in covering these things up.
I also want to be positive, because I know that ten new Commissioners will be coming into your midst as of May 2004.
As well as wanting to see an independent OLAF, I would like the Commission to consider the possibility of one of those Commissioners assuming responsibility for budgetary control and the internal audit service of the Commission, because the sooner it is separated from the budgetary function itself, the sooner we may start to make headway as regards these problems.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, all the political strategies presented are certainly very attractive, but, in many cases, they could come up against obstacles of varying size if they are not supported by a completely reliable organisational and administrative system.
The accession of the new countries, which we planned, promoted and achieved all together, must take place within a solid, transparent framework in order to avoid creating major problems for the Community staff, who are already being called upon to take on more work, or damaging the image and credibility of the European Parliament.
Therefore, the priorities and major decisions must have the necessary support of a Europe which works, which is transparent and, most importantly, which can account for how Community funds are spent and used.
The Eurostat affair does nothing to further that cause.
It pained me to hear Mr Procacci, who had not read the OLAF reports or the audit, describing this as a minor incident; if we were to read the reports he would realise that they are extremely disturbing.
It is therefore the responsibility of the Commission to step up the controls that have proved to be as watertight as sieves thus far, improving the system in such a way as to distinguish between monitoring and controls, on the one hand, and operational management â officials granting authorisations â on the other.
Furthermore, the Consultative Committee for market operations, which operated under the previous Financial Regulation, has been abolished, and yet it has become clear that many transactions were not made subject to any requirement of economic benefit, transparency or contractual legitimacy, creating a kind of free zone, in which, even after 1999, or maybe especially after 1999, orders could be assigned with only one firm taking part, often where there was a conflict of interests and with unsigned contracts, leading to damage to Community finances, the extent of which it is difficult to assess.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank MrÂ Prodi for coming to the House today and also for coming before the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I shall endeavour to be brief.
MrÂ Prodi, concerning what you have grandiloquently termed the EurostatÂ ActionÂ Plan, I suggest this is merely chapter three of a work in which chapters one and two are lacking.
The missing chapter one should have been entitled âfactsâ and the missing chapter two âresponsibilitiesâ.
This chapter on measures to be adopted would be chapter three.
As I have already stated at the Committee on Budgetary Control, I believe these measures are absurd, curious and outdated.
They are absurd because the person or body to be controlled is actually charged with informing the controller of possible infringements.
They are curious because coordination committees are not what is needed to follow up allegations and seek the truth.
Instead, compliance and immediate investigation of the truth are called for.
Alternatively, the information should be placed before the judicial authorities.
The measures are outdated because auditors have repeatedly stated the need to break away from the guidelines of Directors-General who have control over them.
Further, this plan does not concern Eurostat alone.
It applies generally to the functioning of the Commission.
MrÂ President, I believe the sequence is wrong. It should be reversed.
After all, information does not generate responsibility. Rather, responsibility demands information to be able to cope with commitments.
With regard to OLAF, PresidentÂ Prodi, I suggest the introduction of some kind of ruling on admissibility.
This would allow rejection of long, costly and useless proceedings detrimental to specific institutions or bodies.
A number of recent cases of this kind spring to mind.
None of them resulted in significant achievements.
Â Â  . â Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you very much for this debate and to thank you for your opinions on the programmes, which, as you know, we have had to restrict, for next year will be a year of limited activity, being the last year of the Commission and Parliamentâs terms of office.
We must take into account the fact that Parliament will have to suspend its work for much of the year and that the Commission will change twice: once in MayÂ âÂ although that will only be an expansion rather than a changeÂ âÂ and then, again, in autumn at the natural end of its term of office.
That is why the programme we have put forward is very limited, containing proposals that can feasibly be implemented in 2004; no more than what is feasible, taking into account, not least, the experience we gained in implementing the work programme for 2003, with the good and bad points of that process.
We have 126 priorities, some old and some new, on which we can guarantee delivery and action.
These are crucial, major priorities, but, clearly, we cannot guarantee anything in addition to them.
We are also working, as has been explained, on the Financial Perspective.
We are a great deal in advance with our work, not least because we were quite aware that the interruptions in the coming year will cause substantial delays.
The question you are asking is whether the Commission is going to present specific legislative proposals.
Yes we are: to start with, we present them as the lines of a political project, and then, of course, we supply the facts and figures later on, when the political project has been approved.
I would, moreover, stress that this Commission has made enlargement its main objective and will present its project for an enlarged Union.
All the specific legislative proposals will be made by the enlarged College, after 1 May 2004, that is, and then we will have to discuss the timetable for work after that.
A number of major issues have emerged from the debate, includingÂ âÂ and this was raised by many speakersÂ âÂ the issue of the Stability Pact.
I would like to make it quite clear that the Commission will enforce the Stability Pact in the proper manner and according to the proper conditions.
We are the guardians of a rule which has been handed to us by the governments.
I still remember the eyebrows of the German Minister for Finance, when I was Prime Minister of Italy, as they frowned at me, forcing me to accept the Stability Pact.
We have now made it more flexible and, I believe, more workable, and the Commission will enforce it properly in this framework, taking into account the genuine problems but also bearing in mind that the Pact is the basis of our protection of the euro.
We must establish it as such.
I would like to address another minor postscript to you as Members of Parliament.
We are talking about the Stability Pact, but while we are arguing numbers, fractions and decimal points, there are developments taking place in the political arena which I feel give cause for concern.
I will give just one example: the attempt by Ecofin to bring about what would essentially be the end of the Stability Pact through intergovernmental and extra-institutional agreements.
This is much more serious than any other issue.
If this attempt succeeds, it will be the end of that littleÂ âÂ which is too little, as I have reiterated many times here before youÂ âÂ economic governance which the Union has.
It is not a question of any particular country: the entire Ecofin system is, at present, heading in that direction.
I would like to hear not just the Commission but Parliament, too, speak out loud and clear on this matter.
Indeed, I do not mean to be malicious when I say that this plot is not completely free of attempts, which we have witnessed in recent days, to divest Parliament of its annual and multiannual budgetary powers, which are already too few.
At the moment, I believe it is in our common interest not to be excluded from one of the greatest political processes, from one of the most important decisions affecting the work of our Commission.
I was asked another question on cohesion policy.
Our ideas will be outlined in a political document which will be presented before the specific proposals for the Financial Perspective.
I would emphasise two of the areas we are working on: firstly, cohesion will continue to operate in order to prevent the regions which are lagging behind from being marginalised, and, secondly, cohesion will be more explicitly linked to the sustainable growth programme we are developing on the basis of the experience we have gained from managing the Lisbon and Gothenburg processes.
The same appliesÂ âÂ and I am responding to Mrs Frassoni hereÂ âÂ to the issue of sustainability with regard to Kyoto and to that process.
As regards OLAF, there is a key concept: we are on no account trying to turn the Eurostat crisis into an OLAF crisis.
All the observers with any sense have seen that the information channel between OLAF and the Commission failed to work and is still not working, and it would be irresponsible of us not to do something about this problem.
Nobody is thinking of removing OLAFâs responsibility for internal investigations: quite the opposite, all investigations must continue to be carried out by an OLAF which is even more efficient.
We do not plan for any more bureaucratic bodies to be created, a point raised by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
In my opinion, we have made quite a simple plan, but, listening to these concerns, I feel it would be right and proper to discuss the matter further, to talk again, for it is not our intention to make the institutions even more complex by adding more structures.
We merely want to be in a position to gather together all the relevant pieces of information â not all of which were available in this case â from the different parts of the Commission, in order to be able to take a clear, rapid decision on any measures to be adopted so that OLAF can proceed with full knowledge of the facts and we can take a fully-informed decision.
The decisionÂ âÂ of whether or not to open an investigationÂ âÂ will remain entirely at the discretion of OLAF.
It will be for OLAF to decide, like any investigative body, whether the case is sufficiently important for an OLAF inquiry to be opened or whether it is of purely administrative significance, or whether, quite simply, no action is necessary.
This will be decided by OLAF.
In response to Mr Blak, I would like to say that, if we continue to stir up dust, we will not be benefiting anyone, least of all the European citizens.
We have produced independent, accurate, factual reports which have shed light on all the points and have not revealed evidence of any irregularities after 1999.
We are looking into other specific proposals which we will discuss with Parliament.
I will not acceptkangaroo courts or summary sentences: everything is in order where the past is concerned and we are working on more effective measures for the future too.
I will conclude my speech with two points: as regards services of general interest, which are at the centre of our attention, the programme mentions a sequel to the White Paper because, as things stand, the idea of presenting a proposal for a directive has not been excluded but has not yet been decided upon.
We are working on it and the decision will be taken in the light of the debate which is currently starting.
Clearly, if the legal basis is included in the final text of the Constitution, that will be an extremely important factor, for it will make it possible for us to work on this.
Lastly, a personal response to Mr Poettering: I would remind him, first of all, of the total legitimacy of the document containing my opinions, my experiences and my dreams, too, regarding the future of Europe.
I have to say that it is also a legitimate part of my duty to express my political opinion,
a duty which my predecessors discharged liberally and, in many cases, to a greater degree than I have, taking an intensely active role in party politics, as I consider to be right and proper and increasingly important for the Commissionâs development.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats itself, quite rightly, has already mentioned the fact that the results of the political elections will be taken into account when the new Commission President is appointed.
This has been decreedÂ âÂ as, I feel, is rightÂ âÂ because the Commission is increasingly becoming a political organ which takes the general interest into account in its work but which cannot fail to have a public opinion, otherwise, ladies and gentlemen, you would have had no reason to give me your vote of confidence.
You gave me your vote of confidence on the basis of a political line!
I would like to say a word about the content too.
I am very happy, Mr Poettering, to hear you criticise the Italian newspaper which called you before reading the document, for if it had read it, it would have found there the spirit of our founding fathers and your own words, the words you speak when you are not weighed down by the burden of the Eurosceptics who surround your group, words with which we agree and have agreed many times in the past.
I want to say to you that I am President of all Europeans, and I have to express my political opinions before all the citizens.
Therefore, I wonder why the words of such an intensely European programme which are so dear to you, Mr Poettering, and to us all, can cause such concern.
Because people are frightened by values and projects in which you have consistently firmly believed?
Â Â  â President Prodi, what I am going to say to you I say as a personal ally, as one who shares many of your European ideals, and I say it with regret that you have not gone over the bridge that I have built for you.
It is not the manifesto that is at issue, and it is tendentious to reiterate that I, when I gave the interview to âCorriere della Seraâ last Monday evening, had not yet read the manifesto.
I based my criticisms on an agency report, according to which you had given a recommendation to a party political list in Italy, and that is not compatible with your role as President of the European Commission!
Let me make it perfectly clear â and Mr BarÃ³n Crespoâs statement shows that I cannot be wrong in this â that the office of President of the European Commission is not compatible with being on a list of candidates in the European elections, and that this ought to result in your resignation.
This comment, though, hung in the air.
There was the question in your own college of whether you would carry on with your mandate until 1 November 2004.
Thank God you clarified that, but the mere fact that these rumours could surface is not something for which we can applaud you.
Mr President, I say this to you very much as a friend, but also in all earnest and also in restrained language: you need the support not only of one side of this House.
If you carry on like this, we will, in future, no longer be able to support you.
We need a Commission â this is not party polemics, but my profound conviction ...
... we need a Commission at a difficult time, when we face enlargement, at a difficult time in which we have a constitution, and we need neither a Commission nor a Commission President who constantly meddles in the internal political debates in his own country, a country, let it be added, which still holds the Presidency of the European Union.
President Prodi, it is for you alone to decide whether the confidence of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats ...
... and you call yourselves democrats, when you do not even listen to what is being said?
We always listen when your group chairman speaks, and that is good democratic practice.
I will therefore conclude by saying this: President Prodi, it is for you alone to decide whether you want us, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to be alongside you.
We want you to succeed because we all share in your success, but you yourself must be prepared to cross this bridge.
If you are not prepared to cross this bridge, then you yourself must bear responsibility for the consequences.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should first like to say how pleased I am that a political debate has taken place in this House at last.
Such a debate was launched this morning, but only four of us were present.
I should like to respond to the comment made by leader of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. This is a curious body with two souls.
MrÂ Poettering, I would like to clarify my statement last week.
Firstly, MrÂ Prodi, President of the current Commission, was invested and endorsed by the majority of the groups in this House.
I have today reiterated that as my group and I see it, it is MrÂ Prodiâs duty to lead the Commission until the very last day of his mandate.
It has fallen to him to steer the Commission through a period of great political importance.
Secondly, in his capacity as a European citizen MrÂ Prodi has a right to express political opinions on the future of Europe.
He cannot be denied that right.
Preventive censure must not be introduced.
It would be like forbidding Cardinals of the Catholic Church to speak of God.
It simply does not make sense.
Thirdly, I should like to state my personal opinion, if MrÂ RomanoÂ Prodi, who is both an Italian and a European citizen, decides to stand in the forthcoming elections to the EuropeanÂ Parliament, he should then resign.
I think that is pretty basic.
That is what I actually stated.
Â Â  â Finally, we shall hear from 'Cardinal' Cohn-Bendit!
Â Â  â Mr Poettering, I am seriously worried about you, as it was in July last year that Mr Prodi proposed that a list be drawn up this year.
You woke up to this five months later.
Your party has made a serious error in taking five months to realise that Mr Prodi is on the political trail in Italy.
Secondly, I say this because it is absurd that you should set yourself up as a preacher of morality in this matter out of a desire to protect Mr Berlusconi, who, politically speaking, is currently cutting a poor figure as President of the EU.
I find it intolerable that you should stand up in this House and say, âI have built bridges and you have not gone over themâ.
Mr Prodi is entitled to cross the bridges of his choice rather than the ones you build.
You have to understand that once and for all, my good sir!
It is absurd for you to stand up in this House and say, âWhat you say is in fact perfectly correct, and I regret that Mr Berlusconi did not say that.
That is why you, MrÂ Prodi, may not say that, as I would rather Mr Berlusconi did itâ.
That is your problem.
Sort it out in your own group and leave the rest of us in peace, and let Mr Prodi be politically active in whatever way he wants, without constant moralistic attacks by you.
Â Â  Mr President, I will be brief because I have lost my voice â and I do not mean politically, I mean physically!
It is clear that a battle royal is going on within one of our larger Member States.
The main protagonists in that battle royal happen to be the current President of the Commission and the current President of the Council.
It would be unrealistic to suggest that people in such positions have not had a political past, or do not have a political future to look forward to.
There is a question mark over whether the occupants of those posts should be engaged to such an extent in such a political battle while holding those offices.
But it would be naÃ¯ve of us to assume that such battles will not continue, and indeed naÃ¯ve of this Parliament not to imagine that such people will take those positions.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, this pre-election incident has absolutely nothing to do with my group, which is why I had intended to keep quiet.
Nevertheless, I feel that this incident reveals something that has long been clear to me, namely that the Commissionâs claim to represent the general European interest is a claim on which it is unable to deliver.
For my part, I would prefer to see the right and left of Parliament opposing each other with this kind of passion over European Union policies, rather than opposing each other over career plans and affairs of state.
Â Â  I would like to remind every one of us of the role that the institutions should have and ask them not to confuse their respective roles.
I am saying this because someone spoke about PresidentÂ Berlusconi, who, until there is proof to the contrary, is head of a government and as such has the right to take political decisions in his country.
PresidentÂ Prodi has been appointed by the Council and voted in by Parliament.
We respect him as President of the Commission and we have asked him to be President of the Commission.
I agree with what MrÂ Poettering and MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo said, since the essence of their speeches was the same: that PresidentÂ Prodi has the right to go back to active politics as and when he wishes, but not as President of the European Commission.
In view of enlargement, the fight against terrorism and the difficulties that we are facing every day in the attempt to make our institutions more transparent for the citizens, none of us can exploit Europe for the purposes of internal politics.
I hope that what was said today was partly due to exceptional emotional strain and that, in the next few hours, everyone will go back to the job they were appointed to do.
If anyone wants to relinquish their current role, let them state this clearly: they can take on another role but they cannot have two institutional roles at the same time.
As regards MrÂ Cohn-Benditâs statement, perhaps MrÂ Poettering does have two souls, but it is better to have two souls than to have no soul at all.
Â Â  â The speakers who have addressed this issue this morning have very clear points of view.
Clearly, these points of view diverge.
I want to make one appeal: whatever the divergent views, at this moment the European Union is going through an important phase of redefinition.
The biggest single, immediate challenge in the weeks to come is to find the serenity and wisdom together, across the institutions and with the Member States, to produce for tomorrow's Europe a constitutional treaty that reflects the logic of the work of the European Convention.
Let us make sure, however diverse our opinions are on the years to come, that over the next several weeks we work together, in the interests of the public, to deliver the first and necessary challenge of a constitutional Europe.
That concludes the item.
Â Â  â The next item is the vote.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is proposing by a very large majority that this Commission proposal should be rejected, and this is therefore the committeeâs proposal for a legislative resolution.
I would hope that we can vote first on this proposal to reject before we go on to the amendments tabled for the plenary session.
I would hope we can proceed in this way because, as I understand it, both my own group and a clear majority in Parliament are in favour of this proposal to reject, so there is no point in our voting first on the amendments and only finally on this rejection, as this Commission proposal will very probably be rejected.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, allow me to endorse the procedure proposed by MrsÂ Kauppi.
Obviously, rejection goes further than any amendments to a text that the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposes to reject.
So let us vote first on rejection of the proposal, as this will save us having to go through a pointless voting procedure.
Â Â  â In preparing the vote I took advice on this matter.
The House is free to accept or reject a proposal, as amended.
It is the case, however, that no committee or group has made an amendment to reject the proposal.
I accept that the rapporteur has just made the suggestion on behalf of the Committee Economic and Monetary Affairs, but since there is no amendment to reject, and there are amendments that need to be put to the vote, I have been informed that according to the Rules of Procedure, I should invite the House to vote on the amendments.
Ultimately, the House is sovereign to decide to follow the advice of the rapporteur and Mr Goebbels.
However, I have been informed that because no one has moved an amendment to reject, I am obliged to take the amendments as proposed.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am at a loss.
The vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was clear: we rejected the proposal by a crushing majority and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs therefore proposes rejection of the Commission proposal.
Â Â  â A recommendation from a committee is something the House must treat seriously, but it is not an amendment to a proposal.
Do you wish to make an oral amendment to reject the proposal?
Â Â  . Mr President, of course I want to make an oral amendment if that is required.
I want to make sure you understand that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was almost unanimous in its opinion that this proposal be rejected.
That is why we should not have to vote on the amendments beforehand: we can vote on them if the proposal to reject does not get a majority.
Â Â  â Mrs Kauppi, I fully understand that point. I have no wish to contest the view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
However, I am obliged to operate according to the Rules of Procedure.
Having heard Mrs Kauppi's explanation, are there any objections to the oral amendment?
Â Â  â Mr President, together with Mrs de Villiers and Mrs Lulling, I myself have tabled an amendment in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
That amendment was adopted with 22 votes in favour, 2 against and 2 abstentions.
That amendment has now disappeared.
I want to know where it is. That amendment has been adopted and we now need to vote on it first.
Â Â  â Mr Blokland, I do not have a problem with the House, but I have a duty to obey the Rules of Procedure.
The Rules are clear: if there are amendments, I put them to the House.
There is no plenary amendment today to reject the Commission proposal.
I am very sorry, but that is not my problem. It is someone else's problem.
Now I will do my duty and continue with the vote.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I regret the outcome of the vote that has just taken place.
We have taken note of the views expressed by the majority of the House.
The Commission will therefore take appropriate measures pursuant to the framework agreement and to the agreements reached with Parliament.
I will inform the CollegeÂ ofÂ Commissioners of events in the House today.
â That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . â According to the information available, the number of radioactive sources currently in circulation in the European Union exceeds 100Â 000.
This figure demonstrates the limitations of the systems set up in the Member States to detect and eliminate these sources which, for various reasons, slip through the monitoring measures that have been put in place.
These âorphanâ sources may also be discovered by individuals who are unaware of the risks that they entail.
The Commission proposal, therefore, constitutes a justifiable Community initiative, which responds to two main objectives by creating a system of traceability:
- to prevent exposure to ionising radiation resulting from the inadequate monitoring of high activity sealed radioactive sources;
- to ensure that the safety of sources is monitored, in order to prevent, as far as possible, all malicious use.
I therefore voted in favour of a text on which political agreement has been reached in Council, and this will enable us to ensure the safe and effective monitoring of high activity sealed sources in the European Union.
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the number of radioactive sources currently in circulation in the European Union calls for particular caution and care in their management, packaging and handling, and it is crucial that those which for various reasons are not picked up by the Member States are detected and eliminated.
Creating the system of traceability proposed by the Commission could help to prevent exposure to ionising radiation resulting from inadequate monitoring of sources and to ensure that safety is monitored.
This is an attempt to prevent the malicious use of these sources and to enable them to be monitored in the European Union by facilitating their harmonised management at European level, the ongoing monitoring of their life cycle and their safe exchange between countries of the Union.
I share the rapporteurâs view of the need to highlight suppliersâ responsibility, as the technical experts, in the life cycle of the various sources they make available.
I also agree with the compulsory monitoring of potential cross-border movement of the sources in question, both within the European Union and to third countries and to establishing, in line with the judicial and penal traditions of the Member States, a system of harmonised penalties that could be applied in the event that the rules are infringed.
Â Â  . â The decision to determine the indications that are to feature on signs posted at external border crossing points was taken first in 1994, under the Schengen system.
This initiative seeks to update these indications and also to set uniform minimum indications for use in signs.
Mr Deprezâs excellent report warrants our full support and addresses the issue of external borders, which have been the weakest link in the system.
I wish to highlight four essential points:
- opting for the system of separate checkpoints, which is to be welcomed, given the differences in requirements relating to the carrying out of checks on citizens from the Community, from the European Economic Area or from Switzerland and on third-country nationals;
- there must be no difference between signs for citizens of the Union and for nationals of countries have the same rights when crossing borders â these signs must be as clear and simple as possible;
- the Member State authorities should put up signs written in other languages or using other characters, particularly in multilingual countries, in ones which use an alphabet with special characters or in ones which receive a large number of visitors who use languages with special characters;
- this must be applied not only at airports but also at land and sea borders.
Â Â  . â This is a set of measures on crossing the external borders of the Member States, and which is concerned with checks on individuals at these borders, which I believe to be fully justified.
The system of separate checkpoints for citizens covered by Community law at authorised points for crossing the Unionâs external borders is fully justified.
Signs must be clear and easy to understand (E.U./NON E.U.).
Furthermore, the authorities of countries whose nationals enjoy equal rights to EU citizens, such as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, must identify their citizens when these cross borders.
We must also avoid using words on signs when symbols are sufficiently explicit.
Lastly, the Member State authorities should be explicitly authorised to put up signs written in other languages or using other characters, particularly in multilingual countries, in ones which use an alphabet with special characters or in ones which receive a large number of visitors who use such languages.
These measures are suitable for their purpose and I therefore voted in favour of them.
Â Â  â We voted in favour of this report, which proposes initiating a procedure to recruit officials from the countries that the European Union needs to integrate on its enlargement, planned for 1Â May 2004.
Nevertheless, we wish to stress that we disagree with the choice made by the European institution to employ these new officials at pay levels that will be lower than those enjoyed by current European Union officials, given that they will be taken on at a time when a new salary scale is being put in place, which will be less favourable to new employees, whatever their country of origin.
Clearly, it is budgetary decisions that underlie this decision. These are always mentioned when social issues are concerned, but they never enter into play when it is a question of subsidising large European companies or providing military equipment for European defence.
Â Â  . â As I have said on several occasions, the knowledge-based society is more than a mere aspiration; it is already a tangible reality.
In this respect, I agree with, support and encourage all actions that seek to provide a practical basis for political statements such as the Lisbon Strategy of 2000 and the Europe plan adopted in Seville in 2002.
I therefore voted in favour of the report, although I am convinced that the specific sums involved should be gradually increased.
If, as the Commission proposed, the Community funding of projects put forward under the Ten programme will rise from 10% to 30%, with the concomitant reduction in the number of projects approved â since the overall value of appropriations allocated will remain the same â there must be a real increase in the appropriations that are made available.
It is in these areas and not in whimsical legal texts looking into the future that European solidarity must be grounded and on which we must construct a genuine EU that is increasingly solid and ingrained.
As the rapporteur observed, various projects âwhose potential has been recognisedâ end up never seeing the light of day due to a lack of funding at implementation stage.
This is all the more regrettable because we know that some of these projects, such as Health, Learning and Security, could bring enormous benefits to our citizens.
Â Â  . â This proposal for a decision is intended to provide a response to the administration chapter of the action plan Europe 2005, specifically through the âInterchange of Data between Administrations Programme (IDA) to help to create pan-European administration services in order to support cross-border activitiesâ.
The IDA programmes seek to promote cooperation between national public administrations and between these and the Commission, âhelpingâ to implement legislation, Community programmes, monitoring procedures, âand the open coordination methodâ.
Surrounding what appears to be a technical programme and its instruments, however, are doubts concerning the attempt to open the way to federalism, to promote European integration and to create the idea of âa European public administrationâ in addition to the underlying objectives.
Nevertheless, the communication totally fails to address the issue of âGovernmentâ.
Since the Internet can guarantee easy contact with administrations and provide services direct to the citizens, we must always ensure universal access and improve the quality of services.
The Internet must clearly not be seen as a substitute for front desk services and nor can we accept its being used to centralise services, which would have direct consequences on service provision and on territorial cohesion.
Â Â  . â I welcome the Commission proposal and Mrs Readâs excellent work.
As I have said on previous occasions, a knowledge-based society, which is one of the European Unionâs objectives, requires practical actions to promote telematic communications infrastructures â specifically the Internet â promoting interoperable systems and more widespread access to the new technologies for all EU citizens.
I am also pleased to note the impressive results achieved under the IDA programme â cross-border cooperation and coordination between public administrations.
Next, I welcome the new programme that will succeed this one, called âInteroperable Delivery of pan-European Government Services to Public Administrations, Businesses and Citizensâ (IDABC) â for the period 2005-2009.
In actual fact, exchanges between national authorities and Community institutions are of crucial importance, both in operational terms â they constitute a valuable source of information and of cooperation for the staff of national public administrations and lead to greater efficiency â and in terms of guaranteeing citizensâ rights, by making the relationship between national and Community public authorities more transparent and straightforward.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  â To justify increasing tax on diesel fuel where it is lower than on petrol, the Commission either puts forward the argument that harmonisation is needed at European level or gives bogus reasons about protecting the environment.
We rejected this proposal, voting against any amendment that would lead to an increase in tax on diesel.
We would not see anything wrong with large road haulage companies, which are major diesel consumers, being taxed more.
It would be logical for them to contribute to paying for the road network that the State provides for them free of charge, putting them at an advantage over rail transport.
But if this were the aim, it is the profits of these companies that ought to be taxed, so as not to penalise private individuals, including those on very low incomes who are often forced to travel in private cars because of a lack of adequate public transport.
Â Â  . â Despite voting against the report in question â entirely in line with the voting position set out by the Group of the Party of European Socialists â I believe that this Commission initiative is entirely valid and constitutes an extremely positive step towards achieving the smoother operation of the internal market.
As I had occasion to mention in the debate on the report, the proposal to reject the directive, tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, must be seen as a spur for the Commission to amend the additional elements involved in this proposal for a rejection without discarding the fundamental reasons that underpin it.
Â Â  . â The Commission proposal seeks to achieve the gradual harmonisation, at a higher price, of excise rates for commercial fuel, and to separate the systems of taxation for commercial purposes from those for private purposes.
The Commission claims it wants to resolve distortions of competition in the internal market and to protect the environment in line with the âpolluter-paysâ principle.
This proposal for a directive should be seen in the context of the strategy presented in the White Paper entitled âA European Transport Policy for 2010: time to decideâ, which states the desire to redistribute the tax burden between âusersâ and âtaxpayersâ and to pass on to âusersâ the ârealâ costs of transport.
In order to achieve this, according to the Commission, âgraduated charges must be levied for transport infrastructure use and the coherence of the excise system must be improvedâ.
In the broader context, the Commission wants to establish, within ten years, a European tax system comprising taxes for vehicle registration and use, an intelligent pricing system for infrastructure and harmonised fuel taxes.
The proposal for a directive also sets minimum rates of excise duty for unleaded petrol and a central rate for commercial fuel.
Bearing in mind our disagreements on most of these proposals, we supported the positions of the rapporteur rejecting the Commission proposal, which Parliament accepted.
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of the rapporteurâs opinion, which mirrors that of the specialised parliamentary committee, thereby ensuring that the Commission proposal was rejected.
I believe that this proposal, which the Commission justifies by saying that the environment must be respected and that unfair competition in the internal market must be combated, leaves much to be desired in terms of its effectiveness and could have damaging repercussions for the current and particularly for the new Member States.
We must look more closely at the idea of establishing two categories of tax on petrol and at the guarantee that the tax applicable to private vehicles â fuel for non-commercial purposes â will also be rapidly applied to the tax on unleaded petrol in order to take account of the repercussions that these measures will have for the industrial sectors in question.
Whilst I am aware that there are cases of âgasoline tourismâ, I believe that the scale of this problem does not justify total harmonisation.
Tax competition could even be beneficial, since standardisation would, in most cases, lead to higher excise duties.
I come from one of the Unionâs outermost Member States, and so I can only hope that geography is taken into consideration in future proposals.
Portuguese truckers are actually unlikely to become involved in âgasoline tourismâ in the same way that German or Belgian truckers allegedly are.
Â Â  â We are in favour of developing research and thus of funding it.
Of all the European institutionsâ expenditure, it is certainly not expenditure on research and development that bothers us, provided that it does not serve solely as a pretext for subsidising private companies.
We note, however, that it is research funding, along with social expenditure, that is most readily cut, at least in France, so as to increase aids and subsidies to big business.
It remains the case that the entire approach adopted in this report is to see research purely as a factor in competition between Europe and the United States or between different companies.
In fact, the report itself is obliged to note that private companies, being essentially concerned with profit, indeed with short-term profits, are neglecting to invest in research.
There is actually a contradiction between the search for profit and scientific research in the interests of society as a whole.
We did not vote against this report because we are in favour of public research benefiting from considerably more resources than is currently the case, but neither did we want to sanction the way research takes second place to the race for profit.
Â Â  â The vote on this report gives me an opportunity to pay tribute to that great parliamentarian, Mr Rolf Linkohr, and to acclaim the extraordinary work done by Commissioner Busquin in the course of his term of office, which is now fast nearing its end, to give research a true European dimension.
From a quantitative point of view, we now need to move up a gear, to start to prepare the seventh FRDP, with a budget of EURÂ 30 million, and put pressure on those States that are not increasing, or are even in fact decreasing, their research spending.
On this depend the future of Europe, its independence, its growth and employment in it.
Â Â  . â The rough figures for Portugalâs current degree of investment in research and development (R[amp]D) are of enormous concern, because total spending, as a percentage of GDP, stands at approximately 0.8% whilst State funding amounts to 65% of the total, with 30% coming from businesses and 5% from abroad (essentially from European funds).
Nor must it be forgotten that the future of business investment in R[amp]D depends on developments that are taking place in many other aspects of society, and on changes in the labour force and in the countryâs overall development.
These are issues that go far beyond science and technology policy.
The European Parliament report is relevant because it reflects current concerns at the level of development of R[amp]D activities in Europe and the sectorâs specific characteristics and needs.
One aspect that warrants particular attention is the emphasis the report gives to the need to increase investment in the public sector, observing that this is crucial to the progress of R[amp]D in the private sector.
Although the report is vague on a few points, it basically endorses the Commissionâs proposals, and adds some others, specifically increasing funding under the 7th Framework Programme for R[amp]D (to EURÂ 30Â billion); the creation of âtechnology communitiesâ and the creation of a European Research Council.
Â Â  . â Sustained and increased investment in research is the best guarantee of success in attaining the targets the European Union has set for itself, which are to create a more economically dynamic, cohesive economic area based on knowledge.
This will, therefore, be one of the best investments for our citizensâ future.
This Commission Communication sets more ambitious targets than have been seen to date, by proposing measures intended to bring spending on research in the EU up to a level of 3% of GDP, with one-third coming from public funds and two-thirds from private funds.
Today, this percentage stands at only 1.9%, which falls considerably short of the percentages seen in the United States (2.7%) and in Japan (3%), and reveals significant discrepancies within the Union itself.
In order to achieve this aim, annual investment in research will have to be increased by 8%, in addition to the increase in the budgetary allocation that is needed in the context of the forthcoming accession of ten new countries.
This is also my view and I consequently voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  â The Linkohr report denounces the fact that research spending is too low in Europe.
We are obviously in favour of increasing research funding, but the reasoning in this report becomes unacceptable when it comes to what this increase should be directed towards.
It never mentions the contribution that research can make to improving living and working conditions or protecting the environment.
The only reason put forward for funding research is Europeâs competitiveness and stature.
The method proposed to achieve this is research carried out on a competitive basis, which bows more to the commercial interests of private companies.
The report notes that not all research activities have the expected positive impact on European economies; it therefore recommends that a European system be put in place to define criteria for effectiveness and success and to evaluate research on the basis of these criteria.
In fact it is precisely the community of researchers and scientists in France and other European countries that is protesting against the drastic cuts in public funding and against the obligation to direct research towards those areas that will more quickly turn in a profit.
As we join with them defending the freedom of research on behalf of the general interest, I voted against this report and the dangerous premise underlying it.
Â Â  Research is a crucial factor if Europe is to return on a long-term basis to the path of growth.
I say âon a long-term basisâ because it is not a question simply of boosting economic activity in the short term but of guaranteeing in the long term, and in accordance with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, the existence of an innovative and vital European industry.
That is why I voted in favour of MrÂ Linkhorâs report, and I hope that this will serve to strengthen investment devoted to research, both in the budgets of the Member States and in that of the EU.
It is necessary, however, to remain vigilant and avoid a situation in which, under the pretext of support for innovation, measures are taken that tend to satisfy certain industrial lobbies, often alien to the EU, to the detriment of the very interests of our researchers and entrepreneurs.
I therefore voted against paragraph 28, the ambiguous wording of which might cause it to be thought that, at the expense of innovative SMEs in the sector and to the benefit of the American multinationals wishing to perpetuate their dominant position, Parliament was going back on the position it had adopted in the framework of studying the draft Directive on the patentability of software.
Â Â  . â For several years now, the ÎU has been systematically promoting the penetration of big business into a series of sectors in public ownership and under public control (energy, telecommunications, railways, post offices and so on).
In 2002, a regulatory framework was decided for telecommunications which imposes full liberalisation, with uniform regulations, in order to prevent acute contrasts, facilitate competition for the new 'players' with the predominant former public corporations which are now strong monopoly companies and ensure the telecommunications monopolies efficiently penetrate the markets of the new Member States.
The Community decisions have still not been applied in seven Member States, including Greece, against which the Commission has started judicial proceedings.
This delay shows the inability of the ÎU to impose unequivocal solutions between conflicting interests and the reactions to the clearly negative results of liberalisation.
The report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy laments the delay and threatens fire and brimstone in the event of non-compliance.
It even goes so far as to call for a ban on price reductions by 'incumbents'.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece not only have no reason to lament, but we also condemn once again the selling off of public wealth and put forward our standard position, which is that there should be solely public services in crucial sectors of the economy such as telecommunications.
Â Â  â We obviously voted against this report, the sole justification for which is to admonish those governments that are not quick enough in applying their own decisions to liquidate public telecommunications services in order to open this sector still wider to competition and the race for profit.
The rapporteur goes into raptures about bringing the benefits of competition into the sector concerned.
These so-called benefits are past or future job losses, the threat to salaries and working conditions, widespread job insecurity in companies â such as France TÃ©lÃ©com in France â that are in the process of being privatised, and the risk of massive redundancies in private companies engaged in a ruthless trade war.
There may be a wider range of choice for users, but only for those clients capable of paying.
Telephone boxes are being done away with in very many places where they are not profitable but are needed more than elsewhere.
The telephone is becoming less accessible or else more expensive, penalising those in social classes with the most modest incomes who most need this service, particularly elderly people.
Opposed as we are to the privatisation of public telecommunications services, we reject this report and the social decline to which it contributes.
Â Â  . â We are all excited at the way in which electronic communications and technology are put to use and their subsequent effects on our collective economies.
The key question these days is not so much one of technology itself but how technology is used in a way which contributes to growth through improved productivity.
If we are to reap the real and tangible benefits from new and evolving information technologies we need to invest in the re-organisation of companies and in our administrative structures.
One of the central elements of this investment relates to ensuring that new broadband facilities are available at every opportunity.
I am pleased to hear from the Commissioner for Information Technology Erkki Liikanen that the number of broadband connections doubled from 9 million in July 2002 to 17.5 million in July 2003.
I very much support the goal of the European Commission that half of all Internet connections must be by broadband facility by the year 2005 within the European Union.
European Member State governments are also required to connect all public administrations to broadband usage by 2005.
I very much support the eEurope initiative which focuses on promoting broadband usage and which concentrates on those areas where the public sector can make a difference.
Â Â  . â The rapporteur takes the view that âBelgium, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spainâ are âholding up the liberalisation processâ, by failing to transpose the ânew regulatory package within the deadline setâ, thereby endangering âEuropean competitivenessâ.
We therefore congratulate the European Commission on âlaunching proceedings against those Member States who had not transposed the new regulatory package into national lawâ and on calling for proceedings to be âcompleted as quickly as possibleâ and the Commission is even urged to âmake use of the broader range of instruments that are at its disposalâ to emphasise the punitive nature of the regulation.
This position is unacceptable.
As regards universal service, the rapporteur considers that its funding lacks coherence and finds that this should be open to all operators, including mobile network operators, by means of âpublic tenderâ.
As to public service, or even services of general interest, there is hardly a word, apart from some concern about citizens with disabilities.
This is, therefore, a report that fails to value public and universal service, a report that calls for liberalisation which deregulates further in the name of the primacy of competition and of the supposed economic advantages for businesses of âa fully competitive, open marketâ in order to realise the âLisbon Strategyâ.
Â Â  The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector has led to the most serious crisis in its history.
The policy of widespread privatisation, which is a direct consequence of opting for deregulation and enforced competition, has led to appalling debts on the part of the operators which seek new market shares at any cost whatsoever and construct parallel and competing networks, such as mobile networks, in a questionable waste of resources.
This situation is accompanied, let it be remembered, by huge job losses and the jeopardising of any notion of public service.
The report presented to the House by Mr Clegg comes out in favour of taking an additional step in this same direction. I cannot but vote against it.
Another policy is needed, based on the satisfaction of social needs.
Telecommunications must be defended as a public service, necessitating state supervision of the policy applied and of the choice of operators.
We defend the following principles: low rates for the services most used by the majority of the population; free services for the poorest people; blanket geographical cover by high-turnover mobile and Internet networks in a public service framework; and, finally, equipping developing countries on the basis of fair and equal relations between nations.
Â Â  â That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to mention with regard to the Minutes that the statement I made yesterday before the order of business about the Italian soldiers and policemen killed in Iraq also applies to the statement made by President Cox when he opened today's sitting with the same subject and to the minute's silence observed by the European Parliament.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Patakis.
We have noted your comment and will do the necessary.
Â Â  Mr President, I read today in the Minutes for yesterday's sitting that the statement which I made about the situation in the Baltic States and flagrant violations of human rights was made in response to Mr Tannock's intervention.
That is not correct.
I started my statement yesterday before the order of business with a word about what Mr Tannock had said, which I qualified, and then I immediately went into the main point of my intervention, which was the situation in the Baltic States.
I should therefore like to ask for the Minutes to be corrected.
My intervention was not in response to Mr Tannock's intervention.
Â Â  The necessary correction will be made, Mr Korakas.
Â Â  The next item is the report (Î5-0385/2003) by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on enhancing ship and port facility security.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent wave of terrorist attacks even struck at the Union itself.
This morning we observed a minuteâs silence in memory of the young Italian servicemen who lost their lives, and also in memory of the Iraqi civilians who died.
Clearly, no country or sector is risk-free.
It is important to recognise that whether we like it or not, acts of this kind can take place at any time and place, regardless of the motive behind them.
The maritime sector is no exception.
I would remind you of the case of the cruise liner .
Admittedly, that was back in 1985. Subsequently, however, the oil tanker suffered a terrorist attack.
The Commissionâs proposal aims to facilitate effective and harmonised application of the security measures for ships and port facilities endorsed by Member States of the Union in the context of the International Maritime Organisation.
The proposal is intended to establish a common area of maritime security in which the same level of safety is guaranteed for all maritime movements within the EuropeanÂ Union.
The proposal is in line with the text adopted by Parliament and the Council concerning security in the civil aviation sector.
In both the maritime and the civil aviation sectors, determined action on security by the EuropeanÂ Union is bound to prove to our international partners that we take the whole range of issues involved very seriously indeed.
The instruments adopted within the International Maritime Organisation only apply to ships engaged in international trade and to facilities at the ports they use.
It is desirable to extend some of the provisions of these instruments to domestic maritime traffic within Europe. This would help to attain the global objective of security for the maritime transport sector.
It is therefore essential to ensure that the measures to be applied are in proportion to the possible risks.
Priority should be given to passenger transport.
The proposal goes further than some of the provisions adopted by the International Maritime Organisation.
It renders mandatory certain provisions that were only classed as recommendations in the IMO agreement. The intention is to guarantee the maximum level of security envisaged and to prevent MemberÂ States from arriving at conflicting interpretations.
To this end, there is provision for a single national focal point responsible for monitoring security measures for ships and port facilities.
There is also provision for an inspection process overseen by the Commission. This will monitor the implementation of national plans adopted within the framework of this regulation.
The proposal also adjusts certain provisions agreed within the framework of the IMO for the benefit of the domestic maritime traffic of Member States.
It broadens the scope of application of IMO security measures for passenger ships on domestic routes taking them more than 20 nautical miles away from the coast.
Application is extended to include all other passenger ships on domestic routes.
Cargo ships will also be covered to a certain extent.
There is also provision for adjustment procedures regarding ships providing scheduled services.
I should like to reiterate once again that the IMO is determined that these security measures for maritime traffic shall come into force on 1Â JulyÂ 2004.
The main aim of the draft regulation before the House is to ensure MemberÂ States of the Union adopt the necessary measures within the agreed time period.
This will ensure MemberÂ States meet their international commitments. It will also ensure that application of these measures is harmonised across the EuropeanÂ Union.
It is essential for everything to be in place by the deadline set.
Consequently, I cannot but endorse all action leading to adoption at the earliest possible opportunity without detriment to the content.
I realise Parliament and the rapporteur are fully aware of this.
Cooperation with the Council has been ongoing for several months now, with a view to ensuring the text is adopted at the earliest opportunity, preferably at first reading.
I would therefore like to thank MrsÂ MiguelezÂ Ramos for her excellent work.
Thanks are also due to the whole House for its efforts to reach a swift, effective and efficient solution in the interests of the citizens of the EuropeanÂ Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, the EuropeanÂ Commission dealt with the security of passengers on cruise liners in Europe some time ago, in the WhiteÂ Paper on transport. Parliament has also expressed its concerns on security and on the causes of fishing accidents.
The House called for a high level of security for both passengers and crew. As the Commissioner stated, however, it was following the tragic events of 11Â September that the International Maritime Organisation called for new measures.
At its November meeting the IMO unanimously agreed that new measures should be drawn up for the security of ships and port facilities. Maritime transport of passengers or cargo is deemed to be one of the most vulnerable sectors at the present time.
These new international instruments will come into force automatically for all MemberÂ States on 1Â JulyÂ 2004.
It is important to bear this in mind.
The measures must therefore become part of Community legislation prior to that date, so that experience can be gained regarding their interpretation and harmonised application, and also concerning Community monitoring.
I should like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their understanding in responding to the urgency.
I must thank them too for the flexibility they showed in dealing with this draft regulation. I also appreciate their support for this report.
The latter was adopted unanimously, with one single abstention. I am particularly grateful for the work undertaken by those who served as draftsmen of the opinion.
I refer to MrÂ OrejaÂ Arburua and MrÂ Folias. I am indebted to them both for their considerable help and support.
In my view, this suggests the EuropeanÂ Parliament endorses such a global approach.
It also suggests the House believes that problems affecting the whole planet are best dealt with by means of measures proposed by international organisations.
This should prove more effective than the adoption of unilateral measures.
The measures adopted by the IMO only apply to international maritime transport.
Nonetheless, the cross-border sector is not the only one under threat.
The RETTÂ Committee welcomed the extension of these measures at European level, to cover domestic routes and the relevant port facilities.
As a result, security standards within the Community will be higher than those provided for at international level.
Maritime security must be more than a response to the terrorist threat. It must also include appropriate preventive measures to counter threats of all kinds.
That is why the draft regulation broadens the scope of mandatory measures to include not only passenger ships but also cargo ships such as those transporting containers, chemical substances, gases and crude oil. The port facilities used by these ships are also covered.
Maritime security has become an issue of grave concern for European citizens, following the serious maritime accidents in European waters in recent years.
I have in mind the and especially the . The first anniversary of that disaster is currently being marked.
As we speak, in another room in this building, the leader of the regional government in Asturias is presenting the conclusions of a report on this terrible accident in the hope of assisting us in our work.
The amendment of the SOLAS Convention and of Part A of the ISPSÂ Code involves mandatory provisions.
PartÂ B of the aforementioned code consists of recommendations, but the Commission is proposing that some of these should become mandatory. The RETTÂ Committee endorses this approach.
The mandatory measures concern equipment on board and lay down a set of security measures.
Other measures concern the theoretical and practical training of staff concerned, and lay down clearly the duties and responsibilities of the various actors.
The draft regulation also provides for some of the recommendations in PartÂ B of the ISPSÂ Code to become mandatory. The aim is to increase the level of security and forestall differences of interpretation.
The EuropeanÂ Commission is to be responsible for verification of the effectiveness of the national plans of MemberÂ States and of the activities of the national authorities. The European Maritime Safety Agency will be charged with providing support for the execution of these tasks.
The RETTÂ Committee paced itself to comply with the tight deadlines imposed by procedures in the House. The Vice-President of the Commission referred to this earlier.
It is hoped that this range of measures will come into force in JulyÂ 2004.
Simultaneously, we have worked closely with the Council and the Commission with the aim of ensuring that this regulation is adopted at first reading as befits the urgency of the measures to be taken.
The RETTÂ Committee deemed it necessary to draft a number of important comments to improve the proposal.
One of these was mentioned earlier. It involves applying the measures to cargo ships as well as to passenger ships.
Another concerned setting up a European coastguard service or body before 2010.
The members of this committee urged the EuropeanÂ Commission to table a directive on overall security of port facilities before the end of 2003.
The directive should include accompanying security measures applicable in all Community ports. It should cover all the workers concerned.
I have in mind seafarers, port workers and all professionals required to work in these areas at times.
We believe it is essential for the seafarers to be guaranteed training, exercises and practical experience involving the staff responsible.
In addition, we share the Commissionâs concern regarding containers.
We trust the work we have undertaken will facilitate an agreement between the institutions. It would then be possible for this regulation to be applied as from 1 July 2004.
The EuropeanÂ Parliament has done good work. That work can help improve the various aspects of security relevant to maritime transport.
It responds to the citizensâ concerns.
MrÂ President, I should like to make a technical comment with regard to Amendment16.
The text endorsed by the RETTÂ Committee and which appears as the new ArticleÂ 3Â paragraphÂ 2, subparagraphÂ 2a actually replaces subparagraphÂ 2 of paragraphÂ 2 of ArticleÂ 3.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I too would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her work.
This is no mere formality.
The rapporteur has made it possible for the opinion of the Committee on Citizensâ Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to be largely incorporated into the work of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. This meant that there was some purpose to our work in the LIBEÂ Committee.
MrsÂ deÂ Palacio endorsed the view expressed in the House previously. It was stated earlier that we are currently surrounded by terrorism and under constant threat from it.
Consequently, measures designed to combat this scourge of the twenty-first century are now particularly important. I speak too as a citizen of the Basque country where terrorism is a daily event.
Further, the International Diplomatic Conference of the contracting parties to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea is to be commended.
It made it clear that any citizen and any form of transport could be attacked. They are all liable to become soft targets.
It is also important to bear in mind that the Union is due to take in ten new MemberÂ States next year.
As enlargement approaches it is imperative for us to strengthen all measures relevant to the fight against terrorism and to the protection of our vessels and ports.
In this regard, the committeeâs amendments aimed to provide a minor clarification to the Commissionâs proposal. The amendments call for all unlawful acts to be covered.
I have in mind terrorism, piracy and similar acts. They are especially threatening to the safety of vessels, their cargo, passengers and crew.
In the light of recent environmental disasters, we have also endeavoured to strengthen security measures applicable to the transport of cargo containing dangerous substances.
Illegal handling of such substances represents a particular hazard both for the environment and human beings.
These substances must therefore be included in the scope of application of the agreement.
I agree with the rapporteur that a focal monitoring centre for maritime security should be set up. Such a centre would be a point of contact between the Commission and MemberÂ States as regards monitoring the measures contained in this regulation.
I also agree with the rapporteur on broadening the scope of the EuropeanÂ MaritimeÂ SafetyÂ Agency, to allow it to fulfil its task of inspection and following up the present regulation.
This is probably best achieved through a new legislative instrument.
It is important for this regulation and the Commissionâs communication to come into force at the earliest opportunity.
The regulation ought to be in place on 1Â JulyÂ 2004.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to congratulate the committee and the rapporteur, because the need to develop secure ports and maritime transport is proven to be very great every day.
And of course I understand the rush on this issue.
However, I must register a complaint about the fact that a proposal made by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for cofinancing the cost of these measures was rejected.
An OECD study in July 2003 calculated the initial cost of the measures needed at USD 1 279 million in initial investments, followed by USD 730 million a year to maintain them.
As you will understand, this massive cost, which will be divided between the European ports, will need to be paid, as there is no cofinancing as proposed by the Committee on Industry, by the ports, shipping companies and small and medium-sized companies engaged in fringe activities.
We therefore understand that the competitiveness of the European economy will bear a disproportionately heavy burden in comparison with other competing economies.
The fact that it is certain that jobs will be lost and small and medium-sized companies will close has also been ignored.
I worry that none of this has been taken into proper account and I worry that we are sacrificing this in our hurry to pass the regulation.
I hope that time will prove me wrong, but I am very worried that these serious issues will cost the European economy a great deal.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats unreservedly endorses the very fine report by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos.
It is important that the rules drawn up by the International Maritime Organisation should actually be mandatory.
We had lengthy discussions about whether this was even permissible, as shipping is a global business.
No, though, we have to transpose the most important points into Community law, that being the only way in which we can really ensure that the IMO rules are promptly applied across the board in EU waters and in European ports, thus protecting the public from the potential dangers arising from terrorism, piracy or other illegal activities.
We, too, of course, regret having to discuss these issues with relative speed.
Along with the problem with financial sustainability, which Mr Folias has just addressed, people in the ports are constantly asking whether what we are prescribing is workable, and whether it can be implemented in practice.
I hope that the Council will work very carefully through the results in practice when these regulations are transposed, but, as the IMO rules are to apply from 1 July next year, we believe it to be important that we should now create legal certainty, and so we endorse the rapporteurâs request that agreement be reached at first reading.
We hope, however, that the rules devised jointly by the rapporteur and the Council will indeed result in workable and practical regulations in ports, as these are crucial nodal points which we want to make safer without hindering them from functioning.
They must function, and I hope that we can achieve that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, we shall have experienced a term of office in which the dominant theme has been one of security and safety.
There was, of course, the loss of the on 12Â November 1999 and even the attack on the World Trade Center on 11Â September 2001, with implications for the maritime risk. There was also the loss of the , the anniversary of which falls tomorrow, 19Â November 2002.
These events will certainly lead us to provide ourselves with regulations ranging from prevention to sanctions.
The report of our colleague, which I support, leads me to emphasise three points.
The first is that the freedom of the seas must be controlled.
The sea can no longer be seen as an arena for individual adventure, for it also presents a risk to other people.
More careful monitoring and greater discipline are necessary, from the open sea to the port facility.
Secondly, the EU must put down firmer roots within the IMO, which is something of a maritime ministry for the whole world, just as, for example, the IMF plays the role of a Ministry of Finance.
Among the forty or so members who, I believe, form the management board, a dozen are members of the current or future EU. It would therefore be worth coordinating them better.
Otherwise, it will be that much easier to have recourse to flags of convenience.
Thirdly and finally, any law must be able to give rise to sanctions. Otherwise, it is sterile and ineffective.
The IMO conventions are not in any way binding.
I think that action must be taken to ensure that they become so one day and, moreover, efforts must in the same way be made to ensure that the shipâs country of origin takes responsibility for it.
As long as that is not done, there will still be gaps in our arrangements.
To summarise: controlled freedom on the seas, organised unity in the IMO and legality respected by all. These are three principles that must again be worked on.
They mark out the path of maritime security and safety, but the path is still a long one.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, thank you for the dynamism you have injected into your work.
The task of politicians and policy-makers in the field of security measures, in this case in ports and on ships, consists in striking the difficult balance between workability and the desired effect of the intended measures.
This is a thankless task from the outset, for the port authorities and shipping companies that are required to apply the new regulations will always experience these as a nuisance.
For the legislator, the question does remain whether security in the maritime sector will actually increase as a result of this.
So far, this sector has enjoyed a sound reputation where security is concerned.
If this were to remain so thanks to this package of legislation, the question is whether we in Europe will receive credit for it.
To wait and see is not an option.
This is why it is particularly important for this package to be applied promptly, but not at the expense of everything else.
I find it strange that we in Europe are going further than what we agreed in the framework of the IMO, especially by also wanting to apply the measures to our local shipping.
It is worth noting that America, which forced this package through in the context of IMO, does not do this itself.
Why is Europe aiming so high?
An administrative burden on our local shipping will lead to goods being transported through Europe with more difficulty.
This particularly affects the small ports, with only a few hundred thousand euros in turnover.
More obstacles in the transport of goods means that the transport sector, as a rule, will incur additional costs.
Additional costs are inefficient, and inefficiency means that the Lisbon objectives are certainly not moving any closer.
At that rate, we will never be competitive at an international level.
Meanwhile, ships sail up and down the east and west coast of America, carrying goods, without encountering any port authorities or customs officials.
In Europe, this will be a different story anyhow, as our internal market does not, unfortunately, apply to our coastal strip.
Local shipping between the Netherlands and Belgium does not exist.
This is still considered international, but will thus from now on also fall within the internal market.
The internal maritime borders should therefore be lifted.
Finally, I should like to say that, in general, I will be supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
I will withdraw my Amendment 42 because Amendment 65, tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, is preferable.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I must begin by congratulating MrsÂ MiguÃ©lez Ramos on her splendid report.
I must also reiterate that I am in favour of the broadest interpretation of the concept of maritime security.
Consequently, I welcome the fact that the regulation before us today does contain the preventive measures required to deal with potential risks of all kinds.
Such measures should not apply only to passenger vessels. Ships transporting containers, chemical products, gases, oils or other hazardous cargoes must also be covered.
It is now the first anniversary of the tragic incident involving the . That tanker ended up at the bottom of the sea, having caused the worst maritime pollution and environmental damage on record.
Further, the thousands of individuals who demonstrated yet again last Sunday in Galicia believe that the scale of the damage was so great because those responsible at government level in Spain grossly mismanaged the crisis that arose on the vessel on 13Â November.
This all confirms the urgent need to put in place security plans to ensure future crises can be dealt with a minimum guarantee of success.
It is also important to monitor application of the security measures and train teams through practical experience and simulations involving staff responsible for the safety of ships, ports and both international and domestic maritime transport.
We shall support MrsÂ MiguÃ©lez Ramosâ report, because we believe there is an urgent need to adopt all possible measures to prevent further disasters like the one involving the .
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to make three remarks.
Firstly, it seems to me that we are being called this afternoon to engage in a genuinely schizophrenic exercise.
With the MiguÃ©lez Ramos report, we are invited to transpose two instruments adopted at world level by the IMO, aimed at just the right time at reinforcing the safety of port installations in the framework of the fight against international terrorism.
With the Jarzembowski report, however, we are invited to adopt, at European level, a directive on market access to port services which, by applying the excellent principle of free competition in a very dogmatic way, is, on the contrary, in danger of undermining the safety of our ports and transforming those that are not so already into veritable ports of convenience.
Is it to conceal this contradiction that the two documents are not the subjects of a joint debate?
Secondly, we have proof that the IMO â which, when spurred on by determined states, is obviously the relevant level for handling matters of international maritime security â is not condemned to weakness.
The changes made to the SOLAS Convention and to the ISPS Code at the initiative of the United States prove this, as does the raising of the Fipol ceiling, agreed to at the initiative of several European states.
There must therefore be no let-up in the pressure for responsible maritime transport, notably by creating a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area in the Atlantic and the Channel, as proposed by six European states.
Thirdly and finally, the Commission is taking advantage of what ought only to have been a transposition into Community legislation of arrangements relating exclusively to international shipping to broaden the scope of a number of provisions to include national maritime traffic.
It is not certain that this wayward trend, while very obviously increasing the Commissionâs supervisory powers, would make an effective contribution to increasing maritime public safety.
Â Â  Mr President, the quintessence of the European Union is not the ideals of democracy and freedom pronounced in the report; it is to serve big business, in this particular instance big shipping business.
That requires laws and measures as a protective shield for their interests.
The objective is to increase their excessive profits by abolishing seamen's fundamental rights.
Once again, with terrorism as the pretext, an effort is being made to impose a regime of spying and policing in ports and on ships, with an extensive network of monitoring and repression, in the aim of striking policy and trade union action and trampling the grass-roots movement underfoot, in the face of the reactions provoked by the promotion of privatisation.
That is why nothing is said about the real problems and the real threats to maritime security, in other words the health and safety of those working on ships and in ports, the age of the fleet and the 'cut-throat' ports or ports of convenience preached by the privatisation directive.
Not a word about the responsibilities of big shipowners, who are accessories to the tragic maritime crimes which make them pioneering terrorists.
Not a reference to the fact that regional decisions about the safety of ships essentially weaken the role of the International Maritime Organisation and undermine the safety rules within the framework of an economic war and race for profit.
This is a wretched transaction between capitalists at the expense of the safety of life at sea and the marine environment, in the aim of increasing their excessive profits.
The unaccountability of the shipping business is being strengthened through flags of convenience, the privatisation of shipping registers and the lack of any substantial inspections or controls by state authorities.
These are the real and major terrorist threats to shipping, not the ghost pirates the European Union is looking for.
A mass, dynamic, grass-roots movement needs to develop against these policies to grab public assets and impose a mediaeval working regime and slave wages.
Â Â  Mr President, having congratulated Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos on the work she has done, I should like to clarify what this is about, because certain misunderstandings have perhaps arisen.
What we are doing, at Community level, is to adopt an agreement which all the Member States of the European Union voted for in the International Maritime Organisation.
The Commission is here today, and Parliament agrees with it, so that we can adopt these measures at Community level, wrap them up and put them into practice.
What makes this directive different from other similar European initiatives is that here we are being proactive, we are acting before we have a fatal disaster, whereas â as you know â in the past we have acted at Community level after shipwrecks or natural or other disasters.
In this sense, I think that this is an absolutely positive initiative.
Nonetheless, are there no concerns?
Are there no questions?
There are.
They have been voiced by MrÂ Folias and by Mr Jarzembowski.
Indeed, the industry at European level is worried that it will bear the burden of the measures before us, measures which are necessary and which â no one is in any doubt â have to be taken.
It may be an excessive burden or, in certain instances, it may distort competition, because fewer measures will be needed in some Member States and more in others and the industry may therefore bear an uneven burden.
That is why, given that the Council was not ready to accept certain amendments which directly addressed the question of funding by the Member States themselves, we called on the European Commission â both because the measures are urgent and because the European Parliament could not persuade the Council to move to the conciliation procedure (and I am glad that the Council accepts that at least) â to adopt an amendment making provision for the European Commission to present a study precisely on competition and the extra costs.
I therefore call on the Commissioner, because the industry really is worried, to assure us today that the Commission will submit this study as quickly as possible and that it will cover the concerns of industry about the functioning of competition in ports from now on.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish first to thank MrsÂ MiguÃ©lez Ramos for her excellent preparatory work.
Security is an important issue in shipping.
My worry has been that small ships operating domestic services, such as ferries and coastal craft, should not have to be included in what is administratively very cumbersome security action.
The committee has already given attention to this and the matter should be remedied by the amendments proposed.
My other worry has to do with the increase in costs for small and medium-sized port facilities.
If different security-related equipment, fencing and other investments have to be in place very promptly, transport services will have to raise charges and, as a result, ports will lose their competitive edge.
I hope these two issues will be remedied in the vote and I hope they will also be taken into account when the Commission interprets the implementation of the directive.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Vice-President of the Commission, it is indeed very important for our fellow citizens that we are able to offer them the best possible security measures in connection with all forms of transport â air, land and sea.
Today, our debate concerns sea transport, and I will of course take the liberty of offering my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur.
With regard to maritime transport security, passenger safety is of vital importance to us, but it is also important to take account of the transport of goods.
A number of ships do indeed transport dangerous goods and, therefore, constitute perfect targets for terrorism.
It has also been seen, even independently of any problem of terrorism, that simple natural disasters could have catastrophic consequences.
Everything that contributes to better protection must, therefore, be welcomed and, once again, very important arrangements are being proposed to us, which I support: a national monitoring centre for security at sea and increased staff training, not forgetting the adequate equipping of ports â so many measures for which we have called many times in this House.
That is what I think is important, even if I agree with my fellow MEPs in asking for these arrangements to be applied in a balanced and harmonious way, without compromising the actual activity of the ports.
Clear definitions of each partyâs responsibilities are also crucial, which is why I have to tackle the issue of the responsibility of the Member States.
Are the latter prepared to make maritime security a major theme?
Which are the countries that have so far transposed the directives voted on in this House?
Which countries genuinely monitor the application of our European regulations?
What point have we reached in preparing the European map of ports of refuge?
Which states have progressed, and which are dragging their heels?
I know that, where France is concerned, arrangements have finally been made along these lines.
What is the position, and even the decision, of the Council on putting in place the European coastguards I have been requesting for a long time?
If another disaster or accident were to occur, would Europe still be incriminated, by having helped make it possible, or will the Member States finally face up to their responsibilities?
Commissioner, you have in fact completed a piece of work â and a terrific job, at that â in close partnership with the European Parliament.
It is time to have this recognised and openly and publicly to tell the truth about blocking by individual nations, about delays concerning what is and is not applied and about what the Council of Ministers really wants.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on her work and on her will to reach quick agreements so that a measure of this nature can be adopted speedily and thus be applied immediately.
As some of my fellow Members have said quite rightly during the debate on this regulation, in view of the existence of terrorism we are faced with a series of dangers.
We have adopted measures in this Parliament.
We have adopted measures on the initiative of the Commission, which, in an active way, has been presenting proposals to us during this legislature for improving security in all forms of transport.
We have adopted them and we are on the point of adopting them in the field of maritime transport.
In the field of maritime transport we are concerned with international organised forms of terrorism, but there is also a form of terrorism which causes desolation internally, in cases such as Spain.
This needs to be combated and measures need to be adopted, and that is what we are dealing with.
It is clear that we are facing problems and that adjustments will have to be made, but improving our safety, improving traffic safety, improving security in ports is a necessity and an obligation which we must fulfil.
I would therefore like to congratulate the Commissioner on her proposals and the rapporteur on her determination and will for these measures to be applied quickly.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, combating terrorism requires global action that takes account of the various threats the world faces today and which are, unfortunately, myriad.
I therefore share the concerns over the issue of maritime transport expressed by the Commission and by the rapporteur and which are clearly implied in the proposal for a regulation we are now examining, which seeks to enhance ship and port facility security, as part of the war on terrorism.
Such action would necessarily involve the implementation, throughout the European Community, of the international security measures adopted by the International Maritime Organisation and consequently defining a common European policy in this field.
This would entail stepping up levels of protection whilst at the same time ensuring that there are no differences of interpretation amongst the various Member States.
In this context, I should like to refer to three issues that I believe are crucial.
First of all, with regard to extending the measures adopted under the IMO on domestic shipping and the relevant port facilities, I wish to highlight the need for setting a timetable that is sufficiently long to enable the countries concerned to comply with the rules laid down.
The inclusion of national maritime traffic should furthermore take account of the assessment of the risk in relation to the level of danger facing the vessel and/or cargo, and in relation to the vulnerability of the vessel or port facility, set against a cost/benefit analysis.
Furthermore, as regards implementation and monitoring compliance, which are covered by ArticleÂ 10 of the proposal for a regulation, I believe that these tasks should be carried out by the competent authorities of each Member State.
Because Community inspections are necessary, these must be undertaken solely under the regulationâs legal base and always in cooperation with the authorities of each Member State.
Lastly, I wish to point out that, in accordance with the regulation establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency, this body has no power to act in the field of security as such.
This aspect should be considered in a much-needed revision of this regulation.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we European citizens are concerned about maritime safety and we Galicians in particular, since we directly suffered the extremely serious accidents we are all so aware of.
The consequences of these accidents oblige us to speed up the adoption of maritime safety measures of all types and to seek consensus between the various political groups and between the institutions â Commission, Parliament and Council.
We must therefore prevent long legislative procedures in order to respond to the citizensâ demands, reaching agreements at first reading preventing the need to go to the conciliation procedure.
I congratulate the Commission on the proposal it has presented to us, and our rapporteur on her report, which has achieved unanimity, which is significant, as is the support we are giving to the amendments introduced in relation to the extension to other types of ship, such as those transporting particularly dangerous goods, to those preventive measures of all types, and to global agreements within the world framework of the IMO, as well as with the United States.
This debate is therefore timely but, I would insist, we must remember that, if we agree on the fundamental issue, as we do in general terms, we must also agree on the form and the procedures, and act with the greatest diligence, as has been reiterated here.
We must not waste a single second on political discussions which extend the legislative procedures on such sensitive issues.
The IMO measures within the framework of the SOLAS Agreement are therefore welcome, as will the MARPOL measures be, which not only enhance the safety of ships and ports but which also provide for the imposition of criminal sanctions, which we will have to wait to be debated and approved in this House.
The European Parliament must be on the front line in this fight and I hope that the recently created temporary committee will continue with this consensus and provide the best possible resources and instruments in this fight and lead it on behalf of the European Union at world level.
Â Â  â Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposal and I wish to thank MrsÂ MiguÃ©lez Ramos for her very well prepared report.
The Commission proposal is especially necessary in order to clarify the new international instruments adopted last year by the International Maritime Organisation.
The tragic events of 11 September showed that every production sector, mode of transport or building can easily fall prey to a terrorist attack.
Preventive and protective action is also urgently needed for other threats to security at sea, such as piracy and sabotage.
It is nevertheless important that the EU does not needlessly rush to adopt measures but instead calmly keeps to the framework of the timetable that has already been drawn up by the IMO, which, as it is, is very rigorous and demanding.
In todayâs changing world I see international cooperation as being of priority importance in order to improve security for ships and port facilities and a far better alternative to the unilateral measures that were adopted earlier on.
It is in the EUâs own interests to operate in multilateral systems, whilst reinforcing them at the same time.
Furthermore, cooperation with Russia is particularly important.
I share Commissioner Bolkesteinâs concern regarding the possible negative effects on trade that unilateral security measures would have.
There is a danger that the unilateral agreements in the container sector made in collaboration by American and some European ports will distort competition.
In this regard I welcome the current negotiations between the Commission and the United States of America to cover the Container Security Initiative agreements.
The Commission proposal does not really differ in content from the IMO instruments that have been drawn up exclusively for international shipping.
For that reason, I think it is questionable whether the same instruments should be interpreted in the EU to apply equally to domestic transport services in the Member States.
Taking the costs and other difficulties resulting from compliance with security measures such as these into account, I see no need to go any further than the IMO conventions.
The power of decision to apply measures to individual countriesâ domestic transport systems must in any case remain with the Member States, which are best placed to assess the situation.
It would, for example, be absurd if ferries operating in the internal waters of Finland, with its thousands of lakes, had to endure thorough security checks if there were no particular threats to security anyway.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ MiguÃ©lez Ramos, once again for the work she has done, as well as the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the way in which they have carried out their work and the improvements they have made to the text, since the majority of the amendments are acceptable, although in some cases with a slightly different wording.
I would also like to thank the rapporteurs, MrÂ Oreja ArburÃºa and MrÂ Folias, from the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, respectively, for the opinions they have contributed and which have also served to improve the text proposed by the Commission.
The rapporteursâ work in close cooperation with the Commission and the Council will allow â I hope â this text to be approved at first reading.
There are many amendments, which are enormously technical, which are intended, if I have understood correctly, to bring the Commissionâs proposal closer to the text resulting from the activities of the Council which for its part has held many meetings on this project, in the presence of experts.
I am happy that, thanks to this interaction â a kind of almost permanent trialogue throughout the negotiation â we have been able to find a positive response to almost everything.
I would like to point out, in response to what has been raised by some of the honourable Members, specifically MrÂ Folias and MrÂ Hatzidakis, that we accept the amendment which calls for a study focused on the distribution of funding between public authorities and operators without prejudice to the distribution of competences between Member States and the European Community, a study in which the costs of the application of these measures will be analysed, as well as its repercussions on the competitiveness of the maritime sector in relation to alternative transport systems and the European economy in general.
We will naturally present this study to Parliament and the Council and where necessary we will draw up the relevant proposals in accordance with it.
Nevertheless, there are five amendments which raise certain problems for the Commission and which I would like to comment on briefly.
Two of them we cannot accept because they call into question the delicate balance we have achieved with the Council with regard to the extension of these measures to national traffic.
I prefer those of your amendments which precisely reflect the balance which has been achieved.
There are three new amendments relating to comitology, which, in so far as they do not jeopardise the role of the Maritime Safety Committee, provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002, we will be able to accept.
Finally, given the complexity of the tasks in hand, the Commission accepts removal of the early implementation of these measures, although I believe it to be essential that each State adopts a national programme for the application of the legislation we are proposing with this Regulation.
In summary, the Commission can accept 62 amendments in full, 5 partially, and rejects, as I have said, just 2.
These figures clearly reflect the cooperation which has taken place, which I am glad about and in relation to which I would like to thank once again all the honourable Members for your work throughout these months.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (Î5-0364/2003) by Mr Jarzembowski on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on market access to port services.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Madam Vice-President, in the course of difficult negotiations, Parliamentâs delegation has been able to persuade the Council to accept a large number of rules in the interests not only of existing port systems and of the port workers, but also of fair competition conditions in and between ports.
Even though there were some demands that we could not get the Council to accept, I therefore recommend that all Members of this House should accept the result of the conciliation procedure and express their satisfaction with what has been achieved.
Considerations of legal certainty for ports, port operators, and port workers mean that the European Union needs its first basic directive on ports.
Rejection of this compromise would leave unregulated for years matters of vital importance to European transport policy, such as market access within the ports and the conditions under which ports compete with each other, and would therefore open the door to distortions of competition among ports and uncontrollable duplications of their services.
Let me issue a warning to those Members of this House who advocate rejection: if that were to happen, the Commission would be entitled to examine the situation in each individual port.
We would do better to lay down basic rules, so that everyone knows from the outset by what rules they must abide.
In particular, Parliament can count itself very fortunate that the Council has accepted its demand that the definition of self-handling should cover only the deployment of the shipping companiesâ own seamen and not of its land-based staff as well.
In that respect, Parliament has been able to give practical expression to the principal concerns of both the operators of ports and of the people who work in them.
In order to achieve a compromise, on the other hand, Parliamentâs delegation had to abandon its demand for a general requirement for prior authorisation for port services.
The Council wants to follow the subsidiarity principle and leave this in the competence of the Member States.
Our side was nonetheless able to gain acceptance for the idea that the Member States should be able to ensure that the competent authority can insist on prior authorisation for the provision of port services, so this is still left to the Member Statesâ discretion.
Finally, the Council accepted Parliamentâs amendments on periods and conditions for authorisations and transitional arrangements, in which Parliament has ensured that interests in ownership are put on an equivalent footing to leasing arrangements.
Parliamentâs delegation has also achieved acceptance for the requirement that authorisations be amended or abrogated where the criteria for authorisation or for the social security regulations to apply are not complied with in substance.
It must therefore be noted that we have taken up an unambiguous position on the social conditions of port workers, and have done a splendid job of it.
The Council also accepted that the Member States have to enact regulations whereby the newly-authorised service providers are obliged to make appropriate compensation payments to former service providers, but â and this is something with which we are not very satisfied â the Council wants this to be restricted to those instances in which the period of validity of their authorisations is reduced as a result of the new directive.
One can see a certain logic in this.
In all other cases, the legislation of the individual States is to be applicable.
One aspect of the overall compromise that Parliament was obliged to accept with some regret was that pilotage services remain within the scope of the directive.
This was, however, made acceptable by the Council and Parliamentâs joint and particular emphasis on the importance of pilotage services in terms of safety and the protection of the environment, and the fact that the competent authorities can, on grounds of public safety, continue to restrict pilotage to one single service provider.
Parliament eventually managed to delete the limited duration of authorisation for pilotage services, for which the Council had provided.
I think Parliament broke new ground in managing to get the objectives of the directive extended by adding to them the creation of fair conditions of competition in and between ports.
To this end, ports and the providers of port services are obliged to disclose to the Commission and to the Member States the financial relations between themselves and public undertakings.
For its part, the Commission is required to draw the necessary conclusions from this with regard to removing distortions of competition, and it has already indicated its readiness to enact explicit directives concerning the degree to which public funding in ports is permissible.
I would like to note, by way of summary, that this outcome from the conciliation procedure is a great success for all of us in view of the wholly negative stance initially adopted by the Council.
I would like, in particular, to thank the Italian presidency of the Council and the Vice-President for enabling us to take this problematic dossier to what I regard as a good conclusion.
