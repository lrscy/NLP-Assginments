Last May saw the launch of the first working group dedicated to governance and human rights in the context of the Cooperation Agreement with Bangladesh, with the inaugural meeting tackling a wide variety of issues, including the death penalty and the judicial system.
The Commission communication on Reinvigorating EU actions on Human Rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners offers the potential for similar initiatives in the framework of the Mediterranean Association Agreements, with a range of initiatives - such as the systematic inclusion of human rights and democracy issues in the meetings of the Association Councils and National Action Plans on human rights - designed to effect change on the basis of the clause.
Turning to the UN Commission on Human Rights, the human rights clause not only constitutes a commitment to human rights in a domestic context, it also pledges the EU and third states to the promotion and protection of human rights in the international arena.
This leads me to the UN Commission on Human Rights.
Mr van den Bos' report acknowledges the high degree of congruence between the priorities identified by the European Parliament for the 59th session of the CHR and the action undertaken there by the EU.
That is heartening, as the EU's voice is immeasurably strengthened when its institutions speak with one voice.
However, I share the concern articulated in the report about the direction of the CHR and the need to make every effort to ensure that it addresses human rights violations effectively.
The EU has its work cut out: only 47 States have issued a standing invitation to the CHR's thematic procedures - 28 of which are EU Member States, accession states or candidate countries.
Moreover, 80 states have not ratified all 6 major international human rights instruments.
The EU has made a good start in efforts to improve the impact of its actions at the CHR; for example, this year's session saw earlier finalisation of draft EU initiatives allowing more scope for effective lobbying of third countries.
EIDHR funding has also played its part, with recent projects bolstering the work of the human rights treaty bodies and that of several UN rapporteurs.
These efforts will continue in the knowledge that it is only by marshalling all the resources at the EU's disposal - political, diplomatic and financial - that we will really be able to effect the necessary change.
Finally, I would make two remarks.
The first is about children in conflicts, an issue which has already been commented on.
We are trying to do everything possible to change the situation, but it is extremely difficult in the northern part of Uganda to get into contact with the Lord's Resistance Army.
It is almost impossible to do anything meaningful on the ground, because there is no society surrounding the conflict as a basis for action.
There is nothing but the conflict.
However, in post-conflict cases - for example, Sierra Leone - we have been quite successful in the resocialisation of children and other related work.
The other point I would make relates to torture.
We can support rehabilitation centres.
This is also an instrument that keeps the public aware of the issue of torture.
The documentation coming from these centres is the most necessary element in our attempt to address the problem we are up against and deal with the terrible regimes that carry out torture.
So there is more to it than the primary objective of helping the victims of torture.
Establishing facts, which is the secondary output of these activities in rehabilitation centres, is also a powerful instrument which we are pleased to be funding, and we will continue to be an active donor in this area, which definitely strengthens efforts to which we have to give high priority.
I thank you again for this comprehensive report.
We will do everything possible to respond in a very direct manner.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr van den Bos for his excellent report and for his willingness to cooperate with the other groups.
The degree of consensus in this House also shows that all the political families continue to view the commitment to human rights throughout the world as a core element in achieving democracy, social progress and the peaceful coexistence of nations.
I would also like to extend my thanks to the human rights organisations, with which the cooperation is always very good.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats considers that the focus of this year's report - freedom of thought, conscience and religion - is a good benchmark by which to measure the state of democracy and human rights in every country and in every society.
This includes the freedom to practise one's religion just as much as it includes a religion's duty to show tolerance towards the other faiths which exist alongside it.
The freedom to change one's religion or religious denomination must also include the right not to profess any faith.
Democratic thought and action should also preclude any situation in which it is only the members of a specific religion or denomination who are viewed, in effect, as full or fully accepted citizens of a state.
I also do not know of any world religion which is fundamentally intolerant or hostile to other religions or, indeed, towards its own believers.
Criticism of religious intolerance therefore cannot be directed towards a religion as a whole, but must be directed towards those who practise or interpret their own religions in a truly inhuman way, generally out of a desire to achieve or remain in power.
Such criticism of those who are responsible for human rights violations is something which we must also demand, over and over again, from the Council and the Commission.
Does the Council think that stability in the world is enhanced if the issue of human rights is confined solely to nicely phrased human rights clauses?
Why do we find it so difficult to enforce these clauses - such as those contained in the Cotonou Agreement?
What are the advantages that some governments think they have wangled for themselves if they delay or circumvent sanctions, for example against Zimbabwe?
Do you think we are serving the interests of people in China, or our relations with that country, if we pigeon-hole human rights issues as an element of a dialogue on the rule of law which takes place behind closed doors?
This approach gives carte blanche to anyone visiting the country, be they politicians or businesspeople, to point to this scenario and absolve themselves of any further responsibility for human rights. After all, raising the issue might adversely affect the climate in which business is done.
The same applies to relations with Russia and other major countries.
Yet we all know that countries which do not respect human rights at home are structurally weak, whereas respect for human rights has a stabilising effect at home and abroad.
Pressure from the EU to enforce human rights is ultimately a better method of achieving domestic and external stability than policies which I would describe as a slavish adherence to the status quo, which give preference to short-term superficial stability and only change when conflicts actually spill over to other countries.
This Parliament will continue to demand statements on unpleasant issues, and it will continue to demand compliance with the content of our resolutions, for we believe that words and deeds must go hand in hand in human rights as well, and that without a pro-active human rights policy towards the states in question, it will be impossible to reduce the conflict potential in the world.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr van den Bos on his report, but may I state quite categorically that, in addition to freedom of religion, we must be equally committed to freedom of conscience and the freedom, as Mr Gahler said, not to follow any religion.
We must remember that over the centuries and, indeed, even now many atrocities are carried out in the name of religion.
Fundamentalism and intolerance are growing threats.
That is why the role of human rights defenders in the world is vital.
We must do all we can to protect them and humanitarian aid workers around the world.
That is why we must remind ourselves of the appalling attack in Baghdad on the UN mission, express our deep condolences to the families of those who have been killed and injured and note the appalling, tragic and untimely death of Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello, an outstanding human rights defender.
We must defend freedom of thought and freedom of conscience.
And what of our relations with third countries? We should say yes to dialogue, but action must follow from that dialogue.
We have increasing numbers of death sentences in countries with which we have close relations.
That is why we need an end to the death sentence.
With our association agreements - Egypt and Israel spring to mind - if we do nothing, we condone human rights abuses.
What use are our agreements, in particular the human rights clauses, if we do not enforce them?
In Egypt homosexuals are being entrapped on the Internet and incarcerated for no other reason but that they are homosexual: this is appalling.
We must defend freedom of the press, the rights and freedoms of the child, the rights and freedoms of homosexuals, of minorities, the rights of women, ethnic minorities, the rights of refugees, and, yes, unfashionably, those seeking asylum.
Let me make a special reference to Aung San Suu Kyi, now on hunger strike in Burma.
We must do all we can to release from detention this brave and honourable woman.
We must respect also the human rights of disabled people, included in our report for the first time.
I shall finish by saying that the Council, Commission and Parliament must speak with one voice.
Our message is clear: these are our values.
If you support them we will engage with you.
If you do not, we will pursue this agenda until human rights are totally and finally respected.
I should like to congratulate Mr van den Bos on his very balanced report, which is in keeping with the human rights reports of the past few years and gives very thoughtful consideration to such delicate topics as freedom of religion.
I fully subscribe to his appeal for more consistency and coherency in human rights policy.
After all, the European Union is at risk of losing all credibility if it does not succeed in speaking with one voice, even if strategically or economically important countries, such as China or Russia, are involved.
Mr van den Bos is right in condemning the most important human rights forum, the UN Commission on Human Rights, for becoming highly politicised.
I myself have had the opportunity of attending this UN Commission on two occasions and I could never shake off the impression that the governments systematically conspired to exonerate one another.
The motto appears to be: if we spare others, we do not run the risk of being condemned ourselves.
During the latest sessions in Geneva, it transpired once more that it is the foxes that have to watch the hen's eggs.
It is highly worrying that countries such as Libya, Sudan, Zimbabwe and Cuba should play a leading role in the UN Commission on Human Rights and that the European Union, the key sponsor, should hardly have any impact left.
It therefore delights me that the rapporteur has adopted my amendments on this matter.
On the one hand, conditions should be prescribed for membership of the UN Commission, such as the signing, ratification and observation of human rights conventions and the admission of special UN human rights rapporteurs.
On the other hand, the decision-making process must be reviewed and the unanimity rule should make way for a two-thirds majority rule.
If these conditions are not met, the European Union should seriously consider withdrawing from the human rights circus. It will otherwise run the risk of legitimising, rather than condemning, human rights violations, and surely that can never be the intention.
Ladies and gentlemen, when we look carefully at a resolution on human rights that has no less than 56 recitals and 197 paragraphs, after consideration of 284 amendments in committee, we have many contrasting impressions.
I will mention a few of them: does the report make sense, is it useful, are the points raised given adequate priority, are they always confirmed, what role is played by its main errors, by the choice of press agencies and by the media?
Nor can we forget political preferences.
What can we say to those who assert that the underlying ideology is that of the rich and powerful countries, which judge others according to their interests and their criteria without always applying the same standards at home?
The attitude of the United States provides us with an illustration that is more than a caricature in this area: treatment of its prisoners, refusal to accept the ICC, preventive war, death penalty, etc. I am stopping there a list that is by no means complete and to which everyone could add.
As regards overall usefulness and validity, each person must make up their own mind.
Personally, in spite of many doubts, I have nevertheless concluded that this report is useful and I congratulate my colleague Mr van den Bos.
Having stated this, we must then go into more detail to measure and to weigh up the gaps and the excesses that are wrongly included in the report and those, also wrongly, that are missing.
My colleague Mrs Pernille Frahm and I tabled nine amendments in committee, seven of which were adopted, and of the 27 amendments in plenary, eight were adopted by the members of my group.
This is evidence of our interest and thus our belief that this report is useful.
Finally, you will see that not one of us, and I mean not one of us, will agree with everything that is adopted.
I, personally, could list all of the points that bother me and those with which I disagree.
In my opinion, in spite of everything and without denying the negative, the positive prevails and I am prepared to vote in favour of this report, unless it is distorted as a result of certain votes.
I do still have some concerns regarding the desire on the part of some people to replace freedom of conscience with religious freedom and some other fears regarding certain political links.
Other colleagues will make different choices, including Members within my own group; that is democracy.
The most important thing, and I must emphasise this, is the need to wholeheartedly defend human rights, all human rights, including economic and social rights, throughout the world.
Yes, I stress that we must defend them in every country, without exception!
Mr President, whilst I agree with those who congratulate Mr van den Bos on producing an excellent report, and most wholeheartedly with what he said in his opening speech, I would say that there are naturally some differences between us regarding focus.
We for our part still want to lay emphasis on the rights of political prisoners and the right to a healthy environment.
Torture, together with the death penalty, is a violation of the most fundamental of human rights.
In a world that is fighting terrorism we have been alarmed to see the unconditional ban on torture become a relative issue and, as it were, go soft round the edges.
It is not enough to invest in prevention and especially in the broadest possible ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture.
We really also have to support the rehabilitation of victims.
We are now getting a promise of that, but it will also require additional resources.
We must invest in this, however, and that means the proper budget decisions have to be taken.
When you look at the role of the EU in the report and the parts that deal with how prepared it is to engage in human rights work, you get a feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu.
That is certainly not because the rapporteur has failed in any way but because, year after year, we have been emphasising very similar needs for change.
In a world where views on security based on arms and cooperation are in conflict with one another and in which the situation regarding universal human rights and the sovereignty of states is tense - this is a question of the fate of the United Nations - the EU has an opportunity to place human rights at the heart of its external policy.
Institutional changes are not enough for this, even if we have our own foreign ministry and the parliamentary committees are reorganised.
It can only work if we really want to invest in consistent work and involve ourselves with the utmost sincerity.
Mr President, I should like to praise the rapporteur most warmly for his excellent work, which is also very interesting from the point of view both of principles and of practice.
He is trying to lift Parliament's efforts above the level of positive testimonies.
After all, if we speak our minds, then we will also need to do the follow-up.
Too often, we do not take heed of our own criticism and we lack the tools to find out what has become of our indictments.
We should finally do something about this follow-up, even though I fully understand the objections - some of them practical - that the Commissioner mentioned.
This certainly applies to the support to which the winners of our Sakharov prize are entitled.
After all, they are in many cases the heroes of civil liberties.
This very week, timely support has once again been shown - and rightly so - to Aung San Suu Kyi, and so it is odd to notice that Mrs Leyla Zana is always receiving so little attention from us.
Is it not so convenient politically speaking?
If this is the reason, then the criticism levelled by the rapporteur at the Commission and the Council also applies to us.
Upholding human rights is not all that simple.
Defending people with whom you see eye to eye is not difficult.
It is only when the rights of people with whom you do not agree are upheld, that campaigning for human rights becomes an issue.
This also holds for freedom of conscience.
To my surprise, some of my fellow-MEPs get along better with that concept than with freedom of religion.
I find this a bit worrying, to be honest.
I should, however, like to ask for attention to be given to my amendment on freedom of conscience, which I tabled immediately, of course.
After all, very positive things can be mentioned in this area too.
In the amendment, reference is made to the wide range of conscientious objections, with which we do, or do not, agree.
After all, in the framework of respect for conscience, the latter is not at all interesting.
I therefore hope for wide support from this House.
In my view, the rapporteur has handled the topic of religious freedom in his articles very proficiently.
It is all the sadder that plain prejudice on the part of the press has often led to only this 1% of the text that deals with violence in religion being given so much attention.
I hope that the rapporteur will not give this too much of a hearing and simply continues unstintingly along the path that his report has mapped out.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, like Mr Caudron and all of us here, wonder what we can do to stop this annual event of our report on human rights becoming a ritual.
I feel that there is something we could do, and that is to press on with our practical monitoring and condemnation of human rights abuses, to implement the resolutions adopted in this House without confining our duties to the declarations of principle that we write on our cards, to provide - as the Commissioner, too, has said - funds and practical resources, as well as training and support, for those who work in the field of human rights, starting with the United Nations, and, lastly, to support journalists - many journalists have been killed in the past year, Commissioner - whom I believe are a source of witness and verification which is important, not least for Parliament.
With regard to Mr van den Bos' report, it would appear clear that we need to prevent religion becoming a divisive factor once again in the third millennium, as it has been for a long time.
We need to avoid fresh forms of intolerance and new forms of discrimination developing in the name of God, not least in some highly civilised countries, in some highly civilised Western democracies: a world divided and traversed by new crusades would be a terminally ill world, and we must prevent it.
Today, Mr President, I believe that the battle for human rights can no longer be seen as a battle of principles, that it cannot be won by cunning or by taking short cuts.
We therefore call upon the Council to make every endeavour to ensure that the human rights clause - we have already heard this in the Council's speech - is not seen as just a minor addition but represents a firm ideal of legal and democratic civilisation which Parliament will ensure is never diminished.
Mr President, the EU and US should be the two principal forces leading the fight for human rights internationally.
We can only do that if we are united in our assessment of what constitutes full respect for human rights and if we are credible through consistency between what we do at home and say abroad.
There is a gulf of mutual incomprehension between the EU and the US.
We think 'how can Americans insist on executing people, insist on boycotting the International Criminal Court and insist on denying Guantanamo bay detainees a fair trial?'
There are about 18 EU citizens and residents incarcerated at Camp Delta.
One of my London constituents, Feroz Abbasi, is among them.
There must be joint EU pressure on the US to secure civilian trials with normal safeguards.
The war on terror must not become an onslaught on civil liberties.
If we permit unjustified surveillance, detention and discrimination against minorities, especially Muslims, we will weaken our moral credibility as well as foster more terrorism.
The best maxim is 'practice what you preach'.
Together, the EU and US are a formidable team.
Divided, we weaken our power for human rights.
Mr President, when the European Union talks about human rights, the people have every reason to worry.
Memories of the criminal invasions of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq are still fresh.
The problem, of course, is that the peoples suffering the 'benevolence' of the European Union and its imperialist friends insist on resisting their liberators.
The same applies to the people of Cuba, who are not convinced of the advantages of the free market.
The European Union, which has appointed itself as the global defender of human rights, uses them selectively as a lever for exercising pressure in order to impose its policy.
It has in its sights regions and states which are of geostrategic and economic importance and states such as Cuba, Vietnam, China, Belarus etc. with inconvenient social and political systems. Even religious freedom is being used for this purpose, while the Turco resolution reaches the point of proposing an 'offshore' law with punishments and sanctions in accordance with the US standard.
On the other hand, the European Union and the report turn a blind eye to the violations of human rights in the USA, with the anti-terrorism legislation allowing secret arrests and special courts martial.
They do the same for Israel, Turkey and the candidate countries which prosecute and ban communist parties.
There is an urgent need, ladies and gentlemen, for the people to put an end to this hypocrisy.
Mr President, I wish sincerely to thank Mr van den Bos for his devoted and far-sighted work on human rights in the world.
I wish particularly to emphasise issues surrounding the defence of religious freedom, for which Mr van den Bos has provided a sound basis in this document and which I myself have been able to be involved in further strengthening.
The European Parliament draws attention to bans on missionary activity and threats of punishment in cases where people change faith.
We would censure acts of violence based on a misinterpretation of religion or faith.
The European Parliament would point to the vulnerability experienced by members of religious minorities around the world.
An important observation in the document is that atheistic extremism may undermine people's ability to co-exist peacefully.
We also warn against intolerance based on atheism.
It is stated that the rights of women and girls are threatened by child marriage.
We also indicate the important role of the media in disseminating knowledge of religions and cultures.
An important principle emphasised in Mr van den Bos's report is the right to change or renounce one's faith and to seek one's own spiritual home in freedom and without encountering legislation that is oppressive or that gives rise to threats of punishment for those who change their faith and religion.
We wish to remove bans upon, and threats in connection with, converting from one religion to another.
We wish to resist punishments and other practices in the name of religion that violate human freedoms and rights.
Finally, this important document contains legitimate repudiations of the choice of Libya as Chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
Criticism is also directed against Cuba, where 78 human rights activists have been locked up because of their work on human freedoms and rights.
Mr President, Mr van den Bos' excellent report has puzzled me on two points.
The first is the almost excessive emphasis he places on religion.
The second is an implicit idea that we can discern by reading between the lines, namely that freedom of conscience would be guaranteed by tolerance of different beliefs.
I will not dwell on the first point: it is a political choice of the rapporteur and has been explained.
However, with regard to the second issue, that is, the pluralism of beliefs as support for human rights in a society, I am a great deal more sceptical.
Firstly, this idea relegates atheists and agnostics to the rank of infidels, a sort of status by default.
However, more seriously, I am convinced that only the structural secularity of a state or a federation of states can guarantee each person's freedom of conscience.
This structural secularity places beliefs where they are needed, in other words in the private domain.
It is of little relevance whether one is in private an atheist, a Catholic, a Jew, a Muslim or a follower of any peaceful sect.
With regard to sects, I will refer to the words of Anna Morelli, a Belgian historian of religions: what is a sect, if not a religion that has not received the support of a political power.
Yet in the public arena, and particularly in the political arena, all religious interference must be banned, all occultist influence denounced.
These are the only genuine guarantees of citizens' freedom of conscience and quite simply of their freedom.
The van den Bos report would have been even more forceful if his conclusions had gone this far.
Mr President, I should like in the short time at my disposal to put a question to Minister Antonione and Commissioner Nielson, which has to do with paragraph 135, which stresses the central role of education to mutual understanding and so forth.
We are at the start of the school year; in the occupied part of Cyprus, there was only one school, in Rizokarpaso, which was allowed to operate.
Today, Mr Denktash's occupying authorities are not allowing the secondary school to operate and two or three days ago they also expelled the primary school teachers.
This is an urgent matter.
The school year is starting, the children may be left without a school and families will probably leave to go to the part of the Republic of Cyprus where all the schools are allowed to operate.
That is why I should like an answer from Mr Nielson and Mr Antonioni as to the extent of the action they will take in order to raise this matter with the occupying authorities.
Mr President, Mr van den Bos is to be congratulated on his work, but the trouble with a wide-ranging report like this is that it eventually includes everyone's pet hobby-horse and the key messages may be obscured.
It is a clichÃ© now to state that human rights are indivisible.
But I am not convinced that the human rights of mass murdering terrorists or those that aid and abet them in any way deserve the same consideration as those of decent law-abiding citizens.
We are reminded that in the fight against terrorism our democracies must take care not to abuse civil liberties and human rights.
This is, of course, true, but equally, we must not allow human rights to become a political weapon in the terrorist armoury.
It is the terrorists and their apologists that are the biggest abusers of the human rights of our citizens.
It is very easy for us to wring our hands over all the human rights abuses around the world.
To my mind, the European Union should focus more precisely on some achievable objectives where it has leverage.
It should concentrate action on a few areas where there is the possibility of getting results and then act with consistency and determination.
I think of Burma - on which I shall speak tomorrow - and Zimbabwe, where millions of people are suffering under Mugabe's tyranny, a situation shamefully tolerated and encouraged by leaders in some African countries in the region.
Resolutions of this Parliament have too often been ignored by the Council.
Some countries have tried to exploit the situation to their own advantage.
Instead there should be a consistent, coherent approach based on a clear strategy to remove Mugabe's boot from the neck of his people.
It could be done.
Corrupt and brutal governments in failed states are usually the main source of human rights abuse of millions of the world's most disadvantaged people.
As British Conservatives, we are insistent that, in return for enhanced development assistance, recipient countries should implement their side of the bargain, namely good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
Maybe then we would have some progress.
Mr President, if human rights form the core of European values, this annual report on human rights represents one of the most important dates of the year within this European Parliament.
I congratulate Mr van den Bos on his work, struggling as he was with the large number of competing priorities and demands.
It remains a problem for Parliament on how far individual countries should be named in this report.
Why should, for example, freedom of religion be criticised in Laos, Vietnam and Pakistan, but not in Turkmenistan or Saudi Arabia?
The resolution identifies some structural changes at EU level which could genuinely improve enforcement of human rights, including better operation of the human rights clause between the EU and third countries, inclusion of the European Parliament in discussion of the operational programme on human rights, and the introduction of benchmarks which enable EU action short of the two often blunt instruments of sanctions policies or suspension of aid.
I hope the Commission will consider these in detail.
Finally, just as Parliament voted earlier today in favour of a UN Convention on disability, it is right that the abuse of the human rights of people with disabilities are represented within this comprehensive resolution.
This is not just about economic and social rights, but about people all over the world who have lost their lives or who have been subject to abuse simply because they are disabled.
For example, abuse occurs in residential institutions where people are deprived of basic human dignity, including the use of caged beds in psychiatric institutions in countries which will next year become full members of the European Union.
On this and all the issues identified in this report, human rights are indivisible within Europe as well as elsewhere in the world.
Mr President, this report wants us to believe that the European Union has a major role to play as regards human rights at global scale.
It is a fact that in the wealthy countries of Western Europe and in the United States, personal rights and freedoms are slightly better protected than among the poor majority of the planet, as long as you do not look too closely.
As long as you close your eyes to the hunt for immigrants, the so-called 'sans-papiers', the deportation orders, the laws against poor people, as long as you forget that many people are refused the right to decent housing.
As long as you ignore the fact that in a country such as France freedom of expression stops at factory doors, that distributing a political pamphlet inside can be justification for dismissal.
As long as you forget that in some EU countries basic rights are refused to women, such as the choice of whether or not to have a child.
As long as you believe that it is normal that the right to employment, to a decent wage is not recognised as a fundamental right and is not applied.
Even though limited human rights are only assured in wealthy countries because they are refused to the poor people of the planet, it is precisely the wealthy countries, so proud of their human rights at home, that maintain in the poor countries a number of terrible regimes, based on oppression and, in particular, on endless misery.
Mr President, although satisfied with the report, my group too feels that it must use the time available to stress that it is essential that the European Parliament continues to make use of all the resources available to it more resolutely to ensure that the issue of human rights is given greater prominence in our decision-making and that the policies we follow are more effective.
I believe that, as far as human rights in general in the world are concerned - and I would single out in this broad category the rights of the child and women's rights - there is still potential which has yet to be fully exploited in the decisions that we take regarding all the aid policies, not least in respect of developing countries, potential which we must exploit with greater determination and resolution to promote the need to respect human rights.
I believe that there is a problem of information here, too, and I agree with the statement in the report regarding the need for Parliament in general and the committees handling the decisions relating to these countries' policies, in particular, to have greater, quicker, more certain access to absolutely up-to-the-minute daily information on what is happening in those countries.
To conclude, I, too, want to mention the death penalty, which is an ongoing concern for everyone and on which everyone must continue to develop a policy.
. (IT) Mr President, I should like, very briefly, to reply to Mr Alavanos, who raised an issue of which the Council has no knowledge.
Within the bounds of the Council's powers, I can assure you that we will investigate the matter.
I will respond to Mr Alavanos in writing, if necessary.
. I only need make one final, general remark.
I sensed quite a lot of frustration in many of the contributions reflecting the lack of clear decisions with binding effect and the lack of effective instruments to enforce respect of human rights in the world.
Some of it almost had an air of extra-territoriality, even coming close to unilateralist language.
We have to take care and stay faithful to other values that are important for our self-esteem and our project.
We have to remain multilateralist.
And when addressing these difficult issues no short-cut is possible.
When the poor from the Third World look at us in Europe - even if they do not understand the figures, this illustrates their image of us - they see that every cow in Europe gets two euro per day in subsidy.
Over there, 1.2 billion people live on less than one dollar a day.
More than half of the population in the world gets less than two dollars per day.
This is not to move away from the core theme of this debate, but when we talk about perceptions and how this world sees itself, we have to keep it in mind.
Everybody talks about the international society.
We do not have one.
We are trying to create one.
This is where we have a good case for being Europeans at this time.
We have to combine that with the issues we discuss here.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
- (FR) The report rightly condemns the human rights situation in many countries.
However, it is unfortunate that the Maghreb countries as well as Israel are strangely absent.
Indeed, 2002 marked a worrying, repressive turning point in those countries, particularly with regard to freedom of expression: detention of and judicial proceedings against leaders of the Kabylie citizens' movement in Algeria and now attacks on the freedom of the press; imprisonment of an Internet journalist in Tunisia; censorship and the charging of journalist Ali Lmrabet in Morocco; and attacks carried out by the Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara.
In the West Bank, the building of the wall of shame represents serious infringement of the Palestinian people's right to move freely and right to land; it poses a threat to human rights and to peace.
Finally, in many countries, the supposed fight against terrorism provides an excuse for security and repressive measures.
This must be resisted.
Moreover, it is up to us to ensure that the calling into question of international law, which has been dangerously trivialised by the American authorities, does not lead to a world where economic and political interests always take priority over the rights of individuals and peoples.
The next item is the report (A5-0281/2003) by Mr Sylla, on behalf of the Committee on Citizen's Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the situation as regards fundamental rights in the European Union (2002) [2002/2013(INI)].
- (FR) Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that I am honoured to present this annual report on the situation as regards human rights.
It is a summary of the fundamental values on which the European Union is founded, a summary that is recognised and that is included in Part II of the draft Constitution prepared by the Convention.
In my view, according to Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, the European institutions may monitor, each according to their respective remits, strict respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on the part of the Member States.
I hope that, following this vote, the legally binding nature of the Charter, once implemented, will enable European citizens to directly and individually refer matters to the EU's Court of Justice.
I say that because I insisted on involving citizens in the drafting of the Charter.
Thus, at the first hearing I included two schools, one German and one French, which have been following the work for six months now.
I then brought together the major non-governmental organisations - Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights - as well as representatives of the national parliaments, including the candidate countries.
I believe that I was therefore able to gain a great deal more information and verify it during my own visits.
An overabundance of information, far from being a handicap, can be very rewarding.
Therefore, I also wanted to ensure that the report highlighted strong elements.
For me, this meant first of all looking at perhaps one of the greatest splits in the European continent since the fall of the Berlin Wall, namely the consequences of 11 September, both within and outside the Union.
I had the opportunity of undertaking a three-week study trip to the United States.
While crossing the country, I saw that there are still very many negative effects of 11 September.
People are afraid and, above all, everyone recognises that an unprecedented wave of Islamophobia is growing: it is very much to their credit that they recognise it.
Churches, judges, citizens and NGOs were working to protect Muslims.
From that point of view, it should be a lesson for us.
Why should it be a lesson for us?
In my opinion, all too often we forget the primary goal of terrorists: to destabilise the rule of law.
Therefore, each time we do something that does not help to strengthen the rule of law, anywhere, we are contributing to the aim of the terrorists, which is precisely to destabilise the rule of law.
It is then important to remember, within the context of defending the first fundamental right - the right to life - which is set out in the first chapter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the need to remain united in the fight against terrorism.
That is the least we can do while terrorists are striking indiscriminately.
One story came back to me when I was working on this report.
In 1994, I had the good fortune to meet with Nelson Mandela, who was just about to take power in South Africa.
At the very time when he was about to take power, a report was published that classified the ANC as a terrorist organisation.
Is it not also true that the German Occupation considered the Resistance to be terrorists?
The UN has listed more than 142 definitions of terrorism.
At some stage, one wants to say: everyone has their own adversary.
Nonetheless, Mr President, the fact remains that terrorism today is a real source of conflict from all points of view and can lead to caution within societies and cause them to shut themselves off.
It is therefore up to us to ensure that in this context we find solutions as quickly as possible.
I am thinking, in particular, of the concern regarding the fact that citizens, European nationals, are today being held in what I would call great secrecy in Cuba because they are suspected of have carried out terrorist acts.
Thus, combating terrorism also means helping to maintain the rule of law.
The second thing that worries me is the situation in our prisons.
I think that it is particularly shocking at this beginning of the millennium to see what is happening in the EU's prisons, where the situation is far from satisfactory.
The prisons are overpopulated almost everywhere, and particularly in France, where there are 60 000 prisoners but room for only 50 000.
Another concern is the threats posed to freedom of expression.
Here I am thinking, in particular, of the economic mega-groups and the case of Italy.
The final problem is equality.
From this point of view, it is essential for more European political parties to sign the 1998 Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society as soon as possible.
Moreover, the Member States' transposition of the directives adopted by the Council to combat all types of discrimination in the workplace is often incomplete or even nonexistent.
Other issues, such as solidarity, civic and social rights, gender equality and equality in the workplace, seem to me to tie in with European citizenship and justice.
Too much progress is still required.
I did not want to point the finger at any specific country.
I simply wanted us to share what is best in each of our countries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to welcome this timely debate and congratulate the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Sylla, on the report we are today discussing, which has demonstrated the ongoing nature of the efforts being made by Parliament on protecting fundamental rights in the European Union.
There is one particularly significant aspect to this report: this is the first Parliamentary report drawn up on the basis of the annual report on the situation of fundamental rights in the Union and in the Member States drafted by the network of independent experts set up by the Commission at the specific request of the European Parliament.
The network's report expresses the points of view of independent experts, not that of the Commission, and examines the specific situation of the protection of fundamental rights, in light of changes in national legislation and national practices and of developments in the case law of the Luxembourg and Strasbourg Courts.
I therefore welcome the fact that the network's report has been useful to your work.
I am also aware that it is certainly possible to improve it in future and to make it more operational, as proposed in item 4 of Mr Sylla's report.
In line with the recommendations that Parliament will in all likelihood approve, the Commission has already held discussions with the coordinator of the network of experts in the aim of adapting the network's work to the concerns and priorities expressed by Parliament.
I can also state that, in future, the honourable Members of this House will also have access to the national reports drawn up by each expert in the network and that meetings between the network and the future EP rapporteur will be held more frequently.
Similarly, as early as October, the Commission will be holding a meeting with representatives of non-governmental organisations to ensure that the information included in the report is as complete and as reliable as possible.
We are clearly at an extremely important juncture for the protection of fundamental rights in the European Union.
Firstly, because the Union will be enlarging to encompass the entire European family and, secondly, because the Union is laying down its constitutional rules following the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe and in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.
The Union is also working on an area of freedom, security and justice which, it is hoped, will contribute to defining its true identity as a political union that respects the fundamental values of the democratic rule of law.
With regard to the cases raised by Mr Sylla's report and to some of the problems in the field of fundamental rights in the European Union, I wish to inform the House that the Commission has already adopted, or is in the process of adopting in relation to some of the issues, measures that will provide solutions.
In October 2002, the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on compensating victims of crime in general, which specifically covers victims of terrorism.
With regard to freedom of movement and of residence, which is a crucial element of the European project, on 15 April of this year, the Commission adopted an amended proposal for a directive rethinking freedom of movement.
We are also currently working closely with the Italian Presidency to ensure that Council and Parliament reach a common position that will enable a second reading to be held quickly so that this legislative process can be concluded before the European Parliament elections in June 2004.
Similarly, the Commission is closely monitoring the situation of the Roma minority in the context of enlargement, both from the point of view of countries' compliance with the political criteria for joining the European Union, and of their receiving funding through the PHARE programme.
We also intend to launch a study to assess the form that the Commission's programmes should take in order to ensure that they are coherent and effective.
With regard to preventive strategies to deal with the consequences of mass redundancies, the Union has developed a universal policy for addressing company restructuring.
Consequently, before any restructuring takes place, employees must be informed and consulted in order to eliminate or mitigate the social impact of such decisions.
The issue of reconciling family and working lives forms an integral part of the aims of the Community framework strategy for gender equality for the period 2001-2005.
With regard to the draft proposal for a framework decision on the procedural safeguards given to suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings in the European Union, which has arisen as a result of the Green Paper published by the Commission on 19 February, the drafting of this proposal is now under way and the text will be available at the end of November, once it has been adopted by the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union will have a Constitution.
Central to this Constitution, according to the conclusions of the Convention on the Future of Europe, will be the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was adopted by the preceding Convention and which received the political endorsement of the three institutions at the Nice European Council.
This means that a constitutional legal system will be based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union.
The Commission realises the importance, however, of implementing Article 7 of the Treaty of Nice before the Charter can take full effect.
To this end, I wish to confirm that at some point in September, the Commission will approve and submit to Parliament and Council a communication on the implementing conditions of Article 7 of the Treaty of Nice in the field of the protection of fundamental rights.
I shall conclude, therefore, by saying that, through this debate and through these initiatives, the Commission, like Parliament, is making a decisive contribution to a sea-change in the Union's legal and political framework.
One of the components of this transformation is that of fundamental rights, which must not only be respected but whose entire development must be safeguarded.
We will then be able to construct a genuine fundamental rights policy in the Union, implement it ourselves and thereby set an example to the entire world.
. Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Sylla for his thorough report on the situation of the fundamental rights in the Union in 2002.
The length of this report makes it clear that the European Union, which constantly preaches respect for fundamental rights to the rest of the world, is not yet free from breaches to these rights within its own borders.
As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for this report, I am happy that in paragraph 38 Italy is finally and explicitly named and shamed concerning its media concentration and the influence in this regard of its Prime Minister, without any rules at all on conflict of interest being adopted.
I say I am glad because the majority of Members on the Culture Committee sadly voted against making an example of Italy for its bad record in media concentration, which poses a very serious threat to democracy everywhere.
We all know that individual media conglomerates control a significant portion of the national news media in several European countries: Bertelsmann and Kirch in Germany, Rupert Murdoch's empire in the United Kingdom and Vivendi in France.
But Berlusconi's combination of media influence and political power is unique in Europe.
A recent report on media conflict of interest in Italy by the NGO Reporters Without Borders quotes Freimut Duve, the OCSE's representative for media freedom, who has repeatedly condemned the concentration of so much of the Italian news media in the Prime Minister's hands.
The OSCE says it is both a challenge to the European constitutional architecture and a bad example for new democracies in transition.
The Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly also holds that the potential conflict of interest between the holding of political office by Mr Berlusconi and his private economic and media interests is a threat to media pluralism.
I could elaborate further, but I am sure you all understand the problems that media ownership concentration in Italy poses to democracy and freedom of information.
I sincerely hope, therefore, that you all agree that the case of Italy should be included in this report.
. (EL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sylla, who has brought a very difficult job to a close.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights, I should like to express our deep satisfaction with the comments and recommendations in the report on safeguarding and applying democracy and equality in daily life and practice, in the sense of a balanced participation of the sexes in democratic institutions and respect for the human rights of women.
It is not possible, Commissioner, for women to be treated as human beings and citizens with restricted rights in twenty-first century Europe.
It is unacceptable for there still to be professional sectors and areas in the European Union in which Community legislation, democratic rules and fundamental freedoms only apply to men.
My committee has repeatedly condemned gender-based discrimination and discrimination based on sexual orientation or national or social origin.
In other words, we condemn the different weights and measures which derive mainly from cultural traditions and social stereotypes and which today refer to dark and sad periods in the history of mankind.
We insistently and constantly call for the self-evident: for human rights and fundamental freedoms to apply equally to men and women, with no discrimination whatsoever.
Only then will we be able to talk of the universality of human rights and mainstreaming.
I should also like to take the opportunity of today's vote on the report on the DAPHNE programme to prevent and combat violence against women, Commissioner, to call once again on the European Commission and the Member States, to put combating violence against women, which is the worst form of violation of women's rights, high on their political agenda.
I do not think that any policy should carry greater weight than the protection of human rights.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Sylla on his work and would also like to make two comments regarding the method I feel should be used for this report.
First of all, I would like to remind you that this is the third report since an extremely important reform, which Parliament desired, which involves looking at the situation of fundamental rights in the Union in light of the Charter, and this implies a number of obligations.
We have established the means - a network of experts that produces a report, normally a collective working group - but the catchword is above all the Charter and nothing but the Charter.
That naturally requires the rapporteur and all those who would like this report to be adopted with broad support to ensure that it is not a pretext for political activism, that it is not an opportunity to put forward personal opinions, and that it is not a forerunner for action by lobbies that are totally unrelated.
Nothing but the Charter, but all of the Charter!
It is a principle that must be reasserted, as far as I am concerned.
My second comment relates to the countries.
This report is divided into two parts, according to EU regulation.
In reality, the report forms a whole and, thus, the resolution should contain only the true substance of the report and highlight only what Parliament would like the public to remember.
That would prevent nationalist reactions on the part of some of our colleagues who do not agree with their country being mentioned.
Also from this point of view, it would be in our interest to ensure that the resolution contains only the important points, those that correspond, in fact, to the reasons why Parliament decided to draw up this report.
It decided to draw up the report as a guardian of public liberties and so that it could answer the following question: was the Charter of Fundamental Rights as written, and not as one would like it to be written, respected during the year in question throughout the Union?
That is the aim of the report.
It is very important not to forget these aspects concerning the method if we want the report to be adopted with as broad a political foundation as possible.
Mr President, this is the fourth plenary debate in this parliamentary period on the human rights situation in the European Union.
It is therefore time for us to ask what has changed in the meantime.
Let us first look at the facts.
Structural highlights are, and continue to be, the misconduct of government officials such as police officers, the situation in prisons, trafficking in human beings, forms of unequal treatment and discrimination, racism and xenophobia.
If you take a cynical view, you say: what else is new?
In addition, however, civil rights are also put at risk by an over-reaction to terrorism, and this is a new problem.
We are worried about cooperation in terms of criminal justice with the United States and the exchange of personal data.
All in all, it therefore seems to me that the human rights issue within the European Union has become more pronounced over the past few years, despite the efforts of many to carry out improvements in specific areas.
With regard to the collection analysis of data, I can be somewhat more upbeat.
First of all, our work has become more systematic and objective, because we have taken the Charter of Fundamental Rights as our guiding principle.
Our work has also become more professional since we can now fall back on the network of experts under the guidance of Professor De Schutter.
Both improvements are clearly thanks to initiatives of this Parliament, and we should be pleased about this.
As far as the political response is concerned, I am a little less optimistic.
Each time, the European Parliament gets cold feet as soon as the time comes for someone to be nagged and shaken up a bit, and this year is no exception.
Despite this, it is clear that abuses in the Member States must be highlighted.
Why else would we have a report of this kind?
Consigning the abuses we have come across to an explanatory statement is, after all, not what we had in mind where human rights violations in third countries are concerned.
Mr van den Bos' sterling report, which was discussed earlier, bears witness to this.
I think that we should emulate this approach where human rights violations within the European Union are concerned, and this is why my group will be giving Mr Sylla's report its unqualified support.
As far as the European Commission's position is concerned, I have to say I have great regard for its commitment, and certainly for Commissioner Vitorino's own, about which he spoke in such quick order that it was even difficult to follow everything in detail.
There is a slight problem though.
The network is a fine institution, but is the Commission not hiding behind it too much and failing to catch enough of the limelight in what is always referred to in the textbooks as the role of the European Commission as the Guardian of the Treaties?
Where does the Commission itself stand on this, and when will it show the political courage to raise human rights issues in the European Union?
I am therefore very much looking forward to the communication that the Commissioner has announced regarding the further details of Article 7 of the Treaty of the European Union.
As for the Council, Mr President, allow me to add one thing: those empty seats over there are a downright scandal.
The gentlemen of the Presidency were present for the previous topic.
Should I infer from that that the Presidency takes the view that human rights only deserve serious consideration outside of the European Union?
I refuse to believe that.
Perhaps you can ask them on our behalf the reason for their absence.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur and saying that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports the report.
Even though we may have different views on certain parts of it, we should be able to agree that this survey is useful and significant.
I should nonetheless have liked to have seen more practical examples.
Mr Cornillet, I wonder for what purpose we should have this report if we did not single out a number of countries.
If the EU is to set an example to the world, we cannot put blinkers on and not put our own house in order.
What credibility would we then have in the surrounding world?
The question to the Commission and the Council is, of course: what practical measures are you taking to tackle the problems?
I wish to comment on three areas.
The first is the EU's and the Member States' asylum policy, which deserves to be criticised.
There is a political anxiety whereby all the countries apparently feel able to compromise fundamental legal principles.
Naturally, we must put an end to human smuggling and prevent the asylum system from being misused, but we cannot send refugees back to be tortured or ill-treated.
We must give all children who find their way to the EU the chance of a life of dignity.
There are many deficiencies in this area, including in my own country.
The second area is prison conditions.
We have overcrowded prisons, extensive violence and increasing problems involving ex-prisoners' readjustment to society.
Europe must have prisons that are fit for human beings.
The third area concerns a sensitive but important issue.
The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights states clearly and unambiguously that '[t]he freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected'.
I agree with Mr Eurig Wyn on this matter and wonder if it is perhaps an irony of fate that it is the Italian Presidency that is to get the Member States to agree upon a constitution that Italy, through its prime minister's monopoly on the media, clearly and unambiguously violates.
We cannot have this situation.
I want, in conclusion, to ask you, Commissioner, what you are doing about this sensitive matter.
The situation in the Italian media is the whole of Europe's responsibility, including yours, Mr Vitorino.
Mr President, I would like to welcome this report, which is an informative instrument on more than one level: it is an excellent compilation of the existing legislation, it monitors accurately the development of the legislation and, in particular, the effects of 11 September, and it provides clear proof that the perception of danger has changed the terms of the balance between freedom and security, that the increase in the number of exceptional laws has substantially limited our fundamental rights and held them up to ridicule.
With the adoption of European provisions such as the framework decisions on terrorism and the European arrest warrant, or even the freezing of assets of certain entities and individuals considered to be terrorists, the European Union is consolidating the many anti-terrorism and repressive laws adopted by the Member States.
However, if the need to combat terrorism must not be an excuse to adopt discriminatory and arbitrary laws, the absence of a clear and precise definition of terrorism in European legislation today allows the implicit criminalisation of social movements linked to freedom of expression and freedom of association.
A simple suspicion can result in detention.
Entire populations that were already vulnerable have been even more so since 11 September: nationals of third countries, asylum-seekers, Roma and Muslims.
With disregard for fundamental rights and public freedoms, these populations are often treated as if they pose a threat or a danger to state security and it is easy to blame it on 11 September.
It allows us to ignore the real issues society must face: integration, xenophobia and immigration and asylum policy.
Today, the fight against terrorism serves as a pretext for the fight against immigration, which is no longer considered to be anything but illegal.
The association agreements with Algeria, for example, are a good illustration of this amalgam of terrorism and immigration.
The same applies to the agreements on the readmission of sans-papiers sent to third countries.
The list of violations carried out within the European Union by the states and institutions is a long one: xenophobia, double punishment, arbitrary detention, discriminatory practices as regards hiring and housing, and offences based on identity.
Yet human rights have no borders, so we must be frank and begin by putting our own house in order.
We must stop using human rights as a currency with third countries; the aim of the European Union is to promote peace, the values of freedom, justice and solidarity and the welfare of its people.
We must now make all efforts to ensure that human rights are at last respected in the European Union for all residents, regardless of their nationality.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in both his explanatory statement and in the speech he made to this plenary, the rapporteur informed us that it was not his intention to draw up a report presenting an exhaustive framework of breaches of fundamental rights in all countries of the European Union.
The report does, however, in most of its 150 long articles, give in to this temptation, straying from its stated intentions and boundaries and in some cases serving as a political judgment on the Member States.
Such a role does not fall within the sphere of the European Parliament's competence, as we know, except in serious and specific situations that could trigger the sanctions set out in Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union.
Are any of the Member States really in such a situation?
I think not.
No one should conclude from my words that I am any less concerned about or attentive to protecting fundamental rights or to fighting against the various forms of discrimination.
Let us not forget that in the fields of combating terrorism, asylum policy and immigration, police and judicial cooperation, conditions of detention and many others, these are, in political terms, extremely sensitive matters.
Today, in stark contrast to the generous nature of the policies that have traditionally defined democratic systems, sophisticated forms of international crime and terrorism exist and only with a considerable sense of responsibility and balance will it be possible effectively to fulfil the requirements that the complex current situation sets for us all.
Mr President, I come from an ancient nation that prides itself on having been the first in Europe to abolish the death penalty and to abolish slavery and life imprisonment.
For this very reason, I find it hard to accept the criticism made in comments about supposedly racist behaviour or behaviour involving sexual discrimination which, at the very least, betray an ignorance of the facts.
Furthermore, I must inform you that the Portuguese authorities are continuing to modernise their prison system and to make it more humane, without harbouring the illusion, of course, that they can do overnight everything that has not been done to date.
This, then, is my response to the report's main observation about Portugal, in the certainty that future documents will reflect, and with this I shall conclude, an improvement of the current and future situations in terms of the security of our citizens, and in the living and working conditions and also the safety of prisoners themselves.
Mr President, one of the problems with reports of this kind is that fundamental rights are given a politically flavoured explanation, which is subsequently prescribed as absolute standard.
This annual report contains yet again many painful areas.
For example, in paragraph 33, the Member States are requested to promote the principle of secular neutrality, which does not rule out the teaching of the history of religions in school, but this in fact flies in the face of the rights enshrined in the Dutch Constitution by outlawing religious classes themselves.
Indeed, it is possible to opt for special education in the Netherlands, a right which is assumed by many, including Christians, people with non-religious ideologies and now also Muslims.
It is downright ridiculous to find such a thoughtless, ill-formulated statement in an EP report.
What is it anyway, this principle of neutrality?
Politics, and therefore a government, is never neutral.
This once again sums up what happens every year when this report comes out.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our opinion, it would be a mistake to take the blinkered approach of looking at the issue of the protection of human rights solely in terms of the rights of individuals, seeing them as the one and only matter of any significance to anybody and disregarding the rights of peoples, their traditions and their cultural identities.
This can lead to blunders and completely the wrong line being taken, as, for example, where, examining the problem of widespread crime among immigrants from third countries, the report states that this is surely due to poor integration policies while completely disregarding the rights of the communities on the receiving end of this kind of unregulated immigration who suffer the damage and the harmful effects, not least in terms of their culture, of what is, in some cases, a genuine invasion and abuse of the rights of the people of the country of reception.
We are therefore extremely critical of a report which also seeks to introduce euthanasia by the back door.
Mr President, Mr FodÃ© Sylla, this House gave you the very clear brief of examining whether and to what extent fundamental rights are being upheld in the Member States of the European Union.
What you have delivered is unfortunately an ideological wish list, a shopping list of left-wing ideologies.
I say 'unfortunately' because it was an important and substantial report.
We can discuss the issues you raise in it, and we can be for them or against them, but the point is that they do not belong in the report about fundamental rights and respect for these rights in the European Union.
For that reason, and as a matter of principle we, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, will vote against this report.
You also, however, criticise a number of Member States, and as a rule you do so unfairly.
You have quite simply failed to inform yourself adequately about the real situation or you are criticising because the rules they have in place do not conform with your ideological preconceptions.
We reject the criticism - and that includes your criticism of Austria - because it is quite unjustified, and we therefore reject your report for these reasons as well.
Thirdly, I reject the report on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party because we do not support your substantive demands.
These range from the expansion of the right of asylum, to access to education and healthcare for illegal immigrants, the regularisation of the status of illegal immigrants, and recognition of the equality of all partnerships in the EU - we reject all these demands unequivocally.
Finally, we reject the report outright because of your demand that homosexual couples be given the right to adopt children.
You can think what you like about such partnerships: I tolerate them, but in the interests of the children, we must ensure that such a demand is never put into practice.
The Group of the European People's Party resolutely rejects your report for all the reasons I have stated and will vote against it.
Mr President, I would first like to stress the importance of this report, and in contrast to what some fellow Members have just said, to say how courageous it is to identify countries guilty of failure to respect the most basic human rights.
I say that because, unfortunately, we have to recognise that Mr Sylla's report is full of such examples, and it is not enough for us as Members of the European Parliament to denounce violations of fundamental rights in countries outside the EU if we do not point the finger at violations in our own countries.
Our good name is at stake here.
Furthermore, the conclusions of the report are extremely important as regards the other challenges we face.
For example, the current economic crisis and the many redundancies associated with it mean that we have to be particularly vigilant about respecting social rights.
For example, we are unfortunately having to contend with the closure of an assembly plant in the Somme region of France.
Recent events both in France and in other European companies also demonstrate that the freedom of the press is often violated. That certainly happened during the summer heatwave.
On an entirely different point, I would also like to support what some of the previous speakers have said: if the war on terror is to be legitimate, it should not involve flouting the most basic rights.
To conclude, Mr President, given that the Annual Report on Human Rights is the fourth of its kind, I would like to ask the same question as my colleague Mrs Swiebel: what is the human rights situation, and what changes has the report brought about?
Mr President, in the Spanish state, fundamental rights are being violated by terrorist killings, extortion, threats and violence.
Faced with these, the response, under the rule of law, must not be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but the application of democratic law and scrupulous respect for the human rights of all citizens, including the perpetrators of violence.
Nevertheless, the actions of the Spanish Government do not respect the rights of prisoners and their families. Prisoners are moved further away from their homes and not allowed to study in their mother tongues, thereby preventing them from registering in universities in their communities.
All of this goes against the constitutional objective of rehabilitation and social reintegration of prisoners with a view to achieving a fairer and more civilised society.
It is also unacceptable, in a state which purports to respect the rule of law, that the government has ordered the closure of two news organisations. These closures were furthermore of a pre-emptive nature and no sentence has been passed for any crime.
This is all the more serious in view of the fact that one of these daily newspapers - Egunkaria - is the only source of news written in a minority national language - Euskera - which we are obliged to respect and not to discriminate against under the terms of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, do not mention rope in the house of the hanged.
This Parliament is making a hopeless fool of itself by entrusting this report to a Communist.
It is an insult to all victims of the criminal Communist ideology.
It is tantamount to asking Mrs Claude to write a report on moral corruption, or to ask Mr Bernard Cantat to write a report on violence against women.
Mr Sylla has been elected on a Communist list; he must be the last person to talk to us about our fundamental rights.
This was demonstrated once again in this Chamber this morning.
I would refer in this connection to the shameful statements made by some of his group colleagues during the debate on Cuba this morning.
These were like a slap in the face of the many poor souls behind bars in Cuba.
Mr Sylla, take yourself to Havana to preach about fundamental rights, but not here in Europe, not here in Strasbourg!
When I hear the rapporteur call for the freedom of expression, I wonder whether we have ended up in the world of Orwell, because it was his party, no less, which in France continually took the lead to scale back the freedom of opinion, via totalitarian acts such as the Gayssot Act.
It was the party of this rapporteur which, some time ago, commissioned the bulldozing of a home for immigrants in Vitry-sur-Seine, so please let us remain serious.
Communists must be the last people on earth to give us lessons in what Europe should look like based on the principles of a constitutional state.
(Applause from the right)
Personal comments have been made about the rapporteur.
I will allow him 30 seconds to make any comment he wishes to make.
You are aware that we have freedom of expression here, even to be tactless at times.
Mr President, I would simply like to say that it is possible to have a debate without stigmatising people and without insulting and humiliating them.
I think that the least we can expect is tolerance, and failing that then at least respect.
That, however, is asking too much of the person concerned.
I will not reciprocate by name calling and hurling insults, but I think she is the one who is unfit to sit in this House.
Mr President, Basque citizens should take note of the fact that Mr Ortuondo cares more for ETA prisoners than for the victims of terrorism.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with the new annual report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union which, owing to the method used for its production - a different political group every year - makes it impossible for the final result to reflect a consensus - which furthermore is necessary - of all the groups in this House.
This would be my first critical comment with a view to future reports.
Mr Sylla - whom I respect and whom I thank personally - has made considerable efforts to ensure that the European Union's anti-terrorist policy is well-considered and supported by this Parliament.
I would like to expressly state, however - and in this regard I do disagree with his explanatory statement - that it is only the victims of terrorism who really suffer torture and all types of suffering, and not the ETA terrorists, who use the strategy of accusations of torture to try to weaken the rule of law.
This is why in paragraph 12 we called for a European instrument for compensating victims which, let us hope, will be reflected in the 2004 budgets.
Nevertheless, there are other issues which prevent an entirely positive assessment of it.
One of them is its proposal on active euthanasia, which clashes head-on with a decision of the European Council of 26 March 2002, or the chapter relating to immigration and asylum, which confuses economic immigration with asylum seekers - an issue which has already been overcome by the Commission and also within our Parliamentary debate - or the request for equivalence between marriage and homosexual partnerships, and it also proposes that homosexual partnerships be allowed to adopt children, something which goes further than the logical non-discrimination against any person on the grounds of their sexual orientation.
We can also talk about the proposal that resident third-country nationals who have been in European territory for more than three years should participate in municipal and even European elections, which would mean removing the link between European citizenship and nationality, thereby depriving it of any content.
Something else which I consider to be a serious error is the very negative reference made to cooperation with the United States on an issue which, apart from anything else, does not correspond to the year dealt with by the report, that of the communication of passenger data to the United States authorities, which is currently at the negotiation stage and subject to open debate in this Parliament.
Mr President, I must categorically reject the words directed at me by Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar.
I could reply in the same tone. I am not going to do so.
I believe that the first thing I said in my speech was that in the Spanish state fundamental rights are being suspended as the result of the actions of violent people.
I will never put the rights of violent people before the rights of others.
If we really want to resolve the political conflict being endured by the Basques, however, we must begin by respecting all the human rights of all the citizens, without exception.
Mr President, Mr Sylla's report provides an excellent opportunity to recall that immigrant communities resident in the European Union are particularly exposed and are the main victims of breaches of fundamental rights.
Measures intended to create a genuine and coherent Community policy on illegal immigration are experiencing delays in being adopted that are incompatible with the urgency and the gravity of the problems facing these individuals.
Measures designed, on the other hand, to guarantee security or to control illegal immigration, measures that are generally repressive, have shown themselves able to bring about consensus between governments more easily than measures that are positive or which seek to integrate communities.
We can see the progress made in 2002 with the adoption of various instruments that constitute the first steps towards a common immigration and asylum policy.
Amongst these instruments, I would highlight the directives on minimum standards for the reception of asylum-seekers in Member States, the directive on refugee status, the Dublin II regulation and the directive on reuniting families.
These instruments are not sufficient, however, to remedy the weak legal and social position of the several thousand immigrants who have settled in our countries and whose situation is extremely precarious and exposed to all types of abuse.
One fundamental instrument is still awaiting final approval by the Council: the European Statute on Long-Term Residents, which applies to immigrants who have lived within the territory of a Member State for more than five years and which will give those concerned the right to a set of benefits in the same conditions that apply to nationals of that country.
Mr President, finding a way out of these dead ends is crucial if we are genuinely to raise the level of protection of fundamental rights within the Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some of us are extremely concerned: 'Our children, our children, our children ?'.
Our rapporteur warns them that 87% of cases of child abuse occur in the family, according to figures never discussed; another 4% occur in seminaries.
Maybe we should give homosexuals a chance - it might be better for the children.
A moving speech from Mr Borghezio: the right of peoples should prevail over the right of individuals.
Whether you are talking about our Benito Mussolini, Saddam Hussein or any of the others, the right of peoples has always prevailed over the right of individuals.
The right of peoples, indeed, of peoples fighting each other.
Our President has declared inadmissible, unacceptable, an amendment calling for freedom of access to documents.
If these are the sorts of things we are doing, then hurrah for Commissioner Vitorino!
Hurrah for this democratic scrutiny which we have achieved for the first time in 2003!
Hurrah for the rapporteur!
We will gladly vote for the report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again, we have before us a report which has now become rather a routine event.
We should therefore all be sitting here calmly, but, as you can see, it is a report which still provokes heated debate after four years.
Moreover, we are discussing principles which distinguish a civilised society from a tribal community, and, in this respect, the Charter of Fundamental Rights would seem to be the most appropriate, most equitable, most reliable reference when it comes to principles and values.
I endorse the broad lines taken by the report: no to terrorism, protection of prisoners, combating the trafficking of human beings, data protection and protection of privacy, provision of accurate information, immigration, asylum and many other issues like, once again, combating all forms of discrimination.
It is a shame that all these issues, these principles, are jeopardised somewhat, adulterated by invasive ideological and political views when they warrant greater respect.
Consider, for example, the safeguarding of Christian roots and the traditional family unit - a man and a woman united by the common goal of procreation.
Once again, we are attempting to impose on 15 Member States a model which is only accepted by three countries in Europe, and we are doing so, ladies and gentlemen, with force which, although purely verbal, is, nonetheless, violence.
It is a shame where the information sector is concerned too, where a serious issue such as this has been defiled by pure political propaganda such as the contribution of the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport - whom I will not name so as not to give them the right to reply - who has defiled an extremely serious subject with the tone and content of a vulgar party propaganda leaflet, behaviour which, moreover, condemns itself.
I am glad to say, ladies and gentlemen, that this is only an opinion, or rather a set of opinions, which has no legal effect.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report, which each year gives us an opportunity to examine the fundamental rights situation in the European Union, provides an excellent reminder for those who would prefer to forget the universal nature of fundamental rights.
It is sometimes a very bitter pill to swallow, but it can teach us some very salutary lessons.
I would particularly like to single out the strengthening of European citizenship, which undeniably involves the right to vote in local and European elections.
This right is denied to legal residents in several Member States on the grounds that they are not national citizens or are non-EU citizens.
At a time when we are drawing up a constitutional model which ensures that exclusion and discrimination have no place in the enlarged Europe, we must put an end to this situation, failing which our European project and the values that we advocate will lose all credibility.
The time we have available is very short, but this House must take up this major challenge over the coming months.
Mr President, a practical approach to this report will immediately highlight its most important virtue - the fact that European institutions will no longer be able to ignore the pitiful situation of human rights protection in daily life in the Member States.
As the rapporteur says, this annual report will, in future, be valued and possibly even feared.
Though I fully share Mr Sylla's view, I must confess that I have some reluctance in accepting a report subjected to the pressure of current standards of political correctness, which passes over in silence more important considerations such as evident breaches of human rights and political freedoms in some Member States such as the Kingdom of Spain.
Commissioner Vitorino, in paragraph 22, the report clearly calls, as an urgent matter, for action to be taken in favour of prisoners who suffer from serious diseases.
Bautista Barandalla, a Navarrian prisoner, suffers from an incurable illness.
His case is the object of my written question to the Commission tabled last March.
I invite everybody to take a look at Commissioner Vitorino's response on 11 June 2003.
If I were you I would feel very ashamed of it, Mr Vitorino.
Mr President, I would like to clarify one point: I certainly accept responsibility for this report, but I must point out that it was adopted in committee by 24 votes to 17.
Furthermore, it was the subject of a number of amendments, which I discussed with the Chairman of my committee once again this morning.
That means that not all the proposals and amendments were of my making.
I believe that some caution is called for.
Debates do take place and some points are not clear-cut.
Nevertheless, that does not mean that I am not considering this issue.
I find it really shocking that the role of the rapporteur should be reduced to a duty of responsibility.
My intention was quite simply to emphasise those points that I regard as important, and in particular the aftermath of the attacks on 11 September 2001, conditions in prisons and discrimination.
Various proposals were subsequently made, however, which I did not originate.
I am neither for nor against the adoption of children by same-sex couples, it is quite simply not a clear-cut issue.
Thank you very much to the rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
The next item on the agenda is Question Time (B5-0273/2003).
We will take questions to the Council, which is represented by Mr Antonione.
Mr Antonione will be aware that we are starting very late as a result of previous delays, naturally. We have inherited this delay from previous debates.
I think it prudent to ask him to remain with us beyond 7 p.m. and, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I would also say that it would seem prudent to restrict supplementary questions to just one so that we can take as many questions as possible.
This is my recommendation and I trust you will cooperate fully.
Question No 1 by Camilo Nogueira RomÃ¡n, which has been taken over by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (H-0433/03)
Subject: Migrants tragically drowned off the Union's southern Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts
In the last few days 70 African migrants have been drowned, this time off the coast of Sicily.
Such tragic events have become a frequent occurrence, off the Union's southern Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, especially near the Canary Islands and Andalusia, and are a black mark on Europe's conscience.
Thousands of migrants, many of them pregnant women and young children, have died in this way in recent years.
What non-repressive political action does the Union intend to take to prevent such catastrophes?
. (IT) I am afraid I must start, Mr President, by saying that I have a plane to catch and so I cannot grant your request.
However, all the questions will receive a written answer so we will be able to fulfil our obligation.
With regard to Question No H-0433/03, the Council condemns the tragic incidents mentioned by the honourable Member.
The immigration strategy followed by the Union is intended not only to draw up and implement measures to combat illegal immigration and to prevent and control this phenomenon but also to strengthen relations with third countries of origin and transit of immigrants.
We must, therefore, remember that the conclusions of the Seville European Council of 21 and 22 June 2002 noted that it is crucial for the European Union and its Member States that migration flows should be managed in accordance with the law, in cooperation with the countries of origin and transit of such flows.
They also noted that combating illegal immigration requires a greater effort on the part of the European Union, with the use of all appropriate instruments in the context of the European Union's external relations.
To this end, they stated that an integrated, comprehensive and balanced approach to tackling the root causes of illegal immigration must remain the European Union's constant, long-term objective.
They also pointed out that closer economic cooperation, trade expansion, development assistance and conflict prevention are all means of promoting economic prosperity in the countries concerned and thereby reducing the underlying causes of migration flows.
In line with the Seville European Council, the conclusions of the Thessaloniki European Council of 19 and 20 June 2003 reaffirmed that the EU dialogue and actions with third countries in the field of migration should be part of an overall integrated, comprehensive and balanced approach.
It should also be mentioned that, in December 2002, the Commission produced a communication entitled 'Integrating Migration Issues in the EU's Relations with Third Countries', which stressed, in particular, the relationship between migration and development.
This relationship and synergy are, moreover, recognised and stressed by the Council in the conclusions relating to the communication adopted on 19 April 2003, in which the Council states specifically that an effective, coherent development policy is an essential part of an effective migration policy and recognises that, if properly managed, migration can be a positive growth and development factor for both the European Union and the countries concerned, while illegal migration has a damaging effect on both the individuals in question and the countries of origin, transit and destination.
The Council therefore notes that, in order to establish an effective migration policy, we need to develop a genuine partnership with third countries to bring about more effective, common management of migration flows.
Moreover, I must mention the Commission's working document of July 2003 on closer cooperation with countries of origin with a view to managing migration flows.
This document, intended to implement the conclusions adopted by the Council on 19 November 2002, examines the state of cooperation with a number of third countries and makes proposals for closer, improved cooperation.
The implementation of the conclusions of the Seville and Thessaloniki European Councils on the basis, in particular, of the guidelines which emerged from the Commission's communications is the subject of an in-depth analysis carried out by the Council organs.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President?in-Office of the Council for this reply, but must remind him that, just today, a news item appeared in the Spanish press stating that the Red Cross, which is dealing with the immigrants arriving on the Andalusian coasts, specifically in Tarifa, just yesterday had to ask local Andalusian citizens for clothing to give to the immigrants who were there, who had arrived on the coast and who were living in deplorably inhumane conditions.
In this regard, what I would like to ask is whether you believe that, independently of all these issues approved at European Councils, we should not take humanitarian measures appropriate to the everyday reality taking place on our coasts, and other places which are not coastal, where there are immigrants living in bad conditions who require suitable humanitarian assistance?
. (IT) This is a question to which we will certainly give consideration; moreover, it has already been discussed at a number of European Councils, which attached due importance to it.
We will undertake to return to this question to explore it in greater depth and see how we can respond more fully.
Question No 2 by Manuel Medina Ortega (H-0439/03):
Subject: Operation Ulysses
Can the Council provide information on the success of Operation Ulysses in curbing illegal immigration in the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic?
. (IT) As I pointed out in my answer to Question No H-0086/03 by the honourable Member, a final report on the implementation of programmes, ad hoc centres, pilot projects and joint operations was presented at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 5 and 6 June 2003 with a view to it being sent to the Thessaloniki European Council.
The European Council has taken note of the results of the various operations described in the report.
As far as the Ulysses project is concerned, the Council was informed that it was to be implemented in two stages: the first stage, in the Mediterranean, took place between 25 January and February this year, and the second, which was to be implemented at the beginning of April, also this year, was temporarily suspended because of the war in Iraq.
The second stage was finally implemented between 27 May and 2 June this year and consisted of the surveillance and monitoring of the territorial waters off the coasts of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean.
A number of Member States took part in both stages of the operation.
Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain played an active role in the first stage of the project, while Greece, Norway, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland participated as observers, together with Europol.
The second stage saw the active participation of the United Kingdom, France and Spain.
The added value of the Ulysses project lies in the fact that various human resources and pieces of equipment were pooled and deployed jointly in a number of practical tasks, and in the fact that information was exchanged using advanced technologies.
It was reported that, overall, 454 illegal migrants were caught and 15 swimmers intercepted as a result of the coordinated efforts of the air, land and sea forces.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for the detailed information you have given me on the result of the Ulysses project.
One aspect which perhaps you have not highlighted is that, as a result of the division into two phases, while the first phase was strengthened in the Western Mediterranean, immigration in the Atlantic increased, and when the second phase took place in the Atlantic, immigration in the Mediterranean increased.
I put this question in relation to a new project which is apparently going to be implemented very soon - Neptune - which would involve the central Mediterranean.
Does the Presidency-in-Office of the Council not believe that we should coordinate actions so that the pressure on one side does not force immigration to be diverted to other entry points, at least by sea?
. That is a very good point.
Coordination is absolutely essential if we are to obtain better results, and we can therefore endorse your recommendation.
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the problem cannot be resolved solely by means of Operation Ulysses, and so my question in relation to illegal immigration is this: what happened to the proposals to introduce a European border guard or European border police?
. (IT) This is a subject which has already been debated.
Of course, there was a general position to that effect - advocating the creation of a European police force with a view to better control.
To date, no decisions have been taken on the matter, but I am sure that the Council will come back to the issue.
When it does, we will be able to be more specific regarding the decisions it intends to adopt.
Question No 3 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0449/03):
Subject: Position of the Italian EU Presidency regarding clandestine immigrants
According to press reports (Financial Times, 25.6.2003), Umberto Bossi, President of the Northern League and member of Italy's governing coalition, called for coastguards to fire on vessels transporting clandestine immigrants into Italy, frequently including many women and children.
Does Umberto Bossi's attitude reflect the position of the Italian Presidency and if not, how has the latter expressed its disapproval?
. (IT) It is not for the Council to comment on statements of the kind reported by the honourable Member in his question.
However, I would point out that, as it states in its programme, the Italian Presidency will endeavour to promote joint management of migration flows which preserves a proper balance between the policy of integrating foreigners legally residing in the European Union - not least promoting social, cultural and religious dialogue - and resolutely combating illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings.
This measure is part of the endeavour to create a genuine, inclusive joint European immigration and asylum system, in line with the measures decided upon at the Seville and Thessaloniki European Councils.
Thank you Minister.
Although I expected some sort of denial, in other words that no such statement was made on the part of the Italian Government, I want to believe that its position is that expressed by the Minister and not that expressed in the article in the Financial Times.
Question No 4 by Malcolm Harbour (H-0435/03):
Subject: Competitiveness in the EU
The European Council Conclusions of 21 March 2003 called for the Competitiveness Council 'to be effectively consulted within the Council's decision-making processes on proposals considered likely to have substantial effects on competitiveness'.
On how many proposals has the Competitiveness Council been consulted, and what action has been taken as a result?
With further reference to the European Council Conclusions, what practical steps has the Council taken to ensure that the Competitiveness Council may 'actively assume its horizontal role of enhancing competitiveness and growth as part of an integrated strategy for competitiveness to be developed by the Commission'?
How are Council formations 'assessing the impact of the work field' in competitiveness?
. (IT) As the honourable Member is quite aware, the Competitiveness Council formation was established following the agreement reached at the Seville European Council of June 2002 on a number of measures, in order to enhance the way the Council works in preparation for enlargement.
With the decision to combine the three previous Council formations - Internal Market, Industry and Research - in a single Council formation responsible for issues relating to the competitiveness of European enterprises, both horizontal issues and individual political measures, with a view to introducing new legislation, a major step has been taken towards a more effective Council structure for the sectors concerned.
As the honourable Member mentioned, at the Brussels meeting in March 2003, the European Council stressed the role of the Competitiveness Council formation, stating that it should be effectively consulted within the Council's decision-making processes on proposals considered likely to have substantial effects on competitiveness, alongside the responsibility of all Council formations to assess the impact of their work field.
The agendas of the sessions of this Council formation held thus far and the results of these sessions adequately reflect the objectives established by the European Council and the Presidencies' desire to create the best possible conditions for achieving them.
Under the previous Danish and Greek Presidencies, the work of the Competitiveness Council was organised in such a way as to allow the fullest possible integration of the three principal sectors within its scope and greater efficiency in addressing related issues.
A group of high-level Council officials known as the 'Competitiveness and Growth Group' was set up in order to ensure proper coordination.
The Italian Presidency certainly intends to further develop and enhance the work of this Council formation on the basis of experience gained thus far.
The Italian Presidency intends to follow up the constructive, fruitful debate held at informal ministerial level in Rome on 11 and 12 July 2003 with appropriate measures, with the aim of paving the way for an integrated competitiveness strategy, a strategy which will have to be debated and adopted in one of the November Council sessions.
As has been pointed out, a number of initiatives and some practical steps have been taken to ensure that the Competitiveness Council can fully play its specific role alongside and in close coordination with the work carried out in the other Council formations, although it is, as yet, too early to come to any definitive conclusions.
However, there is no doubt that the European Parliament has a major role to play in this regard and the Italian Presidency fervently hopes that there will be constant dialogue with Parliament on how best to implement the joint competitiveness programme, not least on the basis of the proposals announced by the Commission within the framework of the integrated strategy.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for the reply, but I am rather disappointed that he was not able to give me more specific details about the number of proposals that they had been consulted on.
The competitiveness, or rather, the declining competitiveness of the European Union is the biggest challenge that we are facing.
His report rather smacks of complacency.
Could he assure us, first of all, that the Competitiveness Council is taking an active role in looking at Commission proposals that fundamentally undermine Europe's competitiveness, particularly in the fields of chemicals policy, for example?
And could he assure us that they are taking the Commission to account for producing proposals that have not been properly subject to the sort of impact assessments that the Commission has pledged to carry out to ensure that the business and competitiveness burden on proposals is properly looked at?
This Parliament is looking to the Council to take the issue of competitiveness seriously.
His reply has not given me a great deal of confidence that it has the sort of priority that we expect.
I can confirm that this is, indeed, one of our priorities.
My reply was not intended to be evasive: the lack of detail in the information I gave was precisely because we have not yet had sufficient time to assess the capacity of the Competitiveness Council to be able to provide all the information the honourable Member has requested.
Nevertheless, I can assure you, Mr Harbour, that we will be paying great attention to the issue of competitiveness, which we regard as being of strategic importance for the development of the European Union.
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, competitiveness naturally has to do with employment as well.
What interests me, therefore, is how far the Council deals with taxation issues.
We all know that taxation has very substantial impacts on national economic development.
Is there an opportunity here, using benchmarking and best practice, to ascertain how taxation can influence competitiveness, not only in Europe but internationally?
In this case, too, I would like confirm the priority that the Italian Presidency gives to competitiveness, and to assure you that the forthcoming European Council will examine this entire issue in depth, including those aspects that the honourable Member has stressed are vital if we are to achieve a general improvement in competitiveness within the European Union.
For this reason, there will also be an in-depth discussion of the issues of taxation and employment.
Question No 5 by Piia-Noora Kauppi (H-0437/03):
Subject: Continuation of the eVote initiative, which represents interactive Internet democracy, during Italy's Presidency
During its Presidency, the Greek Government has successfully promoted interactive Internet democracy by means of the so-called 'eVote' initiative.
By means of eVote, 170 000 EU citizens have expressed their views on the way ahead for the European Union.
A particularly positive aspect of the eVote program is that the Greek Presidency has been incorporating feedback from the public in its daily work.
Opinions and recommendations put forward by members of the public feed in directly to EU-level meetings, negotiations and conclusions.
It would be a pity if the eVote initiative did not continue in one form or another during the Italian Presidency.
Will Italy therefore continue the eVote initiative?
Might the Italian Government perhaps introduce any other programs or measures during its Presidency in order to promote the application of new technology particularly as a means of increasing political participation by citizens?
How will the Italian Government convince the citizens of the EU that the Union is functioning as an emanation of the will of its individual citizens and is doing things which the ordinary people of Europe, above all, regard as important?
The Presidency recognises the importance of dialogue with our citizens on European integration.
This was particularly important during the Greek Presidency given that, inter alia, that period marked the final phase of the work of the Convention, culminating in the presentation of the EU Draft Constitutional Treaty to the Thessaloniki European Council.
The Greek Presidency's e-Vote initiative, and other instruments created by the EU institutions, such as the Futurum website and the Convention website, have made an effective contribution to ensuring that our citizens' views on the future of Europe are heard.
At its meeting in Thessaloniki in June 2003, the European Council called upon the Italian Presidency to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 48 of the Treaty in order to allow the Intergovernmental Conference to be convened in October 2003 to approve the Constitutional Treaty.
During that Intergovernmental Conference, the Presidency will endeavour to keep the public properly informed about the progress of the proceedings.
The Italian Presidency's website will be one of the instruments used to disseminate information about both the IGC and all the other work carried out during these six months.
I would accordingly like to emphasise that the Italian Presidency attaches great importance to the participation of young people in European integration.
As regards the implementation of the Commission White Paper entitled 'A new impetus for European youth', which is designed to follow up the Council Resolution on the framework for European cooperation in the field of youth, the Presidency intends to support the process of awareness-raising to increase the involvement of young people in policy-making and decision-making in areas which affect them.
It is also proposed that suitable strategies should then be drawn up taking these considerations into account, following an analysis of the results of the consultation on the participation of and provision of information to young citizens of the European Union.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office for this reply and I am very satisfied that the eVote initiative is also to continue in one way or another during the Italian presidential term.
One part of this initiative was that the opinions the public expressed via the Internet were directly visible at summit meetings.
Today here in Parliament my fellow Member, Jo Leinen, introduced an initiative such as this, where the Intergovernmental Conference would also be conducted transparently, with the public able to send in messages to our representatives there.
For example, certain sittings of the IGC could be held openly over the Internet and people could comment on issues whilst our heads of state were in attendance there.
What do you think of this idea?
Would this be possible and are you able to take the matter further?
I regard this as an interesting proposal which merits reflection and in-depth consideration.
As Mr Fini and Mr Frattini stated earlier today, there is an enormous commitment to transparency on our part in order to maximise participation in the important process of creating a new Constitution for the European Union not only by Members of this House and all the institutions, but also by Europe's citizens.
Your comment will, therefore, certainly be taken into consideration, Mrs Kauppi.
I shall ensure that we ascertain how this proposal might be adopted.
Question No 6 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0443/03):
Subject: Detainees in Iraq
In a recent press release Amnesty International expresses serious concerns regarding the conditions under which hundreds of Iraqis are being detained (in the Abu Ghraib prison and in specially adapted detention areas in Baghdad airport). These detainees have been arrested by the occupying forces in Iraq.
In particular, the humanitarian organisation's charges relate to the absence of legal assistance for detainees, the impossibility of communication with their families and the lack of proper access to drinking water and hygiene facilities.
At the same time, the organisation states that there are well-founded suspicions that a considerable number of those being held suffered cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment immediately after and during their arrests.
What does the Council consider to be the legal status and responsibilities of the occupying forces in Iraq, and how can they guarantee the fundamental rights of the inhabitants of the country's occupied areas?
The Council, which never makes statements on the basis of press stories, has not received any official information about the events referred to by the honourable Member in his question.
In particular, the Council has not discussed the situation of prisoners in Iraq, although the issue of human rights in Iraq continues to be of enormous concern.
The Council is closely following all aspects of the situation, including, of course, the issue of human rights.
The responsible authorities and specific obligations under applicable international law of the United States and the United Kingdom as occupying powers are the subject of Resolution 1483(2003) of the United Nations Security Council.
This resolution also calls upon all concerned to comply fully with their obligations under international law, in particular the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1907 Hague Regulations.
Mr President, as you can see, the question by my honourable friend, Mr Papayannakis, starts with a press release by Amnesty International.
There is a legal problem with the detainees, but there is also a problem with their fundamental rights, their inability to communicate with their families, with drinking water, sanitation and so on.
One of the occupying forces, the United Kingdom, is a Member State of the European Union.
Would the Council be prepared to put Mr Papayannakis's questions to the government of the United Kingdom so that it can give a reply?
I think that the whole of Europe is open to criticism as the result of this situation.
I would like to check the accuracy of the comments you have just made, since, as I have already said, we have not, in actual fact, received any official information or communications about this.
We will therefore check to establish exactly what the situation is and we will then proceed on that basis.
Question No 7 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0446/03):
Subject: Euro-Mediterranean dialogue and the status of women
The 19-20 June 2003 Thessaloniki European Council Presidency conclusions include the following: Paragraph 66 (Relations with the Arab world): 'The European Union is convinced that it must strengthen its partnership with the Arab world. It intends to promote a closer political dialogue, pluralism and democratic reform?'
Paragraph 68: '?the civil society of the countries of the region, including women, is expected to play an important role in promoting democratic values, social awareness, education and development.'
However, the personal status which women in some eastern and southern Mediterranean countries still have constitutes nothing less than an infringement of the human rights of the individual.
Modernising such societies involves including women in democratisation processes.
The leaders of countries who try to modernise in technological and economic terms alone whilst leaving the structures of obsolete, patriarchal societies untouched will fail.
Nowadays, women are the most important factor in the modernisation process, since when women bring themselves up to date, society as a whole follows suit.
What form, therefore, is the Italian Presidency's action going to take as it endeavours to promote women in the Mediterranean area?
The Barcelona Declaration of November 1995 recognised the vital role of women in development and the need for them to play an active part in economic and social life and in job creation.
Similarly, the MEDA II Regulation referred to the need to recognise and strengthen the economic and social role of women and to the importance of education and of the creation of jobs for women.
One innovative feature of the Barcelona Process is the regional cooperation aspect, with regional programmes open to everyone.
The promotion of opportunities for women in this context was highlighted by the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs held in Brussels in November 2001, and also by the ministerial meetings in Valencia and Crete, which took place in April 2002 and May 2003 respectively, which welcomed the efforts made in the Euro-Mediterranean context to promote equal opportunities for men and women.
This has led to the creation of the Euromed regional programme on the role of women in economic life, scheduled for 2004, with a budget of EUR 5 million, which is intended to promote opportunities for women by encouraging capacity building and information provision.
The programme seeks to have action plans drawn up at national level, focussing on access and participation for women in the job market, supporting legislative reforms and drawing up policies that foster active training and the active development of the job market.
It also encourages the promotion of women in the business world by creating networks for women active in the liberal professions and in business, and by facilitating access for women to financial instruments.
During the Italian Presidency, we will see the completion of the process of defining priority cooperation sectors in which intervention is envisaged, and, during the second half of 2003, the Commission's EuropeAid Cooperation Office will publish a call for proposals for this specific programme.
Mr President?in-Office of the Council, you have not really been very explicit, because all you are telling me is that proposals will be presented during the second half of 2003, but without being specific about them.
I thank you very much for your reply anyway and I would like to know whether or not you believe that women's issues should be progressively introduced into political dialogue.
This is certainly a highly important subject and we are aware of the need to make progress in this direction.
There is also scope for greater emphasis on women's issues in the political dialogue, and such emphasis is justified.
We will therefore be sure to take your comments fully into consideration, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, and we will also commit ourselves to seeking to achieve the best possible results.
As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 8 to 32 will be replied to in writing
Mr President, we have before us the motion for a resolution adopted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the Commission communication on water management in developing countries and priorities for EU development cooperation, and on the establishment of an EU water fund, which the plenary is to vote on at noon tomorrow.
In practice we are considering two related motions.
I would firstly like to recall the situation in which a substantial minority of our fellow humans on this planet find themselves as regards access to water.
In all, 1.7 billion people do not have access to drinking water.
Three billion people have no access to sanitation.
The number of people who die each day from diseases linked to a lack of drinking water and of sanitation is put at 30 000.
Water is an essential natural resource for life, health, food and general well-being.
The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has enshrined access to water as a fundamental human right.
The 145 countries that have ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have an obligation to ensure that everyone has access to water, equitably and without discrimination.
The issue that is therefore becoming ever more pressing is this: what sort of cooperation policy is needed to help poor countries to meet the vital challenge of making drinking water available to everyone?
Back in 1991, at the end of the World Water Decade, an international commitment was declared to provide safe drinking water for all by 2000.
Two years after that deadline, it had to be recognised at Johannesburg in 2002 that this commitment was a long way from having been met, despite the efforts of the World Bank in particular.
The situation could even be said to have deteriorated somewhat.
A new, scaled-down objective was agreed at Johannesburg: to halve the number of people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation by 2015.
The European Union wishes to play an active part in achieving this objective and the Commission has set out its priorities in the communication before us.
In the motion for a resolution to be voted upon at noon tomorrow, the Committee on Development and Cooperation suggests that the following priorities should be adopted, aware as it is that it would scarcely be credible to continue along the path mapped out by the World Bank in 1993 in its report on Water Resources Management.
It has in fact become apparent that the privatisation of water services in accordance with the 'full cost recovery' principle has generally led to an increase in charges, preventing the poorest communities in the poorest countries from having access to drinking water.
This means that the solution identified in no way solves the problem, and if anything exacerbates it.
We therefore think it is essential for water distribution to be regarded as a public service.
The public-private partnership system may be one means of improving access to water, but it should not be viewed as a panacea.
We also believe that a pricing system should be adopted which allows everyone access to the water required to cover essential needs and ensures efficient use of water by giving users responsibility.
As regards management, the countries concerned have both the right and the duty to adopt a policy that clearly involves local populations in management.
Given that the Committee on Development and Cooperation believes that significant financial resources need to be devoted to achieving the necessary investment in the countries concerned, it welcomes the establishment of a European Water Fund.
Nevertheless, it considers that the main aim of this fund should be to support the beneficiary countries' water policy, which should be based on democratic management and fair distribution.
We therefore propose that the management of the fund should be based on an EU-ACP partnership.
Furthermore, the Committee on Development and Cooperation is of the view that the success of the fund depends on participation by its beneficiaries, who must be involved in the processes of design, implementation, monitoring and assessment, as well as in the management and control of the fund, as I have already said.
We also believe that it is important to devise new categories of financial instrument, based on international solidarity. The first thing that comes to mind here is to call for the ACP countries' debt to be cancelled.
The money thus released would allow these countries to fund basic water supply and purification infrastructures.
We would also like the Commission to study - and please note that I am saying 'study', we are not talking about a proposal as such - the scope for introducing a tax on bottled mineral water in the EU countries and in the relevant ACP countries, a very low tax, about half a euro cent, which would make an important contribution to the fund.
Lastly, I would like to offer the various political groups my views about the amendments that have been tabled.
Amendment No 1, tabled by the Socialist Group, complements the existing proposals very well, even if the report was adopted unanimously in committee.
As regards Amendment No 2, which relates to recital L, I would prefer it if the Socialist Group would eliminate certain terms that weaken the text.
I also find Amendment No 11, tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, perfectly acceptable.
Furthermore, I myself tabled Amendment No 5 on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and this amendment seems very important to me on the eve of the CancÃºn Summit: in line with what I have just said, my group invites the Commission to withdraw the demand, made in the context of the GATS Agreement, that water distribution and purification services should be liberalised.
We regard this demand as running counter to the essential objective of providing access to water for all in poor countries.
If it is adopted, this amendment will strengthen the European Parliament's political message.
I therefore urge you to support it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that my report reflects the balance between the various viewpoints in this House, although the key point is of course the fact that trade is not the solution for development.
I would like to thank everyone, Members and Secretariat staff alike, because there have been a great many amendments and we managed to achieve an agreed position in committee.
We are on the eve of the Fifth World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference, which is to be held in CancÃºn.
In 1999, in the run up to Seattle, Commissioner Lamy, who will be negotiating on behalf of the 15 EU countries at CancÃºn, was given a specific mandate.
However, the issues up for negotiation were different.
I believe that the WTO now has enormous influence and that it has assumed too great a role, so much so that it almost seems to have become the new United Nations.
In fact, this is just one of the reasons.
I think that a new mandate is desirable, bearing in mind, not least, the objectives and commitments entered into by the European Union in different international forums.
Furthermore, the Doha Round, which was called a development round, has not been followed up; in fact, the proportionality relationship between liberalisation and development has not been proven to be correct.
Quite the opposite, in fact: indiscriminate liberalisation and deregulation in developing countries have, in practice, proved to be extremely damaging to development objectives.
Even where liberalisation has led to an increase in GDP, the distribution of wealth within the countries concerned has very often deteriorated.
For this reason the report calls for regional integration between developing countries, and a model of symmetrical market opening, so that the developed countries can dismantle their barriers to trade, including non-tariff barriers, giving the countries of the southern hemisphere the time they need to step up their production, make it more competitive, and expand their markets.
I also think it is important to remember, inter alia, how much we, the countries of the northern hemisphere, have benefited historically from protectionism on the way to our present level of development.
Nevertheless, every now and again we are surprised by the fact that the Commission insists, for example, and despite the resolution adopted by this House on 3 July 2003, on embarking on negotiations on the Singapore Issues. I do not have time to list all those issues, but they include public procurement.
I do not think it is appropriate to open negotiations on these issues.
The reasons for this relate, on the one hand, to the competences and power of the WTO, and on the other hand to the problem that I have already mentioned, namely the developing countries' lack of negotiating capacity.
Indeed, these same countries stress in their reports that they are not in a position to support further negotiations.
I believe, in fact, that it is vital to tackle other issues and to give the special and differential treatment clause some real substance, by implementing a global system of guaranteed prices to support producers of commodities such as coffee and cotton.
The issues that need to be dealt with in terms of development are achieving and promoting fair trade - something that is, in fact, being pioneered in civil society - and the provision of assistance to countries to enable them to diversify their production without creating enclaves in export sectors, by actually promoting the integration of those sectors with the rest of the economy.
It is my belief that development objectives should, above all, be related to the well-being of the population.
I therefore consider that the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement, which states that the agreement may and should be interpreted so as to preserve the right of the Member States to protect public health, should be implemented without delay and without resorting to agreements stipulating procedures that are so restrictive and bureaucratic as to be unworkable.
This aspect was covered thoroughly in Mr Lannoye's report, and in my own report, I, too, have, for example, stressed that it is important for essential goods such as water not to be left to market forces alone and that the European Union should pursue a policy of public funding not only for water distribution, but also to bring about the democratisation of water management as regards the management of springs, rivers and basins.
Any discussion of development should include the issue of debt, which was not, in fact, covered in the Commission document, although I concede that it was not strictly relevant.
Highly indebted countries have debt-servicing obligations that can siphon off as much as a quarter of the value of their exports.
I believe that the EU should commit itself to cancelling developing countries' debt, whilst providing for mechanisms for monitoring how capital sums resulting from debt cancellation are invested, so as to ensure that the benefits are genuinely felt by the population at large.
Another issue is the enactment of a code of conduct comprising ethical, social and environmental clauses intended for European undertakings that make direct investments.
With regard to the negotiations to be held in CancÃºn, it must be pointed out that we need a democratic, transparent system within the WTO and sufficient negotiating capacity for all countries, which do not exist at present.
These conditions are therefore virtually indispensable if we are to establish a level playing field.
I believe that we have a long road ahead of us.
We must act so as to correct the enormous disparities that exist, which means that we need not unrestrained trade but, rather, trade designed to meet the social and economic needs of all the people on this earth.
.
Mr President, I cannot help but say that one of the problems in this world is that there is too little jungle left.
On the subject of water, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to Combat Desertification is currently taking place in Havana and the Commission is represented there.
The big problem is that the desert is expanding and tropical forests are in bad shape, threatened by greed and crime.
We are trying to do something about that.
This has an influence on the balance of water.
Watershed management is directly influenced, micro- and macroclimates are changing and all this relates to the first of the two reports we are discussing tonight.
Perhaps in some years from now the law of the jungle will sound more like a reference to a paradise lost, because the jungle is a symbol of unspoilt nature.
But I am sure this is not what Mrs Morgantini wanted to discuss.
I am faced now with the problem of having to address two different subjects at the same time.
I will start with Mrs Morgantini's motion for a resolution.
It calls on the Commission to reduce its pressure on developing countries to indiscriminately liberalise and deregulate their markets.
There is no such pressure.
The Commission is collaborating with developing countries to help put in place a sound regulatory framework for the provision of basic services.
I want to draw the attention of Parliament, and especially members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to the communication on the reform of state-owned enterprises that we have pursued in the Commission.
This is also extremely relevant to Mr Lannoye's report.
We are issuing this communication in order to have firmer ground in our battle against, amongst others, the World Bank and the IMF, concerning privatisation.
If we talk about water and the conditionality of privatising the management of water resources, my reaction has been that for a country like Burkina Faso the national responsibility of the government there to manage water carefully and in the interests of its citizens is as important - or more important - a national priority for that country as the missile defence shield is for the government in Washington.
That is the approach.
This Commission has been able to make sure that Burkina Faso was not forced to privatise its national water company as a condition for the big Ziga dam project providing water for the capital.
A project where the World Bank is one of a handful of big donors and partners, and where this was initially a condition from the Bank, it has been implemented without that condition being kept, or insisted upon by the Bank, because others - i.e. the Commission - stood behind the government of Burkina Faso in resisting this condition.
You will see in this communication a much more nuanced approach to this whole issue.
However, when I hear Mrs Morgantini arguing that, as far as water is concerned we should move away from the commercial way of thinking - I say yes and no!
What does 'commercial' mean?
A private, commercial, short-term, profit-maximising philosophy is clearly detrimental to handling water in developing countries.
But if by 'commercial' you mean that ends have to meet, that is, it has to have economic sustainability, then there is no way whatsoever of escaping that commitment.
This is what makes things so extremely difficult.
Kinshasa now has more than seven million inhabitants, of which not many more than one million have access to sanitation or safe sewage treatment.
Therefore, most of the population, not only in the big slums in the exploding mega-cities of the south, but also in the emerging middle class, does not have even near-normal sanitation.
They get fresh water and pay for it by the litre, but it is almost impossible to organise the next phase in the cycle economically.
It is too long-term and too expensive.
The real picture is not that some water companies from the north are out for quick profits in the south.
There are no quick profits.
Therefore, the divisive image of the past round of the international water debate, especially among NGOs in Europe, has been wrong - it is easy to warn against the risk of undue profiteering from more donor-funded activity in the water sector - but this is not the real problem.
The real problem is to attract long-term, humble, down-to-earth funding for the necessary investments.
We are nowhere near achieving that.
It is very similar to the problem of the health sector.
Annual public health sector spending per capita in Sub-Saharan Africa is somewhere between one and six US dollars.
You do not get very far with that kind of money.
It is exactly the same proportion when we look at water and sanitation.
In many ways it is easier to do what needs to be done in the rural villages.
We know what to do there.
It is not that difficult and our technology is quite overwhelming.
With deep-bore holes or pipes for transportation, our ability as a donor is quite fantastic.
However, I see a big problem in provincial towns and the big mega-cities of the south.
That is where cholera and other problems sneak in as a collateral problem because of bad sanitation.
Deciding on how to organise this takes much more than repeatedly mobilising well-established divisive images of private or public money.
It is also too easy to take a shortcut by cancelling all these countries' debts.
Please be realistic.
We are doing everything we can on that front.
Only the genuine addition of real money from the pockets of taxpayers in the north will make a difference.
That is the real battle.
We won some rounds in that battle over the European contribution at the Monterrey Conference.
That is where we are looking for more money for water and sanitation.
This is why we urge Member States to accept our proposal to accelerate spending and to create a water facility to ensure that the money, which is still conditional for the 9th EDF - the EUR 1 billion that depends on performance - could be accepted and mobilised to accelerate our action on the water issue.
On trade, we are forced to be optimistic and constructive and to push for Europe to stay on a line of progressive constructivity from the WTO meeting in CancÃºn and the Doha development round.
I am still somewhat optimistic.
It has to succeed.
In Mrs Morgantini's report there should be a stronger reference to the work immediately in front of us and the challenge and the potential for our partners - especially our ACP partners - to do what is immediately possible by opening up more regional markets between them.
Who will invest in producing paint or soap in Uganda if such products cannot be exported to neighbouring countries?
We tried to find out what happened regarding mosquito nets.
Why were no mosquito nets being produced in Africa?
The answer was that, as there were 17% tariff barriers, they were imported from Hong Kong.
Regional liberalisation is the name of the game and this is what we have on the table in the Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations.
Parliament should give more of a helping hand in this.
We are taking the safe route.
Whatever happens in the WTO, the Cotonou route is there and it would be highly beneficial for our ACP partners to engage strongly in it.
I have cut across the themes.
I look forward to listening to the next contributions and, as always, to engaging in dialogue with this Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just experienced the hottest and driest summer since records began and have found out for ourselves just how important water is, both for people and nature.
We pampered Europeans are desperate for rain to replenish our rivers and reservoirs.
Experts have calculated that it will take at least fourteen days of rain to restore our rivers and reservoirs to their normal levels.
Fortunately, we still have enough clean water when we turn on the taps.
The water supply in the EU is obviously secure, and, what is more, it is affordable for everyone.
After this hot summer, we Europeans have some idea of what it means when we are told that three billion people around the world - i.e. more than one third of the global population - have no access to clean drinking water or sanitation.
Admittedly, in the UN Millennium Declaration, 189 governments pledged to halve this figure by 2015, but at present, there is no prospect of this ambitious goal ever being achieved.
Since 1990, water withdrawal has increased tenfold around the world.
The largest consumer of water is agriculture, followed by industry, and only then by private households.
The USA uses most water, consuming around 296 litres per person per day.
Households in Germany and many other European countries, on the other hand, use only half this amount.
In the Middle East and to some extent in Asia, but also in parts of Mexico and Africa, large sections of the population have less than 2.5 litres of water per person per day to meet their needs, and many people in the water-poor regions have even less than that.
Almost 40% of the global population live in river catchments extending across more than two countries.
Countries located upstream often exploit their natural advantages over the countries downstream.
Today, we still have wars over oil; in the not too distant future, wars could break out over water as well.
The situation in the Middle East is explosive.
Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians find it difficult to share the River Jordan.
Turkey, Syria and Iraq, which lie on the Euphrates and Tigris, are trying to control the water from these two rivers.
Conflict over freshwater seems inevitable, and so UNESCO has designated 2003 the International Year of Freshwater.
The European Commission and the European Parliament are aware of the scarcity of water resources and the associated problems, which primarily include a fair system of water management.
This is why the important issue of fair water management was put on the agenda.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is working to ensure that water management is not exclusively a monopoly, either of the state or of major corporations operating on a global basis.
A healthy mix of public and private sector involvement should ensure that the populations in those areas of the world that have water problems can be supplied with fresh water at affordable prices.
We must not get to the stage where if you are rich, you have access to water, but if you are poor, you have no fresh water.
In order to promote this public-private water supply mix, the Group of the European People's Party has tabled various amendments to the annual report on the Commission communication on water management in developing countries, and I would ask all Members of this House to support them.
Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues Mr Corrie and Mr Wijkman for their excellent cooperation and also convey my gratitude to our assistants and staff.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very good report, parts of which are already finalised as no amendments have been tabled.
Although this has been a rather low-key debate today, this report has been the subject of very intensive discussions among Members of this House in recent days and, indeed, in recent weeks, not only in the meeting rooms.
It is obvious, after all, that a Commission communication on water management in developing countries will always trigger very heated and intensive debate.
The previous speaker spoke in great depth about the sensitivity of water as an issue in every part of the world.
The WTO Ministerial Conference, which is due to start within a matter of days in CancÃºn, naturally makes this debate even more topical; key issues in this context are, for example, the Commission's demands for the liberalisation of public services - which of course includes water management - and the situation with regard to the developing countries' freedom to decide for themselves in future how they supply these public services.
When we talk about water management in developing countries, it is obvious to me that the Commission, and the European Union, should be promoting sustainable water management.
One reason why I think Mr Lannoye's report is so good is that he focuses very directly, and also very critically, on the problems and obstacles standing in the way of sustainable water management.
He mentions intensive farming, which is predominantly export-driven, structural adjustment programmes imposed on countries in the past, which have weakened their public services, and he mentions the setting of wrong priorities in project funding.
I think that this is a very good signal to send out, and there are also very positive approaches in the Commission's current policies which aim to avoid these pitfalls in future.
As my group's shadow rapporteur, I am rather unhappy that we have not managed to achieve a unified position on Mr Lannoye's Amendment No 5, which takes a very critical line on the GATS requirements, which are obviously in place, and the Commission's calls for liberalisation.
However, let me reassure the rapporteur right away that I am working hard to ensure that as many of my colleagues as possible support him in making this demand.
He mentioned that he proposes to make a slight alteration to one amendment by Mr van den Berg.
I would ask Mr van den Berg to tell us about this himself.
I cannot do that here.
I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur once again for his good work.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to extend a warm thanks to Mrs Morgantini and Mr Lannoye for their interesting reports, but I would like to make some observations.
I should even like to shift the focus in some cases.
For example, Liberals believe that fair trade, in particular, is one of the best ways of fighting poverty.
Needless to say, this does not mean that we must impose our diktat on the developing countries.
The WTO forums offer the opportunity, in joint consultation, of reaching agreements that are fair for all partners.
We therefore expect CancÃºn to create better world trade conditions.
Something that the developed countries certainly have to offer is knowledge.
International companies have extensive know-how, which they can pass on to their partners in the developing countries.
As my party has already highlighted in an amendment, contributing this know-how results in increased economic activity, which promotes a considerable diversification of products.
It is also to be welcomed that many businesses commit to improving education and health infrastructures for the local population.
This is with good reason.
It is also in their interest to have a healthy and educated labour force, but this must be stimulated.
I should specifically like to call for greater involvement of industry in development cooperation, provided this is done according to the normal criteria - in other words, wages must be reasonable and child labour must be banned.
I also think that too little attention is being paid to the trade options at regional level.
There are quite a few sticking points there too. Water management is a perfect example of this.
Worldwide, there are some 260 reservoirs that are shared by various countries.
Over the past 50 years, some 1 800 conflicts, armed or not, as the case may be, have broken out over these.
Mutual consultation and sound agreements could have prevented these.
Access to drinking water and proper sanitary provisions are fundamental rights of the population.
That goes without saying.
My group calls for sound cooperation between local and national governments and the private sector, and this is where the European Union must take the lead and have a highly stimulating effect.
My group does object to the rapporteur pointing an accusatory finger at the World Bank and the IMF.
We emphasise that the grant of aid to developing countries must be commensurate with the needs of the country in question, and have tabled amendments to this effect.
Liberals believe that the condition for partnership must also apply to the water fund that Mr Prodi proposed.
We deem participation of the countries concerned highly important.
With regard to the previously mentioned water fund, I should like to repeat that the EP's lack of involvement in this proposal was a missed opportunity.
We therefore demand full involvement in its implementation.
After all, this is the best guarantee for democratic legitimacy.
Mr President, in all the EU's key documents, combating poverty is held up as the primary goal of development policy.
It is undisputed that the EU spends substantial sums of money on development assistance and makes every effort to conclude a variety of partnership and cooperation agreements in the different regions of the world, for both sides' benefit.
What is also undisputed is that despite all these efforts, poverty in the world has increased, especially during the last decade, and there appears to be no imminent prospect of any change in this trend.
This is especially worrying in light of the fact that this rising poverty is one of the sources of terrorism.
Parliament has before it a number of reports covering extremely important aspects of development policy.
What is at issue is no more and no less than the use of increasingly scarce global resources.
Today, wars are still being fought over oil, as in the Gulf, but violent conflicts are already emerging on the horizon over water.
The USA and other industrial powers declare those areas of the developing world where there is oil and gas and other strategically important resources to be part of their sphere of interest, which apparently even gives them the right to wage war, but it is primarily among the developing countries that water is a problem - either because the resources are inadequate or because access to water is denied.
There is still time to prevent the impending catastrophe with a careful strategy and targeted expenditure.
Mr Lannoye's report identifies possible constructive approaches which deserve to be given greater attention.
The situation in the health sector is no less precarious.
Already, in some countries of the EU, the motto seems to be that if you are poor, you die earlier, because the reforms aim to establish a two-tier system, but the situation in the developing countries is far more acute.
Millions of people in Africa are dying every year of diseases capable of being treated with drugs that have existed for years in the industrialised countries.
The newly-negotiated WTO compromise on the import of cheap generic drugs comes too late, for a start, and, secondly, it is so hedged about with formalities that it has doubtful prospects of success.
Mrs Morgantini's report highlights problems concerning this aspect of trade in particular.
The rapporteur and, indeed, the entire Committee on Development and Cooperation are seeking to bring their experience and authority to bear in order to combat growing poverty with all its manifestations and impacts.
We expect the same and more from the Council and the Commission.
The twenty-first century has only just begun, yet the signs point to storms ahead rather than peaceful co-existence based on solidarity.
Development policy must be redefined with greater depth and scope, and a new approach is also needed if humankind is to have any chance of life and survival on earth.
Mr President, we have just heard Mr Lannoye and Mrs Morgantini present their excellent reports, which we totally support.
This also gives us an opportunity to adopt the reports before the WTO Ministerial Conference opens in CancÃºn, and I hope that Commissioner Lamy, who will be representing the EU next week, will oblige us by taking the reports into account as part of his negotiating mandate, especially as regards the key issue of preventing water privatisation.
I am sure my friend Mr Lannoye will not hold it against me if I say I attach particular importance to Mrs Morgantini's report.
The Commission wants to help the developing countries to take advantage of trade.
The question is, will the WTO's rules allow them to do that?
I am not sure, given the disagreements that currently divide the developing countries and the western countries over the Singapore Issues, for example, that the European Union is best placed to support the position of the countries of the South, as it has its own interests to defend, the most striking examples being agriculture and fisheries.
Helping the developing countries to take advantage of trade first and foremost means changing the rules governing trade to make them more favourable to developing countries.
The countries of the South were first encouraged to export commodities with low added value, only to have restrictions imposed on them, and they are now reeling from the impact of the fall in commodity prices and the problems in accessing markets in the countries of the North.
As for the WTO, it does not so much regulate markets as liberalise trade.
For example, the common market organisations for coffee and cotton and the price stabilisation systems for raw materials have at present simply disappeared.
What is more, does helping countries really mean helping their populations?
Do the hypothetical benefits of trade really go to the poorest people, or do they get no further than the top of the ladder in these countries?
Promoting fair trade is still the only viable long-term strategy.
On the one hand, we have to pay the producers in the countries of the South a fair price for their commodities; on the other hand, there is an urgent need to open up our markets to imports from developing countries and to abandon subsidies to our farmers.
To that extent, the CancÃºn conference gives some room for optimism.
I hope they will not be disappointed.
It is only by changing and diversifying their production that the developing countries will really be able to establish their independence and play a key role in world trade.
The Commission's efforts should be directed towards achieving that objective, and this is the issue that the CancÃºn conference should focus its work on.
Helping developing countries to develop their trade above all means helping the populations of those countries to try to live a better life.
Can trade be a means of ensuring a better life?
I do not doubt that it can, but it is certainly not the only way.
Mr President, nobody can dispute the need to create a fair global trading system, but we should not delude ourselves in thinking that fully-liberalised trade will in itself bring about fairness.
In terms of agricultural policy, for example, abolishing all market support and protection would remove about two-thirds of EU farmers from the land.
This is in nobody's interests in either rural or urban areas.
The current development round at the WTO is supposed to give special attention to the needs of developing countries and their desire to better integrate themselves into the global trading system.
This is positive and should, in my view, be fully supported.
Sixty per cent of the world's population lives in rural areas and the vast majority are in developing countries.
It is worth noting, at the same time, that trade in agricultural products represented less than 6% of total global trade in 2000.
Economic growth, in the initial stages, depends more on developing countries' internal markets than access to markets elsewhere.
The experience of agricultural trade liberalisation in Mexico should serve as a warning against the promotion of fully open markets as a solution for the needs of developing countries.
Two decades of this policy in the North American Free Trade Area have led to an increase in rural poverty, malnutrition and emigration.
It has also caused increased workloads in agriculture, particularly for women, and an increase in consumer prices.
Increased profit and market control by multinationals has been at the expense of small family farms.
If we add to this lost national revenues and damage to the environment and to biodiversity we see that Mexico's experience of seeking to develop its agricultural sector through trade liberalisation has had devastating consequences.
In terms of creating a fair trading system, the EU has made a significant contribution with its everything-but-arms initiative.
We have committed ourselves to eliminating the customs duties applied to the exports of the world's 48 poorest countries.
I should certainly hope that the Commission will be forcefully urging other rich countries to follow this lead.
