The example of Georgia proves how important a role is played by regular dialogue between the authorities and civil society, or with the enemy.
The fundamental problem is creating political stability in a region bogged down by three conflicts.
In the meantime, we need to confront a factor that signifies permanent insecurity, namely the subversive endeavours of Russian superpower policy.
I am convinced that the EU must act more resolutely against Russia in this matter.
The problem of Nagorno-Karabakh is particularly worrying.
The Minsk Group is carrying out consistent work, but despite this we have not moved from our standstill.
The negotiation process must be maintained, and so I consider both fundamental principles to be important: the equal treatment of regional integrity and the right of self-determination.
However, the first step is inevitably the liberation of the occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, the return of the refugees and the stabilisation of the region.
Only in this way can the future status of Nagorno-Karabakh be decided upon.
Thank you for your attention.
Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Ms Polfer for her excellent work and excellent cooperation.
The European Parliament sends out loud and clear messages with this report: the message that the EU should get strongly involved in the South Caucasus, the message that the EU can play a decisive role in the region and the message that the EU should increase financial and technical assistance to help Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan to reform their administration and to develop their democratic institutions, to encourage civil society to interact and to strengthen these nations' commitments to the European values of respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.
These are the core principles of the EU but, as I have said again and again in this House, we have to accept that the improvements in those areas are a step-by-step process, which will take time.
My conclusion in that situation is that all three countries are moving in the right direction, slowly and sometimes with setbacks, but I hold on to the fact that the situation is better than it was a couple of years ago.
On the Georgian elections, I have nothing to add to what my colleagues have already said.
The situation is, as I have just said, a step forward, but a lot remains to be done.
Concerning the answer to frozen conflicts, everybody agrees that finding a peaceful solution is the key to achieving political stability.
Especially with regard to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, I am one of those who support a solution based on the principles of territorial integrity and the right of self-determination.
I am also one of those who believe that new security arrangements are needed to build trust between the different sides and put an end to the slow but steady and warring process of the demilitarisation of the region.
As I said before, more intensive engagement is needed from the EU and the international community.
A 'no war, no peace' situation is a source of instability and, most of all, the EU can and should transfer its experience and achievements in peace-building, economic prosperity and democracy in the region.
(FI) Madam President, first of all I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Polfer, for an excellent report, which represents a thorough survey of the situation in South Caucasus and the opportunities afforded by the European Neighbourhood Policy in the region.
Extending the European Neighbourhood Policy to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia is an important step forward in the Union's engagement with the region.
Just the name of the report, 'from promises to actions', however, is enough to encourage the Union to be more actively involved in this region.
At the same time, the ENP will be an opportunity for the countries of South Caucasus for closer cooperation with the Union.
The region's many challenges, however, call for more effective action on the part of the Union and, furthermore, require the countries of South Caucasus to show more responsibility and commitment to this partnership.
One of the main aims is a peaceful resolution of the many local conflicts.
That would bring stability to the region and improve its chances of developing independently.
I want to stress the importance of supporting civil society and developing people-to-people contacts in building democracy and the rule of law.
For example, EU-funded cross-border projects are tools for resuming dialogue and increasing confidence between the parties, but that requires the relevant countries to agree not to hamper the programmes and projects designed to bring this about.
Furthermore, closer relations will only really be achieved by reducing the restrictions on border traffic, with student and pupil exchange programmes, and by facilitating the movement of researchers, investigators, artists, entrepreneurs and journalists.
Developing the visa regime between the countries of South Caucasus and the EU would also enhance trade and economic cooperation, as the Committee on International Trade has stated.
- (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, in a situation where, in the South Caucasus, the interests of several influential geopolitical participants are in competition, it is important to distinguish their true influence.
The report has to a great extent avoided acknowledging Russia's real role in this region.
Our experience in the Baltic States has shown us that the cause of many problems is Russia's neo-imperialist foreign policy and its wish to regain influence in the territories it has lost.
I cannot agree with the view expressed in the report that membership of NATO could foster a renewal of conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
We should note that more than 70% of Georgia's inhabitants in fact voted for NATO membership, but in truth Russia has complicated the situation by encouraging changes in the ethnic make-up and altering the make-up of citizens.
We must not ignore the people's wish to get closer to Western democracy.
Proof of Georgia's democratic progress is also provided by the presidential elections of 5 January which, by and large, were held in accordance with international standards.
It is possible that we have been too critical of Azerbaijan, since a desire to respect human rights has been displayed - 119 prisoners were released in December's presidential decree, including journalists.
The European Union must be more actively involved in the resolution of protracted conflicts, which is a precondition for stability and development.
The first step could be to encourage an exchange of Russian military forces for international peace-keepers.
We must speak to Russia in clear language.
Using the language of fables is not the way to move from promises to action.
Thank you.
(CS) Madam President, to start with I would like to say many thanks to the Commissioner for her reply to my question, which concerned the criminal liability of persons in Georgia.
It is a very sensitive issue, which was also dealt with in the pre-election discussions in Georgia.
I would like to mention that the previous speaker stated that Russia has imperialistic intentions.
Yes, that is possible.
However, I have to say that the Caucasus is neither the Alps nor the Pyrenees.
The Caucasus is just the Caucasus, and for us it is necessary to understand it in its geographical context.
I had prepared a longer speech, but I will summarise my mission as an electoral observer in Georgia in seven points.
Firstly, just like the large majority of the people in the Caucasus region, we in Western, Central and Eastern Europe also want to see stability in this region.
It is possible that this stability will be achieved with the support of the United States or the European Union.
Secondly, it is our duty as Members of the European Parliament to question the use of the financial resources that the European Union provided for relevant programmes.
They should not be used for the election of President Saakashvili.
Thirdly, it is charming that the old-new President is suggesting a dialogue with Russia; however, a rule applies that, just like at an official ball, if you offer an arm to a lady it does not mean that you will be dancing the way she wishes.
What I want to say is: if President Saakashvili is suggesting dialogue with Russia, it is necessary for the other party to understand that this is a genuine invitation to dance.
Fourthly, all countries are interested in the Caucasus, including the United States and the countries of the European Union.
Unfortunately, the European Union barely registers in the Caucasus.
Commissioner, I have to admit that the European Union's concern for this region is not obvious, and that includes its concern for the poverty there.
In this sense our common European policy will have to be better formulated; it should not just be words, but also actions and finances.
Madam President, I cannot support a Black Sea policy.
It will consume vast amounts of money.
My country is the EU's second biggest paymaster, and our Government has just decided to reduce our EU rebate by a UKP 1 billion per annum.
Initially, one of the thrusts of this policy will be to facilitate the supply of gas and oil to the West.
Two years ago we saw Russia cut the supply of gas to Ukraine at Christmas time.
They were just flexing their muscles, and once Russia has an even bigger share of Western energy supplies, who is to say they will not do this again - to all of us?
Europe must become more self-sufficient in energy - not by useless wind power, nor by biofuels.
When there is a world shortage of grain, it is madness to replace a fuel shortage with a food shortage.
My Government has, almost too late in the day, announced a programme to build a new generation of nuclear power stations, hopefully catching up with France - that is, 70% of electricity by nuclear.
We should and must do more and use the access power to produce hydrogen and develop the technology to use that in place of oil.
If the EU really wants to make a difference, it should fund the building of nuclear power stations across the continent, to reduce our dependence on unstable regimes and overlong delivery lines.
Then, and only then, would we have the money available to help the poorer regions around the Black Sea.
Pumping money in now will only further delay the promised funding of the 10 new eastern EU members - a promise yet to be kept.
Promises - in Britain we were promised a referendum on the European Constitution, Lisbon Treaty, call it what you will.
In this Chamber, I now demand that the EU hold a referendum on the Treaty in all Member States, including the UK.
Ask the people.
- (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation is quite a mature regional body involved in constant intensive and extensive cooperation.
Furthermore, it constitutes a forum for contact between Europe and Asia.
It is a forum for creative expression, different cultures, different ethnic identities and religions.
The BSEC is called upon to play an important role in securing peace, stability and prosperity in regions facing considerable challenges, such as the Balkans and the Caucasus, as well as in the creation of a Eurasian economic area.
The geostrategic and economic importance of the rapidly developing Black Sea region is undeniable.
Of particular importance is the development of marine links, road transport and corridors as well as cooperation in the energy sphere, together with the promotion of sustainable development.
Relations between the EU and the Black Sea region have taken on a new dynamic thanks to the Commission's communication on cooperation with the Black Sea region.
This communication bears the stamp of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
I think, nevertheless, that a broad, cohesive, strategic approach to the area is required.
I also support the institutionalisation of interparliamentary cooperation between the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the BSEC.
Finally, allow me to highlight the particularly constructive part being played by my country, Greece, with its dual identity as a Member State of the EU and of the BSEC, in strengthening cooperation both within the BSEC and at cross-regional level within the EU.
I would like to end by congratulating the two rapporteurs, particularly Mrs Anastase, as well as the Commissioner for her productive contribution in revealing the common priorities of these two structures.
Commissioner, I still think that we should be even more courageous and should establish institutionalised cross-regional cooperation between the EU and the Black Sea region.
(SV) Madam President, I want to say a big word of thanks to the rapporteur, Lydie Polfer, for a quite excellent report.
It is time to stop making empty promises and instead act to ensure better integration of the South Caucasus with the European Union.
As Parliament's rapporteur on the visa code, I would like to direct attention to freedom of movement and strongly urge both the Commission and the Member States to work to make this possible.
For the EU's neighbour countries and countries in the Caucasus to build up democratic societies subject to the rule of law and functioning market economies, their citizens must be able to adapt smoothly to the EU in order to benefit from our experience in the field.
That is not the case at present.
It is generally known that the consular services of the EU Member States are woefully inadequate in many countries of the South Caucasus.
They are deficient in both subsidiarity and effectiveness.
I therefore call on the Member States to increase their cooperation.
I see two possibilities.
One is mentioned in the report we are now discussing, that is the call to create common application centres for EU visas.
Unfortunately the road to that is long.
I therefore also propose an alternative solution, namely that nationals of the countries affected in the South Caucasus should have the right, irrespective of the purpose of their journey, to apply for a visa at the EU or Schengen country consulate located within easiest reach of them.
- (PL) Madam President, this is an important debate and an important report from Mrs Polfer.
This voice from the European Parliament is striving to make up for 10 to 20 years of delay.
During this time the Union has not in practice had any real policy regarding the countries of the South Caucasus.
Now at last we have come to understand that Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia are not a natural zone for the economic and political influences of Russia.
I am saying this precisely 11 days after the elections in Georgia, where I was one of six observers from the European Parliament, monitoring elections that were once again won by a representative of the pro-Western option, a proponent of maximum convergence with the Union and entry into NATO.
I say this also in the context of a political conflict that threatens us all - the whole of Europe - and may even develop into a military conflict between Georgia and Russia over Ossetia and Abkhazia, but Erevan, Baku and Tbilisi are equally of significance for the Union's energy policy and for diversification of energy sources.
So let us move from words to deeds, as it says in the report's title; let us make the transition from idle words to action.
Madam President, after more than a century and a half of neglect, the Black Sea area is again at the pinnacle of international economics and politics.
This area is currently striving to reach a new balance following the entrance of new actors, the EU included, after being considered a closed lake for so many years during the Cold War.
After the Commission's communication entitled 'Black Sea synergy: a new regional cooperation initiative', the current first report in Parliament is another step in the right direction.
But unfortunately, both are still not enough.
The lack of identity of the area itself and the traditional sensitivities of certain EU countries towards Russia, both political (for example Ukraine, Moldova, the Southern Caucasus and the frozen conflicts) and economic (the increased European dependence on Russian gas and the delicate status of the EU-Turkey negotiations), are probably among the reasons why the EU has limited itself to synergy instead of strategy.
While strategy means clear objectives, concrete means to attain them and, eventually, a detailed calendar, all tailored to the merit of the area itself, synergy suggests simply connecting to neighbouring areas of interest to the EU.
A strategy could be arrived at through concrete measures on how the EU deals with a multitude of local organisations; on physically linking the area to the rest of the continent in which the River Danube is crucial; and on strengthening the instrument of neighbourhood policy towards the Black Sea area, as suggested through my group's amendments.
In conclusion, one word on Moldova, the last piece of continental Latinity outside EU borders.
Although part of the same regrettable experience at the beginning of the Second World War, Moldova could not share the positive destiny of the three Baltic countries after the Cold War.
I believe Europe has a duty to correct that situation and thus continue to encourage and respond to Moldova's efforts to join the Union.
My hope is that her case will be finally judged on its own merit and not remain a de facto prisoner of other EU relations, no matter how strategic that relation might be.
(SV) Madam President, let me thank the rapporteur for an excellent report on a region which merits our attention.
The South Caucasus occupies an increasingly strategic position from both a political and an economic point of view.
We all note the increasing interest in the region, not least in this assembly.
Regrettably there are many potential flashpoints, and Russian interference is considerable.
Russia wants to increase its influence and signal its interest in dominating and controlling processes such as oil and gas supplies to Europe.
The EU must see the danger in Russia's conduct and therefore strengthen its ties with the South Caucasus.
By this means we could also acquire a useful and necessary supplement to Russian oil and gas with distribution routes in northern Europe.
The EU has everything to gain from greater involvement.
I am a member of a Swedish organisation - I actually helped to found it - which aims to increase contacts between Sweden and Azerbaijan.
I therefore say this as a friend.
The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 1991-1994 put a million people to flight, and the conflict is still unresolved.
According to Amnesty International, 600 000 internal refugees are living in appalling conditions in Azerbaijan.
Some years ago I visited a refugee camp in Azerbaijan close to the border with Iran.
I myself have never witnessed such abject poverty.
It is wholly unacceptable that, after all these years, hundreds of thousands of people should still be living in such degrading conditions.
In this respect Azerbaijan's leaders, headed by President Aliyev, deserve serious criticism.
The EU and the Commission must do more in this area.
These refugees must not be forgotten people.
It is also important that we act forcefully to ensure that such a basic right as freedom of expression is upheld.
Opposition politicians and journalists must not be subjected to threats and intimidation or be imprisoned.
If Azerbaijan wants to be a nation respected in Europe, it must uphold the fundamental principles of a democratic state subject to the rule of law.
. - (PL) Madam President, the problems we are debating today - as those who have spoken before me have said - are of unusual importance.
They mark out a vector for Community action that has been and still is greatly neglected.
If it is not to lose its element of Europeanness, the European Union may naturally enlarge itself and spread its influence only towards the East.
However, the discussions that stretch out into infinity concerning, for example, the membership prospects for certain countries in this region do not instil optimism.
There is no need for analysis and immersion in documents to be able to state that this region, compared with Africa, for instance, is treated as a remote province of our continent.
All cooperation mechanisms, as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, for example, are important, but this is not the target prospect for this region, as it does not stipulate true partnership in mutual relations.
For the Union, serious involvement in this region is linked to entry into the sphere of influence of Russia, and this, surely, means the continuing use of half-measures in the region.
What we must remember, however, is that in the long term this policy will not stabilise the area: it will do the opposite, perhaps generating new tensions, and we already have plenty of those to be going on with.
Madam President, the rapporteur on the Black Sea regional policy reminds us that the European Union supports new energy infrastructure and viable transport corridors, diversifying both suppliers and routes.
The prime example of such an undertaking is the Nabucco Gas Pipeline, already recognised as a priority project of European interest.
It is, therefore, regrettable that this project is being undermined by an alternative Russian-Italian pipeline by the name of South Stream.
As a Member from Poland, I see many parallels between South Stream and the Nord Stream Baltic Gas Pipeline.
Both are much more expensive than overland routes.
Indeed, South Stream may prove to be USD 4 billion more expensive than Nabucco.
Both may disturb the fragile ecological balance of sensitive marine environments.
Furthermore, in both cases, the pipelines may be seen as a political weapon in the hands of Russia.
Nord Stream will isolate Poland, the Baltic States and Ukraine; South Stream will play the same role with respect to Turkey, the South Caucasus and, possibly, Romania, which may now be bypassed in favour of Serbia.
South Stream goes against the principle of energy security in Europe, based on diverse sources and routes.
Thus, if South Stream does go ahead, it should not receive EU funding at any stage.
If Russia is going to push forward economically unviable and environmentally questionable projects, because they serve its foreign policy aims, then it should not be at our expense.
(NL) Madam President, I welcome the fact that this evening we are discussing in context the situation in the South Caucasus and our ambitions as the European Union and as Parliament with regard to the Black Sea region.
After all, we are talking about regions with regional problems, where regional solutions have to be found for the sake of the countries forming part of that region.
We are talking here about security, energy, trade, transport - or, more generally, about stability and the development of the regions bordering on the EU, regions where we have major interests.
These are interests that, in my opinion, must be reflected in a more active policy on the part of the EU and the European Commission.
We are obliged to the Commissioner for the initiatives she has developed under the umbrella of 'Black Sea Synergy'.
As other Members have already said, it is important to emphasise that there is also a role for Russia and Turkey in this kind of cooperation.
These countries have already assumed this role, and it is particularly important that the EU makes sure that they retain it.
After all, we have good relations with Turkey - we are conducting negotiations with it about its membership - although Turkey also has a broader role to play in the region, as well as a traditional role.
Russia is important within the region, but relations with that country are rather more complicated.
I believe that, if the EU positions itself as a partner rather than a driver within this cooperation, Moscow will come to feel that responsibility for the region is being shared, that we can cooperate as partners without the EU playing the leading role.
Synergy is a good idea - it is a good summary of the bundling of the EU's - the Commission's - policy activities - but, to provide this with a little more structure, Mr Swoboda and I have suggested giving it a parliamentary dimension, with ministerial consultations at the level of the Black Sea region.
We would welcome a little more structure.
Indeed, we have even talked of an EU-Black Sea Community, although, following Mr Sarkozy's initiatives, we have perhaps become more modest when it comes to using that kind of terminology.
It is important to emphasise that, whilst our suggestions and your vision are no replacement for the EU's bilateral relations with all these countries, they could nevertheless spur our eastern neighbours on to more regional cooperation. I believe that this is also of key importance to the EU.
- (PL) Madam President, in taking the floor in a debate devoted to the countries of the South Caucasus and regional policy in the Black Sea basin, I wish to draw attention to the following issues.
To begin with, this is a vast area for the production and transmission of energy, and one that is of exceptional importance from the aspect of diversification and security of energy raw material supplies to the Union.
However, support is needed for projects involving energy raw material transport from this area, not only to the south of Europe, as has been happening so far, but also to the north - to Ukraine and Poland - and on to the west.
Secondly, only EU support for political stability and democratisation processes in this region, and also the peaceful resolution of conflicts between neighbours, can provide the opportunity for rapid economic development in these countries and a genuine cut in the enormous unemployment and poverty rates.
Thirdly, the strong economic growth throughout the region, which in some countries is above 30% of GDP annually, is based solely and exclusively on the production and export of crude oil and natural gas.
What is needed in this area, therefore, is support for alternative sources of income, especially the development of tourism and the associated infrastructure.
Madam President, the author of the Commission communication on a Black Sea synergy, Janos Herman, is to be congratulated on an outstanding piece of work.
Parliament's rapporteur, Ms Anastase, has also produced an extremely important report.
Madam Commissioner, you said at the outset of this debate that you agreed with much of Ms Anastase's report.
In your response winding-up this debate, could you refer specifically to paragraphs 29 and 36 of the report?
Paragraph 29 calls on you to promote an intercultural dialogue in the Black Sea region, and paragraph 36 to set up an NGO platform for civil society exchanges.
Could you give Parliament your assurance that you will implement those two recommendations?
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, please allow me in my short speech to concentrate on just one of the aspects of today's topics, which is regional cooperation.
If we consider two areas, the Southern Caucasus and the Black Sea area, we can see that the mutual relationships between the countries are usually under-developed, whether they are bilateral or multilateral.
More significant political dialogue is usually lacking, the level of trade between these countries is very low, and a modern and effective transport or energy infrastructure is lacking nearly everywhere.
I therefore welcome the invitations of both rapporteurs to strengthen this very aspect: mutual regional cooperation in these regions, in addition to bilateral relations with the European Union.
It is vital to strengthen regional cooperation in the area of human and citizens' rights, to develop democracy and educational systems; to strengthen regional cooperation in the fields of transport, energy and the environment; to strengthen regional cooperation in the fields of trade, tourism and investment.
In other words, it is vital to create gradually, step by step, a solid canvas of human, cultural, economic and political relationships between the nations and the states of the Southern Caucasus and the Black Sea area.
If this succeeds, I am convinced that even in that geographical area the lingering conflicts will be gradually sorted out and finally resolved, and an area of stability, democracy and prosperity will be created.
(SV) Madam President, with its clear geostrategic position, the Black Sea region is one which is important to both the EU and the countries in the wider area, not simply for security-political reasons but also because of its cultural diversity and cultural wealth.
However, regions in which many routes intersect and in which there is a variety of political and other interests are often at risk of conflicts of one kind or another.
I myself was born in the Balkans and I know what protracted and unresolved conflicts can mean, not just for the security situation in a whole region but also for its economic potential and for the normalisation of life for the people who live there.
I also know that the EU has an important role to play.
The EU can and must have as its aim, together with people of the Black Sea countries, to develop the region into one which is stable and secure and in which democratic principles and the rule of law prevail.
Increasing cooperation in the energy field is also an important element in that work.
By investing in new infrastructure and increasing the spread of suppliers, we shall contribute to economic and commercial development in the region, which in turn will improve the chances of stability and security.
To strengthen ties between the EU and the Black Sea region is therefore not just good but necessary.
Hence it is self-evident that the Black Sea region needs a new and clearer regional policy.
I must emphasise that regional policy should not be used as an alternative to EU membership for those countries which may be eligible.
It must also not be used as an excuse to delay the process of integrating the region with Europe.
Finally I want to thank the two rapporteurs for their excellent work and offer a special word of thanks to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for her personal interest and proven personal commitment to matters affecting this region.
(BG) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, colleagues, I would like to express my satisfaction with the fact that the two reports, on the Black Sea and on the Southern Caucasus, were prepared and discussed in the Committee on Foreign Affairs in an atmosphere of agreement, and were adopted practically unanimously.
This is an encouraging sign that we are aware how important it is to build a clearer, more systematic, more structured and unified policy towards the Black Sea region and adjacent countries.
This is not an easy task.
The Black Sea region consists of countries with diverse traditions, cultures, political practices, territorial spans and population sizes.
Also, these countries are at different stages in their cooperation with the European Union, ranging from Member States, candidate countries, to countries from the European Neighbourhood Policy and, of course, Russia, whose constructive approach would be key to the success of this initiative.
This mix, however, provides a number of opportunities for a combination of the various policies to produce a much larger aggregate effect.
I would like to make three points.
Firstly, the region is of extreme strategic importance for the European Union in terms of security, energy supplies, transportation and trade, environment, etc. That is why, while appreciating highly the Commission initiative on Black Sea synergy, we would like to see a more ambitious project based on the achievements within the Nordic dimension or the EU-Mediterranean cooperation.
At a time of promoting the idea for an EU-Mediterranean Union, there is nothing more natural than to find a more ambitious formula for the Black Sea region.
Secondly, the whole region has an underdeveloped transport and energy transmission infrastructure.
That is why I think it appropriate to support all transnational projects planned in that respect because they are mutually complementary, and not alternatives.
This means more security, facilitation of economic exchanges and linking the countries in the region with the European Union.
This will diversify not only the sources but also the routes along which oil and natural gas will reach the European Union.
Thirdly, most countries in the region suffer from serious social problems and we would like to make sure that social issues are not pushed into the background.
Long-term prospects for countries on the Black Sea and in the Southern Caucasus are linked to human potential development, investment in education, ensuring adequate health services and child care.
Thank you.
Madam President, I would inform the Commissioner that, along with several colleagues, I am convinced the EU has to demonstrate increased engagement in the South Caucasus.
After all, all the states in that region are already members of the Council of Europe and, as such, are part of Europe.
The extended neighbourhood policies will be a valuable tool for applying such an engagement in real terms.
Our challenge and chance is to play the role of a reliable stabiliser, but also that of an independent mediator and supporter of the democratic process.
We therefore need to leave behind hesitations and ambiguity.
It is high time to profile EU policies more clearly in this area.
The EU representative, Peter Semneby, has done an outstanding job, and I am glad, Commissioner, that you spoke about increasing and widening our representations in the region.
Long-term, active EU engagement will certainly contribute to also finding a solution to the frozen conflicts which the Committee on Foreign Affairs has decided to term, more realistically, 'unresolved, post-Soviet conflicts'.
Therefore, it is significant that the report rejects attempts by any foreign power to create exclusive zones of interest in the region, and urges Russia not to oppose EU engagement in conflict management and peacekeeping operations.
Equally important, however, will be the EU's role in advancing the culture of democratic dialogue in the region.
The European Parliament will have an important part to play in this.
Members of Parliament can mediate and encourage normal political dialogue between opposing parties.
Finally, it is important that the report encourages the Commission to move towards possible free trade agreements with Armenia and Georgia, and to make preparations for a mobility partnership agreement between the EU and Georgia.
So, the South Caucasus has become increasingly close and important for us.
That region deserves our firm commitment.
Madam President, the EU is able and willing to help strengthen stability and democracy and improve living standards in the Black Sea and South Caucasus region.
The involvement of large states such as Turkey, Ukraine and Russia is important, although they all have a different status in terms of their relations with the EU.
Poland brings its potential and experience to this region, despite not being directly connected to it, because of its shared history with the Baltic States.
However, just when intensified dialogue and cooperation with our neighbours is badly needed, the EU has drawn down another curtain through some aspects of the expanded Schengen area.
For many Eastern Europeans, 1 January 2008 brought with it a four-fold price rise in visas for travel to neighbouring countries, thus drawing down a financial curtain in Europe.
I disagree with statements made by officials of the Commission to the effect that our Southern and Eastern neighbours should be treated equally from this point of view.
Our Eastern neighbours are on the same continent, and not long ago some of us lived in one country with them, with no borders.
I look to my colleagues for support for the PSE Group's Amendment 10 to the Black Sea strategy report.
We urge the Council and Commission to decrease visa fees to a more acceptable level for ordinary citizens of countries participating in the EU's neighbourhood policy or having a strategic partnership with the EU.
(RO) First of all, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Anastase, as well as my colleagues on the various committees that delivered their opinions, on the report under discussion, which is as momentous as the problems involved in the establishment of a regional Black Sea policy.
I would also like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development for their support to the amendments proposed to the opinion of the Committee that I'm a member of.
I am referring to the inclusion in the final draft of the Black Sea report of my request for strengthening the European assistance mission on the Moldovan and Ukrainian border and the need for improved management of illegal migration and immigration in the area.
I believe we need the Commission's encouragement in the form of action in the region, at both country and regional levels, for this area to become truly democratic and stable.
A more active European involvement would mean a real opportunity for this area which has a huge, insufficiently exploited potential, considering the frozen conflicts and tense relations between some countries in the area.
Institutionally speaking, I am in favour of the idea of Member States in the area assuming leadership (Romania, Bulgaria, Greece), and I think that the Union and the countries in the region should strengthen and coordinate regional cooperation activities and mechanisms.
It is only in this way that the doubling of funds available via the European Neighbourhood Instrument and the principles governing the Structural Funds, such as partnership, sustainability, effectiveness, non-discrimination and decentralisation, will yield the beneficial effects that we all expect.
- (PL) Madam President, the rapporteurs cannot hide their satisfaction at having presented the European Parliament with an initiative to strengthen Black Sea synergy, a proposal put forward by the German Presidency and fleshed out by the European Commission.
This idea has also received support from the countries of the southern and eastern part of the Baltic that have recently been integrated into the European Union.
Their stance also provides evidence of a conviction that there is a need for the close bundling of Black Sea synergy together with what is known as the EU's Eastern dimension.
In this way local cooperation acquires a more general significance, and a realisation potential in line with the basic Community message.
In other words, Black Sea synergy should express itself simply in the identification and synthesis of multilateral undertakings, by identifying them with the best interests of both the Black Sea region and the entire eastern part of an integrated Europe.
One important factor that enhances the particular role of the Black Sea is the special geographic, historic and politico-economic situation of this body of water.
European and Asiatic influences have been criss-crossing here for thousands of years.
European Union involvement in the Black Sea basin must therefore be shorn of superfluous institutionalisation and political influences, and restrictions threatening an attenuation of the conditions for rational cooperation, and even destabilisation in this region, both in the security sphere and in the sphere of functioning of the communications network, protection of the environment, and so on. It should also create additional favourable conditions for a stronger engagement by the Black Sea in the process of diversification of energy supply routes, perhaps involving new sources, especially from what is known as the Caspian direction.
Many EU countries are known to be interested in this.
(RO) The essence of the European neighbourhood policy is cooperation based on a set of common values and concerns which the Union shares with the countries involved in this policy.
It is necessary to strengthen a stable neighbourhood area, which would have a positive influence on the Union's internal security and would be a prerequisite for the economic prosperity and development of the countries concerned.
The countries in South Caucasus have certain features which are necessary to the success of European projects in key areas such as energy and transport.
The geopolitical significance of these countries is linked to their strategic position in relation to energy resources in Central Asia.
This is an essential transit area, being one of the few corridors that may enable the Union to diversify its access to energy resources from the Caspian.
Possible alternative transit routes for gas pipes from the Caspian and pipeline projects across the Black Sea are largely dependent on stability in the South Caucasus.
The European Union is not the only actor with a strategic interest in the area.
Two other major players on the international scene have developed strong initiatives as well as long-term strategies in the area.
The United States have an action plan on energy security involving the initiation and development of alternate routes for the transport of oil and gas.
Russia is funding projects of its own, and is strengthening its position on the Central Asian market.
In the current context, given the obvious importance of the energy issue and dependence on Russia, the European Union's low degree of involvement in the area may lead to negative consequences for all the Member States.
The European Union must develop a single energy security policy as soon as possible, with Member States renouncing individual interests and necessarily involving South Caucasian countries.
(BG) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, I congratulate the European Commission for initiating, by its communication, this debate on strengthening cooperation with the Black Sea region by complementing existing bilateral policies by a new regional approach.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms. Anastase, for her very well balanced and innovative report.
I fully share in the understanding that with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union, the Black Sea has acquired a new strategic importance - not just for the countries in the region but for all Member States, and for the Union's policies and principles implemented.
I appeal to the Commission and insist that it call upon the national governments, in cases of implementations of large infrastructure, energy and environmental projects affecting the livelihoods, health and quality of life of the citizens in the settlements and municipalities where these projects are to be implemented, to provide, on an obligatory basis, local communities with information on the technical parameters of such projects in line with the highest world standards adopted for projects of that kind.
Sharing the report's deep concern for the environmental status of the Black Sea region, and in particular the status of the Black Sea, which is affected by uncontrolled pollution, exacerbated by many environmental disasters, I insist that independent assessments should be made of the impact of developing new oil and gas transmission infrastructure on the environment and the social life of citizens and that national governments should prepare reports on possible damages that could be caused by such projects, and present them for public referendums and debates.
A case in point is the project for the construction of the Bourgas - Alexandroupolos oil pipeline in Bulgaria.
In full agreement with the principles of ensuring sustainable development and environmental disaster recovery as stated in the report and in the context of the two recent tragic accidents in the area of Kerch last November and in the first week of the current year, it is necessary to set up a mechanism to take into consideration the interest of local communities in coastal municipalities where there is a threat to the clean waters of the Black Sea, to the livelihoods and quality of life of citizens in these towns and villages.
Thank you for your attention.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their comprehensive and well-structured reports, and I would like to talk briefly about one aspect.
In Georgia we have had the elections, confirmed as regular by the OSCE but challenged by Russia, in which outgoing President Saakashvili was re-elected.
Amid countless difficulties he attempted to bring democracy to the country, dismantling the old post-Soviet diplomacy and opening up to the West, NATO and the EU.
It was this opening up that caused the retaliation by Putin's Russia, which, amongst other things, has always favoured the independence movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Apart from the geopolitical situation, however, another cause of friction with Russia is, objectively, the oil and gas pipelines in Georgian territory, designed to carry Azerbaijan's oil and gas westwards.
I believe that in the Caucasus region which, as we should bear in mind, is affected by the insidious war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Chechen issue, the conflict between Turkey and Armenia and many other problems, having a democratic country which is our ally and, above all, offers an alternative energy source to Moscow, is a factor of strategic importance.
We should therefore take concrete steps to strengthen this synergy.
(RO) The Member States and the Commission should step up the implementation of priority projects in the field of trans-European transport on axes 7, 18, 22 and 21 and their progressive integration within TRACECA and with the 5 axes defined in Commission Communication 32/2007 on extending the main trans-European transport routes to neighbouring countries.
The European Black Sea Dimension should be similar to the Northern Dimension and based on equal partnership and adequate infrastructure for priority projects in the fields of nuclear power, research and safety, transport, tourism, and combating climate change.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the economic development of Black Sea countries requires high-speed motorways and railways connecting the central and western parts of the European Union to its Black Sea coast.
The European Union should promote the single maritime policy in the Black Sea region.
This will ensure an integrated approach to environmental protection, coastal area development, maritime research, and tourism.
Madam President, I put two questions to the Commissioner and when she replies regarding the implementation of paragraph 29, on the promotion of intercultural dialogue, and paragraph 36, on the creation of an NGO platform for exchanges between civil society, perhaps she might bear in mind the precedent that we have in the Balkans under an organisation called CLIO.
It is independent of governments and involves history teachers from all the countries in the Balkans, who meet together to discuss the common historical and cultural background of the past in order to produce books and documents on the history of their region that are devoid of national conflict.
Perhaps in the Black Sea region there might also be a lesson: for historians and researchers from all the countries around the Black Sea to meet together, independent of government pressure, to promote a common understanding of the Black Sea's history, devoid of national conflict.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I must say that was one of the best debates I have ever had, and at this very late moment of the day.
It was about the European neighbourhood policy, which is already there.
Many of you have said the European Union has to do a lot, but the European Union has done a lot, as others have said.
I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Ms Anastase and Ms Polfer, because I think you have brought about a very interesting debate.
But what is the new element of this Black Sea synergy?
It is the regional element and, as was rightly said by some Members who unfortunately are no longer here; it was under the German Presidency, to which I would like to pay tribute, that there was the idea of having a regional dimension.
This is now the regional dimension of the bilateral part of the neighbourhood policy to the east.
That means that, to achieve a synergy, we are trying to bring together not only the neighbourhood policy countries, but also two other very important players: Turkey and Russia.
Therefore, it is not a strategy but a synergy, because there are, of course, different strategies.
If you think: we have a neighbourhood policy, we have a particular strategy towards Russia and, of course, we have a candidate country - Turkey.
But, still, we think that a policy on working together is very important.
In the framework of the troika, I am going, together with other colleagues, to this region very soon - I think in two weeks' time - and I will certainly take a lot of what has been said here with me.
I shall now come to a few points, because there is such a lot to be said that I could speak for another half an hour, but I do not want to do that, because I think we have had a very interesting debate, and a lot will have to be said in the future.
Trade is one of the important parts.
You have spoken about energy, about transport, about climate change, as I have myself.
There are other aspects, but trade is a very important one, and there is a feasibility study on trade already on the way.
There is a Commission initiative.
What is the aim?
The aim is to evaluate the prospect of further trade openings, for instance in the case of Georgia, in the case of Armenia, but of course we have to see how things are going to evolve.
This is one thing.
Secondly, my personal idea when I presented the neighbourhood policy in one of my last communications - not in the very last but the one before - was to say that we need an economic neighbourhood area, an economic space, and this is also what some Members have mentioned here.
So the idea is to have a sort of free trade in the future.
But of course we have to get there step by step.
An area of justice, freedom and liberty will also be there in future, but, of course, it is again a step-by-step approach.
Many have spoken about a visa policy.
I can tell you that, as a Commission, we have been quite open to that.
But you know very well that this is the Member States' competence, so if you speak about visa fees, you know there is a possibility for Member States, in principle, to concede visa freedom and there is also a possibility for Member States to say they would like to go ahead with visa facilitation.
But it is clearly not the competence of the Commission.
I just wanted to mention that, because the Commission is always addressed on things where it has tried but has not gone further because of the realities.
I shall now move on to energy.
Of course, it is a very important region for energy, and we need coordinated decisions by many - by state and by private players - for long-distance pipelines.
You know that the Commission uses South Caucasus and Black Sea regional cooperation to facilitate decisions and to diversify sources and routes of supply.
This includes contacts, for instance, regarding the trans-Caspian gas pipeline, Nabucco. You know there is now a coordinator, but, again, it is not only the Commission.
It is a matter of the Commission and the Member States.
And again, some Member States have already gone for some different ideas, which are not always within our unified approach.
I think another very important aspect is port development.
This is high on our agenda in the framework of our Motorways of the Sea programme.
So this will also be reflected in the next phase of the TRACECA project.
Let me now answer Mr Beazley.
Yes, indeed, there is also the role of intercultural dialogue in this respect.
But, for instance, yesterday I was in Madrid, where the Alliance of Civilisations was launched, which is now a project on a global scale, within the framework of the United Nations.
Certainly, one of the local and regional aspects will be this aspect, but I think we should put it into this new global framework.
Then, on the other hand, you mentioned NGO exchanges.
On this, I can tell you that the Black Sea cross-border cooperation programme already supports contact between NGOs.
The Commission is planning some NGO events this year concerning economic cooperation and freedom of the press, and we are cooperating closely in this field with the Black Sea Forum, an initiative of Romania.
Finally, I think what Mr Beazley mentioned about history books is certainly one of those interesting elements.
By the way, of course, for the many projects that are being mentioned facility funds are necessary.
Therefore, we have created in the neighbourhood policy the Neighbourhood Investment Fund which, in principle, targets the South and the East.
But within regional cooperation there is also a possibility for projects to be brought up.
I think these are the major points that I would like to make at this stage, but I am sure we can come back to this topic again, maybe after the meetings have taken place.
And you also know that we are trying, at least as a Commission, to facilitate the questions of how we can help to resolve the frozen conflicts.
This is, of course, a much more difficult area, because every one is very different, but we are at least trying with our projects to help and to get the right environment in order to facilitate settlements.
We do hope, together with the Member States and the Council, to come to a good solution.
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, very briefly, I would like to thank all my fellow Members who have spoken, and those who worked with me. I have noted with great pleasure that there is a widespread convergence of views on the need to deepen our relations with the countries of the South Caucasus, to share our experience with them, and to support them on the path of reform, both political and economic.
I would especially like to thank the Commissioner for making herself available this evening, but also for being available and communicating with us to share information and keep track of this dossier.
I can assure her that she has won our interest, attention and friendship.
Rapporteur. - (RO) I, too, would like to thank all the speakers for their meaningful contributions concerning major aspects of Black Sea cooperation.
I fully agree that a separate policy, perhaps even a strategy, should be developed for the Black Sea region, and I would like to stress once again its importance.
I welcome the organisation of an interministerial conference on Black Sea politics and I hope that one of the outcomes of this conference will be concrete, firm measures concerning all the areas of cooperation among Black Sea countries and between these countries and the European Union.
I won't dwell on any other issues for the moment; of course, the debate has been very interesting, but there is one major idea to reiterate: that this synergy and the cooperation policy in the Black Sea region should not preclude new prospects for accession.
Dialogue with the institutionalised civil society is very important, because, indeed, institution building can only be achieved if the people involved are willing to bring about real change.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 p.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) The report discussing Black Sea synergy rightly elucidates those areas where strengthening dialogue could have mutual benefits for the EU and the states of the region.
Among these, energy policy will play an unavoidable role.
Deepening cooperation between the Union and the Black Sea countries could lead to valuable steps forward in the field of the security of Community supplies.
The construction of gas pipelines to ease greatly Europe's dependency on energy is inconceivable without the active cooperation of the states in the region.
Developing a transparent, non-discriminatory framework programme for transport is crucial, not only for the Member States of the Union but also for the welfare of the many states in the region.
We cannot emphasise enough the importance of the Nabucco gas pipeline, since it would mean an alternative for Europe, both in respect of resources and partners and in respect of transportation routes.
On this point it is particularly important that the relevant countries resist the alluring attempts to divide up the short-term benefits.
Nabucco may be a symbol not only of the common energy policy that is taking shape but also of Black Sea cooperation.
When discussing this theme, it would be worthwhile for us to draw attention to the increased activity of Russia in the region.
The European Union must make it clear that it considers unacceptable her monopolistic endeavours on energy resources that can be discerned here.
As the Committee on Industry states in its opinion on the report, access to resources is a legitimate Community interest.
The principles of free competition must prevail when the Union prepares its policy on this.
in writing. - (ET) The report tackles the area on a regional basis, and although this approach has its advantages, it does not allow the differences between the countries of South Caucasus to be highlighted sufficiently.
I urge the differences between the countries to be brought out more strongly because otherwise we would be doing something to them which we would not like to be done to us.
Secondly, the wording of the report may give the impression that Georgia is the most problematic country in the region; I have also seen this happen in debates in various Parliamentary Committees and in groups where Ambassadors have said this themselves.
In view of recent events, however, this is not in fact true and we know full well that that is the case.
Regrettably the violence of demonstrations in Tbilisi has received much greater world attention than everyday violations of human rights in for example Azerbaijan, which frequently are not brought to our attention because of the country's large energy resources.
When considering the situation of the economy or human rights, progress of democratic institutions and media freedom, Georgia's performance is that of a country which has very clearly chosen the road of democracy and is moving forward more successfully than the rest.
And this too merits greater support on our part.
in writing. - As a Member of the European Parliament from Estonia I am glad to inform you that one fifth of the Members of the Estonian Parliament took part in election observation missions in Georgia.
According to the international election observation mission, the elections held on January 5 were 'in essence consistent with most international standards for democratic elections, but significant challenges were revealed which need to be addressed urgently'.
Although some irregularities were discovered and pointed out, it is utterly irresponsible to give way to more friction in Georgia.
Especially by endangering the legitimacy of the elections in the eyes of the Georgian people by creating a doubt that in principle the elections were not held free and fair.
It is my belief that the politicians in the neighbouring countries and even in the EU, who have chosen to remain sceptical and extremely vocal as well, have not acted in the best interest of further sustainable development and consolidation of democracy in Georgia, the importance of which this report clearly stresses.

The role of women in industry (debate)
The next item is the report by Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the role of women in industry.
This report is very important and is likely to receive a great deal of media attention.
rapporteur. - (PT) I must start by thanking the members and staff of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their support and valuable contributions, particularly through their proposals on this report which enabled its unanimous approval.
This work took several months and included a public hearing with valuable contributions being made by members of both parliamentary committees and external guests, particularly social organisations.
This report seeks to highlight the role of women in industry.
On average, over 14% of women in employment in the European Union work in industry.
In some countries this percentage exceeds 25%, such as in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, and in others it is around 20%, such as in Portugal, Greece and Hungary.
We know that in some industrial sectors women represent the majority of workers, such as in textiles, garments and footwear, areas of the food industry, cork, cabling, and electrical and electronic equipment, whereas their participation in cutting-edge technology sectors is limited.
This means that we need different approaches, but with one common goal of promoting the women working in these sectors, guaranteeing non-discriminatory practices in access to employment and contracting, wage equality, creation of career opportunities, vocational training, good working conditions and better pay, and respecting maternity and paternity as fundamental social values.
The need to guarantee employment with rights for women working in industry and to keep facilitating their access to jobs in this important sector of production also requires more attention to be paid to the situation in various industries in the European Union, to the challenges facing them and to the appropriate responses which must be found, including in international trade and in monitoring the situation of imports of sensitive products such as those in the textile sector.
Particular attention must be paid to the restructuring and relocation of multinationals which significantly affect the employment of women and increase their unemployment, particularly in regions where there is no alternative employment.
The fight against the wage discrimination which still exists and which affects female workers, in particular indirect discrimination, requires us to look into establishing a methodology for analysing exactly what jobs entail, which will guarantee the right to equal pay for women and men, give proper recognition to individuals and occupations and, at the same time, establish work as a structural factor, with a view to increasing the productivity, competitiveness and quality of undertakings and improving the lives of workers, both women and men.
We must therefore encourage initiatives that contribute to the development in companies of positive measures and human resources policies promoting gender equality.
We must also encourage information and training measures making it possible to promote, transfer and incorporate successful practices.
I would highlight in this respect certain projects developed with the support of the EQUAL programme which I have had the opportunity to experience in Portugal.
This programme deserves the European Commission's full attention to ensure its continuation and expansion.
As underlined in the report, negotiations and collective bargaining are vitally important in the fight to abolish discrimination against women, in particular with regard to access to employment, wages, occupational health and safety conditions, career progression, and vocational training.
However, the Member States and the Commission have a particular responsibility and an important role to play in promoting equality and fighting all kinds of discrimination, in guaranteeing employment with rights and in combating the precariousness of work which particularly affects women.
We therefore call on them to act, whether by defining high standards for health protection at work that take account of the gender dimension, notably maternity protection, or through working time and organisation that respect family life, or by creating effective inspection mechanisms ensuring respect for employment rights and trade union freedom, or by guaranteeing comprehensive access to good public social security and affordable social services, in particular crÃšches, nurseries and support for elderly people.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission warmly welcomes the motion for a resolution on the role of women in industry.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Figueiredo, on addressing this issue of the situation and role of women in industry, which is complex.
One of the several reasons is that, as shown in the report, the gender equality challenges in industry are even more acute than in other sectors.
In industry, the problems of working conditions, the pay gap and the reconciliation of work and private life tend to be even more pronounced.
It is also a complex issue because it goes beyond equality policy to relate to the general situation in industry in Europe and the way Community policies can support industry and workers - both men and women - in the difficult context of globalisation.
As you know, the adoption of the Roadmap for Gender Equality in 2006 underlined the Union's full commitment to do its utmost to make progress towards a situation of real equality between men and women.
The six priorities of the roadmap are linked to improving the situation of women on the labour market.
The first is economic independence for women and men, the second is reconciliation of private and professional life, the third is equal representation in decision-making and the fourth is the elimination of stereotypes.
The Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament's motion for a resolution highlights precisely these areas.
Whilst the progress made in the area of gender equality is unquestionable, major challenges remain.
The Commission shares the rapporteur's view that we must continue our efforts and consolidate what has been achieved.
As far as women's participation in industry is concerned, two issues should be tackled.
Firstly, there are still very few women in industry compared to the services sector.
Secondly, those women who work in industry tend to be in typically female sectors which are very labour-intensive and characterised by poor working conditions and low wages.
The Commission is conducting various policies to meet these challenges.
Combating stereotypes in education will, in the long term, lead to there being more highly skilled women in technical and scientific occupations and will also help to meet the needs of certain industrial sectors for manpower or womanpower.
It is also important to support the careers of female engineers via networking, mentoring and measures to balance work and private life.
In order to diversify women's employment in industry, it is vital to provide every opportunity for training and retraining.
The European Social Fund provides essential support in this area.
It is also vital to improve the current situation of women working in industry.
For example, there is still an unjustifiably large gap between women and men.
In industry, this gap is as much as 30%.
For this reason, in July 2007 the Commission adopted a communication on tackling the pay gap between women and men.
The communication examined all the resources that must be mobilised to achieve this aim.
The involvement of enterprises is an important way of making progress in the areas of equality between men and women at work, the gender pay gap, training, work-life balance and career development.
In addition to the laws on equal treatment, which all enterprises must obey, it is important to encourage them to adopt voluntary measures to promote equality, in particular in the context of corporate social responsibility.
Finally, the Commission will shortly relaunch an awareness-raising campaign for enterprises about gender stereotypes.
The report on women in industry underlines the vital role of work-life balance in order to achieve real gender equality and the Commission shares this analysis.
This point was mentioned during the adoption by Parliament of the Kauppi report in September 2007.
The Commission will report in 2008 on progress towards the Barcelona objectives in the area of childcare.
The second phase of the consultation of social partners on work-life balance concluded in July.
The Commission takes the view that this issue should be tackled using a combination of different instruments, including the amendment of current Community legislation in order to better take account of new challenges.
As I stressed, the issue of women in industry also reflects the general situation of industry in Europe.
The Commission will continue to pursue all the necessary policies to face up to globalisation, ensure a future for industry in the Member States and help workers of both sexes when the companies for which they work are restructured.
European laws on employee information and consultation, social dialogue and the European Social Fund are all instruments designed to achieve this.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, launched in 2007, will provide assistance of up to EUR 500 million per year and its rules provide specifically for gender equality to be taken into account.
The Commission is, therefore, responding to all the challenges identified by the report on the role of women in industry by taking measures of various kinds: improving equality, working conditions and the role of women in industry, combating stereotypes, creating better conditions for reconciling work and family life and providing general support for companies and workers in industrial sectors in difficulty.
I should like to make a personal statement: I sincerely support this way of tackling the difficulties in this specific area.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, I warmly welcome this report, which I fully support.
The British Conservatives support it, as does the PPE-DE Group.
If Europe is to play a leading part in a very competitive, a fiercely competitive, global world, we need all the resources available at the highest possible level.
Whilst I disagree that there should be quotas saying how many ladies there should be at various levels in companies - and I particularly disagree with any compulsion in that regard - what I do want to see is as many ladies as possible rise to the highest possible levels based on their ability.
It often depends on what we define as 'industry', and industry is changing; everything is much more flexible nowadays, and I am delighted that ladies are playing their role in industry in their various positions.
I do not agree that there needs to be any handicap or under-representation in the new technologies, because ladies have the brains, the intelligence and the know-how to more than make their worth felt.
Firstly, I would endorse the view that we should always go for equal pay wherever possible.
Regarding this report, I was extremely pleased that the rapporteur embraced the views of people from the various groups and that we reached unanimity.
I wanted to see better facilities for pensions for ladies - for portability within pensions from one employer to another to make sure they get higher pensions as they get through their working lives, and more flexibility in terms of facilities so that ladies can balance their family lives with their working lives.
As I say, I fully support this report.
It is a step forward.
We need ladies at all levels and I wish them well.
I welcome in particular our new Commissioner, who is very capable indeed.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SK) I would like to say thank you for the work that has been done on this report by Mrs Figueiredo.
The report to some extent lists the problems facing women employed in various sectors of industry.
Some of the problems seem to be perennial problems, such as the gender pay gap, the inadequate representation of women on company boards of directors or the inadequate reconciliation of work and family life.
The report also brings up issues that are less frequently discussed, such as the insufficient attention given to specific requirements for the protection of women in the work place or the social problems that arise as a result of transfers of production to areas with lower production costs.
Some of the proposals in the report interfere with the principle of subsidiarity or lay down requirements that encroach on the competence of the social partners and the processes of collective bargaining.
The PPE-DE Group will not support these proposals.
Despite the fact that the report is more or less a summary of problems that are reasonably well known, it points at the fact that changes in these areas are slow, as can be seen, for example, in the development of differences between the salaries of men and women.
The research clearly indicates that the turning point comes when children arrive: from that point the careers of men and women take different directions.
Most difficult to break are the critical stereotypes, and this is the case even when we do not identify with them verbally any more.
The report also highlights the issue of the transferability and flexibility of pension rights, which is becoming more and more sensitive with the progressive unification of the labour market, and with the requirement for higher mobility of the workforce.
This, I think, is an issue that should be given appropriate attention.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I would first also like to thank the rapporteur for her help and cooperation.
We made the most of our opportunities to work together across political boundaries and I would like to express my warmest thanks for this.
I would begin by pointing out that we have already presented a large number of reports on this subject.
The demand for equal pay for equal work goes back more than 30 years and we have still not been able to make it a reality.
Of course we are taking small steps forward and we are producing paper after paper, but the situation of women in industry still remains a long way behind what we have been working towards all this time.
In the manufacturing industry, for example, 85% of the employees are women, and in the ICT sector the figure is 15%, and indeed women are very poorly represented in the high-technology industries.
This does not imply that women are less educated, it only means - and this applies especially to rural areas - that there are simply no opportunities to take up other jobs.
Women continue to work in the low-wage sector and even here there is differentiation between male and female workers.
There is still inequality and discrimination, and not just in respect of wage levels but working conditions too.
We are therefore also appealing to the trade unions to do more to prevent this type of wage discrimination when taking part in pay negotiations.
Support for professional and vocational training programmes is still lacking or is woefully inadequate.
Education and training is needed in order to provide female employees with career prospects, even in low-skill sectors.
We also call on companies to apply family and women-friendly policies in their workforce management plans, which will work to everyone's advantage: when everyone has that feel-good feeling, business runs better and this also benefits the women who work in it.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and levels of cooperation, and, in particular, for highlighting the way men and women are treated differently, despite the fact that we hardly ever get a sympathetic hearing.
The Member of the Commission is, I am sure, personally committed to the issue, but when I was listening to your official reply in which you said that the Roadmap had been adopted, and that there was commitment to it, afterwards one might naturally have expected to hear an account of what had actually happened.
Unfortunately, we have to say that hardly anything has happened in matters of equality during this Commission's term.
That is regrettable.
It is perhaps not the sort of important issue the Commissioners or others could score points on; nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to encourage us all to do more because we are responsible for the status of women in Europe.
I will give you one example.
In Finland women got the right to vote when it was part of a very conservative Russia in 1905.
That was amazing.
Looking ahead now, I do not think it will be possible, now we are part of Europe, for women in the different Member States to earn the same pay and receive the same kind of treatment in the EU, even if the EU speaks of human rights and is progressive.
I think the EU could take a look at the decisions that were taken in tsarist times and make bold decisions on equality of pay and equality in the workplace.
The tsar had the courage to give women the vote, but the EU does not have the courage to do anything to bring about equality of pay in the Member States of the EU.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I have clear memories of the 1950s in Poland.
We used to see many huge billboards with pictures of smiling girls driving tractors.
These were girls from the so-called Polish Service organisation.
We saw them shouldering pickaxes and spades and marching joyfully off to work.
There were also women tending looms and lathes.
Times have changed.
We now see women working in design offices, on computers, or on the new production lines for electronic equipment, mobile telephones and televisions.
We also see the tired faces of women hurrying home after many hours of hard work to undertake other daily tasks.
Those were the images that came to my mind as I read Mrs Figueiredo's report on the role of women in industry.
For many years now, efforts have been made to protect women, reduce their workload and treat them in the same way as men are treated.
Unfortunately, differences persist to this day.
The list of expectations is very appropriate, though perhaps not complete.
Differences still persist in the way men and women are treated at work, both regarding pay and career development as well as assessment of their work and qualifications.
The most unfortunate thing of all is that it has not proved possible to create the conditions for women's hopes and aspirations to be realised, so that they can be sure of job stability and opportunities for career development.
on behalf of the Verts/ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the role of women in industry is clearly conditioned - this has already been stated, and I wish to remind you of it - as in many other cases, by a number of stereotypes, some of which are clearly pernicious.

We need to make headway on overcoming such stereotypes and that is precisely why I feel the Figueiredo report is a fundamental and important concept and, similarly, why it enjoys the support of our group.
There is much evidence to justify this report and the submission of a number of proposals, which we trust will be welcomed not only by the Community institutions, but by business itself, which, after all, has to adopt them and implement them.
One such piece of evidence is the fact that the European Union average in terms of women employed in industry is a mere 14%.
It must nevertheless also be borne in mind that, of this percentage, 21% accounts for part-time employees; indeed, women account for 65% of part-time employees in the industrial sector.
I feel that this is one of the key aspects, and by no means a minor issue in this debate.
The second piece of evidence is the fact that it is precisely women with precarious employment conditions, women working part-time, carrying out temporary employment in atypical conditions, that are most frequently affected by wage discrimination or, when they wish to take maternity leave, have fewer possibilities in terms of basic, permanent and vocational training.
Thus the proposals in this report include the proposal for urgent measures to be adopted for full and effective application of Directive 75/117 EEC on the principle of equal pay for men and women as a means of opposing wage discrimination.
We have been calling for this for some time now, and hope to see it implemented as soon as possible.
Secondly, we want incentives to be provided for initiatives, positive courses of action and policies for human resources to promote equality.
We want the Member States and the Commission to provide more and better tax breaks for companies in terms of compliance with codes of conduct and corporate social responsibility criteria in their day-to-day business.
We want to see better working conditions, with particular emphasis on working hours, and maternity and paternity leave - here responsibility is shared on both sides by the couple or the family - thereby guaranteeing working men and women the opportunity to take up their posts again after such leave.
Attention must also be paid to reconciling work and family life.
Thus, for all this to be transformed into reality, the report calls for these rights to be implemented in legislation across the European Union.
Finally, I beg to differ with Mr Dover on the subject of quotas.
For some of us, female and male, these constitute a necessary instrument, and thus we feel the point must be made that the European Union ought to follow the Norwegian example of applying measures to increase the numbers of female board members of public utilities to at least 40%, and use regulations to impose a 40% quota of female representation on boards of private companies.
It is obvious that this is not the solution, but I must insist that this is a path and a means that is proving useful in other aspects, which we would like to see copied within the European Union.
, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr Chairman, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my committee colleague Ilda Figueiredo has, as always, done an excellent job.
She has documented facts that I myself consider fundamental, in particular the fact that working women account for the dominant share of employment in the processing industry, where the majority of jobs require fewer qualifications, are manual and are badly paid.
The stereotype that it is a woman's lot to do auxiliary work is well illustrated here.
I had the opportunity to visit several production plants in the food industry in different countries.
These plants are very similar, despite their geographical diversity. The men hold the managerial jobs and the unskilled work on the production line is done by women.
They earn little, they work mechanically in a stupefying rhythm, without any motivation for professional growth, and they work under unfavourable conditions.
This is, of course, wrong.
A great deal of work is still needed to put an end to gender inequality.
We must realise that this area is still not sufficiently covered by statistics and that the gender issue is a relatively new statistical phenomenon.
In the real world, the disadvantages experienced by women in industry, compared with men, are even more noticeable.
However, it is necessary to focus on the issues that the rapporteur rightly designated as priorities: the disadvantages facing women in terms of pay and the fact that there are few women in technical fields that are, in comparison to the significant processing industry, technologically more demanding and better paid.
Women need to be able to gain access to higher education; professional qualifications are of relevance here.
They should also be given the opportunity to return from maternity leave to the labour market, but also to further studies.
This right, of course, applies to men who look after children too.
Some regions of the European Union, particularly in the East, are undergoing changes in the structure of their industries.
These changes are enforcing greater workforce mobility and retraining.
I know about these trends from my own experience, because I come from the industrial part of the Czech Republic, which has been industrialised, and I am aware of their impact, especially on working women.
Another related problem is the transfer of factories to countries outside the European Union, where the workforce is cheaper.
Women's employment is also threatened by the influx of cheap goods from Asia, but also from other countries that produce high volumes of consumer goods for foreign markets, rather than supplying their own market, which does not have the purchasing power.
All these factors have a noticeable influence on the employment of women in industry and their negative consequences should be gradually mitigated.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the statistics tell us that across the European Union there are more men than women in employment in every age group.
This can be due to personal choice or to tradition, but is often the result of discrimination in the workplace.
In addition, on average women earn less than men in every Member State of the European Union.
It is therefore important to use legislative and regulatory means to remind entrepreneurs and employers of their duty to comply fully with the principle of equal treatment, and not just as regards pay.
The issue of the unequal participation of women in industry should be approached rationally, because the branches of industry defined as 'female' may involve less physical and mental effort.
Women could be advised to consider them but that need not imply lower pay.
It is difficult to imagine more men than women being employed in the embroidery industry or more women than men being employed in the smelting industry.
Furthermore, the embroidery industry I referred to as an example may be better paid because of the artistic element involved than the food industry, for instance.
It is important to ensure that men and women receive equal pay across the different areas, and to eliminate exploitation and other unfair practices and conditions from the workplace.
Opportunities for part-time work should be promoted, especially for women, alongside different types of flexibility facilitating retraining and learning.
In my speeches and in the amendments I have tabled I have repeatedly proposed not only that a return to one's job be guaranteed after maternity or parental leave, but also that such maternity or parental leave be classed as time at work, and the relevant monetary payment made in due course.
This would pre-empt low retirement pensions and also help to reduce unemployment.
Above all, it would ensure the proper upbringing and development of children, who are the future of every family and every nation and the future of the European Union.
(FR) Mr President, on reading this report one might be tempted to say 'All quiet on the western front': nothing new, in other words.
The panorama is always the same: the persistence of stereotypes in the choice of educational and professional guidelines, over-representation of women in certain sectors such as the textile industry, the pay gap, working conditions and career prospects. The recommendations never change, however: promoting equality between men and women in professional spheres in terms of pay, their presence on company boards, or developing structures for child care and employment flexibility.
This is fine, but what then?
What exactly is this umpteenth report on women's rights going to change, within or outside the industrial sector?
Despite coercive policies based on 'positive action' - a misleading formulation, since what it really means is compulsory quotas - gender mindsets have great difficulty moving forward.
It is not by imposing structures that may occasionally be unnatural, in the name of the principles of equality and non-discrimination, that women will more naturally take up their role within companies, whatever they may be.
Women do not have such a severe handicap that they must be systematically imposed to be accepted.
Incentive measures must not be coercion measures.
Moreover, when applying the Charter of Fundamental Rights we should not forget that we must also leave all entrepreneurs free to hire whomever they choose, as long as all employees are treated in the same manner, regardless of their sex.
(SK) A higher concentration of textile and clothing industries on which female employment depends is typical for some European regions, and the PreÅ¡ov region in north-east Slovakia is among them.
If we want to preserve work opportunities for women specifically in these disadvantaged regions, where the textile and clothing industries have their own tradition, we must support these industries as a productive industrial sector through suitable measures: creating new programmes focusing, for example, on the presentation and advertising of new products at specialist and international fairs.
The wider application of the Strategic Research Agenda of the European Technological Platform and the need to introduce innovative technology and new business models are, in my opinion, a contribution to the future of the textile and clothing industries.
We all know that despite an increase in the number of females studying technical and scientific subjects, the obstacles they encounter in the workplace result in women abandoning scientific careers in industry.
Given the importance of maintaining a certain standard in education and knowledge, scientific work must be continuous.
In some scientific institutions no provision is made for women to work for part of their working time at home unless they absolutely have to be in the workplace.
The mentality surrounding overtime may be one of the specific barriers.
Those are the reasons why we are registering below average representation of women in high-tech sectors.
Primary responsibility rests with the Member States.
We would therefore ask the relevant national institutions to prepare and introduce policies aimed at reconciling work and private life, to facilitate greater flexibility in working time and to improve the general approach to childcare services.
It is also important to encourage employers - especially of small and medium-sized companies - to make sure that they put these policies and procedures into practice , through effective technical measures and if possible financial support too.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ilda Figueiredo, for her work and our shadow rapporteur, Edit Bauer, through whom we were able to enrich the report by way of our opinions.
I also value highly the opinion of my colleague Mr Dover from the ITRE Committee.
Mr Chairman, in conclusion I would like to bring up one technical issue.
It is very cold in this House during the debates, including today's debate.
The coldness of this Chamber does not create a good working environment for our work as Members and has serious consequences for our health.
I would like to ask you to see to it that the conditions are improved.
(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our policies for industrial development and the manufacturing sectors can help the European economy become a leader in competitiveness, knowledge and sustainability, in line with the Lisbon objectives.
Lisbon stands for growth in employment rates, significant increase in the employment of women, demand for the provision of proper conditions for the employment of female employees, and wide-ranging support for equal opportunities - over and above the positive role of women in the economy.
Equal opportunities must be underpinned in every area of industry: in employment, pay, promotion, the provision of vocational education and training, the availability and monitoring of different forms of flexible work, and the reconciliation of work and private life.
Overall, decent working conditions must be provided for women in industry and proper representation in the organisations whose job it is to safeguard their interests.
These areas do not constitute an exception from the requirements of ensuring gender equality and the principles and practice of gender mainstreaming must be applied consistently here too.
It is important that we have the right information about actual work relations in the many, essentially different sectors of industry and the differences between the sectors themselves.
A wide range of statistical information is required for shaping and drafting strategies and concrete proposals.
Innumerable international management research projects have shown that the special leadership qualities of women can make a big contribution to business success.
Europe must not lose this opportunity.
Thank you.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteurs and those who have been working on this report on the excellent mapping of the current statistics and the current situation in Europe when it comes to women in industry.
Still, one cannot avoid being disappointed, because documents like this have been produced since the 1950s and we still have very little change.
This applies to women in industry, the health situation and health care for women, and to career opportunities, learning opportunities and opportunities to improve their skills, not to mention the situation of the work and family combination.
I would like, therefore, to spend half of my speaking time on questions to the Commission.
Firstly, it is appalling that, after decades, we still have such a bad statistics situation.
This is something where the Commission can really ask for an improvement when it comes to European statistics.
I see that responsibility for this lies mainly with the Commission.
When I was a university teacher 25 years ago, I taught my students about the rules on equal pay deriving from Brussels and from the European Member States at the time.
The cases from the Court (Danfoss I and II) happened more than 25 years ago.
Is it not time for a new regulation with more teeth?
This is also the responsibility of the Commission.
I would also like a mid-term health check when it comes to the roadmap for gender equality, which contains a lot of nice words, but no regulation so far on the horizon.
Fourthly, the Spring Summit will work with the Lisbon resolution.
These issues should be mentioned in March.
And fifthly, when the Commission - and Parliament - arrange seminars with high-level groups, we should apply the same rules as Norway for industrial boards, i.e. the 40:60 percentage.
(PL) Mr President, the role of women in the economy is going to grow if only because of demographic problems.
It is therefore worth giving careful consideration to this issue.
As a Pole, a woman, and a physicist by training, I can state that in my country the average level of education of women is higher than that of men.
Women are also more involved in business in the SME sector.
I have not observed any gender-based discrimination in the scientific world.
Nonetheless, women earn between 15% and 20% less than men do and women's involvement at managerial level in companies is significantly lower than that of men.
In addition, more women than men are in insecure employment.
The result, therefore, is that although training and different ways of improving one's qualifications are important, they are not enough to reduce discrimination.
Female poverty is due not only to low pay, but also to the way pension schemes are devised.
Following the reform of the Polish pension scheme, a provision was introduced whereby pension contributions for persons taking maternity leave and parental leave were financed from the State budget.
This was a great help to women, as pension systems tend to penalise them heavily for motherhood.
The report has noted the need to deal with the matter.
I also attach great importance to considering issues relating to health and safety from a gender-specific point of view, notably as regards burdening women with tasks causing musculoskeletal disorders.
These issues have also been covered in the report.
Mr President, in 1996 an underwear company closed its factory in my constituency.
It left 160 unemployed - almost all women - of middle age, with little or no skills outside the factory. Only 100 of these women managed ever to work again.
The women who found work needed, after 30 years of service in this plant, to begin again at minimum wage, as they had not been given any continuous training and their previous experience went unrecognised.
This factory moved to a less expensive area of the EU and has since moved to Asia.
Companies will continue to relocate for cheaper labour forces, and we need to protect women - particularly in areas like textiles - by offering the opportunity to upskill and by giving continuous education.
I also want to talk briefly about apprenticeships: in Ireland only 5% of women are in apprenticeships.
It is a double problem.
Are they encouraged to become plumbers and carpenters?
Is there not also the problem that, in most areas, apprenticeships have now disappeared?
Apprenticeships themselves were a very good way to pass on information and skills and be recognised for them, and with the loss of apprenticeships we are denying many people - both men and women - the ability to pass on skills and be recognised.
(SK) I would like to stress three key points in relation to this issue.
Employers must learn not to put women in unsuitable jobs or jobs where their abilities are not sufficiently valued.
The European Union institutions must keep an eye on those bodies that are receiving their help to make sure they respect the acquis communautaire.
Even though different opinions exist, society should respect the fact that men and women are different, but at the same time complement each other.
It is the basic principle of life and it should also be the basic principle of the policy on equal opportunities for women and men.
Diversity and compatibility in the job market and in society are fundamental.
The report by Mrs Figueiredo outlines our responsibility in implementing the Lisbon Strategy, in Europe's 'demographic winter'.
The report correctly underlines the health risks and various types of occupational diseases that can be different in men and women.
I fully support the rapporteur in her request for a full analysis of the existing situations and their consequences.
Such analysis must also include the specific impact on motherhood.
Nothing can justify, for the sake of future careers, future mothers being exposed to health risks that can have a negative influence on motherhood.
Equally, it is the responsibility of the industrial sector not to punish women if they want to have children, and the sector should make it possible for them to be able to return to their original position after maternity leave.
(PT) Mr President, the Beijing Platform for Action asserts that, without the active participation of women and the incorporation of women's perspective at all levels of decision-making, the goals of equality, development and peace cannot be achieved.
Furthermore, to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, the participation of women in the labour market needs to be increased.
As women represent 59% of graduates, it is difficult to understand why the majority of new jobs for women are part-time, sometimes insecure and precarious, poorly paid and with few prospects of career progression.
This report by Mrs Figueiredo, whom I congratulate, contains two proposals that I must highlight: the first is the promotion of female entrepreneurship.
Given that 61% of women take account of family circumstances when considering setting up a business, compared with only 49% of men, measures are needed to help reconcile professional with family and private life.
The other proposal concerns long working hours.
It is essential for the Commission to carry out a study into the negative consequences of long working hours, namely the family, personal and social consequences, such as children being left alone for many hours, which often leads to failure at school and crime.
The Member States should also be urged to improve the monitoring of undertakings that force their employees to work beyond the statutory working hours and to impose harsher penalties.
(BG) Madam Commissioner, Mr. President, colleagues, equal participation of women and men on the labour market is a precondition for sustainable economic growth and harmonious social development.
Over the past decades Europe has made considerable progress in promoting gender equality.
The report on the role of women in industry summarizes some of these achievements, while insisting for a stricter application of the principle of equality.
It can regrettably be noted, however, that despite the existing relevant legal framework, a number of EU directives and resolutions remain without proper implementation.
The role of women in industry ought to be based on the principles of equal pay and equal involvement in decision-making.
The labour market situation in Member States shows that women are inconsistently represented in the various sectors.
They account for a large percentage of those employed in the service sectors and are underrepresented in the high-tech area, for example.
Promoting decent jobs is an integral part of the European Union values and Member States need to take effective measures to ensure that standards are met and decent jobs are guaranteed in the various industry sectors.
I believe that we are all faced with the serious challenge of applying a set of policies with a focus of combining work, personal and family life.
European citizens, both women and men, deserve to enjoy equal opportunities and should be equal not just on paper but in real terms.
Thank you.
- (DA) Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for a very relevant report, which focuses on the growing gender inequality in the labour market at a time when we are all promising each other to combat wage discrimination and work towards genuine equality.
Women currently hold the lowest-paid unskilled jobs in industry, and there is a risk that their conditions will deteriorate further if we do not immediately introduce targeted in-service training.
We need to make it compulsory to compile gender-differentiated statistics on both wage levels and the gender balance in the individual sectors.
It is totally unacceptable that we still have such a poor level of knowledge in these areas.
How can we change things if we do not have a clear overview of what the status quo actually is?
We also need to develop an industrial policy that takes account of the gender dimension and the specific challenges women face in terms of pay, childbirth, job insecurity and monotonous, repetitive work.
This should be done in cooperation with the social partners, and the latter must also ensure that women are sufficiently represented in their organisations.
Mr President, the proposal before us deals with a very important issue, one that continues to spark debate globally.
The role of women in industry affects all facets of society and has wide-ranging implications for employment and welfare policy, family and child policy, not to mention economic policy.
Yes, equality legislation ensures women get maternity leave, but all the evidence shows that they expose themselves to promotional and financial discrimination, albeit subtly (to comply with the law) but nonetheless pervasively in an inflexible business culture.
There was an outcry in Ireland in recent weeks when a media accountant made this very point and he was roundly handbagged.
There is no point denying the blindly obvious.
Perhaps this report before us should be subtitled, 'Motherhood and misogyny', as an editorial in the Sunday Tribune at home screamed last week.
We in the European Parliament must endorse the proposal before us - with which I largely agree - because, on the one hand, industry needs women at all levels and, on the other hand, society needs children.
We all - including employers and industrialists - must respect maternity and paternity leave as fundamental social values.
While I still baulk at compulsory quotas for women's participation, albeit in politics or business, my faith in a meritocracy is being sorely tested the older and, hopefully, the wiser I get.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
There might be one or two paragraphs that I have to think about, but I will be supporting her report, and I think it behoves all of us in the House to support a very good report on which an awful lot of work has been done.
(ES) Mr President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur for her work and her open disposition, which has allowed us all to transform the general duty of companies in terms of respect for the principle of equality between working women and men into specific measures.
Her report includes measures to guarantee equal opportunities in terms of access to employment, training and professional promotion; measures to respect women's and men's employment rights, including - and this must be emphasised - protection against sexual harassment; and measures to enhance the reconciliation of personal and family life and employment relations.
Perhaps, however, the most novel contributions have been, firstly, power-sharing measures: this could, for example, produce a balanced number of women and men on company boards and in all decision-making posts in line with the new law introduced in my country, Spain.
Secondly, there is the recommendation that each company implement its own negotiated equality plan.
This makes it a key report for a strategic sector for the European Union.
(FR) Mr President, I welcome the fact that Parliament has taken the initiative of producing this report since, if the role of women in industry is utterly crucial, their professional situation overall remains much more precarious than that of men.
Thus the report points to a considerable number of discriminatory situations involving women that must be tackled immediately, especially their confinement to certain sectors and certain types of jobs with low pay and limited career prospects, their over-representation among atypical employees, particularly those subjected to part-time employment, or the difficulties they encounter in rejoining the labour market after maternity leave.
I feel that one of the courses of action mentioned to rectify this circumstance, the idea of a reward for companies encouraging reconciliation between professional life and family life, is quite interesting, and indeed the improvement of women's career prospects ought to be encouraged by enhancing life-long learning.
I must, however, voice certain regrets as to the format of the report.
I feel that the text is too long and not properly structured, and this impairs its readability and effectiveness.
(RO) The report may create the impression that we are talking about the absence of women in industry.
This is indeed one of its topics.
However, what the report emphasises is the presence of women in industry: women have low-paid jobs in low-paid industry branches, they are in the majority where there are no trade unions, and consequently no guarantees under collective agreements; women work in vulnerable industry branches, and they are the first to be laid off in the event of mass redundancy.
Women are present at the workplace, but they are nowhere to be seen in management.
They only get to do the work; they don't get to decide.
This report talks about what is missing, but it also talks about the things that women have.
Women have an education, but hold no qualifications; they suffer from occupational diseases which are not recognised as such; they are willing to learn after they've turned forty, but they have no opportunity to do so.
They are mothers, but there are no nurseries available.
Men become parents and have no nurseries either, but they have their wives.
What is to be done?
Existing regulations, our reports, the Commission's roadmap on gender mainstreaming, all these show that we know what should be done.
What we and the Commission should remember, and most importantly what we should remind Member States of, is that citizens, especially women, do not judge our efficiency by the number of decisions we pass, but by our ability and will to enforce them.
And the latter seem to be lacking.
(PL) Madam President, only between 14% and 25% of working women in the European Union are employed in industry.
In addition, their participation in different sectors of industry is uneven, due to the stereotypes affecting educational and professional choices.
Women are employed mainly in the textile, clothing, footwear, food and food processing sectors, where pay is generally low.
Women are significantly under-represented in the more highly-paid advanced technology sectors.
The Member States should develop programmes aimed at educating women and fostering their entrepreneurial spirit.
They should also offer financial support for such programmes.
In addition, incentives should be provided for women working in industry to improve their qualifications on a regular basis.
Every Member State has a duty to comply with the principle of equal pay, to provide dignified working conditions and the opportunity to develop a professional career, while at the same time respecting social values such as motherhood and fatherhood.
Compliance with social standards such as the right to safety, social protection and freedom of association will help to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women in the workplace.
Finally, I should like to congratulate Mrs Figueiredo on a very well-prepared report.
(SL) What we are saying about women in industry could equally be said of women in business and health care.
By nature men and women have different physical abilities and therefore some work is more suited to women and some more suited to men.
However, in cases where the quality of work and effectiveness are not dependent on physical strength, it is not permissible for women to be paid less than their male colleagues.
Moreover, it is precisely female occupations that are automatically less well paid as it is, even though they are by no means easy and require a great deal of effort.
We have heard our fellow Member who said that we adopted similar reports on the inequalities of women 30 years ago.
Why has nothing changed?
Or why is change very slow?
Or are businesses guilty of this?
I believe that we must clearly identify the guilty parties and make a responsible and more decisive effort to ensure that the situation in this area finally takes a more positive direction for women.
(RO) When talking about women in industry, we should also be talking about education, research, and entrepreneurship.
In the Committee on Women's Rights we've had a presentation from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy concerning the role of women in industry.
15% of people with higher education are women.
In 2006, women made up 33% of the total number of European researchers and only 18% of researchers operating in the private sector.
However, it should be emphasised that only 28% of women researchers have children.
Wages are higher in industry, particularly in the oil and chemicals industries, transport, electricity, and the automotive industry.
However, throughout Europe there is a gender gap as far as payment is concerned (roughly 20% in corporate management and 19% in engineering/science).
34% of women working in industry have children and we should stress that only 20% of industrial entrepreneurs are women.
Therefore, we should concern ourselves more with women's education and training and in particular with child-care facilities.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to thank Members of for a very interesting discussion, and will take this opportunity to answer some of their questions.
In reply to Ms Figueiredo, it is true that the Equal programme finishes in 2008, but the European Social Fund Regulation for 2007-2013 incorporates gender equality as a horizontal priority.
In reply to Ms Bauer, we had the first reading of the important legislation issue you mentioned - the transferability of pension rights - in June 2007, and the EPSCO Council dealt with it in December 2007.
We hope to make quick progress during 2008.
In reply to Ms JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki - I realise that she is not in the Chamber, but her question was very important, so I would like to answer it - the Commission adopted, in July 2007, the communication on 'Tackling the pay gap between men and women'.
In that communication, the Commission announced that in 2008 it would examine the relevance of current legislation from the point of view of the relevance of legal instruments with regard to the causes of the pay gap and, where necessary, propose amendments to the Community legal framework.
Following this examination the Commission could propose any necessary changes to the current legal framework.
In reply to Ms Romeva i Rueda, anti-discrimination and gender equality legislation does not preclude Member States from developing and implementing positive actions.
The Commission supports there being a higher proportion of women in decision-making.
We will create a network of women in decision-making posts, probably during 2008.
In reply to Ms FlasarovÃ¡, we cannot prevent companies from delocalising, but we have instruments to tackle that issue.
In 2007, the European Globalisation Fund was quite promptly set up for this purpose.
In reply to Ms Ek, concerning statistics, the Commission continues to cooperate with Eurostat to develop specific statistics on equality.
The Dublin Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions takes into account gender equality in its regular reports.
In 2009, there will be a regular publication on the research statistics on women.
In reply to Mrs Doyle, concerning maternity leave, the Commission is to prepare an impact evaluation on possible legislative measures introducing new forms of leave - adoption leave, and leave to care for family members other than children.
rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, I firstly want to thank my fellow Members and also the Commissioner for their words today and for their contributions which have enabled this debate to assume even greater consequence.
However, as others have already done, I must also of course call for further practical measures to be taken.
These proposals that we have made must be felt on the ground, in the lives of undertakings, female workers and families, because it is not acceptable, as various people have said here today, that 30 years after a directive provided for equal pay, we still have this clear disparity of 30% between the average wages of men and women working in industry.
This figure is double the average wage difference in the European Union.
We cannot therefore allow this situation to continue for a further 30 years and that is why I call on the Commission, and also the Member States, to take concrete measures.
These could be legislative or they could involve better monitoring, but they must ensure increased promotion of equal rights and opportunities and increased promotion of this objective which must be put into practice through education and training.
We must also fight stereotyping, as highlighted here today, and we must ensure that the organisation of working hours, working time and jobs better responds to women's rights, and also to the right to maternity and paternity which are recognised as fundamental social values of the European Union.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing - (HU) I welcome this important report and would stress that women in particular suffer from occupational illnesses.
One new study mentions that in the EU 140 000 people, three and a half percent in this context, die every year as a result of occupational illness, and one of the main causes is chemicals.
And chemicals are implicated in 86% of cancer-related occupational illnesses.
An important point here is that women, who generally live longer than men, are, as a group, more sensitive to chemicals and more vulnerable, as chemicals gradually build up in their adipose tissue and can be transferred to their unborn children.
So we need to have a properly thought out European strategy to minimise the occurrence of occupational illnesses and the number of deaths and give women maximum protection.
in writing. - (FR) Although the report on the role of women in industry rightly emphasises the many difficulties facing women in the labour market and certain economic sectors, the proposals in the text raise two questions.
Firstly, the report appears to neglect the boundaries of the legislator's action.
Europe's legal arsenal is currently one of the world's most lavish in terms of women's rights and gender equality.
Therefore, it is up to the elected representatives and the citizens to ensure respect for the rights of women in the European Union.
In consequence, the usefulness of an umpteenth declaration of intent is somewhat limited.
Secondly, the report contains one proposal that is, to say the least, curious indeed: suggesting that a quota of women on boards of private companies ought to be established by law points to a serious attack on individual liberties and does women little service.
Treating women in a fashion that is closer to charity than equality tends to exclude them even more from certain sectors of society.
Our fellow citizens now expect us to support them by matching our words with actions.
in writing. - The Lisbon targets set in 2000 will certainly not be achieved by 2010 as originally intended.
The current gender structures and attitudes play an important role in this failure.
Europe is not adequately using the potential of the half of its population.
Women do not have equal opportunities for achievement in the high-value-added industry.
Moreover, women are not adequately represented in social dialogue.
Neither employers' organisations nor the trade unions and the public sector have enough women in high-level positions.
It is remarkable and alarming that the future of work and the future of society are decided by the half of the population which does not take equal responsibility for raising the children and maintaining the household.
Increasingly, antisocial measures such as increasing unreported overtime and uncompensated flexibility of workers are used to increase productivity.
The price we pay for this illusory increase is too high.
The Member States should significantly increase the emphasis on gender equality in social dialogue.
Simultaneously, many Member States should strengthen the role which social dialogue has in setting the policy.
Women have the highest potential to accelerate the development of our high-tech industry.
Europe must use it.
Second Internet Governance Forum, held in Rio de Janeiro from 12 to 15 November 2007 (debate)
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the results of the Internet Governance Forum held in Rio de Janeiro last November.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the idea of an Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was born at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis in November 2005 and defined as a non-binding forum for multi-stakeholder policy discussion.
The Commission supports the Forum in this form.
Two meetings have been held so far: in 2006 in Athens and 2007 in Rio.
The Commission welcomes the forum in each form.
The Commission also welcomes the participation of Parliament at the forum and is grateful for the excellent cooperation on both meetings.
As in the previous year, the meeting in Rio provided an excellent framework for enriching exchanges which allowed the gathering of a range of views on the relevant issues.
Therefore, the Commission sees value in upholding the main characteristics of the forum, notably the participation of the various stakeholders and its non-binding nature.
I would like also to thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to say something more concrete on the IGF (we have adopted this abbreviation) which took place in November in Rio de Janeiro.
Firstly I would like to thank very much Ms Trautmann, Mr Harbour, Mr Badia i Cutchet and Mr HÃ¶kmark, who represented Parliament at this meeting, for their active participation and for the continuation of their excellent cooperation.
This allowed us - this year again - together to highlight a number of European priorities such as freedom of speech, bridging the digital divide, security and child protection on-line.
It is important for Europe to bring such issues to the forefront of the international agenda on a constant basis.
The Commission supports the IGF.
This concept, elaborated during the World Summit on the Information Society, is still very valuable, and all the issues which have been mentioned are very much in favour of what we are trying to step up as actions in this particular field.
In fact, on a broad range of internet-relevant subjects, the number of participants - around 3 100 - clearly demonstrates that there is indeed interest in having such a place for discussions.
The fact that there is no negotiated text as an outcome of the Forum should be seen as a strength rather than as a weakness of the process.
The Forum allows for open exchange, without the pressure of defending a particular outcome in a binding document.
This can serve as a basis for improving understanding of each other's concerns and can pave the way for finding common solutions.
Dynamic coalitions stemming from the Forum are, in fact, one example that the IGF can work as a platform where people who share common interests can further cooperate.
Thus, the Rio Internet Governance Forum meeting again provided an excellent framework for enriching exchanges, which allowed a range of views on relevant issues to be gathered.
I would also like to thank once again Members and hope we will continue our excellent cooperation, because this is one of the most promising areas for our future work.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, it is important to underline the rapid change that use of the internet and ICT has brought about, not only for individual societies, but also for the world.
In all sectors of societies, the impact of the internet has changed patterns and opportunities.
This is important in order to keep a perspective for the future, because the strength of the internet has been its independent nature, its opportunities and its ability to adapt to different opportunities and demands in societies, based on a number of different actors and operators.
It is important because, when we look to the future, we must ensure that it can be used in order to bridge rifts between countries and people, and help to fight poverty and support development - it is of crucial importance for the Millennium Goals, for example.
The emergence of new technology should also be used to ensure that it is easier for more people to use the internet, in more societies.
We in the European Union have three important things to focus on.
First of all, we should ensure we are committed to, and support, the IGF process and its independent and non-binding character.
That is of deep importance, because it is a good process which is much more dynamic when it is independent and non-binding.
Secondly, we should contribute to the preparations for the next IGF in New Delhi, and ensure that we hold discussions with parliamentarians and civil society in order to underline its independence, but also the opportunities.
Thirdly, we should ensure that the internet is guaranteed freedom and freedom of expression.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Second Internet Governance Forum was held in Rio from 12 to 15 November last year, and was attended by 2 100 people from all five continents representing interested Internet parties from all public and private sectors.
The forum provides a favourable context in which to seek solutions to future ICT problems.
Through a common culture and a partnership format, it provides the decisions to be taken at future world summits on the information society, in addition to those to be taken by our own states.
It also provides the opportunity to hold an open reflection on the complex nature of the Internet and make timely provision for its technical, ethical and legal limitations, since there are major concerns in addition to the issues close to EU hearts: reducing the digital divide, freedom of expression on the web, cultural diversity and child protection. I could also RFID, radio frequency identification, in short, the formation of an Internet of things, the risks of network overload by 2010-2012, digitalisation, particularly of cultural goods, the consequences arising in terms of the protection of intellectual property and, above all, improvement of access to ICT for less developed countries.
Europe is certainly up to speed in terms of the legislative process.
This is encouraging for us as Europeans, but we must not slacken off.
Many of these legal or regulatory issues are likewise improved with the review of the Telecom Package.
In this respect, I would call for a new phase of targeted political and future-oriented work, notably through the creation of a European IGF involving the national parliaments and local authorities: a European forum implemented by 2009 and perhaps a world forum in Europe thanks to Lithuania's application for 2010.
As delegation head, I wish to thank all Members, colleagues and officials for their work and their availability.
The resolution we will be voting on constitutes a roadmap.
I am pleased it enjoys the support of all of the groups in Parliament.
More parliamentary committees are welcome to lend their weight to this course of action, and I would like to thank the Commission and ask its Members to lend their support to Mrs Reding.
Finally, I would like to ask the Council to include in its agenda relations with India and preparations for the New Delhi forum, and I would urge all Member States to participate in enhanced cooperation.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, among other items, the public service value of the internet was discussed in Rio de Janeiro on 13 November 2007.
Nowadays, the most limited asset of European citizens is time, and it is vital for the governments of the Member States to introduce public services on the internet.
My home country, Estonia, has done much in this field: e-voting, e-tax declarations, e-government and e-registry office are only a few examples of successful 'e'-projects that could be implemented across Europe.
I know that it is much easier to reform a small country, where approximately 66% of the inhabitants use the internet.
However, moving public services to the internet is worth the effort.
One of the prerequisites for the functioning of democracy is participation.
'E'-solutions provide the possibility of participation with minimal effort: there are no queues or officials exercising the right of discretion.
The internet gives citizens more independence and ensures impartial administration of their affairs.
However, it is essential to start such education from an early stage in schools.
On the other hand, computer literacy has succeeded where Esperanto failed - it has become the most universal language - and efforts should be made not only to bridge the digital gap at regional and global levels, but bearing in mind the different age groups and social strata.
Last but not least, the European Parliament often seems to occupy itself with producing immense volumes of paper.
Why not upgrade our tools of democracy and implement paperless administration?
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the Internet is rather like a knife.
A knife may be used to slice our daily bread but it may also be used to kill.
It is hard to imagine the contemporary world without the Internet, and our working lives without the Internet, but the Internet is also abused, for example by paedophiles.
The European Union therefore acted wisely in setting child protection on the Internet as a priority for the last Internet Governance Forum held in Brazil two months ago.
We should strive to combine openness and maximum access to the Internet with safety not only for children but anyone else who might be as risk as a result of Internet abuse.
It is significant that the next Internet Governance Forum will be held in Delhi, the capital of India.
India is a country that has become a leader in information science, despite being relatively poor.
It services global enterprises thus enabling hundreds of thousands of people to improve their standard of living.

Two proposals appear worthy of support: the first is for an Internet Governance Forum to be organised in two years' time in one of the new Member States, Poland for example, or perhaps Lithuania; the second is to consider creating an Internet Governance Forum of our own, I mean our own European forum, not a world forum.
The European Parliament has a vital role to play in this regard.
Clearly, Internet access in the Member States of the Union varies considerably.
In my country, Poland, it is not very extensive, largely for financial reasons.
The European Union should act to ensure that access is comparable, especially in rural areas.
Madam President, I would like to join with Ms Trautmann - and I think I am speaking for all my other colleagues as well - in expressing my gratitude to the Parliament Presidency for having enabled us to go as an official delegation.
This was a fact well noted by the many participants.
We were the most active of all the political delegations there, and there were more European parliamentarians than any others.
However, we are now seeing signs that other parliaments are looking at the Internet Governance Forum and realising they need to engage with it, because it addresses crucial public policy matters on which they need to be involved.
The speeches given by my colleagues have covered a number of the issues.
I would just like to make some broad observations about how I see the process evolving, particularly because I am the only Member of this Parliament to have attended both the world summits on the information society, and have also been through the process from the very beginning.
There is a feeling that the forum in Rio is now starting to come up with much more practical ideas, and people are beginning to realise the value of exchanging information and best practice from around the globe.
That is based on an understanding that it is not actually going to be formal, international, legal structures that are going to deliver many of the benefits we are looking for.
In fact, we are going to have to deal with many of these matters through intergovernmental cooperation, and in many cases through cooperation between voluntary or non-governmental organisations.
In the case, for example, of child protection, which the previous speaker referred to, the most successful initiatives have been those carried out by voluntary-based organisations - such as, in my country - the Internet Watch Foundation.
It was very important to actually talk to people about such organisations.
I will close by giving you a clear example, at a broader level, of the value of such interchanges.
I participated in a workshop on consumer protection data breach notification, which is about to be discussed in Parliament as part of European legislation.
I have a whole dossier on what has been done in other counties, and would say to the Commission that their proposal is currently extremely weak and would benefit greatly from its looking at that information.
This is the sort of practical benefit we can derive from such forums, and I am sure we in this Parliament will be able to contribute to the development of the agenda for the next forum, to make it even more effective.
(ES) Madam President, I feel that the Commissioner and all of us who have spoken today agree on the importance and the social and political impact of these forums, which are being attended in increasing numbers.
For this reason I feel we must congratulate ourselves on the commitment we are making in Europe.
I also feel, however, that we ought to avail ourselves of the political opportunity at this time, as Mrs Trautmann said, to reflect on the new Telecommunications Package, and in that sense I think that both the Commission and Parliament must make every effort not just to offer the people of Europe access to the best digital services, but also to spearhead the extension of the information society as a social commodity to countries that are in need of European cooperation and leadership.
In this sense, I feel that what has been said here is extremely important: we must work on common problems such as sensitivity, freedom of expression on the Internet and protection, priority issues in my view.
At the present time I think it is vital - and I will end here, Madam President - that we make global issues compatible with local issues.
I believe that this is a priority, and so the posture set out in the resolution we will be adopting today is relevant: I trust it will be sufficient incentive for the Commission to continue to include these priorities in its political agenda.
(NL)Madam President, I was not in Rio, but I was at the first conference in Athens, and there I saw the importance of the formula of the forum.
In this forum stakeholders can explore together the limits that are very important and that will probably be applied in global relations later and also translated into EU regulations.
There are some quite difficult issues behind this dialogue.
I am thinking of the domain names, the icon and the American influence on this.
The idea behind it is that we feel that it is extremely important that the world wide web should continue to have a genuinely global, unambiguous approach.
That is why it is important to see that signals from this debate reappear again in the new approach to the icon and that the ideas of partners are taken on board.
Madam President, I would like to throw some light on one particular aspect today.
I very much support a European forum, a European interpretation of the forum for internet governance for the future, ideally before the 2009 elections.
What we have to do is to make sure that we also bring our national parliaments on board in the debates.
From the initiatives in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, you can see that these are live issues; given their importance for the future, for employment and welfare, as well as for freedom of information and participation, it is essential that we bring the national parliaments on board with other stakeholders in a European approach.
I am appealing to the Commission: I read in the files that it does not have enough instruments or funds to support one thing and another, to choose a different line of approach.
There is plenty of money.
Look in i2010, look in the programmes for research, etc. I would really like to a very generous position to be adopted in order to establish the European view of these problems even more clearly before the 2009 elections.
(SK) Thank you, Madam Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this interesting debate.
I strongly support the idea to establish forums on Internet governance with the participation of Members of the European Parliament.
The Internet is today an unavoidable component of the life of European citizens regardless of their age.
However, in disadvantaged regions it is almost impossible to get a fast Internet connection.
With envy I often watch advertisements in our Slovak public and private media for Internet with four times the speed and its advantages.
Where I live we do not have this advantage and our real options are limited only to local sources with insufficient speed.
Commissioner Kuneva, what can the Commission do to make sure that the disadvantaged regions and the people who live there will not be forgotten, to make sure that these people have an equal opportunity to participate in the digital world?
Madam President, I just wanted to say one thing.
I would like to thank Ms Trautmann, who led the delegation to Rio and did it in a very good way.
I did not mention that in my first intervention, but I think it is important to state.
We all found her to be a very good leader.
I would just like that to be noted.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me start with the next steps, which are more concrete.
Following the Rio meeting, consultations will be held in Geneva next month to collect views on the outcome of Rio and the preparation for the next meeting in New Delhi.
The Commission participates in the advisory group which assists the UN Secretary-General in the preparation of the IGF.
As has been our practice since the World Summit on the Information Society, we will of course inform Members of the outcome of this meeting.
I would now like to answer some of the specific questions raised by MEPs, starting with Ms Trautmann.
We welcome the fact that Ms Trautmann addressed, in her speech at the opening session, the issue of the 'Internet of Things' and the possibility of bringing this up at the IGF next year.
With regard to the second part of Ms Trautmann's speech, regional IGFs have emerged in a number of places, and this appears to be a useful way to focus on questions of internet governance that are of particular importance for a specific region.
The Commission strongly supports this idea.
Moving on to Mr Savi, we could not agree more with his statement, and this is why the Commission is committed to the development of the e-application with the broad programmes and legislation.
To Mr Czarnecki, the Commission is committed to all the initiatives on child protection.
We promoted the item on the IGF agenda and we are about to propose a renewed programme on child protection on the internet.
To conclude the debate, I have received one motion for a resolution, signed by six political groups, pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.)

- After the vote on Amendment 62:
(DE) Mr President, now that Parliament in its infinite wisdom has adopted compromise Amendment 62, Amendment 61 as proposed by the ALDE Group is now superfluous and is therefore withdrawn.

- Before the vote on Amendment 3:
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I just wanted to ask Mr Tannock if the addition he is proposing is in fact an addition, or whether his aim is to remove the section on violence and ill-treatment in police custody and penitentiary institutions.
If his amendment is to be an addition, I can of course support it.
If, however, he wishes part of the existing text to be deleted, I can only recommend that we vote against it.
(FR) It is an addition.
Thank you.
- Before the vote on Amendment 7:
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, in paragraph 32 we repeat the two conditions, i.e. territorial integrity and self-determination, even though they are already mentioned in paragraph 30.
However, the author of the amendment has added 'self-determination of the people who live there'.
I strongly recommend that we delete the words 'of the people who live there' because that would exclude the refugees and persons displaced in their own country.
Therefore, if the author of the amendment agrees to delete those few words, I will be able to support the amendment; otherwise, I recommend that we reject it.
Mr President, I have agreed to that change to the oral amendment.
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
- Before the vote on Amendment 8/rev:
Mr President, as we agreed at the beginning of the session, it will be an addition now.
In the actual text it says to replace the words 'in the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline' with the words 'in the trans-Caspian energy corridor projects'.
But by negotiation at the beginning of the voting session, I have already agreed this should be an addition rather than a replacement, so can we include the words 'in the trans-Caspian energy corridor projects'.

Kenya (vote)
- Before the vote:
Mr President, since we formulated this resolution, some important changes have taken place in Kenya.
Yesterday, the newly-elected Parliament - and according to all observers the elections to the Parliament were pretty honest - elected a new speaker. The speaker is from the opposition.
We view that as an encouraging sign, and I would therefore like to propose an oral amendment, in the form of a new paragraph reading as follows: 'Welcomes the fact that the newly-elected Parliament showed its independence by the election of Mr Kenneth Marende as its speaker, and underlines the decisive role to be played by that Parliament in restoring civil liberties in Kenya'.
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
6. (
- Before the vote on Amendment 39:
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, this oral amendment is supported by female Members from five political groups and also by one male Member.
It aims to amend the first part as follows: 'Stresses the need to retrain those women who have had to stop their career, to enhance their employability' and then continues 'calls on the Member States to increase life-long learning possibilities'.
This is the amendment that we are tabling.

Explanations of vote
I would like to make the following proposal for the voting: we shall begin with the explanations of vote and then suspend the sitting at 1 p.m..

(Parliament approved the proposal)
Explanations of vote
Mr President, I have to say that on this particular measure, I voted against.
While Mr Cashman is a very charming gentleman, I must say that whenever I see anything with his name on it, I do look on it with some degree of scepticism.
The issue here is that we have a European Fundamental Rights Agency as if there were no such protection for human rights in the Member States.
I question whether there is any need for this institution at European level.
Is it not just a case of extending bureaucracy and creating new quangos, as we call them in Britain?
This is a burden on the taxpayer which, in the view of many others, will not actually contribute to human rights.
Furthermore, in the absence of the constitution which we were promised, which you are now proposing to drive through without a referendum, there is no basis for it.
Mr President, I voted against this report because the United Kingdom already respects human rights.
It is a signatory to many international agreements; it does not need to be told how to behave by an EU that has overridden the results of the French and the Dutch referendums, which were perfectly constitutional.
They rejected the Constitution.
It has been replaced by an equivalent Treaty that has now been approved even before it has been seen in full by those who signed it.
The EU clearly has no respect for democratic rights and cannot therefore be considered a safe or reliable custodian of human rights.
Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to explain my vote.
This is the first time I have done such a thing.
I voted against this proposal because, whilst the committee in question may be called the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, it does not offer liberties to civilians, it does not offer justice, and it interferes in home affairs.
We in Britain were promised a referendum. We are not going to get one.
What is the European Union going to do about that?
Mr President, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to explain my vote on this important issue.
You may not be aware of this, but I represent the constituency of London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world.
What one needs to understand is that London is actually a pretty diverse city.
Let me explain: we already have 300 languages and 14 religions and, on the whole, we get along very well.
So, the EU could actually learn a lot from London and how it has ensured human rights and that people's dignity is respected.
We do not need those issues to be resolved at EU level.
What could London, the most diverse city in Europe - and perhaps even in the world - learn from this institution?
What could it learn about human rights?
What could it learn about fundamental rights?
Absolutely nothing!
