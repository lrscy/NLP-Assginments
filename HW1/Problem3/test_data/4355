Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  The recent floods in central and eastern European countries clearly showed that, more than ever, an effective and rapid solidarity-based response of the European Union to this type of major crisis is required.
Due to the recurrence of such events, it is of the utmost importance that the solidarity instrument should allow for appropriate EU level response to major crises.
As with the instruments that are currently available, it is extremely difficult to react properly, as illustrated by recent events.
I warmly welcome our rapporteurâs approach, which argues that the Solidarity Fund must be adapted to new challenges and that there is potential for improvement in the way it is used.
Major natural disasters within the Union can cause significant human, economic and environmental damages as well as it can affect more than just one European country.
We must ensure that effective and targeted Community action is possible in areas where public opinion expects the Community to act.
In this respect, we must also ensure that fundâs financial resources match its geographically and thematically enlarged scope of application.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would ask that Amendment 7 to paragraph 1, in which a proposal has been made to add 'in particular in China, Belarus, Cuba and North Koreaâ, also include the words: âColombia, Turkey and Tunisiaâ.
Paragraph 1 would therefore become the following: âis concerned at the high number of journalists being convicted worldwide, in particular in China, Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Colombia, Turkey and Tunisia'.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to request a roll-call vote on the motion for a resolution.
Â Â  . â This proposal was the result of a consensus and a combination of various contributions, and I should like to make an addendum, which has emerged from the consensus between the main political families in Parliament, in order to make this point more precise.
I shall now read the addendum: âcalls for this programme to be reflected tangibly in the individualisation of funding for appropriate actions aimed at preventing the risks of forest fires, either via the creation of a specific regulation with appropriate funding, or via the individualisation of a budgetary heading devoted to such actions within EAFRD or the LIFE+ draft regulation.â
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to request a roll-call vote on the final resolution.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am sorry, but you are speaking so quickly that the interpreters are translating too unclearly for us to understand.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . This report represents Parliamentâs position on the Communityâs strategic orientations for the cohesion policy for 2007-2013.
As substitute for the Committee on Regional Development and permanent Member and shadow rapporteur on this report for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I have made firm calls for European economic growth and competitiveness to be decentralised and shifted away from the centre of the Community area to cover all regions, in particular those less wealthy.
I also feel that these regions will only be able to make a decisive contribution towards creating sustainable employment and towards economic growth in the EU if the existing financial measures specially created to offset the negative effects on regional economies, the dispersion, small size and distance from the European mainland of the outermost regions are stepped up.
In other words, I believe that a better and more effective Union requires better policies and more resources, with a view to sustainable development, which will in turn contribute towards economic and territorial cohesion, the primary objective of cohesion policy, as enshrined in the Treaties.
I therefore voted in favour of the Krehl report.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs proposal on the Communityâs strategic guidelines for 2007-2013 â on the basis of which the Member States will define their Structural Fund operational programmes â leaves no room for doubt as to the way in which the cohesion policy will be subordinate to the funding of the âLisbon Strategyâ and to the interests of Europeâs captains of industry.
Among other objectives, competitiveness, privatisation, reducing the public sector and the role of the State in the economy, public-private partnerships, support for the infrastructure of recently privatised sectors and flexibility of the labour market have become objectives of the pseudo-policy of âcohesionâ.
The consequences of the change of priority of the Funds â relegating âeconomic and social cohesionâ â is much more significant than it might first appear, even though some concerns do emerge as to whether this will be to the detriment of 'cohesion'.
Originally, the report clearly rejected the idea that a minimum of 60% of the amounts of the Structural Fund for convergence regions (75% for the others) must be earmarked for funding the objectives of the âLisbon Strategy', and that that criterion had been accepted via Parliament's adoption of the interinstitutional agreement.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  . â As the elected representative of a French region that has been particularly affected by unemployment and relocations â the Nord-Pas de Calais â I clearly approve of the ambition stated in the report, which is one of supporting growth and employment.
European regional policy, however, cannot fulfil those objectives.
In 2000, the cantons of French Hainault already lost the structural funds allocated under Objective 1.
Between 2007 and 2013, European regional expenditure will increase by 31% but, as a result of the unprepared-for enlargement, the proportion allocated to French regions will decrease further.
Above all, European regional aid does not call into question the policy of the Europe of Brussels without borders, a policy which, while shackling our businesses and our farmers with increasingly binding directives, abandons them to unfettered competition from countries such as China, which practise a genuine form of social dumping.
Almost one year ago, the people of France and the Netherlands said âNoâ to this Europe of economic stagnation and social regression.
Only another kind of Europe, founded on the sovereignty of its nations and on free cooperation, will enable our countries to benefit from genuine economic and social growth.
Â Â  . I voted for the Krehl report on the Community strategic guidelines on the basis that it goes some way in attempting to inject a more social and environmental side to the Commission's proposed strategic guidelines and because it supports sound partnership between all parties and the strengthening of civil society.
However, this vote should not imply acceptance of every word of the report.
I have grave concerns about the inclusion in Ms. Krehl's report of a call for the Commission to promote the use of Public-Private Partnerships and about the absence of a specific rejection of earmarking and the thinking behind that approach.
Â Â  . The idea of grouping resources and guidelines aimed at developing countries, countries in transition and industrialised countries into one single instrument, and the subsequent regulation thereof in accordance with their geopolitical and economic ârolesâ, is one that we find alarming.
We are particularly concerned at the excessive prominence attached to the economic and business dimension that the rapporteur has sought to include in the regulation.
What is thus being promoted is a development policy in which the EUâs economic and geo-strategic interests take precedence over the interests of the countries with which it establishes relations.
What is more, âcooperation with international financial institutionsâ is being proposed, demonstrating the support for the policy of structural reforms and adjustments promoted by those institutions.
This is seen, for example, in the plundering of the natural resources and the wealth of many countries, in the exploitation of the work force, and in the privatisation of essential goods and services, such as water, health and social security.
Attempts are being made, in a somewhat underhand manner, to export and intensify capitalist exploitation and the current neoliberal model under the cloak of âconsolidation of the rule of lawâ and âgood governanceâ.
The set of general priorities and principles being established gives us the greatest concern with regard to the set of âsimplified regulationsâ to follow.
Â Â  . This report on Financing Development and Economic Cooperation actions by the EU has been the subject of much debate.
As draftsman for the INTA Committee, I have worked with colleagues to ensure that the future shape of this instrument reflects the progressive gains made by the European Parliament over the years in terms of poverty alleviation and empowerment.
I believe the Parliament was right to reject the original 2004 proposals which prevented the Parliament from establishing priorities and allocating funds to concrete programmes.
We were also right to reject an open-ended instrument which would prevent Parliament from fully co-determining, on a regular basis, the objectives, scope and methods to be employed by the different instruments.
I am glad to see we have achieved breakthroughs on review and expiry clauses to allow for better modifications and reporting.
I firmly believe that, as the legislative authority, the European Parliament must continue to have a role both in the setting of priorities and through a call-back arrangement.
Our citizens, who have mandated us to set policies and scrutinise the executive, expect no less.
Â Â  . The practical outcome of the vote on this report is that there is indeed divergence between Parliament â in the guise of the Committee on Development â and the Commission on the financial instruments for the purposes of economic cooperation and development.
It is therefore important for us to deal with what we believe to be the final outcome of this debate.
Rather than the issue of whether there are one or two instruments, depending on whether the countries involved are industrialised or not, the important thing is that the EU ought to be aware of its financial limitations â all too evident in the next financial framework â and must therefore set out clear priorities and criteria for action.
Given that it is impossible to attend to all situations, the priority regions and programmes need to be identified.
This, rather than the number of programmes, is the crucial question.
Furthermore, international cooperation is not an exercise in competition between possible world powers.
More than anything, it must be a coherent expression of an external policy that respects values, principles and priorities.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted against MrÂ Berendâs report, in spite of the fact that it was an excellent report.
I voted against it because, while we have extended the scope of the Solidarity Fund â which now includes everything from industrial disasters to terrorist attacks â we have narrowed down its regional scope, and in particular, we did not extend it to areas situated in potential Member States, in regions adjacent to the territory of current Member States.
We have excluded from it the entire Western Balkan region, which I find very regrettable, because if the Danube floods, the Solidarity Fund will assist Romania and Hungary, but it will not assist Serbia and Vojvodina.
This is entirely unacceptable and contrary to the permanent requirement of considering the neighbouring Western Balkan regions as potential Member States.
This is a concrete situation where selfishness has already won.
Â Â  . The Portuguese members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament abstained from the vote on the report on the EUâs Solidarity Fund because, although this Fund is an instrument of the highest importance for the policy of European solidarity, it did not undergo the necessary reforms to make it more effective and workable in terms of its objectives.
On the other hand, despite the fact that the proposals aimed at including drought in the report before us were incorporated, some of which we had tabled, insufficient attention is paid to the phenomena of extreme drought and high temperatures, to the natural disasters that have lain waste to a number of European countries, especially in southern Europe.
As they develop slowly, these phenomena are rarely perceptible over a short space of time.
These proposals also state that the removal of the regional criterion from the scope of the regulation, only appearing as a public criterion, is clearly inadequate.
This amendment was a waste of time in terms of the objective of recovering the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the affected areas, with the support of this instrument.
We should like to emphasise the fact that, in spite of everything, some progress was made in relation to the doctrine, and that, accordingly, its particular character was acknowledged.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, MrÂ Berend, on the proposal for a regulation, at first reading, of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund.
It was becoming urgent to reform the Fund, which was created in 2002 and which has sole responsibility for dealing exclusively with natural disasters, in order to enlarge its scope, to simplify the way in which it is used from the point of view of emergencies and, lastly, to prevent misuse.
Not only the major climate, industrial and technological changes, but also terrorism, health risks and so on were making it crucial for the European Union to provide its citizens and the Member States with access to a tool that is capable of coping with a disaster that would render a Member State, on its own, powerless.
The reform of this Fund is a crucial safety element in todayâs risk society.
Â Â  . Some of the proposals that we tabled were unfortunately rejected, which were as follows:
- maintaining the eligibility of regional disasters in the Solidarity Fund; and
- the possibility of higher levels of financial assistance from the Solidarity Fund â 75% rather than 50% of the total eligible costs â for âcohesionâ countries and for âconvergenceâ regions.
I should like to say that the same European Parliament adopted on the same day, in the Quecedo report, the recital stating that âthe EUSF should continue to enable action to be taken in the case of disasters which although significant do not achieve the minimum level required and that assistance may also be provided in special circumstances in cases where most of the population in a specific region has been affected by a disaster which will have a serious, long-term effect on their living conditionsâ.
This contradiction between the content of the adopted resolutions â legislative and non-legislative â is highly significant.
In other words, when it comes to stating good intentions â such as in the âQuecedoâ report â the majority in Parliament approves, but when it comes to making the execution and the funding of those intentions a reality â such as in the Berend report â the majority in Parliament turns its back, rejecting the regional dimension of the Fund and clearly benefiting the large countries, with their majority representation in Parliament.
Â Â  . I abstained from the vote on the EU Solidarity Fund because I believe that the review of this instrument fell well short of what is urgently required if we are to address natural disasters that occur without prior warning and that have devastated Union territory.
This review should have taken account of the serious nature of the situation, including the fires that have devastated entire forests, the droughts that have lasted for years and the torrential rains that have lain waste to whole regions in Europe.
Yet what we have is a review that failed to take account of the reforms needed to increase the effectiveness and workability of the Fund.
In spite of the timely inclusion of drought in this instrument, I feel that this phenomenon, which develops slowly and is barely perceptible in the short term, has not been given due prominence.
Extreme drought has now affected France, Italy, Spain and Portugal.
Lastly, by opting for public, as opposed to regional, criteria, the opportunity has been missed for this instrument to be given the means to carry out adequate recovery of the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the affected areas.
Â Â  . I support this report.
For too long the European Union has not paid sufficient attention to the need for a common energy policy.
We have spent billions on security of food supplies via the CAP, yet nothing on security of energy supplies, leaving the prospect that Europeâs future would be, in a crisis, eating raw vegetables in the dark.
Recent events in Russia â and elsewhere â show the importance of energy security.
This must become a key element of our foreign policy in cooperation with the worldâs other major consumers whether the United States or Japan, China or India.
At the same time, we must stop tying our hands behind our backs.
A tidal barrage across the Severn Estuary in my own constituency could supply up to 10% of Britainâs energy needs from a renewable green scheme with no CO2 emissions.
Yet this scheme could be blocked with its enormous positive benefits by the fine print of the Habitats Directive leaving the unsafe alternative of nuclear power, which is infinitely more polluting to habitats across the world.
We still have farms in the United Kingdom that have restrictions on stock movements left over from the Chernobyl disaster two decades ago!
Â Â  .Even if the basic idea of the Energy Community Treaty (ECT) appears sound, insofar as it is concerned with helping countries in south-east Europe, which are experiencing significant problems in that sphere, we believe that this Treaty has, inter alia, two major flaws.
Firstly, the Treaties do not confer any powers regarding energy â and, still less, powers of equivalent significance â on the European Union, the Commission having made use of provisions on competition policy to claim such powers.
Secondly, the ultimate aim of the ECT is to create an internal energy market between the European Union and nine other countries, even though, within the EU, this policy has already shown its limits: the gradual replacement of public monopolies by monopolies or quasi-monopolies, with an attack on public services; the rise in electricity prices even in those countries in which electricity generation depends very little on the price of oil; the risk of shortages in the short term because of a policy that gives priority to deregulation faced with the issue of security of supply; and so on.
There were other ways of helping our European neighbours to meet their energy needs aside from creating a controversial institutional and political system within the European Union itself.
As usual, however, the pro-European ideology has prevailed.
Â Â  Mr President, the EUâs human rights policy needs to be independent and bold, and we cannot turn our back on human rights violations for economic interests, for example.
Human rights cannot be relinquished, and no price can be put on them.
I have repeatedly expressed concern about the EUâs growing dependence on energy.
That in itself is not a danger, but difficulties arise if the dependence is one-sided.
EU dependence on Russian energy resources in particular seems to be growing.
It is increasing to a level that could be regarded as worrying, both in terms of security of supply and, in particular, for political reasons.
I would like us to have had the courage to say that there was a risk and draw the necessary conclusions.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, MrÂ Howitt, on Human Rights in the World 2005 and the EUâs policy on the matter.
At a time when the major victories in the field of human rights are being continually and insidiously undermined, the role of the European Union, as an emerging humanist civilisation, is vital.
As the representative of EU citizens, the European Parliament has a great and immense responsibility where human rights are concerned.
Firstly, within the Union itself by ensuring that the Member States ratify and implement the major international human rights treaties.
Secondly, the Union, as an area of peace and democracy, must remain the guarantor for human rights in the world by ensuring that our declarations based on our values are followed through in all European policies.
Â Â  . In supporting this report, I am keenly aware that the EU stands accused of paying lip service to human rights, ignoring abuses by major trading partners, arguing for UN reforms it will not implement, and ignoring international legal obligations at home whilst preaching them abroad.
It is hypocrisy that Colombia gets trade advantages for workers' rights when it has the world's highest rate of murders of trade unionists and that EU officials in Zimbabwe are ignorant of key EU human rights guidelines.
It is even worse that EU governments fail to practice what they preach.
Nine countries, including Ireland, Germany and Portugal, refuse to sign the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.
Eleven countries have not signed the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.
Seven countries are considering opt-outs from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.
I fully support the conclusions by my colleague Richard Howitt and his call for a unified EU human rights report identifying an annual list of countries of particular concern, a sliding scale of sanctions against abuser countries, removing the national veto for their agreement, implementing the human rights and democracy clause in the EU's international agreements and introducing human rights impact assessments for EU actions abroad.
Â Â  The promotion of human rights is an extremely important issue of which account should be taken in all policy areas.
We believe that human rights are universal and that we should fight to ensure that they are respected in all countries.
However, the European Parliament is using this report to promote the EUâs positions.
We are opposed to quite a few features of the report, for example those wordings designed to increase the power of the European Parliament, and we have therefore voted against the report.
Obviously, we condemn all human rights violations.
Â Â  .
This report contains some points with which we agree â such as the need to safeguard the fundamental rights of the Sahrawi people and to ensure a just and lasting solution to the conflict in Western Sahara based on the Sahrawi peopleâs right to self-determination, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, especially Resolution 1495.
Yet in common with previous years, this report has been little more than an exercise in hypocrisy, a weapon of pressure and political interference, in which so-called âfriendlyâ countries are protected and the âothersâ, those that the USA and EU have designated as a target, are criticised.
This is an exercise with which we can have no truck.
Consequently, the majority in Parliament once again refuses to condemn the serious violations of human rights committed in Iraq, fails to note that the war in Iraq is illegal and runs counter to international law and the United Nations Charter, and omits to call on the UN to open up a detailed inquiry into the use of banned weapons, such as white phosphorous during the capture of Fallujah, and of âcollective punishmentâ against the Iraqi people.
The majority in Parliament has also not issued a single word of condemnation towards the Israeli Government for the occupation and oppression of Palestine.
Â Â  .This report will no more improve the worldwide human rights situation than previous reports on the same subject did.
Its real aim, however, is something different.
It is aimed at increasing the powers of the Europe of Brussels regarding foreign policy.
In speaking of âthe powerful impact the EU can have on human rights when it speaks with one voiceâ, particularly at the UN, and in drafting proposals designed to increase this âimpact', MrÂ Howitt's report is in keeping with the idea that consists in gradually depriving the Member States of their sovereignty regarding foreign policy, to the advantage of the European institutions.
That is the ambition of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the CFSP, which consists, inter alia, in stripping France of its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.
On the other hand, ArticleÂ 97, which requires European governments to be even more tolerant than at present with regard to non-European immigration, jeopardises the human rights situation in our very own countries.
In fact, the areas of lawlessness that are multiplying in our urban areas are one of the consequences of the uncontrolled immigration to which our nations have been subjected for 30 years.
Â Â  . I voted for my colleague Richard Howitt's report on Human Rights in the World.
In particular, I voted in favour of Amendment 12 on the violation of human rights in the Western Sahara, which was a free vote.
Â Â  . â It is unfortunate that, when it voted today, this House rejected a motion from my Group which condemns the grave human rights abuses in Iraq and recalls âthat the war in Iraq is illegal and violates both international law and the Charter of the United Nationsâ.
A majority in this House, voting by roll-call, was also found to reject the demand that the UN should mount an investigation âinto the human rights violations committed by the international coalition, particularly as regards the use of prohibited weapons such as white phosphorus in the attack on Fallujah and the collective punishments inflicted on the Iraqi population, which are banned by international agreementsâ.
This vote may be taken as emblematic of the double standards to be found in the human rights report.
Human rights violations in states with which the European Union is on friendly terms are subject to insufficient criticism or to none whatever. One consequence of this is that no reference is made to the ongoing offences against human rights in Turkey.
Restrictions imposed around the world on the right to refuse to do military service are simply whitewashed away, and, if one were to go by the human rights report, neither NATO nor EU Member States are waging war or participating in warfare at all.
It was heartening, though, to note the adoption of a motion on the Western Sahara in which the Group of the Left denounced âthe continued violations of the human rights of Saharaui populationâ and called for âthe protection of the Saharaui peopleâ.
Â Â  . The extraordinary role played by the EU as a whole, and by the Member States individually, in promoting human rights on the world stage is something in which, as Europeans and as citizens of the world, we should all take pride.
Let us face facts â the picture is on the whole a positive one.
Traditionally, Parliament used to publish every year what bordered on a list of violations of human rights around the world, and ultimately failed in its objective to monitor the activities of the Community institutions.
Indeed, without prejudice to constant concern with human rights violations, Parliamentâs main obligation is to assess the usefulness of our endeavours in combating these violations.
Accordingly, I welcome this new approach and believe that it will only be truly effective when it is accompanied by a genuine assessment of the impact of EU human rights actions at international level, in the short, medium and long term.
The impact of our actions is a determining factor in whether or not those actions are worthwhile.
In politics, good intentions are not only inadequate, they are also a waste.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues support the highest standards of human rights in the world.
However, the issue of an absolute ban on the death sentence remains a conscience based issue for individual MEPs.
Nevertheless, we all condemn the inappropriate and excessive use of the death penalty in countries such as China and Iran.
We believe that issues of international human rights violations should not be dealt with by the International Criminal Court but should be convened by UN ad hoc Tribunals.
Â Â  â The report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament on âhuman rights in the worldâ cynically expresses the imperialist policy of the ÎU.
It endeavours to present it like a global trustee and defender of human rights, an 'exporter' of democracy to the world.
The EU's respect for and devotion to human rights and democracy was experienced at first hand by the people of former Yugoslavia, by Afghanistan, by Iraq, by Palestine and so on, who have been drenched in blood by the imperialists of the ÎU, the USA and ÎÎÎ€Î, in the name of human rights.
It uses human rights and their selective, so-called protection as a pretext which gives it the right to intervene in every corner of the planet.
Through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (ÎÎDHR) it finances 'coloured revolutions' and all sorts of submissive NGOs in order to coerce and undermine governments of countries which do not comply with its strategic aims.
The references in the report to poverty, the environment, employment rights and so forth are an insult to the peoples groaning beneath imperialist sovereignty and capitalist exploitation.
The Kommounistiko Komma Elladas voted against the report, denouncing the insulting hypocrisy of the ÎU and the selective use of human rights as a means of imperialist pressure and even of unleashing wars against peoples.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues welcome much of what is contained in this report.
We support the emphasis on qualitative value for money, the proposals on cost-benefit studies and agree that the Commission should be providing greater vision on economic reform.
There are some areas of this report that we are unable to support, such as the CFSP text and the references to the new freedom, security and justice agenda.
These are areas where the Conservative Party has had a long-standing opposition to moving to the Community method.
Â Â  The Swedish Conservatives have today voted in favour of MrÂ Ellesâs report on the 2007 budget: the Commissionâs report on the Annual Policy Strategy.
We are, however, critical of the reportâs assertion that setting up what is known as the Globalisation Fund may constitute important progress for the EU.
Moreover, we reject the reportâs proposal that, in the long run, the EU should have its own resources rather than rely on contributions by the Member States.
Our basic view is that it must be for the Member States to decide what resources the Union has at its disposal.
Any form of EU tax would be a departure from this principle.
Â Â  . This report concerns the budgetary guidelines for 2007, the first of the financial framework 2007-2013, and is hindered by the most worrying aspects of the agreement on the financial perspective.
Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, the guidelines for 2007 give tangible form, in budgetary terms, to the EUâs policies of capitalist competition, liberalisation, interference, militarisation and securitarianism.
Unsurprisingly, therefore, the majority in Parliament rejected the observation that âthe Lisbon Strategy has proved itself to be a failure as regards the implementation of its stated objectives of 3% average economic growth and full employment via the creation of 20Â million jobsâ.
It has also rejected the evidence that this âStrategyâ is âthe main instrument of promoting the liberalisation and privatisation of public services, the flexibility and adaptability of the labour markets, lower salaries and the opening to private interests of the core provision of social security, including pensions and healthâ.
Even in the management of Community programmes and agencies, the policy of lowest cost (who would have thought it?), whereby services are 'outsourced' and 'hired outâ, has been pursued with such zeal that even entities that support the EUâs propaganda effort run the risk of being closed or privatised.
Â Â  . I welcome this report which addresses the Commission's strategic priorities for 2007.
Establishing clear priorities has become increasingly important in the case of the external actions budget heading given the cuts amounting to around 20% in funds committed.
More than ever the trade dimension continues to impact on domestic political priorities in the budget.
If the Doha Round is successfully concluded, the conditional agreement on the definitive elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies by 2013 would translate into incremental yearly EC budget savings that are estimated to be around EUR 3 500-4 000 million per year, depending on internal and world market prices, as of 2013.
As rapporteur for a forthcoming report on trade-related assistance and draftsman for the annual strategic priorities, I have called for greater transparency in the funding of the so-called 'Barroso' billion, committed to support the trading capacity of developing countries.
This pledge should not involve cosmetic re-labelling of funds given to infrastructure.
The Commission must commit to producing an annual report on aid for trade to enable Parliament to scrutinise these funds and assure that they are truly additional.
Â Â  . The situation described in this report demonstrates how all of the shortcomings relating to the adoption of the financial perspective 2007-2013 have brought increasing, unnecessary difficulties for the functioning of the EU.
First and foremost, the glaring discrepancy between the Unionâs budget and its increasing responsibilities can only have detrimental consequences for the EU's capacity to take action, and in turn for its image among the citizens.
On the other hand, there can be no doubt that, on account of the delays that have occurred, this is a document that does not give a quantitative expression of priorities.
Without values, it is difficult to appreciate the extent to which the proposed options are to be pursued.
This presents us with a twofold difficulty.
In light of the circumstances, it was inevitable that this would be the case.
Consequently, what remains is for us to draw the necessary lessons from this situation for the future, the main one being that we must first agree on the major objectives and the Unionâs designs, and which policies we should be pursuing whereby we shall be able, in good time, to obtain an agreement as to the funds that they need.
Â Â  The report proposes an insurance scheme for farmers, jointly financed by farmers, the Member States and the EU within the framework of the common agricultural policy.
That is something about which we have our doubts.
We Swedish Social Democrats are opposed to new instruments and more funding for the agricultural sector.
Given the heavy funding of the EUâs common agricultural policy from the budget, the sector itself should be able to finance aid to farmers hit by natural disasters.
Moreover, there is no scope in the budget for increased appropriations.
We therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  In an EU with 25 Member States, the report focuses too much on the problems in the Mediterranean area of Europe.
Within the EU, there is a host of problems resulting from freaks of nature, such as floods in central Europe and heavy storms and frost in northern Europe, yet it is forest fires in southern Europe that are the problem constantly addressed by the European Parliament as one that needs to be remedied through the EU.
We believe, however, that it is exclusively the Member States affected that are responsible for ensuring that measures are taken in this area.
The fact is that, if the Member States are relieved of responsibility for taking such measures and for putting preventive systems in place to forestall disasters of this type, the risks will increase.
In insurance theory, this is called âmoral hazardâ.
The report lists a host of different measures at EU level, all with attendant costs requiring significant increases in the budget.
We are opposed to a specific EU programme for forest protection because we believe that it is the Member States that should assume responsibility for protecting forests.
The reportâs idea of awareness campaigns at EU level with a view to promoting a change of attitude towards the use of fire (paragraphÂ 23) is one of several examples of the way in which the wealth of ideas that emerged while the report was being prepared has completely lost touch with reality.
We have therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  â Agricultural and forestry production are closely bound up with nature and constantly exposed to it.
Consequently, there needs to be a compensation fund, especially for small- and medium-sized holdings which, unless they receive compensation from the ÎU and the state, cannot continue their activities because, apart from the consequences of the anti-farming policy of the ÎU, they have to deal with climatic dangers, as in my country, in the areas of Thrace and Thessalia, where their production has been destroyed by floods and they face an acute problem of survival.
Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the fact that the frequency of unforeseen natural phenomena and the risk of the viability of farmers is a consequence of the predatory plundering of natural wealth and commercialisation of the environment, a policy which constitutes the cause and which, unfortunately, is being promoted by the ÎU with tragic consequences.
If this philosophy continues of not addressing the cause and of fire-fighting by giving compensation, then the consequences of the fatal climatic phenomena will soon be so great that it will be impossible to satisfy the people affected with compensation, even if it accounts for a large sum in Community and national funds.
A review of this policy is therefore the best way of preventing and protecting against natural disasters.
Â Â  . As with the Estrela report, I do not believe that there is practical or financial justification for creating an agency on drought and floods.
Other forms of environmental action on floods are urgently required.
Â Â  . Following the natural disasters across large parts of Europe, we have seen the inadequacy of the Solidarity Fund since it was set up in 2002, given the unpredictable nature of these phenomena.
The vulnerability of farming to the climate has been shown in stark relief in recent years by cases of extreme drought in Portugal, Spain, Italy and France.
In light of these situations, and the need to prevent future recurrences, the rapporteur has suggested a fresh approach to improving protection for communities and farmers from the devastating impact.
I therefore feel it is vitally important to set up a disaster management system, a risk management system and a stabilisation support system following such crises.
Lastly, training for prevention is a further crucial measure in such situations.
As part of the civil protection measures, the Forest Focus programme and the rural development programmes, we have a framework in place for the necessary measures for raising awareness among communities and prevention training and information for those responsible for crisis management in these situations.
All measures â both those already in existence and those proposed here â need to be available.
For these reasons, I voted in favour of the Capoulas Santos report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, even though this does not come under the explanations of vote, I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank you for the expertise you have demonstrated in presiding over the House.
You will have noticed that many of us support you in that regard.
It was with great conviction that I voted in favour of the Galeote Quecedo report, particularly Articles 18 and 32.
ArticleÂ 18 refers to best practices, by maintaining that the experience built up both at national and at regional and local levels should be disseminated and used in other countries.
In that connection, I believe that we could genuinely help other countries a great deal, through volunteering, for instance, as done by fire fighters, whose work can be carried out in many other regions and countries.
I sincerely hope, therefore, that we will proceed along those lines.
ArticleÂ 32, on the other hand, refers to the removal of administrative barriers, particularly for border regions, which have specific needs.
I completely agree with this.
Â Â  . We warmly welcome the fact that some of the proposals we tabled were adopted, which were as follows:
- protecting the scope of the Solidarity Fund, which should continue to cover intervention in the case of disasters which are, though significant, under the damage threshold laid down but embody severe and lasting repercussions on the living conditions of the inhabitants of a given region, with the possibility of extraordinary assistance existing in such cases;
- the existence of a wide network of agricultural SMEs and an agricultural policy promoting more sustainable production methods, notably as regards water and soil use, is a vital precondition for fighting the effects of drought and forest fires;
- believes it is essential, in the context of the new financial framework for 2007-2013, to establish a Community programme for protection against forest fires, with a view to promoting awareness campaigns and risk prevention and management measures in respect of forest fires, suitably funded and complementing agricultural and structural policy, taking account of the specific nature of forests in the Mediterranean.
We therefore voted in favour of the report, although we regret the fact that other proposals that we tabled were not adopted, which would have made the report more complete in terms of policies aimed at supporting farmers affected by disasters.
Â Â  . The following points were adopted in plenary:
1 â The acknowledgement of the specific nature of natural disasters occurring in the Mediterranean;
2. The establishment of a Community forest fire protection programme;
3. The assessment of the possibility of creating a farming disaster fund;
4. Maintaining the eligibility of regional disasters in the Solidarity Fund;
5. Adapting the Solidarity Fund, in terms of time limits and eligible actions, in order to enable it to deal with the specific nature of natural disasters, such as drought and forest fire;
6. Special attention to the least favoured regions in the event of natural disasters.
It should be noted that, on the basis of proposals by Members from central and northern European Member States, the inclusion of the specific nature of the Mediterranean forest, which we had previously managed to ensure, has been watered down, in spite of our vote against.
This is another example of a situation in which those in control call the shots; that is to say that in this âfederalistâ Parliament, the weighting of Members from each country, with central and northern European MEPs the dominant force, is a decisive factor in undermining the interests of Mediterranean countries, in which more than 90% of forest fires take place.
Â Â  . I welcome the Estrela report.
Although it does not introduce any technical innovations in terms of natural disaster management and prevention, it does offer an important survey of the possibilities and the knowledge currently available.
I warmly welcome the proposals to create directives on the prevention and management of fires and drought, which I believe to be an extremely important factor in forward planning and a more efficient response to natural disasters.
I also welcome the proposal to set up a European Monitoring Centre on drought, desertification, floods and other effects of climate change, which should play a vital role in studying and coordinating best practice as regards civil protection.
The report mainly relates to the problem of forest fires and drought, and refers occasionally to floods, which means that it is of crucial importance to Portugal and the other Mediterranean countries.
Â Â  . We believe it is crucial that a Community programme to protect forests from the scourge of fires should be created in the next financial framework 2007-2013, with the appropriate funding, with the aim of fostering awareness raising activities, and fire risk prevention and management.
This programme should be given adequate funding, should go hand in hand with farming and structural policy, and should take account of the specific character of Mediterranean forests.
We therefore believe that the Solidarity Fund should attach special prominence to time limits and eligible actions, and to natural disasters specific to the Mediterranean, including drought and forest fires.
On the other hand, Solidarity Fund intervention must be possible even when disasters, however serious, do not reach the required level, and that aid should be provided in exceptional circumstances when the majority of the population in a region has suffered from a disaster with serious and lasting impact on their living conditions;
Although the report does not address all of these questions, we voted for it, because it is a positive, albeit inadequate contribution.
Â Â  In her report, the rapporteur discusses natural disasters from an environmental perspective.
It is proposed, for example, that a European observatory be established.
We do believe that cross-border environmental problems should be dealt with at EU level.
It is, however, extremely doubtful whether natural disasters are cross-border in character.
The issue of rivers bursting their banks may be something that can be resolved at EU level, but there is already a rivers directive that regulates how this type of problem might be tackled.
Where fires are concerned, we believe that it is up to each Member State to create the structures required for preventing these and the damage they cause.
If the EU were to cough up every time a natural disaster occurred, there would naturally be fewer incentives to do preventive work. This would lead to further and more serious disasters occurring in the future, something that would obviously be very harmful to the environment and expensive for taxpayers.
The rapporteur wants the EU to call on the Member States to establish national forest funds for the prevention of natural disasters.
That is something we believe to be an issue for the Member States, which should therefore decide for themselves whether or not it is necessary to do this.
For the aforesaid reasons, we have voted against the report in todayâs vote.
Â Â  . I voted for the Estrela report on the environmental aspects of natural disasters, but against the creation of a special agency on drought and floods.
I believe there is no justification for creating such an agency and no budget either.
Â Â  . Natural disasters are crises that may strike at any given moment, and without prior warning.
For this reason, prevention measures must be taken.
Disasters of this nature that my country and other EU Member States have suffered lead me to join the rapporteur in calling for effective prevention measures, such as technological research and development and the establishment of a European Monitoring Centre for Drought and Desertification.
This kind of phenomenon has a serious impact on the lives of the communities affected for an indefinite period.
It is for this reason that the Solidarity Fund should include extreme drought in its instruments, and should take account of the necessary civil protection aspects.
In this regard, it is vital to raise awareness among the communities involved.
Furthermore, the Member States must show mutual solidarity in order to act and to combat these events and the serious repercussions that they engender in the living conditions of the people affected, if necessary with joint resources.
I therefore voted in favour of the Estrela report.
Â Â  .The relentless quest for all forms of prevention and, to that end, the carrying out of technological research and development activities, public awareness raising, the coordination of emergency assistance and the deployment of a civilian force in the event of a natural disaster are crucial elements that we must provide for and put in place as soon as possible.
On the other hand, I am opposed to any creation of an observatory.
That structure is in fact likely to cost a great deal of money for little reward.
Above all, the amount of money spent on funding to ensure that this observatory could operate would be cut from the crucial aid for activities on the ground.
It is, moreover, always very easy to create observatories, but virtually impossible to do away with them.
Â Â  .
To my regret, I am unable to go along with the Berend and Galeote reports, although I would emphasise that this is not out of any opposition to mutual solidarity between Member States when disasters strike.
What both reports have in common is that they rely heavily on an EU framework with the primary intention of preventing (natural) disasters, responding to them and dealing with them.
This might be justified if all Member States were facing the same problem to a greater or lesser degree, but that is far from being the case, and so any action by the EU ought to be restricted to supplementary operations that the Member States themselves are unable to support.
Better use is made of the EU whenever its initiatives are concentrated on disasters affecting more than one Member State and that are either not capable of being prevented or of being insured against, and the consequences of which are beyond the capacities of Member States to manage.
I would therefore have been able to support a limited additional instrument of which use could be made where circumstances justified it.
These proposals do, nevertheless and very rightly, remind us of the importance of preventative action.
It is my hope and expectation that both the Member States and the EU will use all means at their disposal to minimise the risks of a disaster occurring.
After all, prevention is always better than cure.
Â Â  The reports propose that a number of funds be established and that more use be made of Structural Funds and the Solidarity Fund to finance EU measures designed to prevent natural disasters and to tackle their consequences.
They also propose that a European monitoring centre for drought and desertification, a European Fire or Forest Fund and a disaster fund be established within the framework of the common agricultural policy and that intensive information campaigns on the sustainable use of water be conducted.
It is also proposed that the scope of the European Solidarity Fund be extended to cover the consequences of public health crises, terrorist attacks and technological disasters.
The June List welcomes international solidarity when a country is hit by disasters.
The EU must not, however, use these disasters as an argument for extending its power and developing a common policy in this area or for establishing further institutions.
If the Member States are relieved of responsibility for taking measures and for putting systems in place to prevent disasters of this type, the risks will increase.
In insurance theory, this is called âmoral hazardâ.
We have therefore voted against both reports.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we are discussing the coordination of solutions to natural disasters and cooperation on such matters.
I am naturally happy that the report proposes an information and education campaign and the prevention of such events.
I am sure that help will be targeted mainly at areas of high risk, and that it is necessary to protect the environment and safeguard natural resources.
I am convinced that such cooperation should be on a voluntary basis, and I am in favour of individual countries endeavouring to make major improvements to the coordination and communication of information.
However, I strongly believe that contributions to individual agencies and to the setting up of European units should be made on a voluntary basis and should not be mandatory.
Consequently, I did not support the adoption of point 31 and I abstained from the vote on this report.
Â Â  â Mr President, that we in Europe must stand together in contending against the adverse consequences of natural disasters is not a matter of doubt, and for that the regions affected rely on the solidarity of neighbouring Member States; European programmes are also needed to help in crisis situations.
The report provides a whole range of examples of how to go about this.
To European aid in a crisis, then, one has to say âyesâ, but the prevention of disasters is primarily a responsibility for the Member States, and it is a responsibility from which we should not discharge them by passing it on to the European level; the same is true when it comes to organising the response to crisis situations, otherwise known as âEuropean civil protectionâ.
There is no need for new powers in respect of civil protection and disaster prevention; they would result in twin-tracking and wasted money in administrative systems.
That neighbouring states within Europe should help each other when disaster strikes is, then, perfectly obvious; what Europe can do is to help with programmes promoting improved coordination and alleviating material need.
New European powers, though, would do more harm than good, and these reports do not alter the fact that this is still something we need to talk about.
Â Â  â Mr President, would you be willing to take note of the fact that I missed a number of roll-call votes yesterday as a result of the malfunctioning of the bell on my floor?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I had the same problem yesterday as MrsÂ DeÂ Vits and I wanted to highlight it.
The bell does not work properly on our floor, and, when I arrived at the Chamber to take part in the vote, ten minutes late, the bulk of the roll-call votes had taken place.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Nepal(1).
Â Â  . â Mr President, following weeks of massive demonstrations, with hundreds injured and even killed, King Gynanendra, at the beginning of May, at last caved in and surrendered the power of which he had taken possession in February 2005.
His imposition of a state of emergency had been justified on the basis that the authorities had failed to defeat the Maoists in battle.
What has been going on in Nepal over recent months has been quite unparalleled.
Having visited it over a dozen times, I know this state in the Himalayas very well.
Its people had spent years enduring a terror regime with arbitrary arrests, and they vented their fury in active resistance, which will, in due course, make a return to democracy possible.
A new multi-party coalition under a very experienced prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, commenced face-to-face negotiations with the rebels.
It is planned that a constitutional assembly be summoned to decide what form the state should take in future, and the Maoists have declared themselves willing to accept its decision.
I believe it to be particularly important that they should now also lay down their weapons and cease from standing in the way of the countryâs democratic development.
I hope that the new coalition will be able to muster all its forces in order to maintain public safety on a lasting basis.
Political detainees, human rights activists, students and journalists must be set at liberty.
The tens of thousands who have been sent into exile must at last be allowed back into their homeland without needing to fear for their lives.
I now expect the Tibetan refugee centre and the Dalai Lamaâs office in Kathmandu to be reopened.
We Europeans should show our solidarity by sending a group of MEPs to Nepal as soon as possible.
Let us encourage those who are involved in the re-establishment of democracy, both the non-governmental organisations and the ordinary public, who will need not only technical and financial help from outside â important though that is â but also stability and peace at home.
Let us hope, too, that tourism â the main source of income for a country that is still a fascinating one â will flourish once more: Namaste!
Â Â  . Mr President, of course we think that Nepal is a distant country and that these matters are not always very easy for us to understand.
However, I must say that some things simply do stand out.
Before I entered the Chamber, a journalist asked me if I thought that the European Union should become involved in reinstating democracy in the world.
I said that the European Union obviously has limited powers and that we must always support certain values.
We are well aware that the situation in Nepal is unique.
It is not merely a simple choice, based on the fact that the strong rule of a king has exceeded the mandate granted to the latter by Nepalese law, and as a consequence has brought with it serious problems for many Nepalese citizens.
It is also a problem of the Maoist guerrillas in Nepal.
Let us remember that we must be very careful when deciding who to support in Nepal.
It would be a great tragedy for the country if, after the king is removed from dictatorial power which he wilfully claimed and after a short transitional period of democracy, Maoist tyranny should ensue.
We are well aware that revolutionary Communists have frequently acted in such a fashion: they fought against a strong monarchy under the banner of democracy and then destroyed democracy in order to build their tyrannical governments.
We must be very careful and, whilst supporting democratic change, demand respect for minorities and the opening of a centre for refugees from Tibet, which is something that was mentioned by MrÂ Mann.
At the same time, we must carefully monitor the situation so that we can prevent one bad solution becoming another, even worse, solution.
That will be the task of the European Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, all the indications are that things in Nepal are taking a turn for the better.
It is not acceptable that, in any country, wherever in the world, all power should be in the hands of one person, as was, I think, formerly the case with the King of Nepal.
There is certainly no doubt that we, here in this Chamber, at the heart of European democracy, should support by all means available the developments towards democracy in Nepal.
I think that the king has acted reasonably in calling a constitutional assembly in order to endow Nepal with a good new constitution.
It strikes me as particularly important that every group, whether currently outside Nepal or present within it, should be able to regard the electoral system as representative and inclusive, for, in Nepal too, representative democracy must prevail.
The great question is: what can Europe do about it at this stage?
If it is thought to be of value in terms of the development of democracy, and if the parties and the prime minister think it useful, that a delegation from this House should go to Nepal in order to give support at this time of change, then that â it goes without saying â is what we must do.
I also believe that the European Union should become actively involved, at a high level, in the negotiations on the new constitution.
It may well be that we can make some contribution, and I am in agreement with the wording of the resolution according to which we should do this together with the other major powers, not least the United States and India.
More time will be needed to enable the wounds from the past to heal, but we must use all means available, including money and financial resources, in an attempt to help them do that as soon as possible.
Â Â  . Mr President, I warmly welcome the long overdue return to democratic rule in Nepal.
The SAARC delegation and I, as its chairman, have been concerned since the imposition of direct rule by the King, and have worked with the Troika to promote a return to democracy.
Finally this has taken place.
The new government faces many challenges, including limiting the Kingâs power and bringing the military under democratic control.
I therefore welcome the fact that today they are already discussing a new role for the monarchy, which I hope will prevent any kind of return to the disruption to democracy that we saw over the last year.
The main priority for my delegation is to see the establishment of lasting peace, and Maoist cooperation is pivotal to achieving this.
The fact that the ceasefire has been respected is an indication that the right environment for peace talks is being created.
However, I call on the Maoists to demonstrate their genuine commitment to stop recruiting militia, to put an end to any extortion and to return confiscated land.
Both sides need to make the ceasefire permanent and to enter into a constructive dialogue as soon as possible, with the aim of holding free and fair elections and putting the Maoists on the same footing as the other political parties.
I support what Mr Mulder said in terms of the European Unionâs role and how we ensure that we get lasting peace in Nepal.
Â Â  . â Mr President, a new era is beginning in Nepal following 10 years of civil war and almost 13Â 000 deaths.
King Gyanendraâs decision in February 2005 to dissolve the government and declare a state of emergency has been the straw that broke the camelâs back in terms of Nepalese patience.
We must make it absolutely clear that it has been the demonstrations in favour of democracy and peace that have forced this change.
Those demonstrations, which were dealt with brutally by the police and which have left several people dead and many injured, have forced the king to abandon the military dictatorship, to restore Parliament and to hand the administration over to a government made up of a multi-party alliance.
We are now seeing a glimpse of a new opportunity to reach a peace agreement with the Maoist guerrillas, which had previously declared genuine ceasefires which were rejected by the King; now, however, the ceasefire has been accepted.
Our hope is that what is currently a temporary ceasefire will soon become a permanent one.
In the mean time, we must welcome the move from arms to the political arena, as demonstrated by the agreement that the Maoists have signed with the multi-party coalition to hold elections to a constituent assembly in the near future.
This Resolution also gives us the opportunity to welcome the fact that the government has repealed the royal decrees restricting press freedom and establishing strict controls on NGOs and also to call for the release of all of the political prisoners, journalists and human rights activists remaining in prison.
The European Union must monitor the situation very closely and assist this process wisely.
For example, the new government has decided to freeze the purchase by the previous government of military aircraft and weapons; the Council and the Member States must respect this decision and must maintain the freeze on military aid.
Nepal no longer needs arms, but rather it needs to return to democratic and institutional normality.
Furthermore, as has been said, the European Union must contribute to the peace process, providing assistance for demobilisation and economic aid for development and humanitarian programmes and also sending electoral and human rights observers.
Â Â  . â Ladies and gentlemen, southern Asia has long suffered from instability in a number of countries in the region.
Certain regions in the individual countries are in rebel hands and this is true of most of the territory of Afghanistan and Nepal.
Whilst in Afghanistan the countryside is in the hands of the chiefs of clans and tribes, 75% of Nepal is controlled by groups with which the official authorities have so far refused to negotiate.
After the king assumed absolute power, other political players also ran out of patience and in February 2006 people took to the streets.
Now that a new coalition government has been formed, there is vital work that needs to be done; for example, the constitution needs to be changed to include safeguards of democracy and, most importantly, the involvement of all stakeholders in resolving the situation.
According to the most recent reports, this is the current state of affairs.
Preparations for elections of course need to be speeded up.
An elected parliament should draw up a new constitution at the earliest opportunity, and our job is to support the process of democratisation, an integral part of which is freedom of the media and development of the countryâs economy.
The resolution that we have proposed and supported will contribute in the search for a democratic path out of the current crisis, and I believe that the Commission has already earmarked appropriate funds to support the entire process.
Â Â  . â Mr President, in Nepal, a king has managed to destroy not only a new democracy, but also an ancient monarchy with deep roots among the people.
Restoring both on an unequivocally democratic basis will be a very difficult task, and one in which our support will be required, for there is a risk of evil being used to drive out evil and of one dictatorship replacing another.
I would not like to see the democrats who are now at the helm in Nepal suffering the same fate as Kerensky after the first Russian revolution, when, the rule of the tsars having been overthrown, it was replaced shortly afterwards by a totalitarian one-party dictatorship.
It is for that reason that we must give the democratic forces â which are very weak and fragmented â massive support and ensure that this democracy does not soon give way to another dictatorship.
All the Nepalese need to do is to take a look at their neighbours in Tibet to see the damage a one-party dictatorship can do to an ancient Asian culture.
So let the Nepalese democrats be given every possible support in order not to end up being ground up between two millstones.
Â Â  . Mr President, I think we need to be positive.
Mr Posselt, who spoke just a moment ago, was far too negative.
We should echo what Mr Mulder said and look on the events of the last few weeks as a turn for the better.
We in the European Parliament and the EU as a whole must do all we can to support the moves towards democracy.
As the resolution says, we must continue to highlight minority rights, and, as we did this morning, we should vote so as to support the ideas in the Howitt report.
We should support the government to make certain there is democratic control of the military, and reinforce the call made by my colleague, Mrs Gill, for lasting peace.
If this is to be successful, we in the European Parliament must do everything we can to address the root causes of the conflict in Nepal and ensure that there is much greater economic prosperity and much better redistribution of wealth throughout Nepal.
That would be positive and could be the route to lasting success.
Â Â  . Mr President, I think it is clear after this debate that there is broad agreement in this House that Nepal may just be starting to turn the corner and there may for once, after ten long years of war, be a sign of hope.
Nepalâs problems demonstrate the weakness of the EU, but the recent reinstatement of democracy gives us the opportunity to demonstrate our strengths.
In the absence of a collective will to find a solution in Nepal, we cannot impose one.
But now we have the opportunity to guide, to assist and to advise all the democratic forces in Nepal as they continue their long, tortuous journey towards a multi-party democracy and respect for human rights.
This resolution contains a number of worthy ideas, in particular the establishment of an international contact group and continued engagement of the international community within Nepal, guiding all these democratic forces.
We must continue to support the democratic growth of Nepal.
We cannot criticise and we must have a clean pair of hands in our negotiations with all parties in that country.
I commend every mechanism within this resolution to the House and I hope to hear from the Commissioner that the Commission will continue to support us in this aim.
Â Â  . Mr President, events have been taking a positive turn in Nepal, with King Gyanendra finally backing down in the face of mounting opposition to his absolute rule.
The impact of the peopleâs democratic movement is impressive: Parliament has been restored, the government is committed to electing a Constituent Assembly to rewrite the Constitution and, most importantly, talks will soon be under way between the new interim government and the Maoists, under a mutually agreed ceasefire.
This is a major victory for the Nepalese people.
There is now a tremendous opportunity for the new government to restore democracy and pursue a peace process, but the many challenges that lie ahead should not be underestimated.
The victory of the pro-democracy movement marks only the first step in Nepalâs long road to peace and stability.
The new interim government is faced with important challenges: planning for constitutional changes, keeping the peace process with the Maoists on track and responding to calls for transitional justice.
The primary goal must now be to agree a formal ceasefire and bring an end to hostilities between the Royal Nepalese Army and the Maoists.
The second is to take forward a peace process based on constitutional redress.
The third is to ensure that Nepal emerges again on the world scene as a stable democracy.
The EU has a key role in helping Nepal through this difficult process.
The Commission is ready to contribute to a possible peace package.
Such a package could include, , support for elections, election observation, ceasefire monitoring and the necessary technical assistance.
Working closely with the European Union Member States and successive European Union Council presidencies, the Commission remains committed to pursuing all efforts that may contribute towards a stable, democratic and peaceful Nepal.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on Sri Lanka(1).
Â Â  The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance took the initiative of calling a debate on this issue because the Tamil Tigers had left the negotiating table.
The conflict concerned has claimed at least 60Â 000 lives, and millions of people have been compulsorily displaced.
This situation will never be resolved if both parties do not sit down at the negotiating table and remain there for as long as it takes to obtain a solution.
The fact that the Tamil Tigers have now left the negotiating table is destructive for all the parties.
They are in a minority and will never be able to achieve their aims through violence.
The path of negotiation where we can be of help is that which will lead to a successful outcome and on which both parties have some prospect of gain.
We must turn our attention to the Sri Lankan Government.
As recently as in May, at least 18Â civilians were killed on Kayts Island, and there are witnesses to confirm that the Sri Lankan navy murdered innocent civilians â at least 13 of them â because they were unwilling to leave their homes.
Sri Lanka is responsible for a long list of human rights violations that it has never carefully investigated.
Now that the country has been elected to join the UN Human Rights Council, it is absurd that it does not itself fulfil fundamental requirements to investigate human rights violations and take measures to bring their perpetrators to justice.
If both parties get their act together and assume their responsibilities, we too can accept responsibility for helping with the peace process.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the situation in Sri Lanka is getting worse.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are committing new atrocities, and it is the Sri Lankan Government that decides where.
The general image of the situation presented by some of the media is that it is a war with the heat turned down, and that description I regard as an accurate one.
The question that arises has to do with what role the EU might play in de-escalating this conflict; how might it be possible to prevent it from getting even worse?
It has been proposed that the LTTE be, officially, put on the EU list of terrorist organisations; to do so would be extremely counter-productive, particularly in the present situation, as it has not been possible to hold the negotiations on EU territory and the fact that there is any kind of negotiating process at all is thanks to the Norwegian Government in particular.
That being so, the way the EU should do its bit for de-escalation is to refrain from apportioning blame, something of which the proposed resolution is a lamentably bad example, in that it tends, fairly one-sidedly, to present the LTTE as the guilty party.
The Sri Lankan Government, too, has recently done much to crank up the conflict.
There is a quite different respect in which the EU plays an important part in this, for some of its Member States are continuing to deport people to Sri Lanka, consigning them to a situation of simmering warfare, and these deportations must be brought to an immediate halt.
We must get really actively involved, without attaching blame to one side or the other, and that is a demand I make not only of the Commission, but also of the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, as in any conflict there are abuses on all sides, but the urgent resolution before the House this afternoon quite properly focuses on the appalling activities of a terrorist organisation, the LTTE.
The LTTE is interested in one thing and one thing only, and that is political power.
It does not represent all of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka.
It certainly does not speak for them.
Its murderous campaign has not improved their situation one iota.
On the contrary, the Tamils, like all the other people of Sri Lanka, continue to suffer casualties, economic hardship and disruptive lives because of the uncertain and dangerous security situation.
I hope it is not too late for the LTTE to pull back from the brink.
At the beginning of this year there had been optimism that the ceasefire agreement would be reinforced and that substantial progress towards peace would be achieved.
The failure of the LTTE to agree to a second round of Geneva negotiations and its resumption of a terrorist campaign have removed this hope.
It is imperative that the LTTE is held to account for its actions and that further international pressure is brought to bear on it at this time.
Unlike Mr PflÃŒger, I therefore urge the EU to add the LTTE to its list of proscribed terrorist organisations.
I do not see this as a hindrance to future negotiations, but as a major incentive for the LTTE to stop the violence.
At the same time, this ban must be backed by effective action by Member States to prevent funds and other support reaching the LTTE.
Human Rights Watch, a highly respected international NGO, has testified to the intimidation, extortion and physical violence that has been inflicted on Tamils living in Britain and other countries in order to suppress criticism and ensure a steady flow of income.
Every EU country where there is a Tamil community should establish special police taskforces to investigate and prosecute the agents of the LTTE, as well as freezing bank accounts linked to them.
This should be seen as another dimension to the war on terrorism.
For its part, the LTTE should immediately impose a ceasefire, give up its child soldiers, stop its suicide bombings, and agree to return to the conference table in a positive and constructive spirit.
That is the greatest service it could provide to the Tamils and all the people of Sri Lanka.
Â Â  . Mr President, we all hoped that the talks held in Geneva in February involving the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE might have been the beginning of a road towards peace, only for the Tamil Tigers, as we all know, to pull out of the second round of the negotiations.
We all, of course, urged them to return to the negotiating table â I say all of us, but if we ban them they will not be able to do that â because a political solution is the only hope.
Already LTTE delegations to EU Member States will not be received.
The Council, as I have said, is considering listing the LTTE as a terrorist organisation.
Surely it can see that will probably happen if there is any more violence and it will just be isolated even further.
Negotiation is the only way forward, but negotiation should involve all groups, including other Tamil organisations â peaceful Tamil organisations, such as the Tamil United Liberation Front, for instance.
The Government must also play its part and it is certainly not blameless in this.
Both sides have violated the ceasefire.
Both sides have, I believe, committed gross violations of human rights.
I call on the Sri Lankan Government, for instance, to investigate fully and to prosecute cases of extra-judicial killing.
It says it is investigating, but I want a full investigation.
I want it to reinstate the Human Rights Commission.
On the other hand, I want the Tamil Tigers to cease their violence completely, stop using child soldiers and return the child soldiers they are using to their families.
Only if all parties show restraint that will we prevent further violence, otherwise it is the ordinary citizens, yet again, who will suffer.
Â Â  . Mr President, this joint resolution contains many points and I, like others, support some and have reservations about others.
We all condemn the violence taking place in Sri Lanka and we all bemoan the loss of life.
We have highlighted the points we have in common and, having worked on a joint resolution, I really regret the inflammatory remarks made a few minutes ago by Mr Van Orden, who seems to have made a âhit-and-runâ contribution and left the Chamber.
It shows a fundamental misunderstanding not just of the process in this House but also of the severity of the situation and of the way forward.
Mrs Lynne highlighted a couple of points that need to be re-emphasised, for instance, for a peace process to be successful, all parties have to be involved in it.
Perhaps we were wrong to talk in the resolution only of the LTTE and the government, when there are plenty of other organisations.
There have been too many unexplained deaths in Sri Lanka, whether it was that of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar or the Tamil MP Joseph Pararajasingham, both of whom I and others had met and both of whom had been present in this Chamber.
We hear about many deaths, but too many go unreported.
We must give full support to the peace process, but we must recognise, as Mr PflÃŒger and others have said, that unfortunately, in a civil conflict like this, a lot of people are involved.
We need them all around the table and we cannot apportion blame beforehand.
Paragraph 17 on prescription will have a serious and negative impact on the process.
Â Â  . Mr President, my colleague, MrsÂ Lynne, asked for a new Human Rights Commission to be set up in SriÂ Lanka and I am very pleased to announce that the President yesterday did just that, in anticipation, I suppose, of our resolution in this Parliament.
The Human Rights Commission is now up and running.
I think it was Winston Churchill who said that âjaw-jaw is always better than war-warâ.
What we have to do is continue talking.
There is no final military solution to this conflict, which has now raged in the country of my birth for over 25 years.
Thousands of people have died and, with no possibility of a military solution, we must negotiate and talk until a commonality of interest is found.
Who should do the talking?
The European Union is a Co-Chair and I am led to believe that the Council has decided to ban the LTTE as a terrorist organisation.
But we must continue to talk and the EU and the Co-Chairs, including Norway, in consultation with India, now have the role of peacemakers.
We have to bring peace to the island.
The intransigence of the LTTE, which periodically talks peace and then goes back to war, has got to stop.
The international community is not going to be fooled anymore by this stop-go, stop-go process.
I would like to thank my colleagues in this Parliament for the cooperation and understanding they have shown in this matter.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to express my great concern about the breakdown of the peace process in Sri Lanka.
I would appeal to all parties to renounce the vicious cycle of violence and to approach this dispute constructively.
All parties must abandon violence once and for all.
After an encouraging return to the negotiating table in February, the LTTEâs refusal to participate in the second round in April was very disappointing.
The LTTE needs to resume peace negotiations with the Government of Sri Lanka, and the government too must be careful not to jeopardise the very delicate peace process.
In my view the Commission needs to play a more proactive role to enable this process to move forward.
The European Union, as we have heard, is a Co-Chair, but we appear to be playing a rather passive role, rather than seeing ourselves as dynamic players.
I believe that together with the other Co-Chairs â the USA, Norway and Japan â we should urgently consider how we can strengthen Norwayâs role as facilitator, in order to make positive progress towards a peaceful resolution and to get an agreed roadmap to end this conflict.
The European Union is pouring enormous resources into Sri Lanka.
We need to get some real results to ensure that the lives of the people there are remarkably improved.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as has already been said, there can be no easy solution to a conflict that has been going on for nearly 25 years.
What we are dealing with here is a sort of suppurating swelling that breaks out from time to time.
I agree with all those speakers who have said that it is no solution at all to have recourse to force of arms in order to win a particular dispute.
We should instead carry on talking.
The great question is: what is the best way to do this?
Norway has been acting as a mediator since 2002, and MrsÂ Gill and the other Member were quite right to point that out, but whether Europe can play a more significant role is a major issue.
Would it do any good if a major politician from Europe were to go to Sri Lanka to talk with the two sides and with other interested parties too?
A delegation of us went there last year, and, at the time, the suggestion was made from various quarters that it might be useful if some greater power than Norway were to emerge as mediator.
I would be particularly appreciative if the Commission could let us know what it thinks of this suggestion.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, anti-personnel landmines are terrible weapons, especially when they hit a bus full of people, and it does not matter whether those people are soldiers or civilians.
This clearly brutal operation by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was swiftly followed by a disproportionate response, namely the bombing of land under their control.
We are now faced with a further round of violence and another opportunity to supply weapons, to criticise the Sri Lankan Government and to lay down very peculiar conditions for the Colombo Government to take part in the next possible round of peace talks.
Who is so interested in the possible deposits of oil and gas between the shores of the island and the federal state of Tamil Nadu?
Sadly the motion for a resolution fails to answer this question.
Perhaps the next one will.
Right now, all we can do is support the resolution.
I would merely like to conclude with a question for MrÂ Schlyter, an advocate of ethnic rights.
How are those rights enforced among the Sinhalese in the northeast of the island?
Â Â  Mr President, the current situation in Sri Lanka is considered to be the most difficult we have witnessed in the four years since the truce was declared between the Tamil Tigers and the government.
Conflict in this region has already claimed 64Â 000 victims and a further 300 lives have been lost in a series of terrorist attacks during the last six months.
A week ago, the attacks of 11 May culminated in the sinking of a navy vessel with 18 people on board.
The lives of peacekeeping observers are also in serious danger.
These incidents undermine the already fragile ceasefire and threaten to destroy it completely.
According to the principles of the peace agreement, the territorial waters around Sri Lanka lie under the jurisdiction of the government, and both sides are fully responsible for protecting local observers.
It is particularly worrying that the escalating conflict is preventing the economic development of the island, that aid is not reaching those affected by the tsunami, that there is growing racial and ethnic discrimination, that children are recruited to the military and that the independence of the media is limited.
International institutions must categorically condemn the terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka to date.
Support should be given to measures to set up a second round of conciliation talks and to work towards mobilising local communities to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict and to prevent the shedding of civilian blood, especially the blood of children.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission continues to follow the situation in Sri Lanka very closely and welcomes the interest shown by the European Parliament in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict for all the people of Sri Lanka.
The Commission shares your concerns about the worrying situation in the country.
It is clear that the situation in Sri Lanka is now at a critical juncture.
However, the solution can only be a negotiated settlement of the conflict.
Following the first round of talks in Geneva in February, the Commission was rather optimistic about the readiness of the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to enter into discussions on the implementation of the ceasefire agreement as a prelude to possible talks on an overall peace settlement.
The Commission is very disappointed that the second round of peace talks has now been put back indefinitely and that there are no prospects for new talks at the moment.
The Commission is very concerned at the recent deterioration in the situation, in particular the suicide attack directed against the army chief, Lieutenant General Fonseka, and the recent rebel attack in northern SriÂ Lanka against a troop carrier and accompanying vessel, which killed 17Â soldiers.
Both actions led to retaliatory air strikes on rebel positions, causing casualties and deaths.
We are clearly witnessing a very serious escalation.
The navy attack was an open violation of the ceasefire agreement by the LTTE and is made more serious by the known presence of Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission monitors.
The European Union has repeatedly condemned violent acts that have caused death and suffering among all the communities.
The European Union has called on both parties to do all in their power to show restraint and to prevent further violence.
These new developments are important for the EU in its role as a Co-Chair of the Tokyo Donor Conference, and we should carefully calibrate our response.
An extraordinary Co-Chairsâ meeting in Oslo at the end of April took stock of the situation.
A new meeting of the Co-Chairs is scheduled to take place in Tokyo on 30 May.
The indications are that neither side seems keen to continue the peace negotiations and go to the planned second round of peace talks in Geneva.
However, neither side wants to pull out completely and be accused of triggering all-out war.
We thus continue to monitor the situation very closely and will explore any opportunity that could help stabilise the situation in Sri Lanka and lead to a peaceful, negotiated resolution of the conflict.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on two motions for resolutions on Taiwan(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, the World Health Organisation exists to safeguard the health of everyone in the world, without exceptions and without gaps.
If, as in the case of Taiwan, gaps are imposed for political motives, that can only assist the spread of disease and cause many preventable deaths and considerable suffering to thousands of innocent civilians.
It is my view that, with all due respect to the Government of the Peopleâs Republic of China and without violating any relevant United Nations resolutions, the 23 million Taiwanese people should, for the sake of world health, be allowed to be represented by their own observers in the WHO.
This would be fully in keeping with the current practice, which allows entities that do not constitute states under international law â such as the Holy See, Palestine and the International Red Cross â to have observer status.
Such representation will not in any way constitute political recognition of Taiwan as an independent state, but would be done solely to facilitate international public health and in particular to prevent the spread of highly dangerous communicable diseases, such as SARS, avian flu and HIV.
So, colleagues, let us put the worldâs health before regional political conflicts, and let us call upon the WHO to show the necessary courage and the Peopleâs Republic of China to show the necessary goodwill and allow the observer status participation of Taiwan to go ahead.
Â Â  . â Mr President, in view of the current context, with the high risk of several infectious diseases spreading across borders, such as bird flu or SARS, it is important that we establish the fastest and most effective possible mechanisms for prevention and response.
All of the regions of the world must therefore participate directly and freely in the international cooperation networks, forums and programmes in the field of health.
23Â million people live in Taiwan, but it is not covered by United Nations protection in the event of the outbreak of an epidemic on the island.
This Resolution therefore urges the Commission and the Council once again to insist that the Chinese Government, taking advantage of the particularly privileged relations we have at the moment, accept that Taiwan should have observer status in the World Health Organisation, or at least in the World Health Assembly.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, we do not let any opportunity pass us by in this House to defend human rights and the great principles of democracy, but when it comes to Taiwan, we take a more flexible approach.
Let us not forget that Taiwan is the only one of the four large Chinese societies in Asia to have both democracy and respect for human rights.
In the Peopleâs Republic of China, there is neither democracy nor respect for human rights; in Hong Kong, there is respect for human rights but no democracy; and, in Singapore, there is democracy but no respect for human rights.
The joint resolution under examination does, however, go far beyond the usual diplomatic disputes.
Our demand, which centres on Taiwan's being granted observer status at the World Health Organisation, is a public health issue of the utmost importance.
It concerns both the 20Â million residents of the island and the entire international community, us included.
Given the issues at stake â among which I will simply mention the dangers of an epidemic that are threatening us â this demand is the bare minimum.
I call on my fellow Members to think about the consequences of our joint resolution, and to adopt it despite the Socialist Group in the European Parliamentâs last-minute u-turn.
I would have welcomed more firmness on this matter from our fellow Members in the PSE.
Even though they claim to be defenders of democracy and human rights, they were sadly unable to resist demonstrating, in this House, their solidarity with their Chinese Communist comrades.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I genuinely regret what I have just heard - after all, we hear it said so often in this House.
We can recognise Taiwan's achievements in the field of health care, as well as its involvement in international activities in that regard.
From a legal perspective, however, it is not possible for Taiwan to obtain observer status at the World Health Organisation.
Only States can have that status.
European policy recognises one China; the European Parliament supports that position.
At the time of our previous resolutions on that same issue, which were adopted in 2002 and 2003, the Commission told us that it would examine the issue of Taiwanâs participating in the work of the WHO, in particular through non-State channels, via an NGO for example.
The Taiwanese authorities are members of the World Medical Association and of the epidemiological training schemes network.
These two NGOs are themselves members of the WHO Global Outbreak and Alert Network.
They take part in the warning system.
Currently, it is wrong to say that Taiwan does not benefit from United Nations protection.
Nevertheless, we can call on China to examine the issue of Taiwanâs contributing to an appropriate field of international cooperation regarding public health.
Â Â  . â Mr President, who would want to endanger their own health or someone elseâs?
Nobody, surely, would wish to do so, but the situation in Taiwan appears to be an exception.
The health of its 23 million citizens, and also that of the many foreigners who live on the island, is in serious danger.
Why is this so?
It is, quite simply, for political reasons that Taipei is being systematically excluded from the activities of the World Health Organisation, and this is an intolerable and shameful state of affairs.
During my visit to Taiwan, I also heard this charge levelled not only by Europeans who think as I do, but also by the indigenous population.
I am prompted to support this clear resolution even more strongly as a result of a very recent development in Taipei â as recent as this week, according to senior European diplomatic sources.
Most of all, the Taiwanese authorities wanted to depoliticise WHO membership.
Their primary aim was âmeaningful participationâ, in other words technical involvement in all WHO activities, precisely as described in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the joint motion for a resolution.
What I expect of the European institutions is the greatest possible effort towards protecting and promoting public health throughout the world.
Even one single unprotected spot â whether it is called Taiwan or something else â puts the world at risk.
Let the Chinese and the non-Chinese take this to heart, now or in future.
Â Â  . Mr President, anyone who is well acquainted with the historical events of the last 60 years knows that it was in Taiwan that heroic Chinese people led by the brave general Chiang Kai-shek fought against the murderous regime of Communist mainland China.
For a long time Taiwan was ruled by authoritarian governments, but these governments were not murderous.
There was no religious persecution, no class persecution and no persecution of religious minorities.
Today, we must not yield to the dictates of Communist mainland China.
We have to give the Taiwanese Chinese the very least they deserve.
Common sense for the sake of the world, for the sake of health and for the sake of Chinese people in Taiwan demands that they should be given the right to belong to international organisations, including the World Health Organisation.
Â Â  Mr President, I simply cannot understand why a country that is democratic, respects human rights and intellectual property, is tolerant of religious beliefs, trades with the whole world and is no threat to anyone should be discriminated against by international organisations which have the good of the whole of humanity as their goal.
The organisation we are talking about is the World Health Organisation.
It is clear that birds carrying avian flu are not interested in the political reasons behind Taiwanâs isolation from the global community.
It is obvious that Taiwan must participate in joint efforts to prevent the spread of this disease.
At the very least, Taiwan must be granted observer status within the World Health Organisation.
May this happen and may it be the start of full Taiwanese participation in international organisations.
Â Â  Mr President, Taiwan is a prosperous, peaceful, democratic country which upholds high standards of human rights and the rule of law and threatens no-one.
Its citizens enjoy some of the best healthcare provisions in Asia.
For some time, going back to the SARS epidemic three years ago, Taiwan has attempted to gain observer status in the World Health Organisation.
Regrettably, the Peopleâs Republic of China has used every available means to block this.
Taiwan deserves better.
It already faces an immensely hostile military build-up by China, which last year passed the anti-secession law, escalating the degree of confrontation across the Taiwanese Straits.
Taiwan, like Hong Kong, is already a full member of the WTO, as the Peopleâs Republic of China saw commercial advantage in having it in the organisation.
Its current opposition to Taiwanâs WHO bid â and of course Taiwan would be a key player in preventing any future bird flu pandemic, should that arise â is frankly inconsistent and makes China look like a big bully.
Â Â  Mr President, I need no lessons in politics from MEPs who have been reported as singing a Horst Wessel song in the past.
I have three points to make.
Firstly, this resolution is an abuse of our Rules of Procedure.
Rule 115 is not intended to be used in this way.
If it were, I would have attempted to raise the issue of the sadly mismanaged primary healthcare trust in west Gloucestershire closing two out of two local hospitals in Lydney and Cinderford.
We all know what this is about: it is an attempt to undermine by creeping resolution our one-China policy â a perfectly reasonable political position, which I do not happen to support.
Let us have an honest debate about it rather than hide within the Trojan Horse of supposed healthcare issues.
The resolution is a serious one: it is true that Parliament has previously supported Taiwanese observer status at the WHA â not the WHO.
Secondly, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network comprises a series of 40 different institutions from amongst the almost 200 Member States of the WHO.
There is no universality, so there is no Taiwan gap.
In fact, a number of NGOs with Taiwanese membership are members of GOARN and, therefore, they have no shortage of information.
Thirdly, given the quarter to half a million Taiwanese immigrants in Shanghai alone who regularly travel between China and Taiwan, it is hard to imagine that the Chinese would take any risks of them bringing in diseases from Taiwan.
Â Â  Mr President, Taiwan is a sovereign nation and its people have worked hard to become a major economic player in Asia.
Through this same hard work and willingness to interact peacefully with the rest of the world, it is becoming a significant economic player globally.
Yet Taiwanâs progress in joining the worldâs community in other spheres is blighted by the Peopleâs Republic of China.
Not allowing Taiwan to join the World Health Organisation â how sad is that?
It is pathetic that the World Health Organisation and other countries cooperate with this embargo on Taiwan.
Hopefully, the EU will get the nerve to say to China, âwe love you, we will trade with you, but we will not cooperate with you or say you are right when you are wrongâ.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that everyone agrees that it is unacceptable that the island of Taiwan should be excluded from the World Health Organisation and from its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.
Nevertheless, since 1971, since the Chinese seat at the United Nations was granted to the Peopleâs Republic of China, the problem has been there.
We are not concerned in this House with settling diplomatic problems, we are talking about health problems.
The World Health Organisationâs statutes do not provide for observer status; we must therefore find and propose compromises that will enable Taiwan to take part in the work done by the World Health Organisation.
One solution would be to go through a non-governmental organisation and, more specifically, a foundation, which would enable the Taiwanese authorities to have a separate delegation from the Chinese one, and thus access to the World Health Assembly.
I will nonetheless vote in favour of the resolution proposed, but I believe that we should not mix up the various problems.
Â Â  Mr President, the threat of a flu pandemic or of other infectious diseases is one of the most serious problems facing modern civilisation.
Infectious diseases such as HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and SARS are becoming increasingly common worldwide.
Not permitting Taiwan to join the World Health Organisation at all exposes the over 20 million strong population of this island to the risks arising from exclusion from the global community.
Taking into account the high quality of the Taiwanese healthcare system, it would also be in the interest of the international community to permit Taiwanese specialists to attend the meetings of World Health Organisation experts to discuss the fight against avian flu.
As far as the aforementioned matter is concerned, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation should include the Taiwanese Centre for Disease Control in the global epidemiological early warning and response network at the earliest possible opportunity.
The European Commission and the Member States should support Taiwanâs application for observer status in the World Health Assembly.
The health of the citizens of Taiwan and of the populations of South-Eastern Asia and the whole world is at stake.
Â Â  â I am disappointed that at the end of this debate there has not been a unanimous position on this issue in Parliament.
I regret the fact that the legal issue relating to the formula in ArticleÂ 3 is not the wording that enabled us to reach consensus.
In any event, I hope that this lack of consensus does not undermine what was said by the previous speaker MrÂ Pionior, with whom I agree completely.
There is a public health problem of the highest importance.
It is vital to ensure that Taiwan is brought completely into the world protection network, because it is not just the 20Â million people who are at higher risk â we all face greater risks if the island remains outside our system.
This is our fundamental concern and I hope that the Commission is equal to the task of addressing it.
Â Â  . Mr President, after nine fruitless efforts to join the World Health Organisation as an observer, Taiwan has indicated that it is now considering lowering its ambitions and asking instead for meaningful participation in the work of the WHO.
That means that Taiwan has decided that, in this area, substance and pragmatism are more important than legal form.
That is the position the EU supports.
In May 2004, the Irish Presidency, explaining why the EU did not support a vote on the issue of Taiwanâs observer status in the WHO, asked the WHO Secretariat for Taiwanese officials to be involved in technical work and meetings of the WHO where appropriate.
The Irish Presidency referred to the WHO principle of the âenjoyment of the highest attainable standard of healthâ as one of the fundamental rights of every human being and also to the precedent that had been created by the involvement of and practical cooperation with health officials from Taiwan during the SARS crisis, which could serve as an example.
In particular, in view of the arrival of avian influenza and the risk that implies, the Austrian Presidency, after discussion with Member States and the Commission, again took up the issue of practical cooperation with the WHO.
Subsequently, on 2Â May, EU representatives in Geneva had a very constructive meeting with the Director-General of the WHO.
In fact, over the last year, representatives from Taiwan have participated in a number of technical meetings taking place under WHO auspices.
Our clear understanding is that the WHO Secretariat is prepared to further explore possibilities for Taiwanâs meaningful participation in the technical work of the WHO.
We can only welcome this and will follow the matter with great interest.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, given that yesterday the Government of Sri Lanka announced the formation of a Human Rights Commission, could we make an oral correction to our joint resolution?
Paragraph 11 of the resolution states: âCalls on the Commission and the Government of Sri Lanka to ensure the reactivation of Sri Lankaâs Human Rights Commissionâ.
We would like to replace that with the following: âWelcomes, therefore, the announcement of new members of Sri Lankaâs Human Rights Commissionâ.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 18Â May 2006.
Â Â  I am delighted to inform you that a Delegation from the Maldives Parliament is present in the official gallery.
Also present in the official gallery are members of the Delegation from the Mexican Parliament, made up of a group of senators and deputies, as well as MrsÂ AminetuÂ Haidar, winner of the Juan MarÃ­a BandrÃ©s PrizeÂ âŠ
âŠÂ for the defence of the right to asylum and solidarity with Saharawi refugees.
Â Â  Before I give the floor to the Prime Minister of Belgium, I must pay tribute to the victims of the terrible earthquake that has taken place in Indonesia, with almost 6Â 000 dead, 20Â 000 injured and between 100Â 000 and 200Â 000 people affected.
I have expressed our solidarity to the Indonesian Government and I am delighted that international aid â European aid in particular â is being mobilised quickly in order to help those affected by this latest tragedy.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would ask you to give me the floor on the basis of Rule 34 of the Rules of Procedure, which relates to the examination of respect for fundamental rights.
I should like to request, on behalf of the leaders of the groups MrÂ Wurtz, MrsÂ Frassoni, MrÂ Watson and MrÂ Poettering, that the agenda of the next session of the Conference of Presidents should include those incidents that, in the past few weeks and months, have particularly worried all of us in the European Union, namely the increase in xenophobic, racist and, in particular, homophobic violence in the European Union or targeted at EU citizens.
We are particularly concerned about the fact that a leading Member of a governing party in one of the EU's larger Member States, the deputy leader of the Catholic League of Polish Families â who is now the deputy leader of the main governing party of Poland â has openly advocated violence against homosexuals who want to exercise their right to demonstrate in Warsaw.
It is unacceptable for leading representatives of the government of a Member State of the EU to behave in that way.
I should like to take advantage of the presence of Prime Minister Verhofstadt, who is one of the most tolerant Heads of Government in the Union, and who consistently defends the citizens' civil rights, to appeal to you as President of the House: let us consider how we in the European Parliament can counter the fact that, every day, the Right in Europe goes one step further to test how far they can go in provoking civil society.
We have had enough â we can no longer accept the provocation, whether it comes from the in Belgium, the in France, the League of Polish Families in Poland or the Nazis in Germany.
Let us discuss how we can signal our opposition to this.
Â Â  Mr President, just as MrÂ Schulz referred to Rule 34 of the Rules of Procedure, I believe that I, on the basis of that same Rule, am equally entitled, since all MEPs in this institution have the same rights, to say that I regard it as a downright disgrace that, to all intents and purposes, undue advantage is being taken â with your permission no less, since you are not intervening â in that a debate, that is, strictly speaking, not on the agenda, is being held where the largest party in Belgium, or at any rate in Flanders, is insulted and maligned, and associated with a murder incident.
This is something I refuse to accept.
I think that you, in your capacity as President, should step in when the Rules are being manifestly manipulated in this Chamber.
Â Â  Mr President, I speak with regard to MrÂ Schulzâs intervention.
MrÂ Schulz, please refrain from interfering in Polandâs domestic affairs, as we do not interfere in Germanyâs domestic affairs.
Â Â  Do not use points of order to hold debates amongst yourselves.
MrÂ Schulz has referred to a Rule of the Rules of Procedure which allows Members to speak in order to draw attention to a human rights issue during the examination of a legislative proposal.
The subject is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the future of Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, our sitting today is innovative, because the Prime Minister of Belgium is here, who has been invited to speak to plenary in order to contribute to the political reflection in which the European Union is currently immersed.
As you know, normally Heads of State only speak to plenary at formal sittings which are not followed by a debate, or when they are Heads of Government of the country holding the Presidency of the Union.
Nevertheless, we have decided to invite those Heads of Government who wish to take part in the debate on the future of Europe and to listen to their views on it.
Today we have the honour of receiving Mr Verhofstad, the author of a short but striking book â 'The United States of Europe' â which makes a significant contribution to the current debate.
I would also like to point out that Belgium has just completed a parliamentary marathon to ratify the Constitutional Treaty, since that country has had to obtain the assent of seven parliamentary assemblies.
There is no doubt that at the next European Council important decisions will have to be taken with regard to the issue that has brought us together today.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Prime Minister.
Thank you for your extensive and penetrating speech.
The chairmen of the political groups will speak next and then you will have the opportunity to respond to them.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Prime Minister Verhofstadt, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 455Â million people now live in the European Union, many millions more than the populations of the United States of America and Russia combined.
Soon there will be almost 500Â million people in 25, then 27 and later perhaps even more countries.
I must say that, whenever I leave Europe and then return, I always have a profound feeling of gratitude to be back in Europe, because there is no other continent with as much diversity â including cultural diversity â as the continent of Europe and the European Union.
However, this continent is also a difficult one â just think how many parties are represented here in the European Parliament and how we continually need to work to reach joint results.
I should like to say, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that, in our opinion, the Treaty of Nice cannot form the basis for leading 500Â million people into a brighter future.
We must go further, and we therefore welcome today's debate.
A debate should result in people listening to each other, understanding each other and, hopefully, reaching joint results.
I am therefore pleased that Prime Minister Verhofstadt is here today, and it was always the three Benelux countries that gave the greatest impetus to Europe.
I hope and expect that, at the end of this process of strengthening the substance and the principles of the European Union, the three Benelux countries â not just Belgium or Luxembourg, but the Netherlands too â will be at the forefront of European development.
Immediately following Nice, the European People's Party said that Nice was not enough, and we had some very frank discussions with President Chirac in Strasbourg in December 2000.
At our congress in January 2001, we in the European People's Party drafted a resolution saying that we want to go further, we want a new conference, and we want, if possible, a constitution, a constitutional treaty.
Perhaps the name 'constitution' was too ambitious for many people.
That may well be the case, and we must look into it carefully.
I would remind you of what MrÂ Juncker said last Thursday when he deservedly received the Charlemagne Prize of Aachen: it is not acceptable for the Heads of State or Government of the countries of the EU to spend Monday to Saturday talking down the European Union and Brussels, and then to expect there to be a good result in referendums and plebiscites on Sunday.
This is unacceptable, and that is why we call on all governments in the European Union to depict Europe as it really is â with both its positive and negative developments.
We in Europe have got used to always just talking in negative terms: for many people, the glass is always half empty instead of half full.
MrÂ Verhofstadt, you referred to 1Â MayÂ 2004, when eight formerly Communist East European countries â Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were occupied by the Soviet Union â acceded to the European Union, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia.
It is not the European Union that has expanded, but its force of attraction.
Its strength in peace, freedom, democracy and the rule of law was the force that attracted these countries, so that they ultimately became Member States.
We should publicise this as a really great success for European development.
Let us take the Euro: we are quite justifiably discussing the stability of the Euro.
Much of this discussion has been presented very negatively, including in connection with the reform, and it certainly is a considerable challenge.
However, just imagine we did not have a common European currency.
Where would we now stand in the globalisation process if the countries of the European Union were still devaluing their currencies to give themselves an export advantage in the European Union?
Europeans would be set against each other, and it would take away from us any chance of being competitive on a global scale.
So let us be positive about Europe!
I have just been talking to the Dutch Minister for European Affairs.
I found it very enlightening to hear him say that, in an Internet survey in the Netherlands, many of the participants said that we needed more Europe, for example with regard to internal security, agreements on immigration and the major issues of asylum.
It is therefore our common task to find a way, through discussions and then decisions, of turning the substance and principles of the Constitution into political and, in the first place, also into legal reality.
MrÂ Verhofstadt, I welcome your statement that the ratification process should continue.
We should also particularly like to thank Estonia for having ratified the constitution a few days ago.
We would encourage Finland to continue with the ratification process â the leaders of the groups will be going to Helsinki tomorrow.
I would also say to our Polish friends and partners that you have a good point on the issue of energy.
You are quite right to expect solidarity when it comes to energy supplies.
Solidarity applies to all the countries in the European Union, but Poland, too, must exhibit solidarity when it is a matter of our future, on the basis of a treaty, a constitution, that gives us a prospect for the future.
Solidarity is not a one-way street, but a two-way process, and it applies to all Europeans.
Let me conclude by saying this: our group is deeply committed to subsidiarity, and subsidiarity includes local, regional, national and European levels.
The local level and the lower levels in the sense of 'close to the people' need to act when they are the best ones to do so, but the European Union needs to act when the nation states can no longer act, when they are too small to solve the problem.
It is therefore our duty to make the path, the principles and the foundations of the Constitutional Treaty a reality.
We must find common solutions, in all 25 countries and here in the European Parliament too.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your speech, MrÂ Verhofstadt.
You said that we need courage, and I thought that your speech was very courageous.
I have seldom heard a member of the European Council be as critical of the institution as you have just been.
It is true that the crisis in Europe is also, in part, a crisis of the European Heads of State and Government.
I promise you â and this is something I say frequently â that in future I will say: it is, in part, a crisis of the European Heads of State or Government minus MrÂ Juncker and MrÂ Verhofstadt.
It is quite clear that both you and MrÂ Juncker, in what you have said here and in what he said last week, are demonstrating a clear commitment.
It is a commitment not just to strengthening integration or to expansion; you have made a commitment to a fact that should really go without saying for a Head of State or Government, namely that you stand by what you say and do.
In Rome, all of the Heads of State or Government who sit on the Council and take part in the summit ceremoniously â there could hardly have been more ceremony â signed this treaty, but some of them then went home and acted as if they had no idea where they had been.
That is one aspect of the crisis surrounding this constitution.
It is very much to your credit that you have stood up for it so clearly.
I can tell you that I should have liked to have heard a speech like the one you gave today from certain leaders of other institutions in Europe.
I should like to discuss two elements to which you referred directly, MrÂ Verhofstadt.
The question of whether we will get 20 'yes' votes, and how we should deal with the two 'no' votes, is an important one.
We now have 15 states.
We very much welcome the fact that the Finnish Presidency of the Council has stood up and said: no, for us the constitution is not dead.
MrÂ Vanhanen is doing what you are doing.
My government says that he has signed the constitutional treaty; we want our Parliament to decide.
That is the logical and normal way to go.
The Estonians ratified the constitution a few weeks ago.
I do not see why we could not achieve the figure of 20 so that the agreement between the Heads of State or Government to which you referred â not the agreement by the European Parliament, but the agreement by the Heads of State or Government â can enter into force.
Therefore, we cannot give up on the Constitutional Treaty, and it is reckless for senior representatives of the European Union to say 'let us think of something else' rather than first of all following the ratification process through to the end.
That was an important statement that you made to Parliament today.
You also referred to another particularly important point.
The issue of how we in the European Union even assess what has happened differs from one political camp to another and from one country's political class to another.
There is one thing I am sure of, though.
This morning, MrÂ Poettering, I also spoke to the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, Atzo NicolaÃ¯.
Surveys in the Netherlands show that the vast majority of Dutch people are in favour of the European Union.
The same people who said 'no' in the referendum, when they are specifically asked whether they want more Europe, say 'yes'.
They want more social protection, more environmental protection and more stability.
Why, then, did they not vote for this Constitution, which provides more social protection, more environmental protection and more stability?
They must have their reasons.
Of course, it is partly due to problems in the EU, but it is also due to domestic politics in these countries.
I am pretty sure that, if MrÂ Chirac had said to the French people that he would resign if they accepted the Constitution, there would have been an overwhelming majority in favour of the Constitution in France.
I am quite convinced of that.
Perhaps that is how to get the Constitution accepted in France.
However, it is quite clear that there is a connection between the depression in certain Member States and the fact that their populations rejected the constitution.
We cannot deny that, but, given that it is the case, it also sharpens our eye for those people who said yes.
It also makes us more acutely aware that courage is worthwhile, because one head of government in Europe did put his political fate on the line for the constitution â MrÂ Juncker said to the people of Luxembourg, 'I believe that, in the long term, more Europe is the only way that we can keep our small country as socially, economically and ecologically strong as it is today.
I am absolutely convinced of that.
If you have a different opinion, if you think that Europe needs to be administered differently, then you need to find a different Prime Minister'.
So, he linked his fate with that of the constitution, and thus won his people over to the constitution in a referendum just a few weeks after the 'no' votes in France and the Netherlands.
I think you are right, MrÂ Verhofstadt.
Europe is lacking in courage.
Nobody has the courage to say 'I have a conviction, and I am prepared to put my political fate on the line for this conviction'.
Members of the European Council have taken the decision to stand before their parliaments and say 'even though the overwhelming majority of the population is against it, we must send soldiers to such-and-such a place, because there is no other way'.
They could do that, they managed to push through their conviction there; I will make no comment on that here.
I should have liked them to apply the same energy to the European Constitution and to say, with the same energy, 'I will fight for my conviction, just like we fought for other projects'.
If they had done so, Europe would have got much further.
I am grateful to you, and I am firmly convinced that, if there were more Verhofstadts in Europe, we would make much more progress.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is hard to respond in just four minutes to such a tour de force about the future of Europe.
My group welcomes the presence here of Mr Verhofstadt, both as a prime minister and as one of the major architects of European reform.
As you recognised, Prime Minister, in the Laeken Declaration in 2001, the European Union has been talking more to itself than to its citizens.
Yet five years after your Presidency, the task of reconnecting Europe with its citizens still shows too little evidence of progress.
Indeed, just yesterday a survey showed that 82% â more than four in five â of our fellow citizens feel that government at European level fails to communicate with them.
Despite the year-long period of reflection â and eight months into the Commissionâs much vaunted plans â little has been broadcast beyond the bastions of the Berlaymont.
However, the same survey might hold the seeds of hope, for though Europe may not be brilliant at communicating what it does, that survey shows that our citizens still trust the European institutions to do it.
In fact, more of them trust the European institutions than their own national governments.
So here is Europeâs mandate from the people: a mandate to deliver the reforms needed to meet challenges like energy security, migration, climate change and organised crime, which individual Member States struggle to deal with under the current set-up.
Greater coordination of economic policies, as you recommended, MrÂ Verhofstadt, would certainly help, as would greater defence coordination.
Mr Barroso has pointed to the need for practical achievements to reinforce our links with citizens and rally them to our cause.
But this âEurope of Projectsâ can never get off the ground until Member State governments explain to their people what they are doing together in Brussels and why, and until we give the Union the money and the legal powers to push through initiatives like the common energy policy, which faces an uphill struggle against blocking forces in the Council, as too do many other initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs, for example, where the absence of qualified majority voting so often results in stalemate.
Quibbling over the clause in the Treaty will resolve little, and change rests, in any case, on the same unanimity which has led to inaction up to now.
As you said, Prime Minister, it is the Constitution â as practical as it is ideological â that can best put the institutional building blocks in place to move Europe forward.
It is all very well for Mr Schulz to rail against it, but it was his Socialists in France who helped to kill the Constitution in that referendum.
We need to make our period of reflection a period of analysis, producing proposals on how to proceed.
This monthâs Interparliamentary Conference on the Future of Europe kick-started the process.
Todayâs sitting is the logical extension, and let us hear more debates with national leaders.
On Europe Day, Estonia became the fifteenth state to ratify the Constitution and Finland will soon follow.
To me, that Treaty looks far from dead, and with the political courage of leaders like Guy Verhofstadt, Angela Merkel and Romano Prodi â leaders committed to Europe â then Europeâs future is surely brighter.
As the Prime Minister told us, we have a lot of work to do.
However, we have the people of Europe behind us in our task, because they recognise, however much some of our national leaders like to deny it, that the big problems we face, the major challenges of globalisation â population growth and migration, climate change, internationally organised crime â cannot be dealt with by nation states built on the 18th-century concept of military industrial power; they require us to overcome our tribal and our religious hatreds and to work together for the future of all our citizens on a planet which we share with others.
Â Â  MrÂ Verhofstadt, thank you very much for being here with us today because, in this period of generalised siesta that has, alas, also taken hold of the Commission and Parliament, I am delighted that you have brought the debate on the future of Europe here to us.
We also hope that your generous efforts will help us, together with the other European Union Member States and our institutions, to bring a glimmer of enlightenment to this constant crisis.
We substantially agree with your vision for the institutions and we endorse what you have said about Lisbon.
We can even agree on the fact that ratifications should continue, but we also think that it will be impossible to make France and the Netherlands accept the existing text and, moreover, your two-pronged strategy falls down, in our view, on the weakness of the political solutions.
We are trapped in a perfectly obvious contradiction.
If the European Union is to be loved by its citizens, it has to show them that it works, but in the last few years no great initiative has been taken on the environment issue, the jobs issue, peace, development, human rights or the integration of new citizens.
Thus there is only one thing to say: institutions and policies are indissolubly linked, and that is where we no longer agree with you.
The majority of our citizens cannot be won over by the idea of a federal, democratic and peaceful union, based on thoroughly disquieting examples like the United States, China or India.
Furthermore, neither the Socialists nor the Greens who did not vote for the Constitution will be won over by the idea that we must keep up with the growth seen in the United States, China or India, because such growth results in poverty and the consumption and wastage of resources.
I could not help noticing, MrÂ Verhofstadt, that in your speech you did not once mention the considerable environmental and ecological challenges that we are facing.
That, unfortunately, may be a sign that the departure of the Greens from your government has perhaps led to a slight reversal in your thinking about the sustainability question.
Sadly, we also think that to talk about a European army in a situation in which we Europeans shilly-shally in most crises and are forced to follow the United States â and in which our credibility on all human rights issues and on the peace and disarmament question is rapidly losing momentum â clearly, to talk about an army is perhaps too great a leap forwards, and one that we do not endorse.
MrÂ Verhofstadt, we are of the opinion that a European Constitution is in fact necessary and that we have to find a way to win the citizensâ support for one, but we shall certainly not be able to do so with more market, more liberalisation and more firepower.
We shall only succeed by genuinely changing Europeâs policies with a view to greater sustainability.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should like, if I may, to make a preliminary remark, since we are inaugurating a series of new-style debates today.
I believe that it is impossible to respond seriously, in three or four minutes, to an speech that lasts three quarters of an hour and that is also in-depth.
In my opinion, the procedure needs to be revised.
I have a great deal to say about some of the ideas put forward by MrÂ Verhofstadt.
For example, about the idea of putting the Unionâs crisis down mainly to a question of method, which is not federal enough in his opinion, by choosing to overlook the content of the economic and social decisions taken.
That is an analysis that I regard as inadequate and that my group does not support.
Or, indeed, about the idea of introducing, in the name of a form of social and economic governance, maximum social levels alongside the minimum levels that already exist.
I do not really understand his reasoning, which seems to me, in any case, to be heading in the wrong direction.
I have a great deal to say, too, about MrÂ Verhofstadtâs appeal for a military Europe and for that military Europe to be thoroughly integrated into NATO, an appeal with which we do not associate ourselves.
I will not be able to expand on these various points now, because I would like to address another point that I feel MrÂ Verhofstadt glossed over.
It concerns what is, in my opinion, our main problem today: I am referring to the reasons for the widening gap between Europeans and the Union.
The results of the Commissionâs consultation do reveal to us, however, some precious information about the cause of this disaffection, and I should like to mention three examples.
Firstly, 47% of the people polled as part of this consultation see globalisation as a threat to jobs.
In October 2003, 56% regarded globalisation as a good opportunity; 20% fewer of them think the same today.
Yet, in October 2003, Europe was no more federal than it is today.
Here is another result: what do the people polled think about the role played by the European Union in fifteen or so areas ranging from environmental protection to the fight against terrorism, via social policy, with the protection of social rights only appearing at the end of the list?
They gave these areas a satisfaction rating of 4.7 out of 10.
That has nothing to do with the Unionâs being more or less federal.
As regards Europe's ability to combat unemployment, which was consigned to the bottom of the list, the satisfaction rating is 3.8 out of 10.
This figure, I would point out, is the average across the 25 Member States.
How would you rate the educational performance of a pupil scoring 3.8 out of 10 in a core subject?
That is how people perceive Europe's current ability to deal with the problems linked to globalisation.
I believe that that is the main problem.
We cannot cleverly sidestep it.
Finally, what, in the eyes of most of the Europeans polled, is â and I quote â âthe key element for the future of Europeâ?
The most popular answer: to achieve comparable living standards throughout the Union.
That is the opinion of 51% of those polled in the 25 countries and of as many as 74% in the new Member States.
Our new fellow citizens obviously have no desire for their countries to form a kind of low-cost or cut-price Europe, which business communities long for.
To summarise, globalisation is perceived as a threat to the social model, and the single market is not seen as an answer to this fundamental problem.
These concerns will not be alleviated by the project of a barrier-free transatlantic market, which is on the agenda of the next European Union-United States summit.
Sidelining this section of the debate once again will not help us, in my opinion, to break the deadlock.
It is only by accepting real changes, not only institutional ones, but also ones related to economic, social and political lines of action, that we will have the opportunity to breathe life back into the European dream.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrÂ Wurtz.
In future debates of this kind we shall consider a more consistent way to allow the chairmen of the political groups to speak.
For now, however, we must distribute the time in the manner we had planned.
Â Â  . Mr President, to call this a debate about the future of Europe is frankly farcical.
What we have here is rather the self-serving political elite talking amongst themselves. They could not be epitomised better than by a person like Mr Verhofstadt.
I must say I find it a bit rich for the Prime Minister of Belgium to come along here and tell 24 other nation states what they should do.
I say that because perhaps he ought to look a bit more in his own back yard.
The most recent opinion poll in Belgium â or should I say in Flanders â shows that 51% of people there favour independence from the Belgian state.
The Vlaams Belang is now the biggest political party in Flanders.
Is it, Mr Verhofstadt, because you are so embarrassed and ashamed that your own country is falling to pieces, that you come along here to encourage the rest of us to self-destruct as well?
I am not sure.
I suppose there was at least a certain honesty about your speech, because you are an unashamed Euro-nationalist.
You could not give a damn what ordinary people think.
You could not give a damn about the referendum results in France and in the Netherlands last year.
You said yourself today â in that most incredibly arrogant speech â that the whole process of political integration will continue regardless of what the people say.
What you are doing is threatening the very basis of national self-determination and democracy.
In the last century, this principle was thought to be so important that if you look in your own back yard, you will see the graves of many British soldiers who went to defend that very principle, on which you now seem to have turned your back.
It was clear last year!
What is it about you, Mr Verhofstadt?
What part of the word ânoâ do you not understand?
Â Â  Calm down, MrÂ Schulz, calm down.
Please argue amongst yourselves outside of the Chamber when the sitting is over.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for coming and for starting what is a very important debate, despite the fact that I would not agree with some of his ideas and conclusions.
The essence of the best idea and the best debate is when you have divergent opinions, coming together to try and garner the best from the situation.
A number of key elements that were mentioned by the Prime Minister in his speech are deserving of more in-depth analysis and comment.
However, if I may be so bold, I would like to touch on two or three elements.
With regard to the situation of whether or not the people want Europe or Europe, I would never dare to speak on behalf of all the people of Europe.
However, I can speak on behalf of the people in my constituency in the south-west of Ireland, whom I met last weekend.
Out of the 4500 people I met last week in Ireland, 3000 of them brought up issues of European concern that they wanted to see solved.
Amazingly enough, for all the issues that they brought up, they saw that the best way of getting a solution was at a European level â not at a national level â because they saw there was a bigger picture involved.
These issues involved the environment, fisheries, free trade and so on.
They saw their best hope of advancement on all of these issues coming from a European level.
People want more Europe in certain areas, but if you tell people in the world, or people in Europe, or people in my country, that they will be part of a European army; that their taxes will be determined by Brussels; that they will have no say with regard to what kind of a police force they will have, they will reject it out of hand.
This is not because they dispute the argument or the veracity or the genuineness of the argument put forward, but because they see those as red-line issues.
They see those as issues that are best dealt with by the people in their own country.
One of the most important issues we have to discover is not to go down the simple road of saying âyou are either for a federal Europe or against itâ.
Personally, I am against a federal Europe.
The kind of model that has been successful for Europe has been one that we have created ourselves.
It is not something that has been copied from some other model.
It has been a creation out of necessity â the necessity that we now face before us.
You touched on it yourself, Prime Minister, during your own questions concerning economics and other areas.
The discussion is now taking place.
Decisions will have to be taken at some stage in the short term, not in the long term, and such decisions will subsequently need to be properly implemented.
The Foreign Ministers in Vienna last week were correct when they said it was wrong to call this document a Constitution, because it is not a true Constitution in its right form.
Call it a for a new Europe, but not a for a new Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, the presence here of the Belgian Prime Minister, MrÂ Verhofstadt, and the speech he made as part of this debate illustrate perfectly, in fact, everything that is fundamentally going wrong in the European Union, for indeed, the real problem in Europe and with Verhofstadt is that the so-called statesmen no longer display even the most elementary democratic reflexes, are no longer prepared to listen to the people and electorate and are, instead, convinced that they, in their ivory towers, know best.
In fact, we had another glowing example of this only a few minutes ago.
MrÂ Verhofstadt is now urging his European colleagues to ignore the devastating results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands and continue to act as if nothing is wrong.
Although MrÂ Verhofstadt is keen to get noticed as the champion of public involvement via referendums, he has not dared organise the promised referendum in his own country.
Indeed, MrÂ Verhofstadtâs public involvement cannot be organised until he is certain of being right and not at any risk of losing.
This European democratic deficit is at its most obvious in the case of Turkey, which threatens to paralyse the entire European system.
Europe has not run aground as a result of the outspoken, proper and well-founded distrust of the voting public in the Netherlands and in France, but rather because of the reasons that underpin it.
Europe is stuck because eminent European statesmen refuse to define the territory of the European Union, refuse to restrict the potential accession of new candidate countries to countries that belong to Europe culturally, geographically and historically, which obviously does not include Turkey.
In fact, Prime Minister Verhofstadt himself is one of the outspoken champions of this Turkish accession and refuses any referendum or democratic input on that subject.
A month ago, that other ivory-tower sage, MrÂ Barroso, the President of the Commission, said that he could see no reason why a debate about the European boundaries should be held, on the grounds that such a debate could not lead anywhere.
As it happens, the opposite is true.
Only when the European citizens are reassured that Europe has boundaries, only when they know that their Europe is restricted to countries that have a common basis, something that is essential to them, only when the European citizens discover that their statesmen are once again prepared to listen to their voices and prepared to respect the outcome of democratic referendums, only then, and not before, can European recovery set in.
I would like to repeat that in that sense, it was good and symbolic that it was none other than MrÂ Verhofstadt, the man who, in his own country, represents only 15% of the voters, that it was he who should come here to represent the eminent, pedantic eurocrats who are never prepared to listen, that is the role that was made for him.
Â Â  As you can see, MrÂ Verhofstadt, this is a pluralist parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, the other day in my country, a great Europeanist â Fernando Ãlvarez de Miranda â told me that the Europeansâ problem is that they have lost their excitement about Europe.
It is true: we are often Europeans without realising it, and we do not realise what great progress the Union has made; we do not give Europe the credit for it and instead we blame the Union for our little frustrations.
We are now in this period of reflection, trying to demonstrate that Europe works.
As you have said, offering an example, I often wonder whether we are doing the right thing.
For example, we say that Europe must gain legitimacy by creating work; but does Europe â the European Union â have the instruments for creating employment, or are they national instruments?
If we set objectives that do not depend on the Union, but on the Member States, and we do not achieve them, then the Union will pay the price.
I am therefore going to propose to you, MrÂ Verhofstadt â and you can do this, because you are the Prime Minister of your country â that one day you carry out the following test, in order to demonstrate what life would be like for the citizens if Europe did not exist; you could, for example, on 29 May or 1 June, install border posts between your country and France and between your country and the Netherlands, and at those posts you could put customs officers who could ask the French or Dutch citizens for their passports and tell them that their French car insurance was not valid in Belgium and that they have to take out a green card.
And on one day â just one day â you could re-establish the Belgian Franc, and the euro would not be legal tender in Belgium and would have to be exchanged; and, when French and Dutch citizens returned to their beautiful countries, Mr President, those customs offices could make them fill out a form indicating the goods that they have bought in your country.
That would show them what the European Union is, Mr President.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am quite delighted that we once again have a statesman who has a vision of Europe, because part of our problem is all this pussy-footing around, this self-doubt, this half-heartedness, this downright fear of taking further steps towards European unity.
If even political leaders are not committed to Europe, people become disorientated and distrustful.
Therefore, MrÂ Verhofstadt, I should like to welcome you, and to thank you for the vision you presented both in your book and here in Parliament.
You have repeatedly emphasised that the heart of the European idea is political union, not just a huge market.
The European Economic Community was just a detour that we had to take because the Defence Community did not become a reality.
That bears repeating, and the Treaties of Rome were preceded by the Messina Declaration.
I very much welcome the possibility that we might be able to adopt a kind of 'Second Messina Declaration' next spring.
It will not be called that, but the core could be the same: a renewed commitment to the objectives and grand projects of the EU in the coming years and decades.
We also need projects that are attractive to the people.
Once again, we are discussing energy policy.
We know that, in 20 years' time, 70% of our energy will come from imports from unsafe regions.
Why do we not have the courage, as JeremyÂ Rifkin proposed, to launch a third industrial revolution in Europe with a solar hydrogen economy?
We need it all: coal, oil, gas, that is business as usual, but this new basis for an energy revolution would be something that many people could approve of, and I would advise you to adopt something like this at the summit in June.
Â Â  Mr President, personally, I find it very positive and very encouraging to see, at last, a European head of government pleading, committing himself and even campaigning, in an excellent book that I recommend to you, for a revival of European integration.
These days that deserves acknowledgement.
Prime Minister, we agree with your observations.
Europe is experiencing a crisis of vocation, a crisis of inspiration, and, faced with this situation, the European Council cannot simply extend for a year the period of reflection.
It is not a wild rush forward that people need.
What the nations of Europe expect from their politicians is that they put forward a vision and outline perspectives.
Here I should like to say a word about those perspectives.
Firstly, we have, as you keep on repeating, an urgent need for economic governance for Europe.
We have the euro, that is fine, but it is not enough.
If we want to create growth and employment, we all know that we have to go further and coordinate our economic, budgetary and fiscal policies.
Secondly, we have an urgent need for new common policies: I am thinking of research and development, I am thinking of defence, I am thinking of the question of energy and its supply and production, and I am thinking also of the question of migration and codevelopment.
On each of these questions, it would be completely unrealistic, and even misleading, to think or to give the impression that appropriate answers could be found at national level.
Furthermore, we also urgently need a strengthened European presence in the world in order to create at last a new balance.
In order to achieve all that, we shall obviously need to draw up a new Constitution that is shorter, simpler, clearer and refocused on the great principles on which our Union is founded.
This text will have to state who we are and what values and what political project we are defending.
Prime Minister, you have understood what we are expecting from the next Council. It is that, for once, Heads of State or Government should put aside their political scheming and ulterior motives in order to place themselves, quite simply, at the service of the general European interest as a matter of urgency.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Verhofstadt, some thinking is being done in Europe after all, it would appear.
Who would have thought it?
By a Head of Government, in the middle of a pause for reflection; and on the subject of Europe, too.
I would thank you for your intervention and for the clear and courageous language with which you have broken through the governmentsâ deafening silence â or, as some people would say, cacophony â and, in this House and in the middle of the crisis, risen above all the internal political considerations and mutterings about renationalisation in order to speak on behalf of Europe.
To do so is not pleasant, but it is important and significant.
You have resisted the temptation to manipulate the European debate and the motives of those who voted ânoâ.
That is currently the big problem, as I see it.
Almost all the governments now try to attribute to people motives that they did not have, as if those who said ânoâ had done so not in order to vote in favour of a more democratic and more social Europe that is capable of taking action and in order to direct their protest against Europe as it is at present but, instead, in order to demand less Europe.
You have, in actual fact, listened to the people and not only to the other governments, as the British and Austrian Presidencies of the Council did.
You withstood the hubris that persuades us that we were much too quick off the mark with the Constitution, had aimed too high, had asked too much of people and had set our sights too high.
No, you have been one of the very few people to have understood that the opposite is the case.
We were too slow and did not aim high enough.
Our goals were not magnanimous enough and our visions were unconvincing and our compromises too lazy.
That is why you call for the crisis to be solved not by slackening our pace nor by being weary, resigned and demagogic, but by taking a clear step forwards.
Allow me to add just one proposal.
If we could agree to incorporate this step that you propose into a rider to the Constitution, covering many fields including democracy, social powers and individual responsibility for security, then we need not destroy the constitutional process.
Instead, we can show people a clear way forward and a means of progressing further towards a higher goal.
Moreover, we need not allow the ânoâ votes to cause Europe to fail.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Verhofstadt, it is indeed commendable that, with your latest paper and your speech in this House today, you have helped to bring this fatal period for reflection to an end, because â as many of my fellow MEPs have said, and rightly so â it is high time that there was at last further discussion of how Europe is to proceed.
I personally share your vision of a federal United States of Europe.
As a member of the Convention to draft the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and also of the Constitutional Convention, the extent to which this idea is really so much pie in the sky became clear to me, however, in the corresponding debates.
Ideas about how far European integration should now be taken are extremely different, not only between the Member States but also between political forces, indeed even within the political groups, including my own.
In view of all this, I had never expected, when the Constitutional Convention began, what great strides it would be possible to make in deepening integration and how much more it would be possible to achieve in terms of democracy, citizensâ rights and the strengthening of a polity based on social welfare.
The Constitution constitutes huge progress for Europe and, at the same time, reflects the political consensus that has been achieved.
A member of my own party very recently spoke of it contemptuously as old, unpalatable rubbish, but it really is nothing of the kind.
Neither the progress made nor the consensus achieved should be put at risk.
That, MrÂ Verhofstadt, is precisely why I do not share your concept of the eurozone states, nor MrÂ Sarkozyâs alternative concept of what he calls the pioneer group.
In my view, both models are already unrealistic because, in the course of last year, two founder states quite obviously lost the title, âpioneer of Europeâ.
The fact that Commission President Barroso has still not understood the signs of the times is shown by his agenda, which is purportedly citizen-friendly but which, in my opinion, amounts to nothing other than a return to Nice.
I am convinced that it is only as a social Europe that our continent will be equipped to face the future, and on this matter I share MrÂ Junckerâs opinion.
In receiving the International Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen, an award on which I should like to congratulate him, DrÂ Juncker rightly pointed out that Europe would founder if, in the next few years, it did not succeed in becoming a social Europe, for example through having a basic minimum of employeesâ rights, valid throughout Europe.
It is a pity that you have said so little about this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are, today, debating with an honest advocate of a United States of Europe.
He does not hide his goal.
He does not deny the facts.
He has even written a courageous, self-critical Laeken Declaration containing a critique of the EU as it currently exists, and one with which most critics of the EU would concur.
Unfortunately, it was overlooked in the constitutional Convention, and that courage failed him when Belgium was to ratify the Constitution.
That was the end of his desire to get closer to the people through openness and democracy.
The views of the Belgians were not to be heard through a referendum.
The people of Belgium were not to be given the opportunity to vote ânoâ to the Constitution, like the linguistic cousins of the Flemings in the Netherlands or those of the Walloons in France.
The United States of Europe â yes â but not by asking the people.
Take heart, MrÂ Verhofstadt.
Take your colleagues with you in burying this rejected Constitution.
Organise direct elections to a new convention.
