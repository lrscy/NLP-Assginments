We wanted the new countries, which had for so long suffered under Communism, now to enjoy the freedoms brought about by EU membership.
We refused to accept the Social Democratsâ propaganda and demonstrated the nature of real solidarity.
We won the battle, and Sweden never introduced any transitional rules.
Evaluations carried out now show unambiguously that Sweden has not in the least been exposed to the social dumping invoked by the Social Democrats as a scare tactic.
Instead, freedom of movement has only had positive effects on the Swedish economy.
The other countries that did not introduce transitional rules have also had the same experience.
I have to say, moreover, that it was with great disappointment that I learned of several countriesâ decision to extend their transitional rules.
To do so when the scenarios invoked did not materialise is unreasonable.
The only correct thing to do is to refrain from introducing transitional rules, and I hope that, in future, Europe will be influenced more by reason than by fear.
Â Â  We all know perfectly well that the free movement of workers is one of the four fundamental freedoms on which the whole idea of the European Community is based.
However, we also know that this freedom is only valid and fully established only for citizens of the fifteen old Member States, while citizens of the eight new Member States, which became members on 1 May 2004, are subject to the provisions of the transition period and this transition period may last as long as seven years in accordance with the 2+3+2 year formula.
As if this were not enough, according to certain EU directives, in some cases, long-term residents from third countries enjoy rights, which give them a more privileged status than citizens of the eight new Member States, to live and enter the labour market in fifteen EU Member States.
And this means that by demonstrating solidarity with workers from third countries, we are discriminating against workers from the new EU Member States.
As the first transition period ends on 30 April, we have a perfect opportunity to evaluate its consequences and effects on the economies of both the fifteen old Member States and the eight new Member States and to make appropriate decisions.
True, we lack statistical data on immigration in the heart of the Community.
It is difficult to come to objective conclusions, but today, it is already obvious that immigration from third countries greatly exceeds the flow of immigration at the heart of the EU, that is in the fifteen old Member States and the whole of the enlarged EU.
It is also obvious that the countries which opened their labour markets to citizens of the new countries have really only benefited, while the transition periods encourage illegal work, unfair working conditions, discrimination against and exploitation of migrant workers.
I am convinced that the European Parliament must encourage Member States to abolish the provisions of the transition period currently in force, as there are more than enough reasons to do this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, todayâs debate is surely of vital importance as it concerns employment, the economy and the free movement of persons.
It is appropriate to pose a key question, namely should labour markets be opened when there are job vacancies and a shortage of indigenous workers, in other words a shortage of people willing to work?
Allow me to reiterate.
I referred to a lack of people willing to work, not to the unemployed.
Alternatively, should labour markets be opened up so as to generate economic growth, which will lead to the creation of new jobs?
My convictions and experience to date indicate that opening up the labour market of a given country will generate economic growth and new jobs.
We should bear in mind that increased employment and job creation will only be possible if we introduce genuine economic reforms, not just cosmetic changes.
Entrepreneurs need to be convinced of the need for such reforms, but above all we must win over the trade union sector.
Although these changes tend to be painful in the short term, they have a positive effect in the medium and long term.
I shall now move on to a very opportune question, as we are involved in negotiations at WTO level.
To what extent and at what pace should world trade be liberalised so as to achieve economic growth within the EU and create new jobs?
We would then avoid becoming simply an area where imported goods are consumed, with limited capacity for production.
Finally, it is important to prepare for flexibility and mobility of the labour force.
I believe that resources from the national and Union budgets must be devoted to reskilling and training for new occupations.
At present it seems that despite high unemployment, we lack skilled workersÂ âŠ
Â Â  .
I have listened with interest to the debate on Mr Åryâs report and I must say it has been exceptionally far-reaching, throwing light from many angles and many viewpoints onto the issue of freedom of movement for workers.
Allow me to add to the debate one further strand that has not received mention.
A transitional period has formed part of every enlargement of the EU, and every enlargement has been dominated by major fears, and these fears have, in every instance, failed to materialise.
Ladies and gentlemen, the current Accession Treaty therefore provides for a gradual system made up of several stages, designed so that the final stage, in 2011, will be as short as possible.
I am therefore delighted to be able to say now that, from 1 May this year, Europe will be making significant progress towards complete freedom of movement for workers.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to thank you for a debate that has been very serious, very far-reaching and often very sharp â just as befits this serious topic.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The report of Mr Csaba Åry on the transitional system restricting the free movement of workers on the labour market of the European Union refers to the fundamental values of the European Union.
The free movement of workforce is one of the most important fundamental principles of the European Union, and therefore we must reject any restrictions imposed on it, not only from economic, but also from political considerations.
I agree with the statements of the report to the effect that workers coming from third countries should not be granted a more favourable situation than those arriving from EU Member States.
The discriminating regulations in force contradict the political requirement for the strengthening of the European identity.
The knowledge and feeling of belonging to the European Community can only be strengthened in citizens of new Member States if Member States provide equal rights in the area of employment and access to social benefits.
I agree with the proposal calling on the Commission, the Member States, the social partners and the competent bodies of the private and public sector to develop a fair and transparent procedure to ensure that citizens of new Member States can work in all Member States of the European Union without discrimination, for appropriate wages, and with the provision of acceptable health and safety conditions.
Since statistical data clearly show that employing workers arriving from new Member States is not disadvantageous for old Member States, and on the contrary, it actually contributes to their economic development, the antagonism felt by citizens of the fifteen Member States must be reduced by all available means, and the European requirement of the free movement of labour must be laid down in national laws, in accordance with the transitional regulation.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, last week at the Conference of Presidents, the dates for the 2007 calendar were issued.
The deadline for the tabling of amendments was yesterday evening at 19.00.
In this House we have very strict rules that we must have original signatures for amendments to be tabled, but a whole bunch of my colleagues were held up in transit yesterday, did not arrive until after 19.00 and were therefore unable to sign amendments that had been circulated by the Campaign for Parliamentary Reform, amongst others.
I know that you will not be able to change the Rule concerned at this particular point in time, but could you please look at it, because in just about every report we have a decent period of time to table amendments, but on the calendar of our sittings we have no time at all.
Â Â  â We shall look into it, Mr Heaton-Harris.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
(Outcome and other details of voting: see Minutes.)
Â Â  . MrÂ President, as the text has been almost completely eviscerated of its substance, I withdraw my name from the report and call on Parliament to reject it.
Â Â  â Mr President, in the sentence which starts with the phrase 'stresses the importance' and ends with the word 'subsidies', it is suggested that a word be added.
This sentence would therefore be reworded as follows: 'Stresses the importance, therefore, of achieving positive results in reducing and eliminating its domestic subsidies'.
In order not to create confusion and for reasons of grammatical and semantic consistency, it is proposed that this sentence be moved immediately after the sentence which ends with the words 'cotton farmers'.
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of the amendments concerning European coordinators, since we believe that a voluntary and temporary coordination function may fulfil a purpose, especially in the case of cross-border projects.
Â Â  The June List believes that the EU Member States should cooperate on cross-border issues when cooperation contributes added value.
Trans-European energy networks constitute such an issue, and we therefore also voted in favour of the report as a whole when it was debated earlier in Parliament.
Quite a few of the amendments we voted on today are, however, unnecessarily bureaucratic, and the extra cost and the administrative burdens that these would entail are disproportionate to the potential benefits.
We have therefore voted against these amendments.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze on her firm and timely recommendation for a second reading on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks.
I endorse the rapporteur's view that it is necessary to reinstate into the proposal before us the provisions providing for the declaration of European interest and the appointment of a European coordinator for such matters.
These measures are essential for properly completing the internal market for gas and electricity, which would guarantee security of supply.
Also in this regard, I wish to highlight the positions expressed on such matters in recent European Councils.
Â Â  . This is a unique opportunity to show the citizens that we are ready to develop a genuine European energy policy.
We must therefore ensure that we have all the necessary instruments and tools to meet this objective.
The trans-European energy networks will foster interconnections, interoperability and the development of energy networks in the enlarged Europe, and in turn stimulate the effective operation of the internal market.
The construction of the future internal gas and electricity market is perhaps the most relevant objective of the proposal for a decision before us.
Furthermore, the aim is to adapt the guidelines to the new shape of a European Union of 25 Member States, allow funding to be earmarked for projects of common interest, enable the internal market in gas and electricity to be completed, and, above all, to guarantee security of supply by means of interconnections between Member States and with neighbouring countries (south-east Europe, Mediterranean countries, Ukraine, Belarus).
This approach to trans-European energy networks mirrors the approach followed for trans-European land transport networks.
I therefore voted in favour of the Laperrouze report.
Â Â  â Mr President, there is no doubt about the importance of the campaign against undeclared employment as a means of counteracting negative trends in the labour markets, but the free movement of workers â contrary to what was hoped â will not enable us to get a grip on this problem.
Those employers who want to get out of paying social security contributions will continue to do so in the future.
Something else that is dubious is the way in which more and more businesses are forcing their staff into fictional self-employment as another way of attempting to evade standards on wages and minimum social security provision, and we must stop this development going any further.
Over and over again, we ram home the point that an improvement in the employment situation is essential, but, at the same time, the EU encourages workers to be mobile and more flexible, even though studies have proved that the reality is that new forms of work â such as part-time working â do nothing more than share out a scarcely-changing amount of work around more people.
We are not being energetic enough in counteracting these developments, and it is for that reason that I have voted against this report.
Â Â  â Mr President, the MEPs belonging to the Free Democratic Party did participate in the vote on the report (No A6-0086/2006) on the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States.
We did this out of a desire to express solidarity with our colleagues in promoting our groupâs concerns, whilst nevertheless remaining convinced that employment policy is not a matter for the EU, and that this should be dealt with by the Member States rather than by us here in Strasbourg or in Brussels.
If the European Union wants to be successful, it must concentrate on its essential functions, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, which needs, in future, to be taken seriously and adhered to.
Â Â  In principle I am opposed to this type of report in which, on eminently routine matters within a particular policy area, Parliament repeats already known positions and reaffirms its overall good will.
This does not contribute to greater confidence in Parliament, and it legitimises the position of those who want to see ever greater EU intervention even in such areas of policy, in this case employment policy, that should be the province of the individual Member States and be exposed to competition.
I have, however, chosen to vote in favour, and for an important reason: freedom of movement of the labour force.
Those decisions that have permitted transitional rules that discriminate against workers in the new Member States are a flagrant departure from the principle of the freedom of movement of labour and an absolutely disgraceful way of acting towards the EUâs new Member States which have been very enthusiastic about joining the EU.
Experience from countries that have had limited transitional rules, or none at all, has emphatically shown that there is no need for such rules and that the âinvasionâ that certain political leaders had threatened would happen has to no degree materialised.
Rather, there is a need to attract more people who want to work instead of putting obstacles in the way of those who wish to do so.
The need clearly to point all this out and clearly to express Parliamentâs rejection of any form of extension of such obstacles is, for me, a perfectly good reason for supporting the report.
Â Â  . Although the Kovacs report on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, on which we are voting today, raises points relating to equality between men and women and fighting against discrimination, it does not mention what we consider to be the crucial issue, namely that of protecting workersâ rights.
Accordingly, taking account of the National Reform Programmes submitted by the Member States and the measures put forward for complying with these guidelines, we have tabled amendments to the report aimed at making the guidelines more workable and easier to timetable, thus ensuring effective implementation of women's rights, access to high-quality public education and training, the creation of stable jobs with rights, and more public investment in health and housing.
Unfortunately the majority in Parliament rejected our proposals.
We were therefore unable to vote in favour of the report, although we do support some of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
We therefore abstained from the vote on the report, and voted against the legislative resolution on the employment guidelines, which appear to pave the way for openly liberal economic guidelines.
Â Â  . The reports produced by the European Parliament regarding employment and social policies rehash a tiresome vein of European sermonising that, apart from producing a mountain of paper, has had no results at all.
Besides the failure of the Lisbon process, which we see every day, this poorly finished replastering over the guidelines from a decidedly âindecisiveâ decision by the Council is not going to save employment and the economy in France.
The dish proposed tries to please everyone.
It retains the Commission's liberalism, but at the same time states that the European institutions should give themselves greater control over self-governed nations.
To make it more attractive, the whole thing is garnished with good intentions when it comes to protecting the weakest within this monstrous model, which they happily mix up with immigration, and have a history of not putting up with any arguments on this issue.
However, it is precisely on these points that we can find the answer to our problems.
If our economy and employment are going to rise like a phoenix from the ashes, we need to put a stop to immigration for the purpose of increasing the population, pursue policies to increase the birth rate, and apply Community preference and protection in Europe and national protection in France.
Â Â  . The guidelines for Member Statesâ employment policies challenge the EU, rightly in my view, to respond to some of the essential employment issues.
Their concerns rightly focus on the question of those excluded from labour markets, such as younger and older people and other similarly marginalised citizens, either in their own countries or in other Member States.
I feel, however, that there is a balance to be struck between challenging Community and national institutions and advocating appropriate, effective solutions.
The debate on employment policies has a European dimension that should not be overlooked.
This has, in fact, been a constant concern of mine as an MEP, because I feel that reformist synergies need to be created in the European area and that Parliament is one of the most appropriate institutions to achieve this objective.
Â Â  . The primacy of competition is one of the pillars of the internal market and has underpinned the process of liberalisation and privatisation in key sectors such as energy, transport and communications.
This process has been stepped up since 2000 with the adoption of the Lisbon Strategy.
It is clear that what has been implemented thus far has not only failed to bring the promised price reductions, improved access to and quality of services and an end to monopolies; far from it. It has, rather, served to exacerbate unemployment arising from restructuring and mergers of these sectors and the loss of State sovereignty in relation to key areas.
Although the report claims it seeks to combat dominant positions and monopolies, it accepts the guidelines of the Commission report for 2004, focusing on energy and telecommunications, and advocates once again the total liberalisation of the gas and electricity sector, a priority for the March 2006 Spring Council.
Furthermore, in the communications sector, which has already been substantially liberalised, the emphasis is placed on competition in the broadband sector and on the internationalisation of production.
This will make it even easier to relocate production or links in the production chain.
We therefore voted against.
Â Â  . The explanatory statement to MrÂ Lipietz's report is much more instructive than the report itself, which contents itself with heaping praise on the Commission's 'remarkable' work in hunting down the slightest hindrance to free competition.
The explanatory statement expresses regret at the lack of studies into the real effects of Commission decisions or into the dogmatic application of the rules on State aid.
It mentions that the market, in other respects perfectly virtuous, may not be able on its own to achieve certain political and even economic objectives.
It suggests that the liberalisation of certain markets has led to the good old public monopolies being replaced by private oligopolies, thus taking away the benefits without creating any added value for consumers.
Finally, it emphasises the Commission's total lack of self-criticism when its ill-judged decisions lead to economic disasters, as in the Rhodia affair, for example.
The general impression that comes out, however, is that Brussels' competition policy is the expression of the Commission's ultraliberal doctrine against 'economic patriotism', paradoxically put into practice by a nit-picking bureaucracy that continually interferes in business strategies and national policies.
In the context of vicious global competition, that will generate nothing but unemployment.
Â Â  â European competition policy has rules and objectives which will destroy small and medium-sized businesses and allow the European monopolies to take over, by financing and privatising them, rather than consumer interests, as you hypocritically maintain.
Moreover, the word 'competitiveness' is synonymous with greater exploitation of the workers, with the massacre of their rights and with reductions in the reward for labour, when contemporary requirements are increasing.
Legislation on competition is at the service of the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy and its objective is to control, prevent and shrink any subsidies or state aid to satisfy grass-roots requirements which the workers may have extracted with their struggles.
It is a lie that competition helps to reduce consumer prices.
Experience to date has illustrated the opposite: the markets have been shared out, profits have increased for companies and prices have increased for the workers.
Is it not also in the name of competition that young people are being led into sweatshop working conditions which will be extended to all workers?
Young people in France are right to protest and we stand by them.
They constitute the hope for radical change against the exploitative policies of the EU and the governments, which is why we are with them.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to say a few words about Hammerstein Mintzâs report and voting behaviour.
I do support openness, but I am also in favour of a certain degree of realism.
It is perfectly obvious that the Council meetings should be open, but in points 14 and 15 this Parliament voted in favour of the meetings of COREPER, the Permanent Representatives â that is to say the ambassadors of the EU â being open, and those of the Conciliation Committee too.
We can certainly insist on this, but one would assume that the Council also has the right to insist that all our group meetings, preparatory meetings and all meetings of the Conference of Presidents should be open.
I therefore support openness, but I do not think that it is realistic to insist on openness on the part of COREPER.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of Mr Hammerstein Mintz's report on the openness of meetings of the Council when acting in its legislative capacity.
At a time like this, when it is becoming necessary to move towards a political Europe, it is increasingly difficult to understand why the European Council continues to meet behind closed doors when acting in its legislative capacity.
Besides the fact that this position is contrary to Article 1(2) of the Treaty on European Union (Maastricht Treaty of 7Â FebruaryÂ 1992), which lays down the principle of open European decision-making, it also does not provide the openness that our fellow citizens expect from the running of the European institutions.
We will never be able to reduce the divide between the European structures and the people by acting this way.
Pending the ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, the European Council must, as a matter of urgency, reform its own rules of procedure to anticipate this move towards greater openness in its deliberations when meeting in its legislative capacity, whilst maintaining privacy for exchanges between Heads of State or Government.
Â Â  . I abstained from the vote on the openness of Council meetings, because I feel it deals with a false problem.
By forcing the Council to work under the scrutiny of the cameras, we will end up with formal exchanges and backroom negotiations.
All negotiations require a certain level of confidentiality.
Â Â  We are of the view that the Councilâs and Coreperâs meetings must be public when those organisations act in a legislative capacity.
This is an important democratic principle if voters are to be able to hold elected representatives accountable.
Unfortunately, the draft report contains a number of points in support of the adoption of the draft Constitutional Treaty rejected in the referenda in France and the Netherlands.
We have tried to get the relevant parts removed from the report by requesting separate votes on precisely these points.
Irrespective of the outcome of these votes, we wish however to vote in favour of the report as a whole since reforms relating to openness in the Councilâs and Coreperâs work is a priority issue, and we wish to put pressure on the Council to alter its Rules of Procedure.
We are, however, strongly opposed to the way in which, in the context of this important issue of openness, the European Parliamentâs majority has interfered in the debate on the future of the Constitutional Treaty.
Â Â  . This report is a result of the European Parliament Ombudsman's inquiry into the openness of the Council.
The European Parliament Ombudsman considers that the meetings of the Council, when it acts in its legislative capacity, are not open to the public and the Council's refusal to decide to open up these meetings is an instance of maladministration.
This timely report follows on from the British Presidency's call for greater transparency.
Moreover, public opinion polls and statements by NGOs, civil society and the academic world underscore citizens' wishes for increased accountability of their governments regarding EU issues.
I agree it is unacceptable that an important lawmaking body of the EU still meets behind closed doors when acting as a legislator, especially at a time when the EU sees itself as a promoter of democratisation and accountability.
I am therefore in favour of public meetings of the Council to be broadcast and webcast, as well as for official transcripts of the legislative meetings to be issued.
The requested amendments to the Council should be regarded as a long overdue adaptation of the Council to the European reality and institutional equality in lawmaking.
Â Â  . I heartily congratulate my Group colleague, Mr Hammerstein Mintz, on this crucial report, as it cuts to the heart of so many of the problems the EU faces today.
In Scotland where I come from, as in so many countries the biggest confusion about the EU is the lack of transparency and the feeling that the EU is somehow not accountable; and to my mind all of this stems from the Council of Ministers meeting behind closed doors, often in the dead of night.
For an organisation that talks so much about openness, we see little of it in practice outside of this House, and opening the doors of the Council would go so far towards informing the people of Europe about what is being done in their name.
This report is only the start of that process and we must continue to press this crucial issue.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mr Cashman on his important report containing recommendations to the Commission on access to the institutions' texts, to which I lend my backing.
I particularly welcome reference to the need for the Commission to submit a legislative proposal on âthe right of access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, and general principles and limits on grounds of public or private interest governing this right of accessâ.
This proposal must be prepared in interinstitutional debates and must follow detailed recommendations.
We also share the view that the new rules on access to documents should be implemented only after the amended regulation has entered into force, without any retroactive effects.
Â Â  . Since ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty and entry into force of Article 255 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), transparency has become a fundamental principle of the European Union, the primary aim of which is to strengthen the democratic nature of the European institutions.
This report calls on the Commission to create a legislative proposal on the right of access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.
Through this proposal, the report seeks to adhere to the principle of subsidiarity, the fundamental rights of citizens, the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, particularly on Article 8, and Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I am fully supportive of this report as I believe the EU not only has an obligation to be as open and transparent as possible to its citizens; it also has to take a leading role in setting an example to governments and parliaments of Member States as well as to those of accession and candidate countries.
Â Â  . I congratulate MrÂ Cashman on this report and was pleased to support it today.
The problems many Members have had over access to documents have been an issue all across the House and it is only right that we should be starting to address it here.
I only hope we will see the aims of this report backed up by action.
Â Â  â Mr President, in the WTO, the EU is under pressure in various areas.
On the one hand, we will have to accept certain changes in the interests of combating poverty in the poorest countries, while, at the same time, we are not allowed to be too generous in the unilateral concessions we make.
The ACP countries, with their demands for reduced tariffs, risk harm to themselves.
Since that surely cannot be what these negotiations are intended to achieve, I have voted against this report.
At the same time, we have to prevent the threatened lifting of the ban on the import of genetically modified materials from being put into effect.
The European Union has the chance to accomplish this by acting as a strong community on the international stage.
Finally, we also need to resolve without delay the problem with the Chinese imposition of customs duties on motor vehicle components and replacement parts, or else the last car manufacturers will end up leaving Europe and heading for China.
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of the outstanding report by my colleague and friend MrÂ Papastamkos on the assessment of the Doha Round following the December 2005 WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong. I feel that economies, and in particular western economies, should support the Doha development programme, which provides for a kind of open and fair trade that is designed to reduce poverty around the world by helping both developing and developed countries to move forward.
If we do not do this, there will be a high political price to pay, in particular through the rise of extremism.
I welcome the fact that these negotiations have recognised the ability of multilateralism and international trade to create wealth and, in turn, social progress.
We will all be able to see how a unified, strong political European Union can play a prominent role on the world stage in this fight against a situation in which national self-interest prevails over weakened international institutions.
Â Â  . The WTO is now trying to find solutions to problems that would never have existed at all without it and its attempts to force global free trade upon us, regardless of the cost to the people: dumping of all kinds, problems with counterfeiting, access to the market barred to most countries apart from those in the European Union, transparent subsidies (in Europe) or disguised ones (everywhere else, particularly in the United States) that distort competition, and so on.
The global market is a jungle in which the weakest, the poorest, are the targeted victims, and the only region that actually respects the rules of the game, Europe, is a collateral victim.
In order to support the development of the least-developed countries, we must not integrate them into the WTO, but protect them from it.
Like certain Nobel economics prize-winners, we feel that free trade can only benefit all sides when it is between countries at the same level of development, and that trade between other countries needs to be regulated; this, by the way, does not rule out favourable trade provisions for the developing countries.
Neither does it mean that each 'zone' formed in this way needs a common trade policy centralised in the hands of a supranational bureaucracy.
In short, free trade is not an end in itself.
Â Â  This own-initiative report sheds light on the EUâs double standards in international trade policy.
There is a lot of enthusiastic talk about the need for developing economies to open up their markets to European companies.
At the same time, the rapporteur says that EU agriculture has a âmultifunctional characterâ, which there is a âneed to respectâ.
We believe that, in the long term, free trade leads to a better world.
Account must, however, be taken of different countriesâ levels of development.
If, at the beginning too of the development process, trade is to have the effect of reducing poverty, the EU must modify its trade policy by abolishing agricultural aid and allowing poor countries to compete on good conditions.
Because the report for the most part contains negative wordings, we voted against it in todayâs vote.
Â Â  . With this resolution, the majority in Parliament has sought to pave the way for the liberalisation of international trade â in the agriculture sector, non-agricultural products and services â in the current round of WTO negotiations, which it is hoped will be concluded by the end of 2006.
The deepening of trade liberalisation â circumventing the current contradictions or weakening the positions that some of the so-called developing countries have hitherto advocated â would have extremely serious consequences for the workers and for people in general.
Take the example of services.
By 28Â February, either the EU or the USA had submitted applications for the liberalisation of the following sectors: transport (air and sea), audiovisual and culture, information technology, construction, teaching, energy, the environment, telecommunications, distribution, architecture and engineering, postal, financial and legal services.
This means that in relation to these sectors attempts are being made to remove any restrictions to foreign investment, cross-border establishment and provision of services, nationality requirements and limitations on competition.
In other words, attempts are being made to remove mechanisms that are fundamental to less (or more) economically developed States being able to guarantee their development and meet the needs of their people.
This will delight the large economic and financial groups in the EU and the USA, in their exploitative, inhuman greed.
Â Â  . This report on the outcome of the Hong Kong WTO meeting comes at a crucial time, as the negotiations currently hang in the balance.
We voted today to send a strong political signal to the negotiating parties, including the EU, to honour commitments to a successful conclusion of this round geared towards the poorest countries, as agreed at Doha.
As Labour's spokesperson on International Trade, I submitted a number of amendments to this report at its committee stage.
Then, as now, I called for the exclusion of key public services (including water) from liberalisation drives.
On the paragraph relating to NAMA, I called for flexibility in the number and range of coefficients used in formulating tariff cuts, so as to leave adequate policy space for developing countries to choose the rate at which they liberalise.
I voted for a similar amendment today.
On agriculture, whilst I agree with the Commission's assessment that negotiations should be pursued in parallel with those of other sectors, I could not vote in favour of calls by some colleagues for the current EU offer to be made conditional and even retractable.
I believe the current offer should at least be maintained.
Â Â  . The Papastamkos report on the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong has led us to make two remarks.
Firstly, it should not be difficult to understand that international trade has tremendous potential to promote development and prosperity.
On the one hand, the more commercial transactions, the higher the level of dependency and cooperation between the Member States.
On the other hand, the more intense the international trade, the greater the economic prosperity of the various countries, which will help to improve peopleâs living conditions and to make the world a safer place.
Secondly, the inevitable conclusion is that anyone wishing to see a world with more trade and more fair trade, a world in which the rules are complied with, will almost certainly leave the summit disappointed.
As 2006 goes on, we are further and further away from the objective of successfully finishing the round, begun in 2001, by the end of this year.
If this aim is to be achieved, however, we need to reach agreement on the advantages of free trade and on the rules to which that free trade needs to be subject.
Â Â  . This report has been amended so much that it was not possible for me to support it, even though I agree with some of the points.
The aims of the 'Make Poverty History' campaign and the march in Edinburgh last summer have so comprehensively not been met that it is a sorely missed opportunity.
We could have sent a louder, clearer message today to our governments and to the European Commission.
Instead we have virtually endorsed the status quo which I do not want to see continue.
Â Â  . I should like to explain why I ultimately voted against the report in the final vote.
It was because AmendmentÂ 22, which condemned the Commission's insistence on liberalising services within the EU and elsewhere without supporting this with appropriate social and environmental legislation, was rejected.
I fully agree with the fact that no country should be forced to liberalise any service sector and that sectors such as health, water supply, education and audiovisual services in particular must be excluded from liberalisation.
This part of the amendment was narrowly defeated: 291 in favour, 299 against and 20 abstentions.
For that reason, I did not want to vote in favour during the final vote.
Â Â  â Î€he Kommounistiko Komma Elladas voted against the report on the assessment of the Doha Round, because it moves in and repeats the reactionary, anti-grass roots framework of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong and the extravagant claims of Euro-unifying capital, as defined and promoted in splendid cooperation with the USA.
The objective of the ÎU and the USA during the negotiations which are under way is even greater exploitation of the peoples and the wealth-producing resources of the developed, capitalist countries and even more of the developing and less developed countries.
The ÎU and the USA, together with the other imperialist powers, are proceeding with the selective opening of the markets and the abolition of subsidies for agricultural products, to the detriment of small- and medium-sized farms, so that monopoly capital can penetrate the markets of the developing and less developed countries for full control of industrial products, the provision of services and the extortionate exploitation of water, energy and so forth, in order to maximise its profitability.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague MrÂ Garcia-Margallo y Marfil on the situation of the European economy as part of the preparatory report on the broad economic policy guidelines for 2006, which underlines the conditions necessary for sustainable economic growth.
This report is vital for a proper understanding of why Europe is one of the areas of the world, particularly of the developed world, where growth is weakest.
The excessive red tape that makes our economy less flexible, the fact that we do not have enough world leaders and that our small and medium-sized enterprises are progressing less quickly than those in the United States of America, low unemployment levels and low mean working times, and, finally, weak investment in vocational training, research and development: all of this to a large extent explains the current situation.
In the global economic and social competition with which Europe is faced, it is a matter of urgency for the Member States, via their national reform plans, to work with the European Union to create the conditions for achieving the Lisbon objectives that aim to make Europe the strongest economy in the world.
Â Â  . Here we have yet another report on the economic situation; yet another reaffirmation of falsehoods; and solutions simply offering more of the same.
The economic and social situation remains precarious, with increasing inequality, unacceptable levels of poverty and unemployment, and economic growth remaining slow and unstable.
What we are seeing is the financial side prevailing over the actual economy, whereby the emphasis is placed on the need to inspire confidence via the narrow implementation of monetary policy by the European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact, and on the need to reduce taxes for businesses.
These positions are liberalism in its purest form, and we utterly reject them.
What has happened in the name of globalisation?
The rights of the workers and social security have been undermined, greater flexibility in labour markets have been imposed (the magical concept of âflexicurityâ, the CPE (First Employment Contract) in France being a prime example), the increase in the actual and official retirement age has been justified, the liberalisation of the energy sector has been promoted and the liberalisation of services has been called for, thus contributing towards labour deregulation and social and environmental dumping.
This is great news for the economic and financial groups.
As usual it is the workers and the least privileged sections of society that have to bear the brunt of the problems.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  . Just like every year, the European Parliament's report on the broad economic policy guidelines is, in its observations, a catalogue of truisms and, in its proposals, a list of recommendations that Members on both the left and the right of this Parliament will adopt enthusiastically, but that the parties they belong to are careful not to apply when they are in power in their own countries.
Besides this hypocrisy, I should like to underline three points that I found surprising: there is a complete lack of reference to the European Central Bank's unjustified increases of interest rates, which are contributing to the stagnation of the eurozone; the report views the European Union as a perfectly homogeneous area, made up of countries facing absolutely identical problems, while in fact the situation has become extremely heterogeneous since the last enlargement; and the call for European legislation that is 'compatible with that of our competitors' could constitute an unacceptable call for the lowest common social and environmental denominator.
Even if we did not already consider that it was the policies of Brussels as a whole that were largely responsible for our economic difficulties, these three points would have been enough to justify our 'no' vote.
Â Â  . I did not approve the broad economic policy guidelines, which, for a number of years, have done nothing but endorse the EU's liberal tendencies and are at the root of the weak growth, unemployment, uncertainty for employees and the withdrawal of our social protections.
The report does not support any of the guidelines that would allow an alternative policy: maintenance of purchasing power, revaluation of salaries to revive consumer spending and growth, support for ambitious public investment in modernisation and employment, upward harmonisation of taxation and social standards to combat dumping, and the creation of a real economic government that has weight with the European Central Bank.
Â Â  , . â The EU broad economic policy guidelines for 2006 include all the anti-grass roots measures which will bring about higher prices and greater inequality, poverty, uncertainty and unhappiness for the working class and grass-roots classes and greater wealth for Euro-unifying capital.
This has been safeguarded in the National Reform Programmes, so that the noose of capitalist barbarity preached in the Lisbon Strategy can throttle the people quickly and with precision.
There are numerous alibis: the ageing of the population in order to increase retirement ages, energy security in order to privatise the energy sector and convert it from a social to a commercial commodity, reduction in deficits as required under the Stability Pact by 'containing' public spending on grass-roots requirements and salary/productivity links in order to safeguard reductions in wages and pensions.
At the same time, we have tax relief and simplified procedures in order to set up companies, flexible forms of work, lifelong training for market requirements and state aid and research at the service of companies, not the needs of society.
It is the new attack by the ÎU on the working class and young people which only a strong mass movement can rebut; only a strong mass movement can open up new paths by putting into practice the huge wealth which is produced and must be reaped by its creators, the workers, not their exploiters.
Â Â  . I have supported this report in its intention to alleviate the costs for many of the poorest countries for healthcare and drugs.
Whilst I support the intention of AmendmentÂ 3 in alleviating these costs, the amendment is inappropriate as it provides for a blanket limit to all patient protection for products related to this field which could distort markets at a global level and potentially harm further development.
Â Â  . I welcome the thrust of the concerns and recommendations contained in the broad economic policy guidelines for 2006.
At this time, the debate should focus on workable decisions aimed at making the economic environment more conducive to growth, jobs, competition, innovation and wealth creation.
We should not be wasting our energy on peripheral matters or, equally seriously, on what should be self-evident.
The EU Member States, and their political leaders, have a duty to promote a political environment that is favourable to economic reform.
What is urgently needed is discourse characterised by truth, courage and results.
We need to be bold and to challenge our societies to invest in the future and in themselves.
We need to be capable of creating the necessary conditions for that investment to take place.
The future is not necessarily anything to fear.
Yet most European governments appear fearful.
It is because this report rejects that way of thinking and because it comes across as a challenge to take action with workable objectives and proposals, most of which I agree with, that I have supported it.
Â Â  . I voted against the GarcÃ­a-MargalloÂ yÂ Marfil Report because of its support for the Commission's Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base proposal, as stated in paragraph 16.
This CCCCTB proposal clearly sets out the path to tax harmonisation, that great but mostly unspoken threat to Irish prosperity.
Likewise I am opposed to the Home State Taxation scheme for SMEs.
This harmonisation of taxes is directly opposed to the wishes of the Irish people.
If we have a common European corporate tax regime, we will lose one of the greatest factors in maintaining our economic independence and our current state of prosperity.
I see this as the thin end of the wedge to force a common European tax policy on Ireland.
I have to advise the Irish Government to pay careful attention to this space, where our freedom is threatened, and to defend it most vigorously.
It is the refrain from Irish Government circles that: No, there is no plan to harmonise taxes, and if there were, the Irish Government would reject it.
Well, here it is, sticking its nose over the horizon; it's time for you to prove your mettle.
Â Â  . Whilst we support the intention of Amendment 3 to alleviate the costs of healthcare and drugs for many of the poorest countries, this amendment is inappropriate as it provides for a blanket limit to all patent protections for products related to this field, which could distort markets at a global level and, potentially, harm further development.
These issues are best dealt with at the level of the UN and WHO.
The EPLP maintains its position on the issue of corporate taxation, which is not to support a recalculation of the corporate tax base.
Whilst we seek greater coordination of tax authorities in trying to assist SMEs involved in cross-border trade, we acknowledge that this issue remains the competence of the EU Member States.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission communication on the amended proposal for a directive on services in the internal market and Communication on Directive 96/71/EC (posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services).
As everybody knows, this is the amended proposal for the so-called âBolkestein Directiveâ following its first reading in Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, when we debated this proposal at the February part-session I said that the Commission would base its modified proposal on what Parliament voted.
I believe you will see that we have honoured that commitment in the text adopted by the College today.
We have endeavoured to respect the consensus you have reached on some of the key articles.
You will find the amendments you have voted to Article 16 â freedom to provide services â and Article 17 â derogations from freedom to supply services â reflected in the modified proposal.
We have excluded all healthcare from the scope of the proposal and, in line with the commitment given, we will come forward with a separate initiative on the health sector.
The modified proposal also provides for the exclusion of taxation, temporary work agencies, security services and the audiovisual sector from the scope of the proposal.
One issue on scope where we did not follow you is the exclusion of legal services.
The Commission considers this is not required given that Article 3 already provides that in case of conflict between a specific directive and this proposal it is the former that will prevail.
In addition, we have brought the wording on the exercise of an official authority in line with ArticleÂ 45 of the EC Treaty.
We have based the exclusion of social services on the various amendments you adopted in this regard.
I am sure you will agree that any exclusion must be clearly defined, and this is what we have attempted to do.
If we want to avoid diverging interpretation in Member States, then we must provide legal certainty.
The text of the modified proposal specifies that the exclusion from the directive concerns those social services relating to social housing, children and support to families and persons in need which are provided by the state or by providers mandated by the state.
In addition, the Commission will come forward in the next few weeks with a communication on social services of general interest, reflecting the importance these services have for our citizens.
The decision to remove all interaction between the services proposal and labour law has in my opinion been one of the most important elements in creating a more positive atmosphere around this new services proposal.
This has allowed us to move on from the allegations of lowering of social standards and threats to the European social model.
While this perception was wrong, it did not go away, and poisoned the debate on this important proposal.
In any event, the modified proposal is clear in this regard: labour law is completely removed.
As part of the fallout from this, ArticlesÂ 24 and 25 have been removed from the modified proposal.
However, as I said during the debate in February, the Commission would come forward with a communication to address the issues surrounding the posting of workers, which ArticlesÂ 24 and 25 were designed to address.
In a moment my colleague Vladimir Å pidla will outline to you the approach the Commission adopted today.
I just want to add that this communication is a vital element in our efforts to reach agreement in the Council on the services proposal.
There are two other issues in the modified proposal that I want to highlight.
We have clarified in ArticleÂ 3 that all special laws take precedence over the provisions of the services proposal.
In particular, we have made it clear in ArticleÂ 3 that the directive does not affect private international law and that, as a consequence, consumers will in principle benefit from the protection granted to them by the consumer protection rule laid down in the consumer legislation in force in their Member State.
The Commission has also accepted that the professional liability insurance in ArticleÂ 27 should be optional instead of compulsory.
Since the European Parliament voted in February, there has been a growing realisation throughout the European Union that the consensus you achieved was the basis for taking this debate forward.
Heads of Government at the European Council two weeks ago supported this.
We have a window of opportunity for building on this growing consensus.
I want to see the potential for growth and jobs that this proposal will bring realised as soon as possible.
I will now present this modified proposal to the informal Competitiveness Council in Graz later this month.
I feel confident that, with the active support of the Austrian Presidency and Member States, we stand a real chance of making significant progress during this Presidency.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has just adopted a communication containing instructions and explanations for Member States in respect of the posting of workers within the context of the cross-border provision of services.
The communication also includes proposals aimed at helping the Member States to improve the practical implementation of administrative cooperation, access to information and supervising adherence to the directive on the posting of workers.
The Commission announced this communication last February following voting on the Services Directive in the European Parliament, stating at the time that any annulment of Articles 24 and 25, which contain provisions on administrative obstacles to the posting of workers, would be decided on the basis of majority voting.
The removal of these articles should not, however, be interpreted by Member States as meaning that they can introduce or retain excessive administrative obstacles against companies that are posting workers across national boundaries.
The cross-border posting of workers is regulated under Directive 96/71/EC, the aim of which is to harmonise, on the one hand, the right of companies to provide cross-border services, and on the other hand the rights of workers temporarily posted to another state in order to provide services.
The Directive is the main instrument for ensuring the free movement of services, and at the same time the main instrument for preventing social dumping.
The legal explanation approved by the Commission today provides the necessary clarification in respect of which control measures may be used by Member States when monitoring whether the employment conditions set out in the Directive are being upheld.
The aim is to ensure that Member States act in accordance with the principle of freedom of movement for services, while at the same time avoiding social dumping.
The communication provides explanations and instructions for four types of control measure in particular: the requirement to obtain permission, the obligation to have a representative on the territory of the host Member State, the duty to declare and duties in respect of documents dealing with social and employment conditions.
The conclusions of the communication are as follows: the obligation to have a representative on the territory of the host Member State is regarded as somewhat excessive, and it is considered sufficient if some of the workers â for example a manager â are appointed as contacts for the relevant authorities in the Member States.
It is not considered reasonable that the duty to make a preliminary systematic declaration should be applied only on the grounds that a posted service is involved; the duty to retain documents is, of course, acknowledged, but this should apply only to documents that are absolutely necessary and which enable the authorities in the Member State to carry out effective support and control activities.
It does not apply, for example, to social insurance documents, because these are dealt with under Directive 1408/71/EEC.
It was also concluded that it is reasonable to request the preliminary notification of activities.
Notifications must be made no later than the day on which the activities commence.
The Commission intends to have easier access to information on employment conditions for workers and companies, and improved levels of cooperation between intra-state authorities.
It is also essential to improve the resources available to workers and companies, in order to ensure the effective enforcement of employee regulations.
On the basis of a study into the operation of the Directive which the Commission carried out and which can be found in the report from the Commission unit, we concluded that there is still much room for improvement in all areas, and the communication contains several proposals specified by the Member States for addressing these shortcomings.
These include improvements to websites and other information resources, further resources for contact points and the bodies responsible for supervising the use of the electronic data transfer systems and improving contacts between work inspectorates.
I regard as fairly important the suggestion that it is right for Member States to include in the information they provide details of the responsibilities that firms posting workers must fulfil, and not just general references to the employment law or legal system that applies in the Member State in question.
Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that the Posting of Workers Directive â provided it is applied correctly â constitutes an adequate and robust instrument for ensuring, on the one hand, the prevention of social dumping, and on the other hand, the free provision of services.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is not entirely dissatisfied with the state of affairs in respect of the services directive.
In November, we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection sounded the right note by holding out the prospect of a solid and even-handed document, and that is what was actually delivered.
Encouraged by the Commission, we tabled proposals for sweeping changes which were subsequently met with a wall-to-wall majority in the plenary meeting.
At the European spring summit â for surely that is what we can call it now â the Council congratulated us warmly, and we heard the Council express the wish for work to be continued on a services directive that opens up the markets whilst ensuring there is enough room for social protection.
Today, we heard a detailed Commission position on our proposals and we notice that the Commission has kept its promise and remains very committed to supporting the line this House has taken.
The services of general economic interest are retained, although, as we proposed, framed in a structure of their own.
While the scope is limited, which is what we want, I would call on the Commissioner to take another look at how we should exactly define those social services.
The directive has no impact on labour law whatsoever, and Commissioner Å pidla explained the promised guidelines that pertain to the application of the posting of workers directive a moment ago.
Fortunately, the consumer remains sufficiently protected in the end; the red tape is being trimmed down; and the freedom to provide services, as enshrined in Articles 16 and 17, is guaranteed.
Whilst a different cooperation procedure may have been worked out for inspection purposes, we count on the Council to ensure that it works just as well as the one we had proposed.
We know that a balance can be struck.
This is something we would like to work towards, and we hope that the Austrian Council Presidency, with whom we are always prepared to enter into dialogue, will lead us to a directive that benefits the self-employed, professionals, consumers of services, consumers, employees, economic growth as a whole and creates many additional jobs.
We wish the Council presidency the very best of success, and we are pleased that we did eventually get some positive cooperation out of the Commission.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its handling of the services directive, the Commission has leapt out from under the shadow that suddenly overspread it again last week.
Commissioner McCreevy, my dear Charlie, as rapporteur and on behalf of my group, let me say how pleased I am that the Commission has kept the promise it made to this House and has done as it was bidden by the overwhelming majority in the plenary.
I know that it took hours of work by the yesterday, but the most important law in Europe â second only to the Constitution â is now on the right track.
We can accompany it down that road, or ought it to be said that the Commission is following where Parliament leads?
What we can say is that a crucial step has been taken in the direction of a social Europe, and I can tell the Commissioner that I am particularly pleased that the main bone of contention â the country of origin principle â has been binned.
That is the greatest breakthrough as we work towards a social Europe.
I am also very glad that you have done as this House has proposed and removed from the scope of the services directive such important areas as part-time working, security firms, the gambling industry and the whole of the health sector, although there is still a question mark over the exclusion of social services, and we will have to have further discussions on how the Commission's thinking in this respect is actually to be evaluated and interpreted.
I am also glad that, contrary to what had formerly been feared, the services directive will be treated as secondary to the sectoral directives, something that this House saw as important, particularly in relation to the Posting of Workers Directive.
I see what we have achieved as a major success for the people, for the social Europe, and, not least, for this House.
By it, we, its Members, have demonstrated that we take seriously our rights in the service of the public.
Matters are now in the hands of the Council of Ministers.
Just how quickly we get proper legislation will depend on them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for the dynamism and promptness with which he submitted this speedily-drafted document.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would go as far as to say that it represents an advance on the position which the European Parliament adopted, which is a good thing for employment in Europe.
The ALDE Group takes the view that creating jobs is the best social structure there is, more so than protecting what we have achieved thus far.
Unfortunately, there are a number of factors and sectors that remain excluded, which Member States could exploit in order to protect their own markets.
That is what we call protectionism and is likely to result in many legal proceedings at the European Court of Justice.
There are still container concepts, such as gambling, the audiovisual sector, and the list goes on, and what they cover is left to the Member States to decide.
We would have preferred to see a much tighter definition and delineation of what is excluded and what is not.
Unfortunately, there is no support for this at the moment, and more time may well be required.
We hope that people will come to realise this.
Sometimes, as is the case in France, this can cause problems if you want to reform in order to secure our current achievements and prosperity, not least for the sake of our children.
Millions of people are still, every Tuesday, taking to the streets to protest.
What a shame!
Politicians are there to take long-term decisions and, occasionally, to be re-elected in the very short term.
Sometimes, we opt for the latter.
In any case, we feel that a step has been taken in the right direction.
We supported the proposal at first reading.
We hope that some more light will be shed as to why a number of sectors are excluded.
For example, as you mentioned yourself, the definitions should become less ambiguous so that it becomes more difficult for Member States to protect their incoming services from others.
After all, mobility and dynamism in the economy will need to be improved and strengthened in the internal market if we are to be capable of competing with other large economic regions in the world.
I think that that is how we can hold onto our prosperity.
I thank you and hope that a positive outcome can be achieved very quickly during the forthcoming Council.
Â Â  .Mr President, Commissioners, I think we should be delighted that the Commission has yielded to the double pressure of the European Parliament and of the Council.
I believe that, given the current state of affairs in Europe, this is a shining example of the fact that parliamentary democracy within the European Union can work and that the Commission can effectively take on board the amendments voted for by the European Parliament.
The European Parliament has substantially improved the Commissionâs original proposal.
That being so, I wish to emphasise the fact that the fundamental objections that we made, and which justified our groupâs unanimous vote against it, still remain.
They mainly concern two points: the scope of the Directive and the confirmed inclusion of services of general economic interest.
Our group is in favour of a specific directive on services of general economic interest because we fear that their inclusion in this directive may stand in the way of any new proposal by the Commission.
The second objection concerns the compromise reached on ArticleÂ 16, which does not increase the legal certainty of the text and in fact takes us back to the case law of the Court, as well as to the requirement for the Court to give a ruling on a case by case basis, contrary to the wishes of the Commission and of Parliament.
The ball is now in the court of the Council, to whom it falls to define its common position.
In this respect, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance unanimously calls for the Council to amend and to improve this text, particularly in relation to the two points that I have just mentioned.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioners, in any battle, it is advisable to assess each stage correctly.
One must neither underestimate the points scored, otherwise one encourages defeatism, nor overestimate what seems to have been won, for fear of setting oneself up for disillusionment.
In the case of the so-called âBolkesteinâ draft directive, where are we in this respect?
The points scored at first reading in Parliament by the opponents of the original text are undeniable.
The removal of the reference to the country of origin principle and the adjustment to the actual application of the Directive are the most symbolic setbacks imposed on the hard-liners of liberal Europe.
The exclusion of a number of sectors from the scope of the Directive and the granting to the host country of supervisory powers, which are, nonetheless, limited, conditional and difficult to implement, are also significant factors.
Finally, the exclusion of labour law takes us back to the law currently in force.
We shall examine the Commissionâs new text under a microscope.
If it appeared that the Commission was trying to reclaim part of the ground that it had had to concede, particularly by granting itself any automatic right of supervision, that would, in our opinion, constitute an unacceptable claim.
If, on the other hand, it turned out that the Commission has included Parliamentâs demands in its new revised draft directive, that would be both a fresh sign of the growing importance of our Assembly within the European institutional triangle and also, and perhaps most importantly, this would be the confirmation of the formative influence of the citizensâ sudden emergence in the European debate, especially since a certain 29 May 2005.
That just shows you that our group has no intention of denying these developments.
Having said that, however, does the result achieved to date manage to curb this craze for competition between workers, against which our fellow citizens are rising in ever-greater numbers?
That is the real question, and our answer is ânoâ.
Apart from the exceptions stated, the Directive in its amended form in fact reinforces rules establishing a form of integration that is no longer based on harmonisation of legislation, but on freedom of the market.
The present circumstances and the weight of the in this respect merit our renewed attention, especially at a time of the enlargement of the European Union to include countries whose social standards are attractive to economic and political leaders obsessed with lowering costs and lifting âbarriers to competitionâ in the notorious free market economy in which competition is open and undistorted.
How are we prepared to depart from this repressive logic?
When the time comes for the great open debate on the future of the European Union, that is the central issue on which I propose opening up the discussion, particularly on the left.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioners, I am bound to express the tremendous disappointment I felt following your presentation of the Commission communication today.
The amended text of the directive on services lacks precision and its wording is frequently unclear.
Countries opposed to a free market in services are bound to take advantage of these shortcomings.
CommissionerÂ McCreevy, at a meeting of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection two weeks ago, you stated that the excellent must not be allowed to stand in the way of the good.
That is certainly true, but do you really believe that this draft, which represents the outcome of two yearsâ work on the liberalisation of the market in services within the European Union, is actually good?
Do you consider that the directive as it stands is an appropriate response to the expectations of the European economy at a time when global competition is becoming ever more intense?
I find it hard to understand the stance adopted by the governments of certain Member States of the old Fifteen.
They are pursuing a short-sighted and selfish policy, and are hindering competition within the European Union.
As to the inaction and peculiar apathy demonstrated by the European Commission, I simply cannot come to terms with that at all.
The Commission is supposed to be governed first and foremost by the interests of the European Union as a whole.
It is supposed to strive to achieve at least the aims enshrined in the Lisbon Strategy.
Two months ago the European Parliament turned the draft directive upside down, as MrsÂ Gebhardt so aptly put it at the time.
This was the result of a most unfortunate compromise between the two largest political groups in the House.
Nonetheless, the Commission did then assure advocates of a free market in services that alternative arrangements would be made to compensate for the removal of liberal provisions from the draft.
I refer in particular to ArticleÂ 24 and ArticleÂ 25, which were intended to eliminate the barriers currently encountered by posted workers.
It is now clear that the European Commission has failed to honour this promise.
To all intents and purposes, the document it has prepared on posting workers is simply a description of the barriers now in place.
It does not contain proposals for sanctions of any kind against countries blocking posted workers.
It is, however, incumbent on the Commission to make radical changes to its policy towards countries that are blatantly infringing Community law on the freedom to provide services.
Finally, I should like to wish you every success in creating a free market within the European Union, Commissioners.
Success in this endeavour is crucial for you and for the Union as a whole, but it calls for greater courage and determination on the part of the Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, the Council and the Commission have taken note of the vote on the Gebhardt report on the Services Directive, and we can only be pleased about that.
For once we are in the majority, and we shall make the most of it.
We largely helped to take out the most questionable aspects of the Services Directive, starting with the notorious country of origin principle.
Nonetheless, a number of grey areas remain, particularly in relation to services of general economic interest, and it will be up to the Council to resolve them, in agreement with Parliament.
For the time being, the danger is elsewhere.
The Commission intends to revise, and make more liberal, the directive on the posting of workers, which could partially invalidate the European Parliamentâs legislative function.
Finally, we condemn in the strongest terms the Commissionâs decision to reprimand France on the grounds that it adopted decrees against hostile takeover bids in 11 sensitive and strategic sectors, particularly in relation to defence.
The Commission prefers to go against its own camp rather than to defend Europeâs interests at the WTO or in world markets.
It is therefore up to the Member States to correct this institutional and political anomaly.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Commissioner McCreevy for fully living up to the pledge that he gave to us.
He said that if we produced a balanced proposal with a strong majority from this Parliament, then the Commission would take that up and produce it as an amended text.
And he has largely done that, as many colleagues have said.
I am fully in support of that.
It was a compromise.
I make no bones about the fact that I would have liked to have seen a more liberal directive, but the fact remains that what is on the table is a major step forward in the internal market.
Commissioner McCreevy, the point I want to make to you is will you please from now on become the strongest advocate of this directive.
We want you to go out there and sell the package.
You did not say in your speech that this directive contains a hundred separate measures directed at Member States to remove barriers to service businesses, to reduce bureaucracy, to simplify administration and to give more information.
My colleague from Poland seems to have ignored that entirely in what he said just now.
We also have as a central clause freedom to provide services, proposed by this side of the House.
I am absolutely convinced, and I am sure you will confirm it, that the formulation fully respects â and I use the word from the directive â the rules under which service providers operate in their own Member State.
That is a major step forward, but we need you to go out there and advocate it in a strong and positive way.
Please take that as the first message, because we need to win the hearts and minds of the people out there, who think that we produced a diluted and weak piece of legislation.
If you read it, it certainly is not.
In conclusion, I would like to thank Commissioner Å pidla very much, because we asked for a statement on the posting of workers directive as part of the compromise for removing ArticlesÂ 24 and 25 of the proposal, and he has given us that.
I think it could go further, but I am delighted that the two are linked together, which was a key demand from this side of the House.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my thanks to the Commission, which has remained as faithful as it possibly could to Parliamentâs position.
I have to say, Commissioner, that the rather limited definition of social services gives me some cause for concern, and I would like Parliament and the Council to spend some time thinking of a better definition.
I am delighted, though, that the Commission has adopted Parliamentâs social clauses with regard to respecting labour and social security legislation and the collective bargaining agreements and also, Commissioner, that the services directive gives priority to the posting of workers directive and respects this fully.
I have to tell Commissioner Å pidla, though, that I am not entirely happy with the content of the communication on the posting of workers, and so I would insist on this communication being presented to the social partners and Parliament for consultation.
Whilst it is a good thing that the red tape and restrictions which Member States impose and which have been repeatedly condemned by the Court of Justice will be eliminated, I get the feeling that the prohibitive clauses in the communication go much further than the administration of justice.
For example, the opinion that the appointment of a representative among posted workers should be sufficient is tantamount to denying the Scandinavian countries their negotiation tradition.
In addition, with the ban on previous permissions or registrations, you run the risk of undermining the system of licences, for example in the context of temporary employment.
This will therefore need to be examined more closely.
I should also like to give credit, though, for the good start that has been made on improving inspections in practice.
It is vital that companies and employees should be better informed than they have been to date about the conditions of employment in relation to the posting of workers and that liaison offices become more effective.
I also unreservedly endorse the idea of better equipping labour inspections and getting them to cooperate across the borders.
This is something for which this House has repeatedly asked.
Only then, I believe, will we have sufficient guarantees in place to create an internal market for services that function well while fully respecting the social ground rules.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in our opinion, it is imperative that the final text that we must arrive at fully preserves the balance achieved by the Members of our Parliament.
If we must adopt a directive on the free movement of services, because doing so is a real necessity, then it will not be at any price.
The Commissionâs original draft was a clumsy text, ill conceived and unwise.
Parliament has now completely revised this text, thus making it possible to complete the internal market while at the same time preserving our social model.
We are grateful to you, Commissioner, for resisting the temptations and we suggest that you join with the European Parliament in working out a compromise.
Henceforth, the ball is in the court of the Council, and we expect it to act as a responsible co-legislator.
The Services Directive is now a structure balancing on pillars of equal importance to us.
Calling one or other of them into question would be liable to bring down the whole structure.
The Council, therefore, cannot ignore the political message that we have given it.
Commissioner, Parliamentâs vote on services has shown the way.
Our fellow citizens would not understand if we were to backtrack.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am glad that it has dawned on the Commission that the Posting of Workers Directive is indispensable as a means of protecting workers in the European services market.
The Services Directive must not be allowed to impose limitations on it.
The Posting of Workers Directive establishes the principle of âequal pay for equal work in the same placeâ, yet I have to tell Commissioner Å pidla that I do wonder how, in view of the criminal energy expended on circumventing this principle in practice, one local foreman or one registration on the day work begins is meant to be enough to ensure that the Member States can keep tabs on what is going on.
If the means of control available to the Member States are intended to help protect workers, then it follows that no restrictions must be placed upon them, and that â rather than the assertion that such a thing is no more than a bureaucratic imposition â must be the guiding principle of the handbook.
The Posting of Workers Directive must continue to have the protection of workers as its primary purpose.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to add to the words of thanks that have been spoken to Commissioners McCreevy and Å pidla.
I have great admiration for the way in which you have met us halfway.
What is now before us represents a big step forward.
I have a few questions and comments.
I shall start with you, Commissioner McCreevy.
You said that you will be presenting a document on health.
What do you mean?
Is it a directive?
Indeed, we cannot accept a situation where the European Court of Justice decides that we should monitor the situation closely, only for nothing to be done thereafter.
I would appreciate it greatly if it was a directive that were to be tabled, because you have not mentioned the form that document would take.
Turning to Commissioner Å pidla, I agree with you both that Articles 24 and 25, as they were formulated originally, were included with the aim of making it impossible to put up administrative hurdles in the recipient Member State.
I totally agree that something should be done about them.
Having said that, wages and working conditions can also be skirted, which leads to improper competition on the labour market.
That means, therefore that it is important for new policy guidelines to be drafted, also for the workers who are posted.
I have a question, though.
Why have you issued a communication, Commissioner Å pidla?
I am asking you, because MrsÂ SchrÃ¶der is writing a report on the posting of workers directive and you already have an assessment of the same directive at your disposal.
Why have you issued a document that is difficult to enforce?
Why did you not decide to adapt legislation instead?
Mr President, I have one last comment to make.
I am delighted with the fact that the monitoring procedure that checks the way we deal with each other is set to improve thanks to different labour inspections joining forces.
We will need to have another talk about how we could reinforce this procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, during the first debate on the Services Directive, a British Member said: âFritz Bolkestein is well and alive and living mainly in Franceâ. My group wishes the former Commissioner, Mr Bolkestein, a very happy retirement.
Indeed, we hope that he will have a peaceful retirement, but his directive is well and truly dead.
Henceforth, we shall have a Gebhardt â McCreevy directive.
There are still, of course, the Bolkestein orphans.
On the extreme left and among certain well-known anti-Europeans, the Bolkestein Directive had become an obvious bogeyman, the symbol of an anti-social Europe.
These people have difficulty in accepting that the Bolkestein Directive is definitively dead and buried.
Others have the same problem, notably some enthusiasts of ultraliberalism, and here I am thinking of those who saw in the Commissionâs original proposal a sort of master key providing access to a totally deregulated Europe.
I am thinking in particular of that French baron who tries to look modern by speaking American when he is speaking on behalf of big employers.
Happily, though, the European Parliament has done its job, and a qualified majority of Parliament has rewritten the text that was submitted at first reading on the Commissionâs original proposal in order to make it a respectable instrument that encourages the free provision of services, while avoiding any form of social dumping.
The Commission has done well to broadly support the European Parliamentâs position, even if we did observe a bit of shillyshallying last week.
PresidentÂ Barroso has taken his troops in hand.
We shall, of course, have to remain vigilant and we shall have to request some further information.
Nonetheless, the Austrian Presidency would likewise do well to ensure that the Council supports Parliament so that we may quickly arrive at the proper Services Directive that we hope and pray for.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioners, in Parliament we have held hearings concerning the Posting of Workers Directive, and these have shown that there is nothing wrong with the directive itself, even if it is complicated.
However, there are huge problems with applying the rules in practice.
People are unaware of their rights, companies do not know which rules they have to follow and public authorities interpret the directive differently from one another.
Rather than amend the directive, we therefore have a great deal to do in terms of better administration and the better provision of information.
The EU and the Member States must together ensure that it is possible, for example via the Internet and quick caches, to obtain better information.
In that way we should be able seriously to reap the benefits of an internal market for services.
I am looking forward to the Commission taking initiatives in this area and ensuring that the Posting of Workers Directive operates better in the future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, thank you for presenting the guidelines on the posting of workers.
They certainly represent a further significant step towards the liberalisation of services.
The Commissionâs document outlines the administrative barriers illegally imposed on firms posting their workers abroad for work purposes.
It also contains examples of rulings by the European Court of Justice, which considers that such practices infringe the Treaty.
Unfortunately, however, the document does not propose any effective ways of resolving the present situation.
The Commission has demonstrated quite clearly that it lacks the will to ensure compliance with Community law.
Mere references to rulings by the Court of Justice are not enough.
The barriers remain firmly in place in spite of the rulings, the Treaty and the Directive.
Nothing has changed.
More determined action is therefore called for, such as starting legal proceedings against those who have infringed the provisions.
I fear that the proposal to prepare another report on progress achieved in eliminating barriers in a yearâs time simply amounts to a further postponement of such action.
In conclusion, I should like to say how taken aback many Members of this House were on discovering that health services had been completely written out of the Commissionâs opinion on the directive on services, even though the parliamentary vote showed a majority in favour of their inclusion.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the honourable Members for their remarks.
I shall reply to some of the specific questions.
On the excluded sectors, it is important that we all remember that the provisions of the Treaty continue to apply to those services outside the scope of the directive.
The College of Commissioners will debate the question of health within the next couple of weeks and the scope of the initiative will be decided at that time.
MrÂ Kyprianou will have the lead and Mr Å pidla and myself will be submitting our ideas to him.
While I cannot be more specific today, I can say that at a minimum it will cover the issue of patient mobility and reimbursement for health expenditure.
We will have to wait to see what Mr Kyprianou will bring forward.
Mr Harbour is being a little pessimistic about the reception given to this revised proposal.
It is true that there has been a degree of negative comment in some of the media, but views will change with time and when people have had more time to digest what was voted on by Parliament.
I have vigorously sold the modified proposal to the Council of Ministers.
At a meeting of the Council of Ministers on Sunday, 12Â March 2006, I vigorously defended the intended revised proposal.
I told the ministers that I intended to follow what the European Parliament had agreed in the main areas.
While some ministers may have been somewhat sceptical initially, at the end of the meeting most were quite pleased as to what the outcome was going to be.
The fact that the European Council last week overwhelmingly endorsed the vote in Parliament shows that the debate has moved on considerably.
It is a good proposal.
Mr Harbour outlines many of the initiatives and the good points in it and we should be prepared to sell it as a very important step in the services area and as a good day for Europe when this particular directive is adopted.
As I have said in committee meetings â and recently I attended a meeting of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection â it is important to realise that the previous Commissionâs proposal was never going to see the light of day as it was drafted.
So those who defended the original proposals would have to recognise the political reality: it was never going to become a piece of legislation.
What I as Commissioner and the College of Commissioners recognised was the political reality that we could not keep trumpeting how brilliant the proposal was while knowing in our hearts that it was going to remain on the shelf.
We adopted the pragmatic approach of saying that we could see whether we could get a broad agreement among the Members of the European Parliament from the major groups because, if we could succeed in doing that, we would have a better chance of seeing the revised proposal through the Council of Ministers.
In the meetings of the Council of Ministers that I attended there were as many divisions as there were in the European Parliament.
So I think Parliament has clearly shown the way.
Now that we have a revised proposal, we all should be prepared to sell it and to recognise that it is a major step forward.
Some might describe it as an incremental step forward, but a major step forward it is.
It will be of considerable benefit to the economy of Europe, because what is at issue here is galvanising the European economy to be able to sustain the kind of growth rates that would deliver the number of jobs that are so necessary.
In my opinion the modified services proposal will do that.
Given the broad consensus that has been reached on the most difficult points in this proposal, I am certain that the Council of Ministers will want to work closely with the European Parliament to try to reach an early agreement.
We in the Commission will do all we can to facilitate an early final agreement on the text.
If everybody maintains an open and constructive approach, we can steer this important proposal to a successful conclusion.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the discussion that has just taken place.
Allow me to touch on some of the points that have been raised.
In the continuing debate between the social partners and representatives of the Member States, and especially also within the framework of parliamentary debates, the view has now taken hold that the Directive is fit for purpose and that there is no pressing reason for it to be subjected to any fundamental legislative reworking, although its practical application may give rise to a number of problems.
In the course of discussing the Services Directive, Parliament obtained a promise that the Commission would include in its communication a round-up of practice to date and of the decisions to date from the Luxembourg court.
It is absolutely clear, and I think it applies across the entire legal system, that laws should be used only in accordance with the purposes for which lawmakers have framed them.
The Posted Workers Directive should protect workers who have been posted, securing for them the appropriate rights while preventing social dumping, protecting them from exploitation and saving them from being forced into accepting unreasonable social standards and thereby competing unfairly against workers in the host country.
This is the purpose of the Directive and this was our determining viewpoint when formulating a strategy for the communication.
It is not of course the aim of the Directive to create artificial barriers, and this means that every single barrier and every administrative procedure must be weighed up from the following standpoint: is it necessary and essential to the greater protection of workers?
If the answer is yes, then it will be in agreement with the Directive, if the answer is no, then it will not be.
I can provide a typical example: the protection of workers unquestionably requires the use of official documents, but we can easily imagine that some documents may be unnecessary from this standpoint.
This is one of the issues addressed in the communication.
In a number of speeches a question also arose that was not connected directly with the communication, but was connected with the further development of the Services Directive and with issues relating to services in general.
This was the question of social services in the public interest.
I can report that the communication is already complete in respect of the fundamentals of this issue, and we expect it to be fully formulated by the end of April.
The communication will, on the one hand, clarify some of the principal legal questions, because it is necessary to have precise and reliable interpretations of court decisions, and on the other hand it will put forward a number of other procedures that might be adopted with the further development and elaboration of the political concept of services in the public interest.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Services Directive and the related communication, along with the additional negotiations and subsequent steps, provide an example of exceptionally productive cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, within the framework of some highly demanding parts of our legislation.
Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I might be allowed one more comment, already touched on by my colleague MrÂ McCreevy, which is that we do indeed expect some new legislative proposals to be formulated in relation to health care, and particularly in relation to the movement of patients within the health system.
Â Â  Mr President, I am surprised that the European Unionâs Austrian Presidency is not taking a stand on this very important communication from the Commission.
Listening to Chancellor SchÃŒssel, he speaks highly of the compromise reached by the European Parliament, and I should very much like to know whether the Austrian Presidency is now going to do its best to ensure that the Council adopts this new position of Parliament and of the Commission.
Â Â  Mr Goebbels, I would hesitate to describe your speech as a point of order, although it does affect the order of the debates.
It is a question about the order, but I do not believe that the Council needs incentives from MEPs to speak if it wishes.
It knows that it can speak, and if it has not asked to do so, it will be because it has not felt the need to.
Silence is equivalent to assent.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  â I am grateful to the Commission for having taken account of this Parliamentâs position, which democratically reflects the demands of the majority of European citizens.
I am sorry that certain social services are still excluded from the directive: services like affordable housing and support for children and families must not be subject to the laws of competition, but must aim solely at meeting the beneficiariesâ interests.
I hope, therefore, that these demands will be adequately taken into account in the social services directive that the Commission has announced for the end of April.
I am also pleased that the country-of-origin principle has been removed and that the new document on the posting of workers has been drawn up.
I think, in fact, that we need to guard against social dumping by carefully examining the rules of the market, especially as regards wages and working conditions.
It is important to ensure that competition improves job quality for the benefit of workers and consumers.
The ultimate aim of the European Union is in fact not to increase the volume of business but to create a competitive society that serves its citizens, a society that helps to raise the living standards of its members in every respect.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate âBetter law-makingâ, which deals with four reports:
- the report by Monica Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Commission's 21st and 22nd annual reports on monitoring the application of Community law (2003 and 2004) [2005/2150(INI)] (A6-0089/2006),
- the report by Bert Doorn, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on better lawmaking 2004: application of the principle of subsidiarity 12th annual report [2005/2055(INI)] (A6-0082/2006),
- the report by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the implementation, consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force [2004/2224(INI)](A6-0083/2006) and
- the report by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on a strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment [2006/2006(INI)](A6-0080/2006).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly delighted to take the floor today, not in my usual guise as my groupâs representative, but as rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs representing a broader-based majority.
As such, I should like to deliver a few messages about this report, the essential aim of which is to emphasise that the implementation of Community law forms an important part of the âbetter lawmakingâ dossier, alongside the other issues that we shall debate this afternoon.
Implementation is an important part of law primarily because the situation at European Union level is unsatisfactory, as the Commissionâs report points out very effectively.
There are very serious problems particularly concerning environmental legislation as well as legislation on the internal market, and responsibility for that â there is no point in denying it â lies above all with the Member States.
Non-implementation is also due, however, to the fact that the procedure is enshrined in the Treaties and is therefore not easy to improve.
It is a slow procedure that provides for relatively inadequate sanctions: in order to arrive at a positive solution for the implementation of Community law by the Member States, the procedure often leaves much to be desired and takes a very long time.
I should like to hear whether you believe that this issue of the implementation of Community law is a priority for the Commission or not.
Judging from the communication, it does not seem to me that it is, because, as we know, it deals more with the aspect of withdrawing and amending directives rather than their proper implementation.
I believe that there are substantially two schools of thought in the Commission: one that says, âIt is best to avoid trouble with the Member States, so let us try to solve problems together with them,â whereas the other says, âLet us apply the rules as they are, not inflexibly but at any rate positively, using procedures that as far as possible are fast and within the law.â
I should like to give some examples of that.
We believe that several decisions made by the Commission regarding the initiation of certain procedures, such as those on GMOs in Austria, were made particularly quickly and effectively.
On the other hand, in the case of France and its inability to implement the Natura 2000 Directive, we have been waiting for three years, ever since the Court of Justiceâs decision, for the Commission to intervene under Article 228, which is the article on fines.
Similarly, there are interesting situations regarding the citizensâ right to reimbursement of their medical expenses.
This is an extremely important issue for the people themselves, but we realise that it remains unresolved because it is a politically complicated issue to take on.
At the same time, Article 228 has only been invoked twice: once for the Greek waste discharge case, which was suspended after a very short time, and once for the Spanish bathing water case, which was withdrawn at the last minute because of an issue that the Commission itself admits is rather dubious from a legal standpoint.
What answer do we give or what proposals do we make to resolve a situation in which we believe that the Commission should act more transparently?
First of all we believe that there should be greater surveillance and greater transparency regarding the ways in which Community law is implemented.
I think it is important that the Commission pass on to us the compliance studies that it carries out on implementation of the law, which unfortunately we have not succeeded in obtaining.
Secondly, I believe it is extremely important for resources to be transferred from all those bodies that will no longer produce legislation to those that will instead implement it.
We do not agree with the idea, for instance, that there should be such a transfer to those who will carry out impact assessments, something that is currently being discussed in the Commission.
Thirdly â and this affects us â we believe that the European Parliament should act much more specifically in the area of the implementation of Community law, not in order to change the Commissionâs powers â I am aware that this is of great concern to the members of that Institution â but, on the contrary, to gain a clearer idea of what actually happens, as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and other committees do.
I believe that the policy of naming and shaming with regard to the implementation of Community law is very useful and that the Commission should perhaps help us to apply it more decisively.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to quote an article from an authoritative Dutch newspaper in May last year, just before the referendum in the Netherlands.
The quote starts as follows: âNot Barroso, not Blair, but Mr van Alphen from the Netherlands, along with thousands of other national civil servants, takes the day-to-day decisions in Europeâ.
This article did nothing to contribute towards a positive basic perception in the Netherlands of the referendum.
You know it all went horribly wrong.
The Netherlands said no, which is worrying.
It is these very rules and regulations that are a source of worry and that we should discuss in more detail today.
We must work hard in order to remove the negative image the citizen has of rules and regulations.
How can we achieve this?
We can do it by making them more transparent.
We must also consider the administrative burden that results from them.
Many companies have the mill stone of a heavy administrative burden round their necks, and if there is anything that affects companiesâ competitiveness, then this is it.
How do we achieve more transparency and cut the administrative burden?
We can do it, in the first place, by carrying out an actual impact assessment, and that is what is still lacking at the moment.
We have seen many examples of impact assessments, and they all vary in terms of quality.
Some are good, and some are not.
If we in this House want to benefit from impact assessments, then they should offer impartial and sound information that is readily understood.
That is what is missing.
We in this House have first-hand experience of some impact assessments on amendments; we too have found that the quality varies, and that is why I propose an independent review of them.
This need not be done by a weighty authority.
This could be a panel of four experts in the field of impact assessment, who simply look at the impact assessments carried out by the Commission and those carried out in this House, and who then issue recommendations on that basis.
In other words, there is no need for an agency or weighty authority; what we simply need is an independent quality review, one that is effective and external.
Turning to comitology, the article I mentioned a moment ago had something to say about this too.
It also included another paragraph, one about the committees, which I do not want to keep from you.
âYou do not see them, you do not hear them, some 450 consulting clubs in Brussels, constantly take decisions that affect the everyday life of the citizens.â
More transparency is needed in that area too.
When comitology leads to secondary legislation, this legislation must also be verified.
We must demonstrate the implications of legislation of that kind by means of an impact assessment.
The public will then see that we mean business and that we actually want this transparency.
Finally, as Mrs Frassoni already pointed out, implementation is extremely important and Parliament should devote far more attention to it.
When a report has been discussed in the plenary, then the work of the rapporteur is done.
I would suggest asking the rapporteur in question, three years after approval in this House, to notify his committee of the state of play in terms of implementation.
This will contribute significantly to the proper transposal in the Member States and also to sound contacts with national parliaments.
Those are the proposals: more transparency, objective supervision of the impact assessment, limits to comitology, more insight into comitology and possibly a call-back right for the European Parliament should the need arise.
Those are the components of an inter-institutional agreement that I think are needed in order to really get going with these rules and regulations.
Â Â  . Mr President, as Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I very much welcome this joint debate on better regulation and the opportunity to discuss with the Council and the Commission how we can improve the regulatory experience for consumers, citizens and businesses that are at the sharp end of making sense of implementing EU laws.
The confidence and trust of citizens, consumers and business in the EU itself is linked to their experience and perception of EU laws and the impact they have on their daily lives.
I want to focus on improving better regulation for the internal market and ensuring that we achieve a sense of purpose in our law-making for consumers in the internal market.
The internal market accounts for almost one third of the Community .
Good-quality, effective and simple legislation in the internal market should open up opportunities for cross-border trade and give consumers increased choice, while protecting environmental, social and consumer rights.
At the same time, getting legislation right in the internal market is critical to achieving the Lisbon goals of jobs, growth and competitiveness.
I believe that the internal market will benefit most from a joint and coordinated approach by all three institutions to improving the entire regulatory cycle.
That means that we also need to think of the consequences of the midnight deals and compromises that we make, and consider whether they are going to confuse or clarify laws for end users.
That starts, in my view, with good, clear drafting of laws, high-quality impact assessments and effective, comprehensive and transparent stakeholder consultation.
The Member States too must take their responsibilities seriously and ensure good and correct implementation of internal market laws.
They must resist the temptation often to gold-plate or add on national requirements.
Although transposition rates are improving, as shown in the internal market scoreboards, there is still room for much improvement.
That is why we are asking for a fast-track infringement procedure for test cases in the internal market.
We need to learn from the failures and mistakes of EU laws.
That is why we would like to see both and, in particular, impact assessments or evaluations of where we went wrong.
Has this legislation achieved its objective or, on the contrary, has it led to distortion and fragmentation of the internal market?
Some believe that the impact assessments should be handed over to an external body.
I do not share that approach, as I believe that the internal market laws should be the responsibility of Commission officials as part of the discipline of effective policy-making.
However, the Internal Market Committee insists that all legislative proposals be accompanied by a quality impact assessment, a summary and a better regulation checklist on internal market proposals.
Of course alternative regulation is a subject of much scepticism.
While the interinstitutional agreement provides for this non-legislative option, we insist with respect to internal market laws that Parliament is both informed of and consulted on such alternative approaches.
They are justified by impact assessments.
Equally, we must have redress for the consumer and sanctions if these alternative regulations fail to deliver benefits for the consumer in the internal market.
I want to stress the work of the Internal Market Committee as an active partner in the better regulation process.
I know that Commissioners often say that Parliament does not take its role seriously.
We were the first committee to commission our own impact assessment, under Mr Whiteheadâs chairmanship, for amendments on the Toubon report on nominal quantities for pre-packed products.
On the pyrotechnics proposal we are conducting an impact assessment on amendments proposed by our rapporteur.
We will look at a cost/benefit analysis of his amendments to that proposal.
We are conducting a hearing on the impact of public procurement laws on the internal market.
EU public procurement accounts for 16% of EU GDP, yet the 1992 package of laws, as demonstrated in a number of ECJ cases, has not achieved the desired opening of the market.
Let us be clear. It is the consumer, the citizen and businesses that pay the price when laws are not effective.
Bad drafting leads to legal uncertainty, poor or confused transposition and at the end of the line is a confused businessman or consumer who loses confidence in the internal market.
The ECJ, after years of deliberation, becomes the arbiter of better legislation.
That is not the right way forward.
Finally, I want to quote the cases of SOLVIT, which I believe is an excellent initiative of the Commission.
A qualified doctor tried for a number of years to register as a doctor in Spain.
He spent a large sum of money on legal fees, had lost confidence in the internal market, yet the SOLVIT system intervened and helped him within ten weeks to get registration in Spain as a doctor.
That doctor said: âSOLVIT has restored my confidence in the internal marketâ.
So, the reality is that good laws that are well drafted, easy to implement, easy to enforce and police, are the key to restoring confidence in the internal market.
I hope that todayâs debate is the beginning of a process of close cooperation, sharing best practice between the institutions in a close partnership of equals, to build and restore that confidence that the doctor I mentioned was asking us to achieve for him as a consumer in the internal market.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about three aspects, starting with the issue of simplification.
There is no doubt that this House is, as a matter of principle, backing the Commission in its efforts at simplifying the lawmaking process, but I also want to make it clear that here, as in so many other instances, the devil is in the detail, and that we have to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
Let me give you an example.
Looking at this document from the Commission, for example, I see that they want to simplify the whole body of commercial and company law; now I know, as one of the Legal Affairs Committeeâs permanent rapporteurs on this area, that many of the directives and regulations we have enacted on this were the result of highly complex negotiations and compromises and that there is, in any proposal for simplification, the inherent risk of Pandoraâs box being opened and of the compromises arrived at after much effort ending up being once more open to question.
That means that simplification is an instrument that must be handled with great care.
It is for that reason that I believe that it is very definitely advisable that we should give some thought, when simplifying just as much as when codifying, to the possibility of the three institutions adopting an inter-institutional agreement stating in clear terms how one goes about simplifying laws.
A second point to which I should like the Commission to give some thought is the issue of what priorities simplification proposals should set.
Directives are customarily addressed to the national legislatures rather than to the public, and the laws with which practitioners have to deal are those enacted at the national level.
It follows that the simplification of directives should be no more than a secondary objective.
The Commission should give priority to regulations, for the simple reason that regulations are directly applicable as law and have a direct effect on those members of the public who have recourse to law.
The second issue has to do with impact assessment.
I want once more to ram home the point that most of us in this House regard an independent element in the assessment of lawsâ impact as vitally necessary. In a report it produced in December, this House called for an independent agency on the American model.
For my part, I want to make it clear that this is not a for me; it is something we can talk about.
What I do regard as indispensable, though, is the participation of an independent external element in the assessment of the impact laws have.
It is not acceptable that the officials who make proposals are also and at the same time the ones who are responsible for gauging what impact those proposals will have, for the consequence of that is that the impact assessment ends up being no more and no less than part of the justification for them, and that is not what we want.
It is for that reason, then, that I believe we have to hammer out something sensible with the Commission in relation to this issue.
An inter-institutional agreement has been in place since December 2003, according to which the Commission is, in principle, responsible for the impact assessment.
That also means, though, that it is exercising a responsibility with and on behalf of the legislature, that is to say, for Parliament and the Council, and so we believe that we in this House, too, should have â and do have â a right to be consulted as to how this impact assessment is carried out.
I might add that that is also the reason why we, in the Conference of Presidents, initially delayed adopting a resolution on the follow-up administrative agreements, since these, of course, have to be renegotiated, not least in the light of the resolutions that we will be adopting on these four reports in May of this year.
I would also like to say something about something that is very definitely a live issue.
On 16 March, Advocate-General Sharpston delivered an opinion in the case of Spain versus the Council, in the conclusions to which she refers explicitly to the impact assessment, stating that the absence of any adequate impact assessment is an indication of the legal act having been adopted arbitrarily, and that demonstrates and confirms the Court of Justiceâs increasing interest in this issue.
Further to what Mr Doorn has had to say on the subject, I think it is crucial that decisions arrived at by way of comitology also need to have their impact assessed.
There are a whole load of cases that we could take as examples, where the real bureaucratic madness lay in the comitological decisions rather than in the legislation itself, so, here too, there needs to be proper monitoring of what impact laws have.
Last of all, let me turn to the third issue, that of , that is to say the process whereby the interested parties are listened to.
In preparing legislation, the Commission has come to rely very heavily on Europe-wide organisations and associations.
I have nothing against the European lobbying associations, but the processes whereby they arrive at decisions are sometimes more complex than those in the Council of Ministers, and what emerges from them is often consensus compacted into nonsense.
I believe we need still other forms of consultative machinery in order to get the information directly from those interested parties who are working at their jobs and therefore have to deal with these issues.
So, for example, the consultative machinery we came up with through the network currently engaged in developing European contract law, with which we defined a limited category of person to be consulted, could be a good example of how to improve these mechanisms.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity today to discuss with you an issue that is of great importance for Europe.
I know from my own, very close, contacts with the public over recent months that the issue of âBetter Lawmakingâ, along with everything that is associated with it â perhaps not as a slogan, for many of them do not know what it stands for, but as a principle â is one of the issues of greatest interest to them.
As you know, the Commissionâs programme for this year is under the heading of âunlocking Europeâs full potentialâ, and rightly too.
The Council is convinced that better lawmaking will be crucial in making this possible.
It is our intention that lawmaking should support the citizen rather than hampering him, and the same is true â as Mrs McCarthy has already said â of the consumer, but it is most especially the case in business life, where too little has been done to foster the dynamism and creativity of small and medium-sized businesses in particular.
Only recently, the European Council indicated its desire to promote small and medium-sized enterprises and provided some impetus in that direction.
Studies have shown us that the administrative burden for businesses and members of the public is equivalent to between 2% and 5% of European GNP, and so it is our intention that a marked upturn in competitiveness be brought about by assessing the impact of the administrative burden, simplification, and a reduction in it.
The term âbetter regulationâ is one that has recently been in frequent use, and I certainly agree with Mr Lehne that we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater and that this term is very often used rather loosely, and in such a way as to devalue it, in that it is not always clear what is meant by it.
I can say on behalf of the Council that your Houseâs engagement with this issue in no fewer than four reports today is very much to be welcomed.
The Council presidency continues to regard the Inter-Institutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking, to which reference has already been made today, as the framework for our cooperation.
We intend to collaborate with the future Finnish Presidency, with the Commission, and, of course, with your House, in further advancing the agenda for the reform of the regulatory framework.
Let me discuss in greater detail some of the areas that are significant in this context.
I will start with simplification.
The simplification of EU regulations is something that has a tangible effect on businesses and the public, and it is for that reason that it will be particularly efficient if it also enables us to gain greater credibility.
Commissioner Verheugenâs screening initiative and the current plans for sectoral simplification and further efforts at horizontal simplification put us on the right track.
I am also very impressed by the presence of the President and the Vice-President in this House today and by their participation in this debate, for we must encourage further progress down this road, and that is precisely what the Council and the Commission are doing by doing something to bring Europe closer to its citizens.
As you know, the Austrian Presidency has to some extent taken âbringing Europe closer to its citizens againâ as its watchword, and these initiatives, including those on the part of the Commission, make a substantial contribution to doing that.
They also help Europe to be successful in achieving the Lisbon targets.
The Presidency of the Council is glad to see that the Commission is not only pursuing the âsimplification of existing legislationâ by means of a general weeding-out of the , but is also planning to include in this the outcome of the Councilâs efforts in this area.
Together with the future Finnish Presidency and the Commission, we are working towards better working methods for simplification and towards maximising the efficiency of the cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and so it is also useful that the Commission should, on an annual basis, provide the Council with information on its programme of simplification.
We also propose that the simplification dossiers be put near the top of our agendas, and that the Council and Parliament should endeavour, where possible, to adopt simplification dossiers at first reading.
The burden of administration â to which reference has already been made â upon the persons it affects is, of course, directly measurable and affects them directly.
We need instruments in the European sphere to do just that.
Such instruments exist; now all we have to do is to use them.
The Presidency of the Council is currently drafting a paper on the prescription of quantitative targets in this area.
As my third point, I would like to turn to the subject of the choice of legal instruments, for, whatever our efforts towards improving lawmaking, there are a number of important aspects of which we must not lose sight, among them the subsidiarity principle and the principle of proportionality, while at the same time taking care to ensure that the remains intact.
It is not less Europe, but a better Europe, that we would like to see.
The principles of subsidiarity and of proportionality are fundamental guidelines for action by the institutions in their exercise of EU competences and hence an integral part of better lawmaking.
Subsidiarity and proportionality also play a central role in the choice of legal instruments.
In carrying out impact assessments, several alternative courses of action need to be considered, one of which must be the option of acting at a lower level than the EU itself.
Contrariwise, though, the interests of legal clarity and the smooth functioning of the internal market can be better served by regulations than by directives, and that, too, has been referred to today.
All in all, it is crucial that, in each individual case, the instrument should be chosen that best enables Europe to achieve what regulation is intended to do, and so, in practice, there is a close connection between impact assessments, which are of considerable value qualitatively speaking, and the effective application of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Both the Council and Parliament are already obliged by the inter-institutional agreement to have extensive recourse to the Commissionâs impact assessments in the process of arriving at decisions.
These impact assessments by the Commission can therefore also serve as the basis for an active discussion of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Perhaps I might take this opportunity to reiterate that we intend, in order to add depth to this discussion, to organise a conference on subsidiarity in Austria on 18 and 19 April, at which we look forward to valuable contributions from your House.
As was generally stressed today, impact assessments must be produced to the highest possible standards of quality and must then actually be used in the negotiating process; The Austrian Presidency of the Council will be producing what might be termed a handbook for chairmen of Council working groups with the title ââ.
We also want to encourage more cooperation between the institutions, particularly in respect of assessing the impact of major amendments proposed by the Council and in the consistent adherence to the agreed in all three of them, and, with this in mind, we look forward with great interest to the Commissionâs impact assessment review, which has been announced for this spring.
Overall, the presidency shares your Houseâs view that high quality impact assessments are essential components of an improved regulatory framework.
Something else to which reference was made was the involvement of what are termed âstakeholdersâ in consultation processes, which is vital if there is to be greater transparency.
Interested parties must be fully informed about the options for consultation, account must be taken of their views when policies are drawn up, and they must also be given proper feedback.
Let me conclude by adding something about transparency.
If the public are to accept the decisions we take, it is important not only that the laws we enact be comprehensible and simple, but also that we do a better job of explaining how these decisions are arrived at.
The decision-making process needs to be as transparent as possible for the general public.
Our Federal Chancellor said this when presenting the Austrian Council programme, and it is a point I have emphasised on many occasions.
The Austrian Presidency of the Council attaches importance to continued progress in transparency.
The first steps have been taken by way of the resolutions adopted last December, on the basis of which we are now attempting to give this practical expression and, where possible, to highlight other ways in which greater transparency may be achieved.
As I said at the outset, âbetter lawmakingâ is a project of public relevance and of direct concern to all of us.
If it is accomplished successfully, we will, together, have been able to add real value and to again make the benefits of the European Union clearer to its citizens.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, European legislation is central to everything that makes the European Union special.
We are, in fact, a Community based on the rule of law.
Without law, we should have to rely on continual negotiation, on the balance of power between the Member States or else on goodwill, in theory only, on cooperation and on willingness.
We do not want a Community based on the arbitrary and the discretionary.
We want a Community based on the rule of law.
It is law that can guarantee those freedoms that Europeans enjoy today.
I believe that this is an important point of principle and here I would like to make a personal observation.
Three days ago, at the European University Institute in Florence, I gave a lecture, the Jean Monnet lecture, which focused precisely on my conception of law in the European Union.
I believe that it is more necessary than ever to reaffirm those principles of a Community based on the rule of law that is our Community.
That is what makes it different from other experiments at international level.
We make laws for a number of reasons: for example, to protect health by ensuring food safety, to protect the environment by setting standards for air and water quality and to lay down rules for businesses operating within the internal market, so as to enable them to fight on equal terms, avoiding all discrimination.
We make laws at European Union level because the Member States have agreed that certain measures should be determined at Community level.
In practical terms, it is indeed a matter of substituting a single rule, applicable throughout the European Union, for 25 national rules.
For all that, we have to ensure that European legislation and regulations give added value: they must be targeted, they must conform to the principles of subsidiarity and they must be correctly implemented, while at the same time being proportionate to the needs that they are intended to meet.
The measures adopted must not be excessive nor go beyond what is strictly necessary.
We must avoid rules that are too prescriptive, that lead to unwarranted expense, or that may turn out to be counter-productive.
We must also eliminate the cumulative effects of rules which, in time, end up overlapping with each other, an outcome that is detrimental to businesses, to the voluntary sector, to public authorities and to the citizens.
Allow me, therefore, to congratulate the European Parliament on its excellent initiative to hold this debate on the topic of âbetter lawmakingâ.
It gives us the opportunity to examine this issue coherently.
I wish to thank MrsÂ Frassoni, MrÂ Doorn, MrsÂ McCarthy and MrÂ Gargani, for whom Mr Lehne is standing in today, for their excellent work and for their reports.
In order to properly evaluate the quality of our legislative initiatives, we need a set of measures and a strong guiding principle.
That is what clearly emerges from the various reports, which I believe provide a sound basis for our exchange of views today.
These reports and the way in which we respond to them prove that our two institutions have come a long way in recent years.
The need for better lawmaking and for laying down better rules is the subject of a genuine consensus.
Our legislative activity is a continuous process.
We must work together to ensure that our political choices, whatever they may be, are translated into legislation of the highest quality.
Here, I would also like to congratulate the Austrian Presidency on all of the measures it has taken in this respect.
How do we perceive this challenge?
We acknowledge it: we still need to make improvements to all the stages of the cycle, that is, from acts already adopted to new initiatives, via proposals currently under negotiation.
That is why the Commission has launched a vast system for better lawmaking that combines several measures: a system designed to evaluate the impact of the Commissionâs important proposals; a programme designed to simplify the legislation in force and to withdraw a number of the Commissionâs proposals that are awaiting consideration by Parliament and the Council; and more frequent recourse to other ways of resolving problems aside from conventional legislation, for example, self-regulation by the parties concerned or coregulation by the legislator.
All of these measures are now producing tangible results.
Let us look at impact assessment.
Since 2003, the Commission has put in place a system to look at the economic, social and environmental impact of all its major proposals.
Since the adoption of an integrated approach, 120Â impact assessments have been published.
We have also updated our guidelines to help staff to better examine options and impacts, including on competitiveness, and to focus attention on issues such as the cost of too much paperwork.
This reflects a marked and profound change in approach and attitude.
I believe it is real progress.
We know that as yet assessments do not all meet the same standards.
We know there is room for improvement.
We recognise, as pointed out in Mr Doornâs report on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, that quality can be improved and that quality control mechanisms must be strengthened.
I fully subscribe to the need for a separate scrutiny of impact assessments; a kind of âfour eyesâ principle.
We are working on a comprehensive approach.
First we need to ensure that our impact assessments are organised in the right way.
As promised in March 2005, we are setting up a network of technical and scientific experts to help us develop methods of ensuring that impact assessments are comprehensive and of high quality.
An external evaluation of the system is also under way, to identify where we are doing well and where we need to do better.
Also, the authors of impact assessments need feedback to know if they have done a good job.
That is why consultation is part and parcel of the impact assessment process.
It is also one reason why all Commission impact assessments are on the Europa website.
As for quality control of the individual assessments, I agree that an independent check should be carried out independently of the services that propose legislation.
I suggest that the best guarantee of impartiality is to put such a check under the authority of the President of the Commission.
I have asked the Secretary-General of the Commission to examine how best to step up our quality support and control.
But let me stress that we need to work much more closely with you on impact assessment.
I welcome the recent agreement on the common approach to impact assessment.
This set of rules for dealing with impact assessment across all three institutions is an important step forward; it will facilitate our work together and avoid duplication of effort.
Moving on to simplification, we have made a good start.
The action programme, which we adopted last year, provides for the repeal, codification, recasting or modification of some 220Â legal acts covering a wide range of policies.
The programme, already under way in the automobile, waste and construction sectors, will be reviewed and updated in consultation with stakeholders.
Other sectors such as foodstuffs, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and services will follow.
We need your input to determine the right targets and to secure the best results.
We need the Council and Parliament to speed up the adoption of simplification proposals.
My reading from your reports is that we basically agree on what we are trying to achieve.
Now we have to get down to work, look at the substance and deliver results.
We are also tackling administrative burdens, which are particularly burdensome for small businesses.
This means simplifying forms and modernising the customs code to assist electronic exchange of information.
We are introducing the measurement of administrative costs in our impact assessments.
It is essential that the Council and Parliament pay attention to the paperwork load when they suggest amendments.
We also need to test new approaches to regulation, looking at co-regulation and self-regulation as a possible alternative.
We can work more closely with industry, for example, to deliver results on a voluntary basis.
I understand very well your concerns about not being closely involved in the preparation of non-legislative approaches.
Where such approaches seem the best route, I fully accept the need to work out ways of keeping Parliament involved in their preparation and implementation.
Finally, I would like to say a word about the implementation of law.
This is a high priority for the Commission.
I ask you to look at the conclusions of our College meeting today.
We analysed 2055 cases of infringements.
That was the decision of the Commission today.
Sometimes the decisions are very difficult and we expect some Member States to react.
I hope you support the strong commitment of this Commission to the implementation and enforcement of Community law.
Our laws need to be correctly applied and implemented, otherwise our efforts as policy- and lawmakers are in vain.
As more and more policy areas mature, we should see a shift in political attention and resources towards implementation.
In fact that is a great priority for this Commission.
This whole programme of better regulation â including implementation â has become a flagship of this Commission.
I am personally devoted to it, as are Vice-President Verheugen and the whole College.
As the Commission we need to manage infringement proceedings efficiently.
I am conscious of the need to reduce the timespan on individual infringement procedures.
We need quicker ways to respond to the problems faced by citizens in business.
We should look at these broad issues of implementation together and explore constructive ways of dealing with them.
Later this year I expect the Commission to come back to you with specific suggestions.
I believe that the reports discussed today show a shared analysis of what needs to be done.
We have been putting the building blocks in place and now we have to deliver on our commitment.
I am convinced that if we work in partnership we can show that Europe is not about red tape and unnecessary burdens but about delivering what citizens need in the right way.
I believe that if we work in partnership we will reinforce a Community based on the principles of law.
Â Â  . I fully endorse what Mr Barroso said in the latter part of his speech.
On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I have drafted an opinion on Mr Doornâs report.
I should like to congratulate him on it and also thank him for including, virtually in their entirety, the various paragraphs that we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, had incorporated in our opinion, based on our experience.
I would also like to endorse what Mr Winkler said and respond by adding a slightly different slant, namely that better regulation does not always mean fewer rules and regulations or deregulation, but rather more effective regulation that is mainly geared towards the outcome and end result.
This cycle of preparation, consultation, formulating rules, impact assessment and subsequently the implementation and enforcement has been mentioned by various people.
In our opinion, I argued that we should, in fact, start at the back and look at the process from that angle.
How can we make the process effective and based on that, what are the rules that we need to draft?
A bad example of how this was not done, how this had not been given any thought and how the field dimension had not been drawn on at the preparation stage was the services directive which we discussed just now in its original form.
Fortunately, this directive has now been changed by Parliament.
I would also like to mention good examples from that selfsame Directorate-General market.
Particularly in the area of the financial provision of services, a practice has been developed in that directorate and proposed by the Lamfalussy experts committee, which we call the Lamfalussy procedure.
In this framework, it is indeed those who use the rules and regulations in practice, namely the supervisors, the economic operators, the consumers and users involved in the process, who should have far more say in terms of the content of those rules.
We have also used this example to show others, and that is something we would like to make quite clear once again in this discussion.
Whilst we have problems with the call back and Parliamentâs responsibility as colegislator to be able to monitor what is eventually produced, the process as such is something we wholeheartedly support.
Â Â  . Madam President, Mr Winkler, Commissioners, this debate is essential.
It deals, after all, with the Commissionâs right of initiative in legislative matters.
Whether it is a matter of better regulation or of lawmaking, what is important is the way in which the initiative for the law is taken.
If, in the Treaties, the Commission has been granted the right of initiative, it is because it has to represent the general interest.
It has to show this ability not to be merely a sounding board for the various businesses concerned, but to represent all those who cannot necessarily organise themselves.
In this respect, I think we are all convinced of the fact that better regulation is undoubtedly important for the world of business, but that it must also result at times in more legislation.
That, Mr Barroso, is what Parliament told you very clearly, when your Commission was proposing to withdraw 68 proposals for texts and when, very clearly, in relation to Friendly Societies, we spoke of the need for legislation.
On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I drafted an opinion on Mr Garganiâs report, which focuses on simplifying the legislation and, in that regard, I should like to make three observations.
Firstly, we must be mindful of the fact that, in this area, behind every technical question, there clearly lies a political question about content: what is it that we are simplifying?
What are we working on behind the simplification?
Secondly, there are those who sometimes believe that better regulation is synonymous with self-regulation.
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we have, in the form of accounting standards, a perfect example of a situation where, in the absence of very specific democratic regulation, dangerous abuses can sometimes arise.
Finally, the quest for simplification must also lead to the implementation of legislation that is better drawn up, whereby Parliament defines the principles and the rest is left to comitology.
As you know, we fully support such an approach since it is based on a comitology agreement that fully recognises the rights of the co-legislator, that is to say the European Parliament, in the matter.
Â Â  . Madam President, Member States touting protectionism as a positive policy option are dressing up protectionism as patriotism or are scared not of what Europe might become, but of what it already is: an economy based on free trade and competition.
As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and a draftsman of an opinion on better lawmaking, I am adamant that boosting competition via regulatory reform is the initial stimulus that Europe needs to improve productivity.
I see it as imperative that all future legislative impact assessments should take into account the increasing level of global competition.
Furthermore, if the European Union is to become more responsible and flexible to the global current of market change, I propose to the Commission that a review clause be introduced into all new legislation.
Also, it is fundamental that, under the guise of better lawmaking, alternatives to legislation be examined.
Measures such as enhanced levels of consultation and mechanisms to quicken the resolution of disputes need to be investigated.
The prime objective of all legislation should be to allow the internal market to function without cross-border obstacles to the growth of industries.
We must grasp, therefore, the opportunities that are presented by substantial economies of scale through mergers and acquisitions.
I am anxious that concrete steps be taken by the Commission to reduce the cost to business of complying with 25 different national regimes.
I welcome the operation of the Financial Services Action Plan.
However, Member States should not be allowed to become complacent in the implementation of these 42 directives.
If commitment is lacking, then enforcement measures need to be put in place.
Consistency and the rate of implementation need to be improved if the Lisbon objectives and the challenges of globalisation are realistically to be met.
People need to realise that globalisation is here, and it is here to stay.
It is unacceptable politically and economically that some Member States should seek to revert to protectionist policies.
Irish companies and other European companies are trying to make a reality of the single market and tackle the challenges of globalisation head on, and the governments touting protectionism should not stand in their way.
Â Â  I support the efforts of the Commission and everyone else towards better lawmaking and towards the better drafting of European Union legislation, and yet I regret, at the same time, that the Constitutional Treaty has not been adopted.
I regret this, specifically, because in the Constitutional Treaty we prepared a very good transparent regulatory framework, which offers us another opportunity to speed up the process of the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty.
Today, Mr Barroso mentioned areas which require further review.
He should add terrorism to that list.
In the field of terrorism, we have already adopted 58 regulations, directives and so on â 27 of them are in the draft stage and some 15 are yet to come.
In a nutshell, our regulatory system to combat terrorism is extremely untransparent: I am unable to navigate through it and I hope that terrorists are also unable to find their bearings amongst all this confusion.
Europe is suffering from at least two forms of idealism.
The first is normative idealism: if a given area is unregulated, we think that more regulation will solve the problem.
The consequence of this is that regulation is allowed to expand out of all proportion.
The second is organisational idealism: if we think that a field needs to be better regulated, we set up an institution.
The last one we set up was an institution for equal opportunities, and the one before that was an institution for human rights.
As if they were a guarantee of more and better regulation.
These are illusions which will never become reality, so the Commission would do better to examine how these areas are regulated and, of course, how they impact on people.
People are wondering if it is really necessary for us to have so much legislation, so many institutions etc. In addition, I do not believe that the Commission needs new institutions to supervise legislative acts and the revision of their drafts, because we have a Parliament which can fulfil this role perfectly well.
Finally, European institutions will not rise in the public esteem through a multitude of regulations, directives and so on, but rather by acting transparently to benefit the people and strengthen the idea of Europe.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Gargani for the clarity and commitment of his report.
I am delighted that a large part of my opinion has been included and that his report took up my own two objectives, which are, first of all, the emphasis given to the fact that simplification is necessary but must not be achieved in any old fashion, and secondly, the affirmation of Parliamentâs wish to participate fully in the simplification strategy.
We can only welcome any initiative that aims to make the regulatory environment clearer and more coherent.
It is, in fact, impossible to continue working properly with an of more than 80Â 000 pages.
How, in these circumstances, can we talk to the citizens about accessibility and transparency with any credibility?
That is why the simplification strategy must be supported in principle.
It should enable us, in the long run, to have Community and national standards that are easier to apply and less costly.
This simplification, however, also entails a number of limitations, indeed dangers, and we therefore need to be vigilant.
In particular, this report specifies that simplification must not take the form of a lowering of standards, that there are problems linked to the application of the Interinstitutional Agreement governing the recasting procedure and that it is therefore necessary to clarify the applicable rules in order to avoid conflicts of competence and procedural obstacles.
This report also clearly affirms Parliamentâs desire to fully participate in the simplification strategy and it puts the same emphasis on the need to protect Parliamentâs prerogatives as on the question of the adaptation of its rules of procedure.
Simplification cannot, in fact, take place outside of all democratic control and, in particular, outside the control of Parliament.
Parliament must also give thought, within the context of simplification, to the improvement of its procedures and its internal legislative techniques.
This issue will be the subject of a specific report that I am responsible for drafting.
Finally, on the subject of alternative means of regulation, I am very pleased that this report demands a strict framework for recourse to coregulation and self-regulation, because it is essential to provide safeguards in this area.
Â Â  . Madam President, directives and regulations all make up the law that is perhaps the main thing that our citizens see or feel as a result of our activities.
Law is, as it were, our main product.
But lawmaking, especially at a European level, is a process â a lengthy process â not an end point.
This continuum is well represented by the various reports that we are discussing today.
There are the Doorn and the Frassoni reports, one focusing on lawmaking and subsidiarity, the other on monitoring the application of the law.
But our citizens should be at the beginning, the end and at the heart of this process, helping us set the agenda, lobbying and informing us as we make decisions and overseeing how the results work.
The Doorn report has a special focus on the use of impact assessments.
This is really welcome.
But we have to take care.
Impact assessment cannot displace political decision making.
Of course, we need full and independent information from all sides on all aspects, not just the effects on business.
Then we as co-legislators can decide, but it must be our decision, not that of experts, nor of technocrats, stakeholders or lobbyists.
Give us all the information in a balanced manner, then, in full transparency, we can make a political decision for which we are accountable.
No number of impact assessments or re-impact assessments should replace democracy.
Let me turn to one of the main preoccupations of the Committee on Petitions.
It is perhaps the committee in this House that is most in touch with our citizens.
They come to us when the law is not working.
The job of the Petitions Committee is to help citizens highlight the problems with implementation and monitoring of EU law.
This work should be given a much higher profile and recognition, especially in the Commissionâs annual report.
For the umpteenth time, the Petitions Committee has emphasised the need for the Commissionâs infringement proceedings to be more robust and we welcome, therefore, the proposals made by Mrs Frassoni in this respect.
I was also pleased to hear the comments on implementation made by President Barroso.
We have also underlined the place of our citizens in the lawmaking process.
Many of us would like to see them have a role in initiating law, as foreseen by the European citizensâ initiative in the draft Constitutional Treaty; but sadly, probably, this is a matter for another day.
But we could at least ensure that our citizens understand what we are doing in their name.
There seems to be broad support for the proposition that each directive and regulation should be prefaced by a non-legally binding citizensâ summary.
In short, let us have legislation that is accessible in its form, the way we make it and the way we enforce it.
Â Â  . Madam President, I particularly want to welcome all the reports.
As coordinator of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I particularly would like to commend MrsÂ McCarthy on the excellent work she has done, as well as our committee, which held a hearing on this topic.
One of the lessons we must learn from this exercise â and I say this to the select group of colleagues around here â is that better regulation is a shared task for every single Member of this Parliament, whatever committee they belong to.
It is good that we are broadening out the discussion, but too few people are engaged.
The major point I wish to make tonight, linked to the amendments I made to MrsÂ McCarthyâs report, which were accepted by the committee, is that better regulation is a process.
I agree with much of what MrsÂ Wallis says.
The problem is that the process is difficult, complex and very few people understand it.
We have to try to explain and simplify it, but we need to explain it to our own constituencies as well as to people outside.
How many people in this Parliament can really say that they understand the procedures that have now been set up within the Commission to improve the quality of legislation?
How many of you know what your responsibilities are under the famous interinstitutional agreement, which was signed in this very Chamber two years ago by our then President, Pat Cox?
I suspect that if we had a questionnaire about it, most of you would have no idea what those obligations are.
Surely the first thing, colleagues, is that we should be putting our own House in order; that each of us should have that simplified checklist.
We should say, when the Commission sends us a proposal â and this again is a recommendation â that with each proposal there should be just a short checklist about the procedures that the Commission has already gone through and the ones that it will go through in future.
If there are documents and impact assessments, they should be clearly attached to that.
That is the sort of practical definition and clarification of the process that we need.
If we do not do that, citizens outside will lose belief in the process.
The better legislation process is vital for the future of the whole way we do business here.
Â Â  . Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I want to extend very warm thanks to all the rapporteurs and to those who have drafted opinions, not least for having agreed to us having this joint debate on them here today.
This joint debate makes it possible for us to see all the aspects that we have to debate today under the headings of âbetter regulationâ or âbetter lawmakingâ.
I have to admit that it is getting harder and harder for me to get any overview of this debate.
There is often nothing visible behind the well-intentioned forms of words that we hear, and with which we are already familiar.
I also sometimes suspect that this debate on better lawmaking is intended to distract us from our real functions as legislators and to serve as a pretext for inaction on the part of those who legislate for the Community or for better regulation meaning deregulation.
The whole thing has now got so baffling that one is tempted to call for a process of âbetter regulation of the better regulation processâ or for the impact of the impact assessment to be assessed.
I am grateful to the rapporteurs for having worked out some very definite measures, albeit in amidst all this fog, particularly to Mrs Frassoni for her report with its concrete proposals for improved monitoring of the process of transposing Community law, for speedier infringement proceedings and greater transparency for those citizens who bring complaints.
After all, it is not acceptable that members of the public should bring a complaint, or that the Commission should commence infringement proceedings, and then see the proceedings suddenly halted without the public being given any real information as to why this has happened.
This often puts them in a worse position in pending cases at national level, and so rather more transparency is called for here.
Above all, I welcome the proposals that Mr Doorn has put together, especially those relating to impact assessment.
We agree with him that the impact of acts of comitology needs to be assessed too, and with the idea that the impact assessment should be subject to independent review â independent, that is, of the relevant Directorate-General, but not necessarily conducted outside the Commission.
The Commission has its political responsibility, and should not be required to surrender it; indeed, in this specific instance, it has no intention of really doing so.
We do not agree with Mr Doorn, though, on the question of mandatory impact assessments for amendments proposed in this House and in the Council.
I do not think that we, as legislators, should, in this respect, allow ourselves to be shackled and silenced.
A good impact assessment carried out by the Commission will also make it possible to gauge the effects of amendments, and there is also to hand the voluntary application of the impact assessment, of which â as we have heard â the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has already availed itself, and that is something that should be discussed by the other committees too.
What is true of better regulation is true of all other good intentions and of all the good things in this life: it is no good unless something is actually done about it, rather than it just being talked about.
Â Â  . Madam President, I have been campaigning for many years for better lawmaking, particularly in my committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
We need better and more comprehensive impact assessment and we need to look at whether legislation is really needed at EU level, or best left up to Member States in many instances.
If it is needed, we need to have a proper cost-benefit analysis of businesses, including small businesses, and the workforce alike.
I would like to see the impact assessments being truly independent, better than what we have quite often at the moment: a justification for the need for legislation.
Once legislation has been passed, it has to be implemented equally, as we have all been saying, across all Member States.
