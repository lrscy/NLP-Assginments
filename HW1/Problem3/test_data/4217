Unfortunately, ETA has once again revealed its true colours, namely its preference for blind terrorism that rejects democracy and scorns all types of freedom, including one of the most fundamental, which is freedom of expression.
I would ask you to observe a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Agenda
The next item is the order of business.
The draft agenda has been distributed and the following changes have been proposed or made, pursuant to Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure.
First of all, I have two pieces of information to give to you.
Mr Busquin will present the Commission statement on the specific programme implementing the Framework Programmes 2000-2006 of the European Community, on the one hand, for research, technological development and demonstration activities, and of the European Atomic Energy Community, on the other hand, for research and training activities.
I would also inform you that the report by Mr Hans-Peter Mayer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has been withdrawn from the agenda, because it has not yet been adopted by the competent committee.
With regard to the joint debate on environment policy, the Council has informed us that the Swedish Minister for the Environment, Mr Larsson, wishes to attend the debate on the report by Mrs HulthÃ©n.
Therefore, with the agreement of the political groups, the joint debate will be brought forward in the agenda and will be dealt with before the report by Mrs Myller, also on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on a Community Environment Action Programme.
Lastly, I would like to inform you that the deadline for tabling requests for separate, split and roll-call votes has been brought forward to 4 p.m. today, which has also been done at the request of the political groups and with their full agreement.
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
Madam President, in the last few days an agreement has been reached on a European bill to combat paedophilia.
I would point out that this agreement comes a little late considering the thousands of signatures we have had the honour of presenting to you on this issue, and considering the growth of this phenomenon which has struck down so many thousands of children, as it did recently in Italy.
We want quicker justice and tougher legislation.
In fact, all too frequently, economic interests and political connivance lie behind this filthy crime, which marks the lives of thousands of children forever.
We want Parliament to urge the Commission and the Council of Ministers to mount a great campaign against paedophilia, including regulating the use of the Internet, too often the vehicle of paedophiles.
Children all over the world, but especially in Europe, are calling on Parliament to make its voice heard.
We cannot rely solely on late, restrictive documents. We must start to take effective action.
Madam President, I wanted to bring up the issue of a very important meeting which took place yesterday with Justice and Home Affairs ministers, where agreement was made in relation to people' s privacy and their right to privacy, their fundamental rights in access to telecommunications.
This is what is called ENFOPOL 29.
It has never been discussed in this Parliament.
There was a discussion on ENFOPOL 98 about re-writing international user requirements, but this is very different.
It is interpreting the existing requirements and how they will be used within the EU.
It is completely unacceptable that far-reaching decisions have been taken by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs ministers when there has been no debate in this Parliament on the subject.
These decisions will affect us all and will affect everybody outside this Parliament: people will not have the right to privacy, and this is an issue that should be raised right across the board.
It is a fundamental rights issue.
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
Madam President, I should like to address the same issue.
The bad thing about the renewal of these ENFOPOL plans is that they go much further than was planned three years ago.
It will no longer only be traffic data and content data - that is the header of an e-mail and the content - that are monitored, but many, many more details down to credit card details, and IP-ports, which would enable everything on the computer to be monitored.
In other words, there would be no part of the communication that was not monitored.
That was not even mentioned in the documents before the Council.
We have no way of getting hold of the information!
It appears that, because of a formal error, the actual decision has not yet been taken.
It can be taken at any time, however, and no further meeting is required for the purpose.
I should like to repeat the call. We need to debate this.
We have just had a committee of inquiry into Echelon and we are angry that the NSA and other secret services are violating fundamental rights.
What is happening is that something much worse is being planned in the EU and absolutely everything can be monitored!
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
Every time Madam President speaks on the Basque country, she brings to this House the picture of sadness and pain, which is very regrettable.
This is why I systematically join this assembly in mourning the victims - all the victims - of our more than a century-old conflict.
We ought to realise that it is not easy to find an exit to one of Europe' s darkest political tunnels, especially if we stick to the same paths.
We must definitely try something new and we, Euskal Herritarrok are eager to give all the help we can.
Madam President, with your permission I am going to read a paragraph from the editorial published in the Diario Vasco [Basque Daily], the financial director of which, Santiago Oleaga, was murdered by ETA.
This paragraph says: 'There is no doubt about the purpose of Santiago' s murderers.
They killed him with an indescribable sadism in order to spread unease and fear amongst the professionals who work in the different media which ETA has targeted.
The terrorists, however, could not have chosen a more suitable victim to demonstrate the ultimate intention of its action: to silence the messages of those sections of the media in order thereby to silence a whole society to the point that it comes under the control of its abominable tyranny' .
Madam President, I believe that the greatest homage we can pay to Santiago Oleaga is to express our firm rejection of those people who wish to impose that abominable tyranny on us and also express our complete disdain for its spokespeople.
Specific technological R & D programme
The next item is the Commission statement on the specific technological research and development programme.
It is my pleasure to give the floor to Mr Busquin.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today the Commission approved its proposals for the specific programmes of the Research Framework Programme 2000-2006.
A communication on the possible use of Article 169 of the Treaty establishing the European Community to implement the Framework Programme was also approved.
The specific programmes are the instruments for implementation.
Therefore, the Commission' s proposals contain nothing other than the proposal for the Framework Programme, which must be adopted under the co-decision procedure.
The proposals do, however, provide some clarification.
As you are aware, the Commission approved the Framework Programme on 21 February 2001, and this new Framework Programme is specifically designed to help create the European Research Area.
I would like to reiterate the main principles.
Within this context, we presented the Framework Programme with the determination, on the one hand, to focus efforts on a limited number of priorities where Community action would present the greatest added value.
We are also endeavouring to give some structure to the research that is carried out in Europe, through greater interaction between national activities, in order to create a more consistent European Research Area.
We also believe that the management of our Framework Programmes must be made more easy and simple in terms of the means of intervention in place.
In order to implement the Framework Programme, we are proposing a structure based on five specific programmes.
This structure is a faithful reflection of that of the Framework Programme and translates the political project into reality.
This structure is as follows: a programme on 'Integrating and strengthening the European Research Area' which brings together all the activities involving research and coordination of research policies in Europe; a programme on 'Structuring the European Research Area' which covers activities involving the integration of research and innovation, the mobility of researchers and infrastructures and issues relating to science and society, and the links between science and the public - all increasingly burning issues within European society.
We also have a programme covering Euratom research activities and then two programmes covering the activities of the Joint Research Centre, in the non-nuclear and nuclear fields respectively.
The content of the proposals aims to provide clarification with regard to the scientific and technological content, which is presented in much more detail than in the Framework Programme.
These proposals, however, also concern the new instruments of implementation, which are central to the philosophy of the Framework Programme 2002-2006, the creation of networks of excellence and integrated projects.
Further details regarding the way this will operate will be provided in the rules for participation in and dissemination of the Framework Programme adopted under the co-decision procedure, the proposals for which the Commission will present at a later date.
I also said that with regard to the communication on the implementation of Article 169 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has never truly been applied, we have put together some suggestions on practical ways in which the Community might participate in jointly implemented national programmes.
This is the meaning of Article 169.
Our aim is, therefore, to launch a political debate on this issue.
On the basis of these initial results, the Commission intends to present a proposal at a later date, on a framework decision on the general conditions for Community support within the context of Article 169 and the possible areas where this could be used.
Madam President, I think that it is true to say that this is the first time that the Commission has presented its proposals for specific programmes so quickly after having presented the proposal for a Framework Programme.
We believe, therefore, that we are responding to a request by Parliament with the aim of facilitating political debate, by providing this further clarification.
This information also includes accurate and clear details, since the new instruments require this, and we have also planned an information session with the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 5 June 2001.
I believe, therefore, that we will have done everything possible to enable Parliament and the Council to approve, within the specified time frame, the new Framework Programme that is a tool for creating the European Research Area, which, in my opinion, is widely supported by the European Union.
Thank you, Mr Busquin, for your statement.
Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner warmly for his explanation and particularly for the fact that he managed to adhere to the agreed deadlines.
That is a major achievement.
I should also like to ask him if he could answer the questions put to him by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy as soon as possible.
That will, in turn, enable us to adhere to the deadlines, which is very important in my opinion.
I have two explicit questions to put to the Commissioner.
Firstly, in the specific programme, the most important research, and thus the money, is earmarked for the human genome and biotechnology.
This may be a major area of research, but the results will only become evident over a ten- to fifteen-year period.
At present, many EU citizens still die, unfortunately, of the three well-known diseases, namely cancer, heart and vascular diseases, and signs of ageing, such as Alzheimer' s.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has expressed a growing need for a separate life-science programme within the context of the human genome and biotechnology.
I should like to find out from the Commissioner whether he would be prepared to help us think about setting up a programme of this kind.
My second question to the Commissioner is of a technical nature: the Commissioner delivered a comprehensive explanation with regard to Article 169 of the Treaty.
Why does he not apply Article 168 of the Treaty?
Surely that would be a far more practical approach.
Madam President, I would like to say to Mr Van Velzen that the questions were officially sent to us on Monday 28 May 2001 and that we shall do everything possible to answer them before the end of the week.
You shall, therefore, have the answer at the beginning of next week, I assure you, and we will be able to continue the debate on these issues.
With regard to the two more specific questions, Mr Van Velzen has quite rightly mentioned health problems, including both degenerative neurological diseases and cancer problems, and he will see that, if these specific programmes are approved, there is the prospect of carrying out European added-value research on this issue, within the context of genomics and health.
For example, there are opportunities in the specific programme to undertake clinical trials for cancer and degenerative diseases, which are some of the new possibilities opened up by genomics.
This does not mean, however, that they cannot be begun immediately, since there is an undeniable European added value.
Regarding Article 169, as I mentioned, we have produced a document, which is launching the debate along these lines, and we shall explain why Article 168 is not used in the same way.
Mr Van Velzen will be given a very clear answer to this in the answers to the questions.
Madam President, I should also like to congratulate the Commissioner and the Commission on this proposal.
If I understand you correctly, however, this Sixth Framework Research Programme contains far fewer specific programmes than the fifth and I should like to ask you why?
What are the reasons?
We therefore have fewer specific programmes for the sectoral themes.
Up until now, we had one for biotechnology, one for energy, one for the environment, and so on. In future that is all going to be under one roof.
Are you not afraid this will make the framework research programme less visible?
Is there not also a danger that the lobbies representing various professional groups and sectors will be less involved in the Sixth Framework Programme because they are not clear what area it falls under?
My question is: Can you give us the reasons why you have fewer specific programmes this time than last?
I would like to say to Mr Linkohr that the aim is to move towards a European Research Area, and, therefore, to give more structure to research at this level, and he is one of the first within Parliament to have said to me that we should avoid spreading research too thinly.
The Framework Programme represents a considerable amount of money, but it only equates to 5% of public spending on research in Europe.
We must not, therefore, expect the Framework Programme to fund all European research.
What the programme can do is to contribute to acting as a catalyst for European research and to give it greater consistency.
If the approach that we adopt is focused on too many sectors, we will then end up with many different measures and our efforts will be too dispersed.
We have therefore attempted to tackle the problem by dealing with priority issues first.
I have just mentioned the problem of genomics, which affects many subjects relating to health and biotechnology, but in the field of nanotechnology, with which Mr Linkohr is very familiar, which is, in other words, developing technologies using more intelligent processes and materials which waste less energy and matter, a large number of sectors will be affected, including the automotive and the aeronautics sectors.
We are, therefore, aiming for consistency rather than to cover a whole range of problems.
I do believe that this issue concerning the number of specific programmes should not prevent a dialogue on the content of the priorities.
We will, obviously, be able to go into much more detail in the content of the priorities.
You will see that we will make a further step forward by approving the specific programmes.
I believe that the dialogue established with the Commission will enable us to further clarify this determination to create the European Research Area.
I think that the current shortcomings are well known.
We are spreading our resources too thinly and Europe does not have a critical mass to devote to the main research objectives, in contrast to other developed countries such as the United States and Japan, and so we must create this critical mass.
The European programme can help to achieve this, with new provisions, such as improved networking of national programmes.
We must encourage coherent action.
It is, to some extent, because of this that there are not as many catalogues of specific programmes in each area.
Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his explanation.
Nevertheless, I should like to take the liberty of disagreeing with him as regards his last answer and to side with Mr Linkohr: whether a programme comprises twenty different topics or constitutes one specific programme, each programme must be assessed on its own merits, and must have its own scope and budget.
It then appears less ambiguous to me for those who subscribe to these programmes if these programmes are kept more separate.
That was not my question, however.
Like Mr van Velzen, I would like to ask when we will be receiving a response to the questions we have put to you in writing. You, as no other, know how often I have asked the Commission on what basis certain priorities in the Framework Programme are, in fact, used and what criteria have been used in the process.
I, nor anyone else who has asked similar questions, have ever received a response to that question.
I hope that this will now change.
As for answering the questions, I would simply like to point out that we received the questions on Monday.
It is Wednesday today, and we shall, therefore, answer them before the end of the week.
I think that such tight deadlines respect Parliament and the work that we are trying to do together.
I am determined to ensure that replies are fully consistent with one another, so that dialogue becomes increasingly clear and accurate.
With regard to the problem of choices, I believe I have told you that the main priorities, and I have already had the opportunity to answer Parliament on this issue, are, on the one hand, the work by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) and the debates held with the Centre for Renewable Energy Sources (CRES) with various representatives of the Member States' scientific councils, and, on the other hand, the general trends within the scientific and industrial community, be it genomics, nanotechnologies, the problem of the information society, food safety, sustainable development, and I agree with you on this that there should be more clarification on issues regarding transport, the environment and energy.
The main lines were, I believe, defined in accordance with very objective criteria, and I have already had the opportunity to answer, but there has always been a choice.
Ultimately, I am still asking the question - what else do you wish to add?
Let us discuss this.
I believe that there is a degree of flexibility within the framework of the specific programmes, but only on the condition that we do not fall into the trap of following a scatter-gun approach which would compromise the coherence of the Framework Programme.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the Commissioner, both for his statement and for the ongoing debate with us which he puts himself through, as we ask him a great deal of questions, but gradually we have what is needed in order to do our work, and I believe that the seminar due to take place on 5 June 2001 will provide us with further information.
I would also like to emphasise the need to create a European Research Area, and the need for the innovation that this represents, to make the Sixth Framework Programme more flexible and easier to access.
I am thinking, in particular, of the European added value, which we will find if there is more interaction between the countries of the European Union, namely through grants provided to young people so that they can go and carry out research and work in other Member States and discover more about themselves.
We must also be able to maintain the values and the knowledge that we have in Europe and not just watch these go elsewhere.
Lastly, with regard to the specific programmes, I would like to emphasise innovation, this time in the area of sustainable development.
This is an important subject, which we discuss a great deal, but it is an area in which still too little is done.
I would like to draw my fellow Members' attention to the fact that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is organising a meeting on this issue in Parliament, in Brussels and this will take place next week on 6 June.
We would like to invite all Members to come and share their views on sustainable development, energy, renewable energy, the environment and ecology in particular, so that we can take these into account and make some proposals in this area which is of great interest to us.
Mobility is extremely important for providing research with a truly European dimension.
There are two aspects to this issue; firstly, obstacles preventing researchers and teachers and others from moving around at present. A High Level Working Group met with experts from all the Member States and submitted a report to us, which will also be discussed at the Research Council on 26 June, and will be communicated to Parliament to present all the difficulties regarding mobility encountered by the scientific community.
As I often say, it is more difficult for a researcher who has qualified in Europe to go to another European country than to go, for instance, to the United States.
There are, therefore, obstacles that we must try to face and to remove.
The second aspect to this issue concerns the mobility of young researchers. You are aware that we have the Marie Curie programme, which is a success, but we would like to double the resources in the proposals allocated to assisting the mobility of young researchers, and also to create grants to attract researchers to Europe, so that Europe once again becomes an attractive option for the best researchers in the world including third countries.
You will see that there are very specific proposals on the issues of mobility in the programme.
Lastly, I believe that my final point, which is the problem of how to put into practice the elements of sustainable development, is included in the policy that Parliament, the Commission and the Council will discuss at Gothenburg.
I believe that there is research to be done in these areas, particularly on the specific examples, in order to support the policies of sustainable development.
Furthermore, Mr PiÃ©trasanta, you have put forward the idea of having some specific ecosites, for example, in a specific area, which, I believe, is a good example of how sustainable development can be achieved on a local level and I think that creating a network of ecosites is something that is feasible in Europe.
Madam President, I hope you will not rule me out of order, but I have a very specific question to the Commissioner on research.
I rather sympathise with my colleagues who think that the way in which the new programmes are going to be organised makes it difficult to see what is actually happening.
My specific question is this: one of the things on which research is urgently needed is the efficacy of vaccination in outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease.
I do not know - and I conducted some research into this - what is happening as regards such research within the Framework Programme, either the present one or the one which is planned.
It would be extremely useful for many people in Europe to know what is being done.
I fear very much on the basis of the experience in the United Kingdom that foot-and-mouth disease is not going away and that we may be dealing with it over a long period.
European research is therefore absolutely urgent.
Madam President, regarding the problems of research into foot-and-mouth disease, the issue of food safety has become a priority in the new Framework Programme, as has food quality.
We are, moreover, planning to allocate EUR 600 million to this section of the programme.
I believe, therefore, that we will then have a greater opportunity to adapt the programmes to new problems.
The point that we must stress is that we are able to retain a degree of flexibility and adaptability for urgent situations, which means that we will not be committed today if we adopt a new Framework Programme lasting until 2005, without being able to predict what could happen at that time.
In the specific programmes, therefore, we are presenting what, in our opinion, must be put aside on an annual basis in order to deal with possible urgent and specific programmes.
With regard to research that has been carried out into foot-and-mouth disease in the past and within the Framework Programme, I would like to send you details of the research to which the Commission has access, and I shall specifically ask the Commission services to let you know about these as soon as possible.
Madam President, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for attending this session and for observing the deadlines which are set by both parties when we have our debates.
I would also like to confirm that we support the general structure of the project.
However, having listened to what he has said on the five specific programmes, I would like to remind the Commissioner that Parliament is concerned that the number is too low and I would like to ask the Commissioner about how he intends to monitor the specific programmes, both in Parliament and in the Council of Ministers.
My second question concerns the instruments.
I hope that the Commissioner will talk about the flexibility that is needed and which, in our opinion, seems crucial, between the proposed new instruments and the old instruments that have been retained, at least on a temporary basis.
My third and final question is this: what guarantees can the Commissioner give that the Council will keep back the proposed EUR 17.5 billion?
I also have a tie-breaker question. Is the Commissioner personally in favour of continuing the work of the Joint Research Centre in the best possible circumstances?
Thank you, Mr Caudron.
Naturally, all these questions would benefit from a lengthy discussion, but I would like to attempt to provide you with some initial answers, in the telegraphic style that we are using today.
With regard to the programme for monitoring priorities, this applies as much to the Council as to Parliament because the Framework Programme is subject to the co-decision procedure, and the obvious advantage of having a specific programme covering all the priorities is the single committee, which is a committee that can be sub-divided, if you like, according to different areas of interest.
I think that, in the discussion, the problem is not necessarily the number but is rather being able to hold an in-depth debate on a specific number of priorities.
I think, therefore, that we can discuss working arrangements and the way the programme will be applied to see how we can deal with this objection.
To take the problem of new instruments versus old instruments, we have to be clear on this point. We believe that the new Framework Programme must be the cornerstone for the creation of Brussels' European Research Area.
Assessments that have been carried out on previous programmes show that they can be useful, because they enable contacts to be made at European level, but that they do not provide enough structure.
This is quite clear and that is why we need new instruments.
I understand the concerns felt every time the word 'new' is mentioned.
It is difficult to adapt to change and this is to be expected.
This reaction is, therefore, extremely understandable and I sympathise with some of the concerns, hence the need to explain things carefully.
I would, however, like to say that calls for proposals are still applicable in the so-called Category 8, which brings together support for policies with emerging policies.
So, over EUR 1.6 billion is available for the calls for proposals in the original meaning of the word.
The proposal is, therefore, understood.
As for the general budget, in my opinion, I think that although it appears to have a degree of approval from the Council, I believe I am right in saying that the Swedish Presidency proposes to hold an initial informal discussion on the budget at the Research Council on 26 June.
I hope that our proposal will be adopted.
This is a sensible proposal, which is also part of the financial perspectives that were drawn up in Berlin on the various policies of the Commission.
I believe, therefore, that this could be done.
My last point relates to the Joint Research Centre.
As you are aware, we have made an effort to focus the tasks of the Joint Research Centre on areas to which it is best suited. In other words, tasks involving joint monitoring, joint tests and scientific expertise in problems relating to the environment, health, some aspects of the nuclear industry and security in terms of the information society.
These are useful tools, and, of course, we have a programme for the Joint Research Centre, which, in budgetary terms, is, admittedly, unlikely to increase, but which allows the role of the Joint Research Centre to be more targeted.
I believe, therefore, that the Centre will always have a future provided that it is given tasks, which will be of benefit to the whole of the European Union.
Madam President, I should like to revisit briefly the problems which have typified the animal products sector for the past couple of months and years.
We are faced with two problems: BSE, for which better tests can be developed, and foot-and-mouth disease, for which a marker vaccine can be developed.
I should like to find out from the Commissioner what specific contingency measures he intends to put in place in this connection.
I believe that public opinion can no longer accept the massive slaughtering of healthy animals.
We, in Europe, will need to do something about this as soon as possible, and I would like a clear response from the Commissioner to the question when the European Union intends to contribute to developments in that area.
(no microphone) ...problems relating to research, since I am speaking about research.
As for diseases, 48 research projects on diseases, including BSE and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, were set out in the previous programme following the drawing up of the process.
We have a document, therefore, which includes all the research projects that have been carried out and a decision was taken at the last meeting of the Council of Ministers for Research - which was a first - to organise a meeting of all researchers at European level - and I do not mean veterinarians or colleges specialising in veterinary studies - I mean researchers working on issues relating to mad cow disease and on issues relating to Creuzfelt Jacob disease, which also has particularly worrying and perturbing implications for human health.
It is a pleasure for me to inform Members of Parliament that we have recently completed this task, which has been acknowledged as unique, of drawing up a list of every single research project in Europe.
It is an interesting project in itself because researchers in many countries were surprised to find out that there were other researchers in other countries undertaking similar research as them.
This document will be available at the meeting of the Council of Research Ministers on 26 June 2001 and it will be published - I have already had the opportunity to hold a press conference to announce this and explain the main points, but I think that this is much more practical.
As for the policies on whether or not to slaughter animals, I think that you must speak to my colleagues, Mr Byrne or Mr Fischler, as these policies are defined according to either health and consumer protection or the common agricultural policy.
Madam President, we are now discussing animal diseases, but Commissioner, humans too still face tragic diseases.
For example, the spreading of apparently inexplicable diseases in people can be traced back to explainable causes, such as uranium, which is depleted or not, as the case may be, and diseases of the immune system which are said to be caused by substances in the environment.
Could you give us a reassurance that you will be devoting the necessary attention to research in this field?
I should like to ask you in more general terms whether Europe' s shortfall, compared to the United States, will ever take an end?
Europe is lagging behind in areas such as spending of resources.
Could the Commissioner assure us that more resources will be made available, both by the Community and by the Member States?
The Commissioner has told us time and again that it is not so relevant to keep alluding to the discrepancy between fundamental and applied research.
Could we, despite this, assume that fundamental research in Europe will not lag behind?
In response to the first question, it is clearly evident that, in the specific programmes that the Commission adopted this morning, you will see, Mrs Maes, that there are some very clear headings on the effects of the environment on health, as well as, for example, the effects of chemical products.
Studies of this type are planned.
Some have already been carried out, but you are right to say that issues of prevention do exist.
Health risks related to the environment - you will see in the document - are dealt with on the page on the priority entitled 'Food safety and health risks' .
With regard to the resources that the European Union is making available for research, I think that I tell everyone that it is essential that we make a greater overall effort.
This was the message in the statement on the European Research Area - we are only spending 1.9% of our GNP whereas the United States spend 2.7% and Japan 3.1%.
Since the Lisbon and the Stockholm Summits, a considerable number of people have become aware of this, and the Heads of Government often discuss the European Research Area.
I was also pleased to read that Mr Jospin spoke of the need for a European Research Area in his speech on the European Union, but said that Member States' determination was crucial.
They must step up their efforts.
That is why the issue of benchmarking, which we are implementing, of comparisons between research efforts, and of raising the resources to catalyse this research by creating integrated projects through bringing about the European Research Area, by providing support from the Commission to make national programmes consistent, must create a dynamic to help this research.
Similarly, you are quite right to highlight a crucial problem at European level, which is the problem of young researchers.
We do not stress often enough that the average age of researchers in Europe is higher than the average age of the European population.
This means that there is a problem, that there has not been any recruitment or development of scientific research in our Member States.
Generally, there has been a specific problem for the last 20 years and there is currently a need, therefore, to attract young people to careers in research and to develop them in this career.
Clearly, in many Member States - and perhaps this is putting it very bluntly - there is something almost scandalous about the status of young researchers in terms of their social and financial standing.
This is, therefore, a problem that must be tackled throughout Europe, and I believe that we can provide various comparisons so that all Member States properly address this problem, and I can say that people are becoming aware of this now.
Everyone knows that the knowledge-based society is the driving force of the economy of the future.
At the Lisbon Summit, it was acknowledged that 25 to 50% of the economy is related to knowledge and therefore to research and innovation.
This is a positive aspect that we are indeed attempting to make known as far and wide as possible.
The Framework Programme must play a part in increasing awareness of this issue.
Madam President, Commissioner Busquin, you are calling for greater integration of research activities at European level on the one hand and at national, regional and international level on the other.
There is a very typical example in my region, namely the cooperation between the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg and the Transuran Institute in Karlsruhe.
The question arises: should we not in future bring in a European integration week highlighting good examples, and will integration not also require financial assistance from the European Union, which could be used to support particularly promising joint research ventures?
I fully support what Mr Schwaiger has said as that is exactly what we want to do.
I can tell him that, with regard to the large research centres in Europe which do not fall within the competence of the European Union, like CERN in Geneva and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, we have made initial contacts with them.
For the first time, we are attempting to establish links between them.
They came here to Brussels to meet independently with the Commission, but in doing so created a critical mass.
I would like to give the same example of INSERM in France that you give of Heidelberg and of the Cancer Research Centre, as you know that there is an INSERM team from France working at Heidelberg with the German Cancer Research Centre.
It is vital that we help to create these national links, through either Article 169 or through supporting cooperation in the national programmes.
However, your idea of showing this networking in a practical manner is an excellent idea, which perhaps, if I may, I can use to show what already exists and that we must build on this.
The Commission' s role will be to enable everyone to take part, depending on their interests in a number of areas, but it is obvious that there are initiatives that have been taken.
The dynamic potential of the European Research Area is already being felt in some national institutions that have taken this dynamic spirit to heart.
Madam President, I welcome the Commissioner' s statement that he is in listening mode.
I wonder if he would listen in particular to those people who are working in the field of public health and their concerns that what has been a very good programme on public health care, health promotion and illness prevention seems to be disappearing.
As I understand it, within the first seven categories of research programmes, when health comes in, it is confined to highly scientific biomedical research programmes.
When people ask what is happening to public health care research, they are told that it has gone into the all-embracing Category 8, which is rather a jumble sale of a programme with a very small amount of money attached.
They are told that directorates-general of the Commission are already being invited to submit bids, so it is Agriculture bidding against Environment bidding against Health, and so on. This area of public health looks like missing out, just at the time when the Treaty of Amsterdam is putting it up the agenda for the European Union.
Will he have a look at that, because if we are going to get the research programme right, we need to have research into that research programme, and to listen to the people in the field.
I fully understand this question.
I believe that this is the type of discussion that we are going to have.
First of all, let me take the content of the priorities.
As part of genomics research, it is obvious that there are health policies within this as well.
I have already answered Mr Van Velzen with regard to the problem of cancer and the problem of Alzheimer' s disease, which will continue to be investigated.
I recently attended a meeting of the leading European cancer specialists.
They all know that genomics research represents a potential solution for this disease, as we are advancing towards developing increasingly individually-tailored types of treatment, taking into account aspects of genomics research.
This is not theoretical genomics dating back 10 or 15 years - these are elements of application that can be highlighted.
One of our objectives is, therefore, to create a network of the leading cancer researchers.
There is no contradiction whatsoever.
Having said this, you are right to highlight that public health research, which appears to have less of a genuine scientific dimension, but which focuses instead on epidemiology, should also be carried out.
It is true that this has not been planned in Category 8.
It is planned in another category that perhaps has not been emphasised enough, namely the cooperation of national programmes.
We could, therefore, put 'co-operate' on, for example, all epidemiological data.
EUR 400 million has been set aside to strengthen the European Research Area.
There are several angles of attack.
You are quite right to say that we should do everything to help to give the problem a European dimension.
These aspects must always be taken into consideration.
Madam President, I would like first of all to highlight the excellent cooperation which exists between Commissioner Busquin and the European Parliament, by means of the committee which I chair, on issues of research.
I would also like to take this opportunity to communicate to you the double concern of the scientific community, which is practically unanimous, in relation to two questions.
The first is that the scientific community unreservedly supports the idea of a common area of research.
However, on the other hand, it has serious doubts that the effect of synergy and added value at a European level may be lost by means of a concentration of the different research projects; that is to say, the smaller the nucleus, the more concentrated those projects are, the more difficult it is for these synergies to be produced at a European level.
The second question relates to the instruments.
The three instruments planned: the networks of excellence, on the one hand, the integrated projects and the recourse to Article 169.
The scientific community is concerned about the fact that these three instruments are new and that they are the only ones being used.
It fears that others which were being used will be lost despite the fact that the scientific community had become accustomed to them.
It also fears that a whole series of research teams which had been created could be lost, all of a sudden, as a result of the exclusive application of these three instruments.
I would therefore like the Commissioner to respond to this double concern.
Mr Westendorp y Cabeza has asked a fundamental question.
We will try to answer it point by point.
I think that we must consider the dynamic that we wanted to create, in other words, greater concentration, a European added value in the projects, a dynamic of giving structure to the European Research Area.
I have already mentioned this.
What, then, is the meaning of the question?
It is the fact that there are obstacles to creating this structure, because the proposals are too dispersed.
The risks of dispersion will increase with new countries joining the EU and with enlargement.
We will then have projects that are too small in size, creating problems that the scientific community has itself seen as well; problems involving deadlines, bureaucracy and the fact that the projects are not sufficiently ambitious.
This is the negative aspect.
We must, therefore, find the right balance, with ambitious, more integrated projects, which involve the whole scientific community.
These projects are, moreover, more geared towards the scientific community, because they have a European added value and they are projects for the longer term.
The networks of excellence, for example, are a long-term venture and they affect the scientific community more than the current system.
I am aware of the need to find a balance between the desire to create this European space, the dimension of projects, and the fact that everyone should feel involved.
Our task, therefore, is to provide information, to refine things, all the more so because the three instruments are tools for the priority areas, but are not so within the context of the 8th Category, where there are projects which remain linked to the support for the European Union' s policy, and therefore with traditional proposals.
I believe, however, that the whole debate that we will hold will actually be to find the right balance between change and a certain conformity, which has posed several problems in managing all the projects.
We are managing 14 000 projects.
I would like to say once again that the European Research Area is not simply the European Framework Programme.
The European Framework Programme is an aspect of the European Research Area.
The European Research Area will also be created through the determination of Member States to increase their collaboration with one another in terms of their research tools.
We must, therefore, play a part in this.
That is our aim.
Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner, for I think that this is one of the most important areas of all that we are discussing here today.
We are, of course, concerned here with the creation of those values which will ensure prosperity in Europe for many years to come.
Unfortunately, responsibility for research lies, in particular, with governments which, in all European countries - almost without exception - have merely been cutting back. Nor am I sure that our Swedish brethren are in any way doing anything to encourage support for the national basic research programmes which generate the new knowledge.
If, in the Sixth Framework Programme, we are to achieve a situation in which innovative small companies have access to programmes without their intellectual rights being destroyed, we must have mechanisms which enable companies to have access from outside to the major research programmes and which make it possible for contracts to be concluded without subsequent unnecessary bureaucracy.
One fundamental question is therefore the following: has the Council finally got around to giving the research department a mandate to conclude contracts without the need for umpteen signatures?
If it has not done so, then your power to act is very limited, Commissioner.
It is frustrating for a small enterprise or university department to be obliged, at the diktat of the Council, to wait for heaven knows how many signatures.
Have we taken account of this important issue in connection with the restructuring of the Commission's procedures?
I am delighted that the Council is there for once, and I am looking forward to hearing the Commission' s answer.
I fully support what Mr Rovsing has said.
The new instruments aim to provide greater responsibility and increased flexibility.
We would like to avoid having such restrictive and off-putting rules for participation - these have no place in the Sixth Framework Programme.
The rules for participation must, therefore, offer more to small and medium-sized businesses and the scientific community than they currently do.
This is absolutely clear.
Because of this, the integrated projects will be more adaptable and more flexible and will prevent rules being so restrictive that they are out of the reach of small and medium-sized businesses.
Madam President, I want to use my speech to thank Commissioner Busquin for the exceptional opportunities he affords us by maintaining a continuous relationship with the European Parliament.
We certainly think the programme as a whole is going well, but it does need improvement.
That is the task we must undertake together.
Improvement is needed, for example, in the general approach, which is still too bureaucratic.
The components of the programme need to be clarified, and so, in my opinion, does the redistribution of the financial architecture.
In my opinion, the extremely urgent, serious, emergency issues relating to human health must certainly be considered priorities.
When we debate networks and centres of excellence, then, I am sure the Commissioner will also see the need for dialogue with Parliament.
As far as our parliamentary committee is concerned, we have an idea for a whole series of centres of excellence to be active in Europe.
I therefore believe this continuous relationship can enhance the whole programme and make it possible to find the answers to urgent questions like those raised by Mrs Jackson and Mr Bowis, for example.
In other words, we should not be working in our own little sealed compartments. We have put together a European public health programme which can certainly be extremely useful to the Commissioner, and I am sure he has largely taken it into account already.
Thank you, Mr NisticÃ².
I think that the expression that he used to say the programmes must not be too compartmentalised is the answer but phrased differently, to which I say that we must attempt to avoid excessively strict systems that are too compartmentalised, and therefore take up the broad themes, such as, of course, anything related to neurology, genomics, which are problems that will affect health and which affect various areas, and therefore, we will have greater interaction, create networks of excellence taking into account these various elements - this is the idea behind it.
This idea must go forward, however, with, of course, a dialogue between the various scientific communities.
In this respect, Members of Parliament are obviously well-placed to bring, first of all, the questions from the scientific communities that I am seeing surface, but also proposals for creating networks of excellence on the themes that are of interest to the European Union and which have an undeniable European added value.
This is one of the fundamental criteria.
I believe, as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, that on 5 June, which is next Tuesday, we have an afternoon of work, during which we will attempt to find practical aspects based on the specific programmes as have been set out, but also based on legitimate questions on the new instruments.
Thank you, Mr Busquin.
I would also like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the debate.
The debate is closed.
Can I make a suggestion for the future.
At the beginning of this session, I waved my hands repeatedly for a long time. I may or may not have got on the list, but I had no idea whether or not this was the case.
Would perhaps one of your assistants acknowledge our wavings so that we would know we can stop and whether we are on the list or not.
It might help us.
Certainly, Mr Purvis.
Your suggestion has my support.
Treaty of Nice and the future of the EU
The next item is the report (A5-0168/2001) by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Treaty of Nice and the future of the European Union.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, four years ago, when I had the honour of presenting the statement on the Treaty of Amsterdam to this Parliament, together with my friend Dimitri Tsatsos, I ended that speech by recalling the words of Miguel de Cervantes who, when old and tired and weary of life, said that there were times when one had to chose between the road or the inn, between moving forward and staying put, and I said: 'we must chose the road, we must move ahead' .
Amsterdam is one more step in that direction.
I remember that the Commissioner, our good friend Marcelino Oreja, replied to me with more words from Miguel de Cervantes, telling us of the sorcerers, who can deprive us of everything, but never of our hope.
Does the Treaty of Nice, therefore, represent that hope which the European Parliament had put its faith in?
The answer is clear: no, it is not what the European Parliament was asking for, because the European Parliament wanted a thoroughgoing reform of the institutions; because the European Parliament wanted to prepare the Union for enlargement; because the European Parliament wanted to deal with the problems of concern to the citizens.
The truth, however, is that the governments, which control the agenda at an Intergovernmental Conference, took a different decision and the agenda was, therefore, not the one the European Parliament wanted.
The Treaty of Nice has not resolved many of these issues.
It has only resolved some of them, satisfactorily in some cases and insufficiently in others.
I believe that the merit of this resolution - if it has any - and of this report that Antonio Seguro and myself are presenting, is that it is a balanced document, which reflects that nature of a Parliament which is no longer merely there to provide impetus but is now a co-decision maker.
A co-decision-making Parliament means a responsible Parliament and, therefore, a Parliament which has to do things in a balanced way.
I would like to pay tribute to all the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs who have worked extremely hard to reach a consensus, starting with its Chairman, Giorgio Napoletano, and also my good friend, Antonio Seguro, who has not only been a solid and intelligent contributor, but also an honest one.
We are, therefore, talking about a balanced document, in which we explain what we do not like and what we want to see modified in the future, because agreements, and the Treaty of Nice is an agreement, do not last forever - forever is no more than an adverb of time - and are liable to be reformed.
The Treaty of Nice itself contains the seed of such a reform.
I believe that this resolution looks to the future, towards that Declaration No 23, which lays down the basis for reform.
In this constructive spirit, we wanted to help the Swedish Presidency, with which we have had much contact over the last few months, so that this European Council in Gothenburg may show us the future of the European Union through the responses of its institutions.
Madam President, we want to see national committees set up in all the Member States so that the people may hold a genuine debate, not a phoney one, and in that way we will discover what the citizens want of Europe in the future.
This Parliament also wishes to see the Intergovernmental Conferences prepared by means of a democratic method.
We believe that the convention that drafted the Charter on Fundamental Rights should provide the model for this democratic method.
Today, when we are seeing so many proposals from different people, all on the convention - which is a positive start - I would say that what the European Parliament wants is a convention based on the model of the convention which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights: on that one and none other; because that model was shown to be successful and it brought together various authorities in order to achieve the desired result.
On the basis of the convention model, we want the result of that convention also to be the role played by the governments in the Intergovernmental Conference.
We are going to make constitutional proposals, and we must not be afraid of the term 'constitutional' because, when we talk of competences or institutional structure, we are talking about constitutional issues.
The result we are seeking is a European Constitution, and I wish to make this completely clear, a European Constitution which makes everybody' s competences absolutely clear and, above all, makes it clear what each institution does within the institutional structure.
We want this to be ready before 2004, before the European Parliament elections, so that the political groups in this House can go into these elections defending our choices.
Madam President, I believe - and I recall my initial comments - that this is a path of hope.
We are facing the Europe of the euro, the Europe of enlargement, and it is up to us whether this is a path of hope or a path which leads us to a situation of stalemate in the European Union, which none of us want to see.
I therefore want this resolution to make a constructive contribution to this road of hope becoming ever broader and our becoming ever more European.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Barnier, it will come as no surprise if I begin my speech by restating our disappointment at the outcome of the Nice Conference, at the options taken and at the timidity of the Conference' s work in Nice.
We feel that Nice was just a continuation of Amsterdam and was therefore a wasted opportunity for Europe to take a solid and far-reaching step forwards, in its process of gaining political and social depth.
The European Parliament strove to ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights was incorporated into the Treaties and the Conference approved the Charter but failed to incorporate it into the Treaties.
The European Parliament wanted more subjects to be decided not by unanimity but by qualified majority, because the situation is already difficult with fifteen countries, let alone twenty-seven and the Conference decided on precisely the opposite.
The European Parliament wanted the qualified-majority rule for Council decisions to be changed to coÂ­decision with this Parliament, and the Conference did not do what we felt was right.
Nice had the shortest agenda in the history of the Intergovernmental Conference and yet took the most cautious step of any Treaty reform.
Contrary to what we wanted to see, Nice left an image of a Europe of 'national self-interest' , instead of a Europe of 'a community of values' . An image of a Europe in which it seems that every State was looking after itself more than it was looking after Europe.
Europe is not about each country looking after its own interests, but about all countries looking after all the others, in homage to the founders of this European project.
Yet, the Council was aware of this when it adopted 'Declaration 23' , saying and acknowledging that it had achieved a very minimal result in Nice.
It also acknowledged, to a certain extent, that the method of preparing for this Conference was completely inadequate.
Nevertheless, we feel that one of Nice' s other, positive aspects, was to enable us to make progress on the enlargement process.
It is precisely within this triangle and this balance, which my colleague IÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo was discussing, that the European Parliament is positioned, bearing in mind the results from Nice, which were a disappointment, bearing in mind the opportunity to make progress on enlargement, and bearing in mind the fact that a debate and a new method of preparing and revising the Treaties are being initiated. This new method will enable us to take a more global, more serious, more coherent and, above all, deeper view of Europe.
We will not achieve this by saying 'yes' , as we did in Maastricht, to the Treaty of Nice or by saying, as we did in Amsterdam, 'yes' to the Treaty of Amsterdam, and nor will we achieve this by contributing to bringing the enlargement process to a standstill. What we must do, therefore, is engage in positive cooperation, in order to ensure that enlargement does actually take place.
To put it in another way, the European Parliament does not wish to be part of the problem, it wishes to be part of the solution.
I therefore state once again that our report does not attach less importance to the assessment of the Treaty of Nice than to the Laeken Council conclusions, but we shall take account of the Gothenburg and Laeken Council conclusions when the European Parliament has to deliver an opinion on convening the next Intergovernmental Conference.
Why do I say this?
Because we want serious and far-reaching solutions.
We therefore propose, firstly, a new method of preparing for a revision of the Treaties.
We want a convention.
As a matter of fact, there is something I cannot understand: if the intergovernmental method failed in Nice and if the convention was successful in drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which the Council signed, why do we not take the good example of the convention to draft the reform of the Treaties?
In fact, I fail to understand why the national parliaments and the European Parliament cannot participate in this convention.
I cannot see what the Council is afraid of, because we are not seeking to replace governments, but to participate on an equal footing with governments in the debate and in making positive proposals for the future of the European Union.
Secondly, we want a wide-ranging debate, not one limited to the four issues listed in 'Declaration 23' .
The debate must, however, have a human face: we do not simply want a web site. We want committees, to add dynamism to the debate, and Minutes that show proposals which agree on the convention and we want the convention to produce a constitutional proposal that can form the basis of the future reform of the Treaties, which we want to be a convention.
Madam President, I shall conclude by offering my thanks: firstly to my colleague, IÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo, for his experience, his competence and also for the honesty and rigour with which he worked on this project. Next, I wish to thank all of my colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and its Chairman, Giorgio Napolitano for the exemplary way in which he led the committee' s work throughout.
I am also grateful for the way in which everyone contributed, even though at times extremely varying positions were held, to enabling us to reach a firm and strong position for the European Parliament, with practical proposals.
Lastly, I wish to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which made it possible for us to have the amendments and the proposals in all languages in good time.
Our aim, Madam President, is to do our bit to ensure that Parliament is contributing to a Europe that is closer to the citizens, a Europe that gives more backing to the Commission and Parliament and less to the Council, a Europe with institutions and bodies that concentrate more on looking after the welfare of all citizens living in this area and not on the national interests of Member States.
Reiterating my utmost respect, esteem and admiration for you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I feel sure that you will accept a memento of your attendance at this debate and I wish to say that the political significance of this event gives us great satisfaction. This is a small sticker, which says 'Yes to the convention!'
I hope that you might take this sticker with you when you present your proposals and when you vote on them with your colleagues and the other members of Union governments.
(The speaker approached the President-in-Office of the Council and gave her the aforementioned sticker)
Thank you, Mr Seguro.
The sticker matches the Mrs Lindh' s suit perfectly.
That is a good sign!
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I shall now give you the floor.
, Council.
(SV) Madam President, honourable Members, the future of Europe is now being forged as the European Union composes itself ahead of its enlargement.
We are concerned with the historical task of uniting Europe and welcoming the applicant states back into the European family.
In the western Balkans, the Union is doing everything to prevent new wars in Europe, a new Srebrenica or further ethnic cleansing.
So far, we have been able to help prevent full-scale conflicts in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in southern Serbia.
The EU' s future lies in coordinating foreign policy so that we can prevent armed conflicts.
The Union is also currently working on developing its cooperation with Africa.
An EU troika is visiting West Africa at this moment.
The responsibility and future of the EU also encompass a global responsibility.
Cooperation is now being deepened in a number of areas in Europe.
Europe must mean more than a market.
Full employment, equality and social and economic balance are aims for the EU of the future.
The Union' s ways of working are now being developed with the legislation on public access to documents and with the reform work within the institutions.
The future of the EU lies in an open and democratic union.
At the same time, we know that there is a lot left to do in respect of justice and free trade, the fight for human rights and work on environmental issues.
The debate on the future is about how we can succeed in these issues of the future and how we can create institutions that make us successful.
Through the Treaty of Nice we prepared the Union for new members joining and, at the same time, made clear our commitment to continued deeper cooperation.
We succeeded in moving from unanimity to majority decisions in respect of a further thirty-five or so provisions.
However, I myself - and many others like me - had hoped that we would have got further in respect of social matters and the third pillar.
We also succeeded in extending the codecision-making procedure to encompass new areas in which the European Parliament, together with the national governments, can ensure that the decision-making process is democratically rooted.
These were important decisions, and we succeeded in getting further than just the three matters that were selected in Amsterdam.
At the same time, most people are agreed - and I am convinced that we will have many examples here today - that the next Intergovernmental Conference needs to go significantly further than Nice and that we therefore need this broad debate on the future of Europe.
An important aim must be to make citizens more active participants in the European project.
The Swedish Presidency which, together with the coming Belgian Presidency, has been given the task of getting this debate going has taken it very seriously.
The common website that the Commission is running went live back in early March.
It already contains contributions from many heads of state and government and plenty of comments from European citizens.
The website will be expanded to encompass all eleven EU languages, and I hope that it will live on in the debate which will continue up to and in parallel with the Intergovernmental Conference.
The institutions are also planning a number of common seminars and conferences.
In addition, there are all the national initiatives that have been started, both in Member States and in applicant countries.
We are now turning for the first time directly to the citizens of Europe in our preparations for an Intergovernmental Conference.
Their hopes and expectations will undoubtedly extend further than the four institutional issues pointed out in Nice.
I think this is a good thing.
I believe that the debate on the future is primarily about policy, and secondarily about institutions.
Before we attempt to define our tools, we must know what the tools are to be used for.
At the same time, we must, of course, also conduct the arguments of principle concerning the nature and being of the Union.
That is why, as President-in-Office of the Council, I welcome the more long-term visions that we are now beginning to see in the debate.
It may be tempting to simplify the debate by looking too much at the terms themselves and too little at what the terms actually represent.
For example, we see many people wanting to draw a clear dividing line between the radical 'federalists' and those who have more modest ambitions in respect of the institutional issues.
However, each country has its own history and its own reference frameworks that help decide how the terms are viewed in that country.
The very term 'federalism' is interpreted positively and as decentralisation in some countries, whilst it can be like a red rag to a bull and seen as centralisation in other countries.
The same applies to the debate concerning a 'constitution' .
As quite a few people have said, the existing Treaties already form a kind of constitution.
They contain provisions concerning the tasks that we are to have, the distribution of responsibility between different institutions and the rules of procedure.
What is of interest is what the fundamental rules contain, not what we decide to call them.
Similarly, a contradiction is often painted between those who believe that democratic legitimacy emanates from representatives elected by the populace in their own country and those who believe that it must be sought in a new political model of European cooperation.
I believe that we must try to find different ways of strengthening the link between European policy and national policy.
Democracy is not a zero sum game.
I am convinced that we can do a lot to strengthen European democracy without rebuilding the Union from scratch.
When the interaction between the European and the national level develops, then democracy is the winner and the influence of citizens is strengthened.
We must get away from the artificial division between what is European and what is national.
Both national and European parliamentarians have a direct mandate from the people.
What is to prevent national parliamentarians appearing more regularly in the European Parliament and European parliamentarians more regularly in the national parliaments?
The requirements for grassroots support and the extensive agenda will make special demands of the preparations for the next Intergovernmental Conference, and many people have said that we must find a more open way than previously.
Some think that a small group of so-called wise men should table proposals.
Such a group can work quickly, but at the same time this would mean that not all the countries could be represented.
Many people, especially here in Parliament, have proposed that we should use an open forum similar to the convention that drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights last year.
However, quite a few countries have stressed that an open forum, a convention, must not restrict or forestall the debate with the citizens.
Once an open forum has completed its work, the result must be subject to debate and comments, and grassroots support must be sought for it.
If I may take a moment to speak as a Swedish President and Swedish Foreign Minister and not just as President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to say that I would wish us to be able to set up an open forum early in 2002.
Such a forum should be given around a year to complete its work and have the task of submitting recommendations for matters to be included on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference and also of putting forward various suggestions in respect of the responses to, and viewpoints on, these issues.
At the same time, it is important that the broad debate continues and that we also take on board what is happening in the national debates.
One way of ensuring this may be to summarise the national debates and to report to the European Council every six months.
It will also surely be necessary to have technical investigations carried out, since the matters addressed in Nice are fairly complicated.
In summary, I believe - based on the discussions I have had with Member States and applicant countries - that it will be difficult to find an individual form of preparation that is appropriate to all issues.
We need a combination.
I believe that we need a convention, that we need technical preparations and that we need to report the national debates.
The Swedish Presidency will continue the discussions with the European Parliament alongside the deliberations in the Council.
The resolution that you are adopting today - I would really like to thank Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro - will be a very important contribution to that debate.
This will naturally also form an important basis for the presidency when we present a report in Gothenburg.
These issues will be given a prominent place there and hopefully contribute new impulses to the continued discussion.
I now look forward to your viewpoints.
Madam President, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets is in a way summed up in paragraphs 2, 3 and 40 of the motion for a resolution; but you will understand that I will not give in to the temptation to end my argument here.
Please allow me therefore to illustrate and expand on it a little.
We totally agree with the phrase in paragraph 2, which says 'profoundly regrets the fact that the Treaty of Nice has only given a timid response' .
This is one of the great frustrations of the Committee on Budgets: that we have not been able, at this time, to deal with and resolve the budgetary issues before entering into the effective process of enlargement.
In paragraph 3 of the proposal of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs it says that the Conference makes 'the decision-making process within the Union more confused and less transparent' .
In this regard, and from the point of view of the budget, I will just say that if you look at the budgetary payments and compare them with the votes of the Member States in the Council, the voting procedure will perhaps not appear so confused.
Turning to certain budgetary aspects, we, as I said, expected more ambition from the Member States, we hoped that they would now deal frankly with the issue of the budgetary procedure and that they would even choose, if you like, a model such as that in the German constitution, which has a 'financial constitution' section, which provides for financial compensation (Finanzausgleich) between the Member States, the lander of the German Federation.
This was the right time to do it without waiting any longer.
There is still complete ambiguity with regard to the meaning of the Interinstitutional Agreement, to the point where there are 5 articles in the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline which provide for majorities not laid down in the Treaty.
This legal problem has not been resolved in Nice.
This frankly causes frustration in Parliament.
We would have liked to have seen the financial perspectives set and defined, knowing that it was going to be a particular advantage to the European Union but not to Parliament.
This time, the financial perspectives are mentioned in the Treaty but not defined, which means that we are not progressing much.
New activities and new spending are proposed, and it is presupposed that the European Parliament will agree, but the financial means for it are not provided for.
Because time is at a premium, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address the President-in-Office of the Council because I have pointed out our different cultures, policies and traditions, but there is one thing that unites us all: Parliaments were born in Europe to represent the citizens by controlling public spending and approving the spending of the sovereign.
The budget is at the centre of representative democracy and if we want a representative democracy in Europe we must make much more progress on the budgetary procedure.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the field of foreign and security policy shows in exemplary manner the shortcomings of the results of Nice and of the Treaty as a whole.
The European Union is strong wherever the Monnet method is used.
The European Union is weak wherever the intergovernmental method is used.
We see it in the area of foreign and security policy with the twin structures that hamper our freedom of action.
We also see it, for example, in the fact that closer cooperation is used everywhere where it is not necessarily needed; but where it is needed most urgently - in defence - it is not used.
We need to remind ourselves why the Nice Conference took place.
It was meant to strengthen the European Union' s ability to act for enlargement and at the same time to reduce the democratic deficit.
In neither area were the desired results achieved, and as far as the decision-making structures are concerned, they were actually made worse.
We therefore have to recognise that the present method is no longer working.
I have twice had the honour of representing Parliament - in Amsterdam and in Nice - and I know that this method of preparing for the Intergovernmental Conference does not bring us the necessary progress.
Only the convention can do that, with the national parliaments and the European Parliament, too, suitably involved alongside the Commission and the governments.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the open forum is no alternative to the convention.
It may be helpful in making preparations, but the convention - consisting of parliamentarians - can channel that open forum, the public debate, so as to present to you as heads of state and government an outcome that will form the basis for your negotiations.
It therefore builds on the public process, but it is not an alternative to the public process.
We have to see to it that the citizens of this Europe enjoy their rights.
That is why the Charter must be made binding.
We must therefore ensure that where this European Union has powers it is able to take decisions, so that its decision-making ability gains it acceptance.
We must make this European Union democratic.
There must therefore be codecision in all matters of legislation, including agricultural policy.
We must make it transparent so that citizens know who is responsible for a bad decision.
That is why the Council as legislator must meet openly.
These are the decisive measures that we must get accepted at this Intergovernmental Conference!
At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the national parliaments.
It is not enough, as Mr Jospin has suggested, to bring a Chinese People' s Congress to Europe for major debates once a year.
No, we must strengthen the national parliaments at home so that they can control their national governments as members of the Council!
That must be the starting point!
(Applause)
We are now in a situation where the next two and a half years will shape the face and the size of Europe.
We shall shape its face by conducting this constitutional debate in a reasonable manner and bringing it to a conclusion and by bringing about enlargement - both things together.
I hope we shall have the strength and not the vanity of many governments who think their job is to sit around where they are and stand in the way of progress!
That is why we should give the convention a chance, so that Europe' s elected representatives, the European Parliament and the national parliaments can play a part in shaping that face!
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just one point will suffice to make clear to you my committee' s disappointment.
I represent fisheries policy.
This is one of the few European policies, however, that lie in the sole competence of the Community.
As a result, all the legislation coming out of Brussels in this sector affects the Union' s citizens directly.
The democratic deficit of which we rightly complain is all the more obvious to all concerned.
We, Parliament, the only institution legitimised by popular vote, continue to be denied any real involvement in making those laws.
I am referring to the codecision procedure, which, despite our demands, has still not been opened up for fisheries policy.
The future of Europe' s fisheries from 2003 is being rewritten at this very moment.
I therefore particularly want to reiterate, indeed to emphasise, our pre-Nice position today in the post-Nice era.
A mere consultation of Parliament is not enough.
We want to be really involved in defining the most important themes.
We therefore emphatically call for the codecision rules to be taken into Articles 32 to 38 of the EC Treaty and ask for your support!
I find there continues to be a further deficit in Parliament' s involvement in fisheries matters when it comes to concluding international agreements.
We demand that the European Parliament' s assent be made mandatory for international agreements negotiated by the Commission, which do after all have an impact on the budget.
Finally, we want our own title in the EC Treaty, all that, dear Elmar, in addition to agricultural policy.
It is only logical.
Only then will we be able to keep up with all the rules and regulations of that now highly developed European policy!
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs regrets that the Treaty of Nice made far fewer specific changes in the area of employment and social policy than those that it had sought.
It hopes that these issues will be addressed by the second report from the Constitutional Affairs Committee and by the next IGC.
On the broader institutional issues, presently under discussion, we welcome the report's call for a convention to prepare for the next IGC and for a debate involving the active participation of the European citizenry as a whole.
We would ask that the convention engage closely in the course of its discussions with the social partners and with civil society.
In particular, we would seek consultation, both within the Member States and with the applicant countries on the issue of the provision of a legal base for the involvement of civil society in the decision-making processes of the European Union.
We would also like to see Member States being encouraged to establish fora where citizens can interact with their own Parliament's on the future of Europe.
We believe too that up to and beyond the next IGC, there would be merit in joint annual meetings of delegations of committees on employment and social affairs from the European Parliament, from within Member States and the applicant countries and from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
We hope that a means will be found for supporting such meetings.
Finally, we trust that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be incorporated in the Treaties in a legally binding manner and we look forward in future to wide and active participation in the discussion on the future of the Union.
Mr President, I believe that the motion for a resolution on which we are going to vote on the future of the European Union and the assessment of Nice is a positive and balanced text which maintains the European Parliament' s important role in the construction of Europe.
It therefore deserves full support in this House, I hope by a majority.
As Chairman of the Industry Committee, I have presented an opinion which I would sum up by means of four points.
The first refers to paragraph 3 of Article 157 on support measures for industry.
The second is the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in 2002.
The third relates to Article 181 A on relations with third countries, above all in the field of financial and technical cooperation.
Finally, the fourth aspect relates to the unsatisfactory amendments of Article 133 on the common trade policy.
All of them have the same defect, and that is that they do not resolve the clear democratic deficit which exists in these areas, where the role of the European Parliament, in some cases, is completely absent and, in others, is restricted to a mere consultation when it should have gone further.
I trust that this opinion which is appended to the motion for a resolution will soon be included in a new European Parliament document, and I also trust that these issues will be included in the agenda for the coming convention which will lead to an Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to say on behalf of the Socialist Group that we support, and are going to vote in favour of, the report jointly produced by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, which has been produced seriously and elegantly and in a spirit of not only Iberian but also European cooperation.
I believe that that spirit of cooperation could be extended to other fields because I notice that, in this post-Nice debate which we have started, the illustrious leaders of the PPE-DE are criticising the proposals made by the leaders of my political family: Mr Jospin (Prime Minister of France) and Mr SchrÃ¶der.
I only have one thing to say: we impatiently await the contributions of Mr Aznar and Mr Berlusconi.
We all remember (protests and applause) the contributions of Mr Berlusconi in this House in favour of Europe.
Having said this, Mr President, I am not going to enter into a critical analysis of the Treaty, which has been the job of our two colleagues.
I would like to address the President-in-Office of the Council because she has said some important things.
Firstly, she has said that she has launched a virtual forum.
This forum is already on the Internet; it is a forum and I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council that the European Parliament has finally entered the forum, in the latest edition.
We could also seek formulae so that we can connect to our own debates.
The forum now exists.
It is a tribute to the Swedish Presidency that this forum is open and democratic in the best Swedish tradition.
She has indicated that it might be appropriate to create a committee of wise men.
I am in favour of the idea that experienced political leaders should not go on the dole.
We could look for some political leaders to advise us.
However, in any event, no forum can replace the convention, because - and I would like to remind you that it is an invention of the Council, not Parliament, at Cologne - it is a method by which we do not make recommendations but rather we debate the issues and make proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference.
In this respect, I believe that we have to be clear: it is not only a request of the European Parliament at this point.
If am not mistaken, after a lively debate in Stockholm, the COSAC last week expressed its support for the convention.
This clearly means that the representatives of the European people, elected on both European and national levels, agree that this convention should exist, in order to produce something which we consider to be essential, Mr President - and with this I will end - that is, an open, public and transparent debate, which will allow us to create treaties which are constitutional and, above all, comprehensible to our co-citizens.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, my group shall support the work of the rapporteurs and I congratulate them on its elegant balance.
It is entirely appropriate at this stage that the European Parliament does not express a definitive view on the qualities of the Treaty of Nice, because we recognise - as the Treaty itself does - that more needs to be done.
We want to be active persuaders and influencers in doing more, hence our commitment to the convention idea.
I am very pleased to hear the President-in-Office's positive remarks in that regard.
You have talked also about factoring in both the national dimension and the wider public debate.
I hope I am not listening to the creation of a convention, which will be a sort of pub with no beer.
We would actually like to see these things incorporated in a way that it would be vigorous and representative of a wider opinion.
In my country, the Republic of Ireland, in eight days time, there is a referendum on the Treaty of Nice, unique among the 15 Member States.
In the run-up there has been a very active anti-campaign on three broad themes: Anti to say that it is not necessary to say "yes" to Nice for enlargement; anti to say that the reforms with regard to qualified majority and the role of smaller states go too far; and anti regarding the so-called militarisation of the EU.
Normally I do not engage in national politics, but today it is for a European reason that I want to state clearly for the record of the House that to vote "yes" to Nice in Ireland is to vote to remove the last formal obstacle to a significant enlargement.
In good conscience, I ask people to vote yes and I myself, in good conscience, shall vote yes.
It is a "yes" to make sure that we meet the political conditions agreed in Helsinki that we in the EU should be ready, no later than the end of 2002, for this historic journey towards enlargement.
A "yes" vote is a vote to reunite Europe.
I urge my fellow citizens in Ireland to take that into account.
There are plenty of criticisms to make of Nice with regard to qualified majority and the role of smaller states, but for people who are fair-minded and rational, none of the criticisms should be that it went too far.
The problem with Nice is how much more was left to be done.
Anyone who argues the opposite is playing to the gallery of populism, rather than dealing with substance and fact.
Finally, on the argument about militarisation: as a Irishman it makes me sick in the pit of my stomach to listen to lectures from Mr Adams and other people in Sinn FÃ©in who today still maintain an armed ceasefire in Northern Ireland, who refuse to decommission weapons, and who, prior to their entry into a peace process, sullied the name of Irishmen through a campaign of murder and terror for three decades.
It is a travesty for these people to describe the one great peace movement of Europe, which is the European integration process, as heading towards militarisation.
These people are themselves still incomplete democrats.
We should not accept lectures from them on this topic.
General Morillon, here this afternoon, served at Srebrenica and other places with dignity, despite having a very difficult and effectively impossible UN mandate.
We know that NATO and the US would not act and did not act.
We, the EU, could not act.
If not NATO there was nothing.
We have a moral and ethical duty to ensure we are prepared for such missions in future with the likes of the Rapid Reaction Force.
This represents responsibility and maturity in Europe, not militarisation.
Again people in Ireland should not listen to those who preach about militarism, for this is a false premise.
I have been very generous with time for the three political group leaders.
I will not be so tolerant from now on, but I am sure you had a lot of support in the House, Pat Cox.
Mr President, what kind of generosity would it be that confined itself to the large groups?
It would be a power-based generosity that I would not like to think you capable of!
Ladies and gentlemen, if we are to resolve the crisis of European integration it is time to speak openly.
We are witnessing and involved in a struggle for power in Europe.
It is not a matter of federal state versus confederation or about a superstate versus subsidiarity.
It is about democracy versus the national executives' desire for power, versus a Europe of clandestine cooperation between governments and de facto legislation by governments.
It is about transforming the European project from a thing of administrative elites into a res publica.
The Intergovernmental Conference in Nice was a failure.
The EU has become neither more democratic nor more capable of action nor ready for enlargement.
The Intergovernmental Conference has proved to be an unsuitable instrument.
The heads of state and government are making Europe into a bazaar of national interests.
At half past three in the morning between their calvados and the fireplace they exchange fish quotas for basic rights, agreement on enlargement for farm subsidies.
After Nice they called for a celebration not for what they had done for Europe but for what they had deprived Europe of.
Instead of doing their duty under the Treaty of moving Europe forward, they turned out to be advocates of national identity while expressing surprise about the likes of Haider and Berlusconi.
The same people who failed in Nice now want to be not only government and legislator and lords of the Treaties, but also the creators of Europe' s constitution!
Honourable Members, it is time for Europe' s parliaments to remember why they are really there, that it is for them and them alone to create a constitution.
It is time to show Europe' s princes that there is another Europe, a European democracy and a Europe that is a social area.
It is the hour of the parliaments. It is the duty of the parliaments and I am glad that this Parliament is forging an alliance of parliaments for a European democracy!
Ladies and gentlemen, I am terribly bored with the debate about a federal state or a confederation!
We can confidently leave that to the next generation, but not the question of European democracy.
That is the challenge if we are one day to be able to say: Vive la RÃ©publique d'Europe! Long live the European Republic!
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner Barnier, many MEPs in this House are critical of the Treaty of Nice.
I and my group, too, are deeply worried about the future of the European Union, because many of the questions affecting people' s everyday concerns and needs have still not been resolved or are addressed only half-heartedly.
Nice has weakened the Community.
Nice was a step backwards in terms of integration.
There is no trace of a strengthened democracy, more transparency, more freedom of action and ability to take decisions!
As the report says, the Treaty has rightly removed the obstacles to enlargement in the most formal way possible.
From this point of view, I should like to thank my two colleagues, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, for their commitment to their work as rapporteurs because their report reflects the predominantly critical view of the Treaty taken by this House.
The Nice Council revealed that the governments are in the end fighting only to preserve their national rights of veto.
The Union itself is facing the greatest challenge in its history, but instead of energetically tackling the pressing problems, the governments dissipated their energies behind closed doors.
In my opinion, the time after Nice must therefore be used to rescue the Union from Nice.
I want to take up a few points here that I consider important.
It is absolutely essential that the number of seats for the Czech Republic and Hungary in the European Parliament is corrected immediately.
There can be no discrimination against these two countries in their parliamentary representation in this House.
Post-Nice must tackle an ambitious, really far-reaching reform, a reform that must achieve two things.
Firstly, the progress made towards integration must not be reversed, and I should like at this point emphatically to stress that I do not share the German federal government' s position on the renationalisation of agricultural policy and of the Structural Funds in particular because it amounts to calling into question one of the Union' s central pillars, the principle of economic and social cohesion and solidarity between Member States.
Secondly, we need a reform that will actually make the Union viable for the future.
A constitutional process must therefore be initiated the outcome of which will be the formation of a united Europe by the will of its citizens.
This naturally involves a Europe-wide, broad and open public debate, that is essential, but I should also like to stress that Nice has shown that the Intergovernmental Conference method is out of date.
It is no longer the appropriate way of carrying Europe substantially forwards.
We need a method, the convention method that many here have already mentioned.
Important and essential as decisions about the future institutional structure of Europe are, we must not forget to question the contents of European policy.
Europe' s future cannot remain confined to the market and common currency.
I welcome the fact that French Prime Minister Jospin put the objectives of Union policy at the centre of his latest speech and did not, like Germany' s Chancellor SchrÃ¶der and Foreign Minister Fischer, largely confine himself to questions of EU institutional reform.
The debate over the content of European Union policy is in fact at present more urgent than the discussion about its final institutional shape and I welcome the fact, Madam President-in-Office, that you also raised the matter today.
Justice, solidarity and social policy must be central values and tasks of the Community.
Jospin' s proposals for a closer coordination of economic policies and the formation of an EU economic government as well as for setting up an EU economic fund to assist EU Member States in times of crisis are therefore extremely topical.
Social dumping must no longer be commonplace in the European Union, harmonisation of corporate taxation is in fact urgent.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commission, the European Union leaders when they met in Nice last December to review existing treaties had one single objective in mind: they sought to change the internal decision-making procedures within the institutions of the Union to guarantee that enlargement of the European Union could take place.
I believe the Treaty of Nice is a balanced agreement which guarantees the go-ahead to the enlargement process whilst at the same time protecting and promoting the entries of the smaller Member States.
The Treaty of Nice does not build a two-tier European Union whereby larger Member States can dictate the pace of change within the Union at the expense of the smaller states.
There will not be a fundamental shift in the balance of power within the Union as a result of the enactment of the provisions of the Treaty.
The European Union will remain a Union of peoples and states.
All Member States within the Union will retain the right to appoint one member to the Commission until 27 countries become full members of the Union, and even at that stage, positions in the Commission will be distributed between all Members on a rotation basis.
Decisions concerning key national entries will remain the exclusive domain of individual Member State governments, and any changes concerning taxation policies or social security matters will be left to individual countries to decide on.
The unanimity requirement for tax changes remains the order of the day within the Union.
This is very important, because I believe that issues of taxation should be addressed by national parliaments and not decided centrally by the European Union.
Enlargement of the Union will promote and consolidate democratic structures in Eastern and Central Europe.
It will help to strengthen new free-market economies of these countries, and it will contribute to making these countries more competitive.
The enlargement process provides the basis for a truly historic reconciliation on a continent which has been divided over the past century by wars and ideologies.
It is incumbent on all of us to grasp the opportunities which are before us to help build a more stable European continent at peace with itself.
We are all aware in this House that a constitutional referendum on the Treaty of Nice is being held in Ireland next week.
The Treaty is certainly a good deal for countries of Central and Eastern Europe, but equally for existing Member States of the Union.
There is no doubt that the operation of the internal market has been a success, particularly over the last ten years, and from an Irish perspective economic success in our country could simply not have been achieved if we were not a Member of the Union.
Mr President, what the Treaty of Nice essentially boils down to is more Union and less democracy.
The Treaty of Nice increases the distance between the EU Ã©lites and the people of the EU countries, who are being taken hostage as part of what might be described, at its mildest, as a warped understanding of democracy which also finds expression in this Assembly.
What really was the background to the Treaty of Nice?
All right, it had to do with the enlargement and integration of the European continent.
There are only two remarks to be made about this.
Firstly, that what is necessary for securing enlargement is not to be found in the Treaty and that what is to be found in the Treaty is unnecessary for the sake of enlargement.
The crucial element of this Treaty and of the refrain that forms the basis of this report is to be found in the ambition expressed in recital F and in what follows on from this.
It is a question of developing the EU' s institutions and, in particular of course, this Parliament as a surrogate for the national democracies.
The majority of our group can essentially concur with the minority opinion, expressed by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, to the effect that what we have here is a warped view of democracy.
We can see this in the curious provision whereby the EU Ã©lites are to supervise the democracies.
What kind of talk is that?
Is it not the people who supervise their democracies?
No, it has to be the EU Ã©lites.
We can see this in the curious proposal tabled in the last part-session, a foretaste of the new Article 191, 'European political parties' . These are to be financed by the European Union because they cannot acquire money in any other way, partly because they do not have any members.
What kind of view of democracy is that?
Finally: are the various populations being asked about this Treaty?
The Danish people are not being asked.
The only people who are being asked are the Irish people, and I sincerely hope that, on behalf of all the populations of Europe, the Irish people will tell these Ã©lites that their conception of democracy is a misunderstanding and then vote against the Treaty on 7 June.
Mr President, with all due respect, because this debate is about institutions and democracy, if you are going to be strict, you should be strict with all the groups.
If you are going to be tolerant, you should be tolerant with all the groups, at least in the first round.
I think that then we would all stand to benefit.
Mr Alavanos, I will try and keep the time because if Parliament gets behind schedule, it is extremely complicated for some of the people who come later in the debate, not just the ones who are at the front.
As far as your group' s spokesman was concerned, I have to tell you she had exactly the same amount of time as Hans-Gert Poettering for instance, and Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
Mr Cox went over a little bit but he was giving one of the most impassioned speeches that have been made in this Parliament for a long time and I think the House was enjoying listening to it.
Mr President, we have had an almost permanent Intergovernmental Conference for 10 years, we have had endless debates on the nature of the European Union and even on its raison d'Ãªtre. The European Union increasingly resembles one of these useless machines seen in contemporary art, where the only important thing is the complexity of its workings.
The whole thing has spiralled so far out of control - I actually heard the word 'extravagant' being used earlier - that some of the social democrats are beginning to openly call for a new type of nationalism, but, this time, one with a European edge, whereas even they are proving to be unable to shoulder their rightful responsibilities on behalf of their own countries.
Since the Treaty of Nice was a failure, let us move swiftly on to a fifth European Treaty, which will surely be better than the previous ones with their countless directives and regulations.
Of course, however, European integration is something that is so distinctive, paradoxical and uncertain that it is untouchable.
The gestures made by the institutions favouring a 'federation of nation States' or a 'United Europe of Nations' , as in the slogan used during a certain election campaign, cannot hide the reality that today' s Europe is merely a trading post that has one or two environmental concerns and is dominated by media finance.
Everyone is well aware that the common agricultural policy is on its last legs.
Guaranteed prices have been widely replaced by grants and a policy of high productivity has driven most farmers from their land.
In this respect, the recent proposal by Chancellor SchrÃ¶der, to exchange maintaining the common agricultural policy in return for a step towards European federalism, should remain unanswered, as, in actual fact, in order to save the last farmers, we must move towards phasing out the common agricultural policy.
With regard to the Structural Funds, the grants of which gave rise to countless cases of irregularities, it is utterly unrealistic to claim that it will be possible to maintain the Fund beyond 2006.
Let us keep the money that is still available for the candidate countries, in the shape of an increased Cohesion Fund, in the hope, of course, that these countries do not become disillusioned too quickly about the actual advantages that they will gain from European utopia.
We oppose any form of European nationalism.
Mr President, I should also like to applaud the rapporteurs in particular because they did not give way to the temptation, perhaps even the pressure from a largish number of parliamentarians, to demonise the outcome of Nice as a knee-jerk reaction, but rather endeavoured to make an objective critique.
Almost everything has already been said about Nice.
I should like, however, to take up one thing that Mr Poettering touched upon but did not really emphasise.
I consider the call for the Intergovernmental Conference proposed in Nice for 2004 to be brought forward to 2003 to be mistaken.
The arguments put forward for that are not convincing.
For one thing we also have important elections in Europe in 2003.
Secondly - and there is extensive agreement about this despite differing ideas about the run-up to it - the next Intergovernmental Conference is to be of short duration.
It can therefore easily be accommodated after the elections to the European Parliament.
Above all, however, the best way to meet the desire for a broadly-based discussion about the future of the Union would be to make it a subject of the election campaign.
Bringing the meeting forward looks like evading the electorate and the electorate will see it that way.
Be warned!
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the honourable Members Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro and point out that the Spanish contribution to the future of Europe is, first and foremost, the result of dialogue and proper political compromise.
It is true that the Nice Summit and the Treaty of Nice contain numerous contradictions and a great many lacunae, especially as regards the role of the European Parliament within both the future of Europe and the institutional framework on the basis of which Europe is to move forward from now on.
However, the questions which we need to address from now on, as Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro have clearly stressed in their report, are important questions such as the separation of powers, the role of the European parliaments, the constitutionalisation of the Treaties and the future of the common foreign policy; questions which we shall be addressing between now and the Summit in Laeken and beyond, questions which will link future summits with the outcome of Nice.
I listened very closely to the President-in-Office and I have to say that I am not bothered about fora or websites one way or the other.
They are all extremely useful.
What I am bothered about, however, is the fact that we have not yet said 'yes' to the need for a convention at which all the political forces in Europe can express their official, coordinated views and can conduct an official, coordinated dialogue on its future.
Mr President, I hope Parliament will pass this resolution by a large majority. It is the fruit of long, thorough discussion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, with Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro making decisive contributions.
It is a resolution which combines effectively severe criticism of the Treaty of Nice and serious concern about the risks arising from its immediate application at this new stage of European integration which is now in progress.
The resolution contains precise guidelines for preparing adequate responses to the fundamental questions on the future of the Union in constitutional terms.
We set great store - I want to stress this point particularly - by the role of the national parliaments and our cooperation with them in every possible way.
We do not pretend to give instructions to the national parliaments on what they should do as regards ratification of the Treaty of Nice.
What we do hope for is convergence on the proposal for a convention.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the convention is not meant to be a mere discussion forum producing, at best, polite recommendations, but a working body that can draw up documents to be submitted, eventually, to the Intergovernmental Conference.
When we talk about a convention, we are not claiming a role for the European Parliament alone, but a shared role for all the parliaments, all the institutions directly representing the citizens at national level and Union level, which is the only way to guarantee openness, transparency and democracy - as you have said, Mrs Lindh - in the preparation of the future conference.
None of the governments, whatever their political persuasion, are hesitating over the choice of a convention.
Ultimately, they should also be concerned about not finding themselves back in a cul-de-sac, back in the cage, back in the nightmare of that last night at Nice!
My group is determined that the specific legitimacy of the European Parliament to play a part in the constitutional development of the Union should be recognised inside the convention.
Parliament will bring wisdom and commitment to the process and focus upon common European solutions.
However, we also require the Member States to play a full part inside the convention and there are currently certain signals that some prime ministers are preparing to concede us the convention but then to withdraw their own representatives from it.
This would subvert the convention and it would be an insult to this Parliament.
It would also ruin the pretence that the European Council respected the role of national parliaments.
For the governments to absent themselves would leave us with a grandiose talking shop, it would be insufferable for this Parliament to be fobbed off in this way.
I would request the Commission and Council to pledge that the convention will have four parties inside it, and that the IGC will use the work of the convention as the basis for the IGC.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, it is a great pleasure at this time - when in the United Kingdom I fear a rather negative tone has been taken about Europe - to be able to say how much one welcomes this development of a constitutionalisation of Europe in circumstances of enlarged and expanding democracy bringing the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in.
As the President-in-Office has said, it is an odd view that the European Union does not already have a constitution.
Of course it does.
It has an implicit and not very intelligible one, and the task is to make it explicit and intelligible and properly adopted.
That does not necessarily imply a full-scale federation along the lines of Mr Schroeder.
Those of us who believe in a confederal Europe believe just as much that it must be marked by respect for human rights, by clarity of democratic principle and by interaction of pluralistic constitutions, rather than a strictly hierarchical model.
Too often in this House we hear the term "nation" used as though it were purely co-extensive with the term "Member State" .
It is a well-known fact, to those who reflect upon it, that there are more nations in Europe than there are states.
One of the interesting features of our time has been, partly under the guidance of the growth of democracy in Europe, the re-emergence of internal democracies in small ancient nations of Europe like Catalonia, the Basque country, Scotland, Galicia and Flanders.
We in the European Free Alliance hope that the process which we start today will be marked by a respect for subsidiarity in a generous and extensive sense: Amendments No 5 and 18 from the Liberals and Amendment 28 from my own group are for us keystones of this process.
Surely indeed, this Union must recognise subsidiarity in a generous and broad sense, it must acknowledge the political and national diversity of the European Union and the debate on the future must take full account of the powers of the internal political units of the Member States, not only of the Member States themselves.
In this election in Scotland, there is a debate going about whether there should be full fiscal autonomy for the Scottish parliament: autonomy is growing in all these small countries and it is vital that it be recognised.
I was delighted that the recent statement by the Commission on tax harmonisation made it perfectly clear that there can be wide subsidiarity in these matters.
Mr MacCormick, I am sorry I did not recognise that yesterday was one your special birthdays.
Congratulations.
Mr President, the Treaty of Nice tends to be marketed as an enlargement treaty.
I do not believe that this is correct.
This is because the institutional issues involved in the enlargement are not resolved by the Treaty of Nice.
Moreover, most of what was decided in Nice has nothing to do with enlargement.
As pointed out in the report, the seats in the European Parliament must be redistributed since there is direct discrimination against Hungary and the Czech Republic.
This can be changed in the accession Treaties, just as these matters can be regulated in general in the accession Treaties as they were, for example, in the cases of Sweden, Austria and Finland when we joined the European Union.
The Treaty of Nice is actually in the main about something else. It is about the power of the large EU countries being strengthened at the expense of the small countries.
All the candidate countries except Poland are therefore also losers, because they will be small countries in the European Union.
The decision-making process in the Council of Ministers will become more complicated, not simpler.
The second main feature of the Treaty of Nice is the increasing move towards a superstate and the disappearance of the right of veto in more areas.
There are also some clearly federalist elements, for example, as regards the support of European political parties and a new process for appointing the European Commission, which will mean that the Commission will increasingly resemble a government with a prime minister.
The real significance of the Treaty of Nice is thus that an enlarged Union will be dominated by the same large countries as dominate today' s European Union and that the march towards the formation of a federal state in the EU is continuing, even if this development is not progressing as quickly as some in this assembly would like.
It is therefore not difficult for my party and for me to vote against both the Treaty of Nice and the report that we are to vote on tomorrow.
However, it is important to point out that the report does contain some positive elements.
It calls for open meetings of the Council of Ministers.
It would have been reasonable for such a decision to have been taken in Nice, that is, to open up the legislative assembly to inspection.
Moreover, it calls for a redistribution of seats in the European Parliament, which is an essential democratic requirement.
However, we do not believe in the convention method.
We cannot really see the point of having a convention in order to draw up the next treaty amendment.
However, if in the end we are to have a convention then we believe that it must be a convention for those who decide on the treaty, namely the national parliaments.
We hope that the Swedish Presidency and the Swedish government will not move an inch from the idea that it is the national parliaments that must have decision-making rights over the treaties and that it is they who must control developments when the treaties are produced.
So what should have been done in Nice instead?
Well, we would have liked to have seen a democratisation of the EU, a reduction in the power of civil servants and the Commission, an increase in the power of the national parliaments, increased openness and inspection in the Council of Ministers, a change in the dominance of the free market over environmental aspects and social aspects and a re-examination of the dogmatic monetarism which forms the basis of monetary union.
Now we are instead seeing the social democrat governments starting to fall around the EU.
There has been no actual change in the foundation of the EU during the time that we have had a 'red-green' dominance in the EU.
The opportunity is about to be lost and the EU' s basis has not changed in either a 'red' or a 'green' direction, which we find regrettable.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to make nine brief points.
This report does not concern the Treaty of Nice; it is about the post-Nice process, the start of the political circus at the Laeken Summit, which will be held at the end of the year.
Nice is no longer an issue - it has galloped off into the sunset.
The so-called crisis facing the European Union is a result of this federalist obsession.
We could concentrate on reforming the institutions so that they function more effectively.
We could begin here in Parliament, where democratic representation is so lacking in authenticity and so mediocre.
But no!
Instead, you want to reform everything else.
You spend all your time discussing changing the balance between the institutions and this is the source of the fight for power that you are so ready to criticise; the struggle between the Member States and the struggle between the institutions.
This has opened up the fight for power.
The federalists like invoking the founding fathers, but they would do better to read what they said.
In his famous speech of 9 May 1950, Robert Schuman, said: "Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity" .
This should suffice for us to disregard this report, which is full of attacks and plans, completely ignoring the practical actions that have been taken to achieve a lasting, de facto solidarity.
Where is the real cohesion?
By the same token, I must thank Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for having debunked one of the myths of federalism once and for all, which is the erroneous idea that it serves the smallest and the weakest States.
This is a proposal to centralise power, to wipe out Member States, and to destroy social and economic cohesion.
Exactly the opposite.
We do not want to see a United States of Europe, but a Community.
We do not want a federation of nation states, but a Union made up of the nation states that we are.
Nothing more and nothing less.
Who is abandoning ship here?
Who is actually destroying the Europe that has been successfully achieved?
Drafting a European constitution is another perverse fantasy.
If there is no single European people, there can be no legitimate constituent European power.
If there is no constituent European power, there can be no European constitution.
Treaties can only be reformed by Treaties.
There is an Arabic proverb that says, 'words are man' s invention for concealing his thoughts' ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, slightly less of Brussels, which I welcome, and slightly more of Germany - this is how, in my mind, we can sum up the disastrous Treaty of Nice that we are being asked to adopt.
To think that two French people joined forces to undermine the European edifice, the cornerstone of which, for fifty years, has been parity between France and Germany. Everything tells us to respect this parity - geography and history, the head as well as the heart.
Unfortunately since Nice, the Franco-German twosome looks like one of the couples made popular by the French artist Albert Dubout, and we now know who is wearing the trousers.
This is primarily why, whether or not you are in favour of European integration as has been pursued for fifty years, no French citizen should ratify the Treaty which spells disaster for the interests of France as well as for the future of the European Union itself.
I believe, if I may say so, that no one in Germany should vote for this Treaty either, since it seems obvious that the unexpected advantage gained at Nice by Germany is only due to the desire of our two national politicians, who behave much like Edouard Daladier, to come to an agreement, come what may.
Mr President, this Treaty is not only worthless, which is what we are hearing from the whole of this House, but it is also dangerous, and Parliament would do itself credit if everyone of every political hue sent back their copy to those who, at Nice, made such a poor prediction about the future of Europe.
Mr President, we shall not be voting in support of the report by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, which is, of course, far too indulgent towards the Treaty of Nice.
In the very first Article, the report claims to believe that this text could remove the final obstacle to enlargement.
That is not our view.
This Treaty will not facilitate enlargement - on the contrary, it will complicate the issue.
The protocol, which is supposed to prepare the institutions for this important deadline, is not at all convincing.
The reform of the Commission will only take place after enlargement, and even then its content is extremely vague.
The only clear issue, which is putting an end to the second Member of the Commission for the larger States, seems to hold little interest for us.
As for the redistribution of seats in the European Parliament and re-weighting of votes in the Council, this makes the Community veer from an approach centred on States towards an approach centred on populations, which might help to lay the foundations of a superstate, but does nothing to help enlargement.
In actual fact, the pursuit of a superstate justifies almost all the provisions of the Treaty of Nice, which are devoted to strengthening the institutions and the supranational procedures by extending majority voting to the crucial issues of sovereignty.
One of these, which is the appointment of the Commission by qualified majority voting, would eventually transform the college into a government of Europe and would thus cause a radical upheaval of the philosophy of the European institutions that we know.
The move towards the superstate relies on the belief, which the federalists hold dear, that we must react to the growing diversity within Europe by stepping up centralisation.
In our view, this belief will make enlargement more difficult and, at the same time, it will increase the democratic deficit within today' s European Union.
In order to explain this position, the Movement for France delegation to the European Parliament has just published a counter-report to the Treaty of Nice which, Mr President, I shall send to you and which is, sadly, our preference over the report by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro.
Mr President, Nice was simply not a successful Summit.
Very rarely has a European Summit taken place which has had such ill after-effects, as is mostly the case in very problematic births.
Presidents, a Chancellor, Prime Ministers and Foreign Affairs Ministers are falling over each other with articles in prominent newspapers, with speeches for prestigious institutes and statements on what Nice should have been like and what should be Europe' s future.
It would have been much better if that work had been delivered before and not after Nice.
Maybe we would not be facing this debacle now.
A great deal went wrong at Nice, but the most serious mistakes have been the complicated decision-making processes that have been created, which are even more complex and opaque than before, and the fact that on a number of scores, a qualified majority vote was taken without approval from the European Parliament.
If this were to happen in a developing country, we would say, it was high time a good governance programme were drafted.
It is therefore best not to look back any more, but to look to the future instead and to improve on Nice.
In this connection, I welcome Chancellor SchrÃ¶der' s initiative to adopt the PPE-DE ideas of the 70s and 80s and to give them a new lease of life.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo wondered what had happened to the proposals by the PPE-DE Presidents and Prime Ministers: reinforcement of the European Commission, a European Parliament with proper powers, and a Council which has to hold public meetings in the form of a Senate or a Bundesrat.
Our PPE-DE - both group and party - have stood for those ideas since the 70s and 80s.
The question is now how to ensure that these proposals actually take shape.
We are no great fans of wise men - we have had 20 such committees since 1979 - or of a forum which can be convened at any time.
Quite simply, a convention should be set up of national parliaments and the European Parliament. When national ministers meet in the European Summit, they would then at least be covered by national parliaments.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, it would be better if you were to adopt this idea.
I wish you good luck in Gothenburg, and I hope that a convention will ensue.
That appears to be the best solution to me.
Mr President, when the rapporteur started work on this report, there was a real danger that this Parliament would end up rejecting the Treaty of Nice through an unholy alliance of those who felt it went too far and those who felt it did not go far enough, so it is a tribute to their work that they have steered Parliament to a very sensible analysis of the Treaty and a strategy for moving forward from here.
Some indeed, as we heard just now in the debate, still seem to have the fanciful idea that this Treaty is setting up a centralised superstate: I find it astonishing that they can read the Treaty of Nice and genuinely believe that.
Also outside this House, the British Conservative Party is campaigning in the UK election saying it would not ratify the Treaty of Nice if it were to come to power.
This is not the case with their Members here, or at least not all of their Members here - I noticed that the two British Conservative Members in the committee voted for the MÃ©ndez de Vigo/Seguro report and I pay tribute to them for having done so.
Conservatives back home, however, are coming up with this idea that this Treaty sets up a superstate.
That really is nonsense and it does not seem to be doing them much good in the opinion polls.
The public can see through this particular fanciful idea.
If you were to look behind you, you would see in the bouquet of flags that the Irish Flag has been placed where the European Flag usually is, in the middle of the bouquet, presumably because Ireland is the only Member State holding a referendum on the Treaty of Nice.
Why is only Ireland holding a referendum?
Why not Denmark and others?
Precisely because in this Treaty of Nice there is no further transfer of competence to the European Union.
It is not a centralising treaty and the critics, of course, know that.
Others have been disappointed with the Treaty of Nice, because it did not go far enough and because of some of the questionable compromises it contains, such as the voting system in the Council and the extra seats in the European Parliament.
As work went on in our committee, however, we realised that Nice also had a lot of positive points.
In any case if you feel that it had shortcomings, the best way to improve it is to use the process of 2004.
Rejecting Nice would have caused delay and confusion.
2004 offers us opportunities to improve what our President of the Council refers to as the existing European constitution, the Treaties.
Yes, it needs improvement, but so does our method for working on it.
That needs to start with our preparation for an IGC: Not the usual group of foreign ministry officials, with all due respect to Mr Gunnar Lund, but a wider more representative body.
Hence Parliament's demand for a convention of the Council, not just a forum.
The forum is the wide debate that is taking place with civil society.
We need something to channel that debate into a set of conclusions that the IGC can work on.
That is what we need, an IGC at the end remains something that can distil the debate...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the Treaty of Nice is obviously open to a wide range of interpretations.
It is positive that the informal barriers to enlargement have been cleared away and that the Union is now constitutionally ready for its important task of uniting Europe.
Now we hope for a clearer timetable and preferably a date at the summit in Gothenburg in a couple of weeks' time.
There are, of course, major problems with the Treaty: it makes the decision-making process no simpler, no more efficient and scarcely any more comprehensible to our citizens.
It also leaves much to be desired in democratic respects.
Far too many decisions will continue to be made behind closed doors in the Council - without the democratic control, inspection or participation of Parliament.
The method for the Intergovernmental Conference is rather reminiscent of that for choosing a new pope.
The delegates are locked away in negotiations for several days whilst the world outside waits impatiently for the white smoke, a sign that a compromise has been reached.
During that time nobody knows what is happening.
However, now the next treaty is to be prepared differently - together with the citizens.
It is important to remember these fine speeches when the plans are being made for Laeken.
Perhaps it will be a convention after all.
After all, it is no secret that the majority in this chamber advocate that in any case.
It is the most open and democratic way of preparing proposals.
However, now there are rumours that it will be a convention without government representatives.
So what will it be?
A talking shop, an alibi that the ministers then ride roughshod over?
It is not a good solution!
It is also time to turn away from Nice and look to the future.
We are doing this in the European Parliament as well, possibly not so much today, but we shall do so.
Some Heads of Government are also doing so.
Moreover, I hope that more Heads of Government and ministers will participate in the debate on the future of Europe.
The Foreign Minister spoke of 'the term federalism' and the different feelings that it invokes.
This is true, and the substance is of course more important than the term itself.
Federalism - with the different interpretations that it may be given - is, however, a vision of a more democratic Europe.
Different visions of the European project are essential to the European debate, so that citizens gradually find out what issues they are to take a position on.
Mr President, we support this resolution reaffirming the full right of the European Parliament to take part in decisions on the future of the Union, which many government ministers still believe to be their exclusive prerogative.
To obtain that right, we call on the Commission, the national parliaments and those governments which recognise that genuine democracy at European level is in the interests of their citizens - perhaps not in the interest of their administrations, but certainly in the interests of their citizens. Those are the governments which no longer believe the nonsense about the mystical omnipotence of the sovereign state and which were embarrassed at Nice by the haggling that went on there.
We want them to become our allies in obtaining two things: a constitution and a convention.
We expect their support on these two matters.
Mr President, the Treaty of Nice was a coup on the part of the large countries.
They gained more votes at the expense of small countries.
Large countries were also given a new right of veto based on their population.
The Treaty of Nice was justified by the needs of enlargement.
The leaders of small countries have approved the principle according to which the number of votes of large countries grows, even if the EU is not enlarged.
This misjudgement on the part of the leaders of small countries alone is sufficient grounds to reject the Treaty of Nice.
Declaration 23 adopted in Nice will increase federalist pressure for the EU to adopt a superstate constitution and use the convention method in its preparation.
This is an unparliamentary and undemocratic method.
The Treaty of Nice supports a federal republic along the lines of the German model and does not recognise the demand of the French Prime Minister for a Europe of independent states.
This report supports the development of a federal state and must be rejected, and national parliaments should reject the Treaty of Nice.
I wish every success to the democrats in Ireland, whose referendum offers the opportunity to reject the treaty through direct democracy.
Other countries do not dare to ask their citizens, who are the sole subjects of democracy.
Mr President, there are those in this Parliament who take a very negative view of the Nice Conference and I am one of them.
I have signed a written resolution - and I hope it will collect as many signatures as possible - stating that Parliament considers the Treaty of Nice a backward step for the European institutions.
However, the deed is done and, at this point, we need to look forwards and try to ensure that Parliament and the European institutions march towards the goal of a constitution, no longer handed down from on high but built from below. I believe in that, and I also believe that it is a great goal, which does not eliminate the nation states but unites the peoples of Europe, as it is and as it will be, in a greater dream.
That seemed to be the path before us, but there is no point in ignoring new developments. The French Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, has, in recent days, been making statements to the contrary.
The French government' s statements make no reference or allusion to progress via a European convention towards a European constitution.
If I have understood them correctly, those statements - but that is how they have been interpreted - are saying the exact opposite.
This is a huge new political fact which cannot be disregarded.
I hope France is not going to maintain this position in the future.
I also hope the President of the Republic, who has the power to intervene, will correct this approach, but if the Seguro resolution is passed tomorrow - and I would have liked to make it even stronger - we have to recognise that it is a proposal contradicting the recent statements by Mr Jospin and the French government.
I hope Parliament and the Commission will be true to the outcome of tomorrow's vote.
Mr President, allow me, by way of parallel process, to give you a brief, historical account. In the seventeenth century, the Netherlands consisted of seven provinces which were each independent and sovereign.
Only certain matters were regulated by a common authority.
How did they deal with decision-making in those days?
Every province used to have veto right in all decisions.
Furthermore, the representatives were not authorised to render decisions binding upon their provinces.
That was only possible following approval from the province.
You can imagine that in an era of coaches, tow barges and carrier pigeons, this caused quite a bit of delay.
Despite this, the Netherlands was in those days a prosperous world power and had, relatively speaking, a great deal of freedom.
The complex political system evidently did not cause any obstacles.
Many in this Parliament do not spell a bright future for Europe.
The European Union is said to head for a deadlock, unless more far-reaching and in-depth centralisation takes place.
I would call that into question.
Decision-making will mainly depend on consensus among governments.
The past has shown that this can also be reached unanimously.
More important, however, is the EU' s future stability.
That will depend largely on the extent to which its decisions are experienced as being legitimate.
The EU' s legitimacy is a far greater problem than its complex political structure.
However, the legitimacy of decision-making cannot be enhanced by centralisation.
It is distressing to see a lack of attention for this point in the MÃ©ndez de Vigo/Seguro report.
That is why I shall be voting against it.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this objective, interesting report.
The success of Nice is perhaps the fact that this paper exists and it is now up to those responsible to take things forward on the basis of it.
The following areas are important for us: the division of competences between the EU and the Member States that could stand at the start of a constitutional process, the simplification of the Treaties to make them easier to communicate to the population and easier for those affected to understand, the inclusion of national parliaments in a future united Europe in order to involve the citizens and make them more enthusiastic for a united Europe, and of course the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
If my colleague Mr Voggenhuber spoke so despairingly about the behaviour of electors in Italy and Austria, perhaps he needs to remember that the European democracy he is so keen on means above all else respect for the wishes of the electorate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two rapporteurs, IÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo and AntÃ³nio JosÃ© Seguro, took on the difficult task of evaluating the results of the Nice Government Summit in December 2000 without hurting anyone while at the same time setting our sights for the future and expressing the hopes and demands of the European Parliament.
They deserve our sincere thanks.
Political closeness to the governments in the home countries obviously plays some part in the evaluation of the results of Nice.
Whether the practice of appointing two rapporteurs from different groups will still be meaningful for the European Parliament in the future needs to be looked at carefully.
As Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I should have liked the language to have been clearer.
I know that large parts of the PPE-DE Group and not only my German colleagues agree with me.
In our view, the results of Nice are not sufficient to create the institutional conditions for enlargement.
We regret that precisely because we want enlargement and want it as quickly as possible.
We have reservations in particular about the complicated voting procedure in the Council of Ministers, but also about the number of MPs and the composition of the European Parliament; that this should not be settled until 2009 is completely unsatisfactory, will create legal problems in the meantime, create injustices for some candidate countries and also cement the continuing democratic deficit because it fails to link the codecision process to majority voting in the Council of Ministers.
Nice set out four topics for the new Intergovernmental Conference, of which the definition of competences is of the utmost importance for us and must be settled before the first accessions.
Unfortunately, the draft repeatedly speaks of a constitution.
I want to argue here for the clear legal concept of a constitutional treaty.
Lastly and most important of all: the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference must not only be prepared for more carefully, it must be over by the end of 2003, and that means that the way must be definitively paved in the form of the convention, timetable and content by the time of the European Council in Laeken at the end of 2001 at the latest.
Mr President, despite the limited speaking time that I have, I do not wish to miss the opportunity to give some deserved praise to the two rapporteurs.
They have taken up the challenge of winning over a broad majority of Members, given a project, which, at the outset, seemed to be impossible to defend.
Nice was the summit of interests, not to mention the summit of national egoism.
In reality, no major European project, no exciting inspiration could come out of an agenda which was confined to the leftovers from Amsterdam.
The post-Nice process now gives us the opportunity to reassert the importance of politics.
Before we start another rush-job on the institutions, let us clearly establish why we want more of Europe, to protect and consolidate our fundamental values and our social model, in order to give more weight to the European Union, and occasionally to give it more balance, in international politics, to say loudly and clearly that internal and external solidarity must take precedence over any prevailing egoism.
We do not need any new institutions.
Let us strengthen the existing institutional triangle.
First and foremost, let us find a better way to involve citizens in the preparation of the future of the Union.
The new method of the convention that our two rapporteurs have been hoping and praying for gives us the opportunity to do this.
Some new inspiration, some groundswell, must reinvigorate the old method of intergovernmental negotiation.
In order to unveil this new round of European integration, let us allow our imagination to run free, and let us begin by saying 'yes' to the convention.
Mr President, this report does not reflect the political reality of the sub-state situation.
That is why we have presented amendments: because the sub-state situation does not appear in this report and it is important that they, the constitutional regions, participate in this preliminary debate and participate in the convention.
This is the desire of many people in Europe.
For this reason, not only are we presenting these amendments, but also the highest representatives of the important European regions - Catalonia, Bavaria, Scotland, Rhineland North Westphalia, Salzburg, Wallonia and Flanders - met on Monday with the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Verhofstadt, in order to raise exactly the same issue with him.
If these amendments are approved, it will show that the reality has been positively recognised and that the principle of subsidiarity is functioning properly.
Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, this report gives hope to many of us.
Let us hope that it represents a road and not an inn. I congratulate you and Mr Seguro on the work you have done.
Mr President, there has been severe criticism of the Treaty of Nice, not just here in this House, but throughout Europe.
The kind of late-night dealing and smoke-filled rooms that finalised the treaty was the unacceptable face of the EU and it is not worthy of a Union of 350 million people.
The focus should be accountability and democracy, but Nice was a shambles with the outcome for Ireland that we lose our automatic right to a Commissioner.
I believe Ireland will vote "no" on 7 June in spite of the sneers of some elites here and elsewhere and that result will be welcomed all over Europe.
The Treaty of Nice allows a core group of Member States to form an elite inner circle.
They have hijacked the EU institutions and this will mean that some states become second class members including the new applicant countries.
We need an accountable Europe that makes human rights a core value and brings progress on social and environmental rights also.
The EU, which brought former enemies together for peaceful cooperation, is now being militarised.
The Treaty of Nice could mean that a number of Member States could decide to go ahead with a nuclear-armed force even though other states do not agree.
That should be unthinkable.
Mr President, I disagree with this report for three basic reasons.
The first concerns its view of the Treaty of Nice' s content. It adopts an uncompromising approach in its criticism of the positions that were adopted there, considering them to be timid and inadequate, when what it should have done was criticise the steps towards federalism, which threaten the fundamental interests of some current and future Member States, since the applicant countries could not take part in a process of decision making on changes that will affect them.
It is also unacceptable for the European Parliament to criticise the position taken in Nice on increasing the number of MEPs in order to ensure a more pluralist composition following enlargement, although it then tries to achieve some fairness with regard to the number of representatives from Hungary and the Czech Republic.
The lowest possible number!
My second point of disagreement concerns speeding up the process of preparing the new Treaty when the Treaty of Nice has not even been ratified by the Member States' national Parliaments.
It is unacceptable to insist on a proposal that seeks to make rapid progress on revising the Treaty in order to conclude it by the end of 2003 without even guaranteeing participation on an equal footing for the applicant countries.
My third point of disagreement concerns the method that has been laid down for following up the proposal to draft the Charter.
This method excludes the participation of parties with different political views, which threatens the pluralism and the genuinely independent and democratic participation of national parliaments.
