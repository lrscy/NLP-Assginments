We also do something about international animal transports.
This is all very important but also highly arbitrary.
We have to ask ourselves what Europe would like to do, or indeed has to do, in the area of animal protection.
Do we want a ban on collecting lapwingsâ eggs in the Netherlands, or bull fighting in Spain or the fattening of French geese for , because those customs are animal-unfriendly or are they national matters to which Europeâs interference does not add any value?
It would not be a bad idea for us in this House and in the EU to think about what we do and do not want to do in the area of animal protection, rather than indulging in protection at random.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur on the perceptiveness she has shown in this matter, and we fully support her proposal to reject the Commission proposal.
We can also endorse her arguments.
Nevertheless, I would like to stress a few points.
First of all, Commissioner, I would like to say that I very much appreciate the preparations you have made in terms of following up this project, in view of the European Parliamentâs position.
I would like to stress how inconsistent the Commissionâs management of this issue of humane trapping has been.
We must remember that, in 1998, the European Parliament rejected the conclusion of tripartite agreements with Russia, Canada and the United States, because it felt that they were not ambitious enough to be effective.
Unlike todayâs events, though, the vote in 1998 was of no consequence, because the Council could have concluded the agreements even against Parliamentâs wishes.
This time, however, the Commission has proposed a European directive to implement those same agreements, in other words a project that does not achieve the objectives it has set itself.
So why, under such circumstances, would Parliament accept such a weak proposal?
That is our question to the Commission.
With regard to the content, too, we find this proposal unacceptable.
Not only has it been criticised by scientists, as my fellow Members have already said, and by animal welfare organisations, but it also does nothing to reduce the suffering of trapped animals.
In this connection, I think we must look at the arguments put forward by MrsÂ Scheele, who explains quite specifically that we are not reducing this suffering at all.
One final, vital point: this draft is unacceptable because, at the end of the day, it flouts European law, in that its positive list includes species protected under ArticleÂ 12 of the Habitat Directive.
It includes the otter, the wolf, the beaver and the lynx.
And you know, Commissioner âÂ and I am well aware of this, coming from FranceÂ â how difficult it is to enforce the Habitat Directive, to protect wolves and to try to explain the situation.
It is therefore for all these reasons that we are rejecting this proposal and that, in truth, Commissioner, we are counting on you to act as an intermediary between Parliament and the Commission and to get it to withdraw this draft.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this proposal for a directive from the Commission is no great success.
Everyone, from hunters to those whose job it is to protect animals, may be said to be dissatisfied with its content.
Our political group concurs with the criticism made.
In particular, the content is obviously not based on the latest scientific findings, as a proposal for a directive of this type should, in fact, be.
It is therefore time to withdraw the proposal and start again from the beginning.
As we see it, it is a question of obtaining a balance in the proposal.
Animal protection must come first, meaning that considerable improvements to the proposal are required.
When the relevant regulations are laid down, it will, however, be important not unnecessarily to regulate hunting rules in the Member States to a degree greater than that required to protect animals against suffering.
In the future too, this must, in the main, be an issue for individual nations.
We hope that the Commission will come back with a new proposal.
We would thank the rapporteur for her work and shall vote in favour of the report as it stands.
Â Â  . Mr President, my group supports the proposal to reject this directive, albeit on the basis of arguments that are different from the rapporteurâs.
Firstly, I take the view that this directive would render the effective control of pests impossible in certain Member States â I am thinking especially of the muskrat in the Netherlands.
This can have major consequences for public safety.
As long as the proposal contains no exemption in this respect, I cannot lend it my support.
Commissioner Dimas said that he could understand the concerns of many organisations.
I would like to know if he could also understand the concern we in the Netherlands have for the safety of our citizens, if dikes are undermined by muskrats digging burrows.
My second argument for rejection concerns the legal foundation.
Protocol 33 to the EC Treaty grants the EU competence in the area of animal welfare only in the framework of agricultural, transport, internal market or research policy.
The draft directive implements the international agreement on humane trapping methods, which was concluded in the context of the common trade policy.
Since the proposal harmonises the Member Statesâ standards for animal traps within the internal market and does not serve a direct environmental goal, Article 95 alone can be seen as the correct legal foundation for this proposal.
I would like to have Commissioner Dimasâ reaction to this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, for the third time since 1991, in other words in 15 years, our Parliament, as usual during the night sitting, is discussing the issue of traps and their âbarbarism with a human faceâ.
In 1991, for example, we banned leghold traps and imports of fur from foxes, otters, lynxes and 13 species of animal from Canada and the United States.
The ban was intended to apply as of 1995.
In 1998, however, the Commission explained to us that it was necessary to extend the life of leghold traps in the interests of Inuits and their traditional hunting practices, even when the Inuit trappers in question are multinational fur companies with premises on Fifth Avenue in NewÂ York.
In this very place, before the Irish Commissioner MrÂ MacÂ Sharry, I described an animal from the far North, the bones in its foot shattered, its tendons crushed and its arteries severed, which tears off its own foot and drags itself over the red-stained snow to die 20Â metres away under the fir trees, all for the profit of a luxury industry run by people who are about as Indian as I, with the name Martinez, am genetically Swedish.
This evening, then, in response to the directive on humane traps, which is supposed to enable us to take action to manage fauna, to protect dykes, to protect cultures and to respect the Treaties, I say âNo!
No!â, because, for every muskrat or badger that creates danger, we trap 10 silver foxes that create a profit.
So, MrÂ President, Commissioner, let them live!
Â Â  Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the report.
The vote in committee produced a clear result.
I believe that we all, in principle, are glad to see regulations on the protection of wild animals, and so I regard an all-round approach as desirable.
Let us just consider the great differences between the Habitats Directive, the Birds Directive and the protection afforded to other animals: those differences are not always justified.
Account must, of course, also be taken of animalsâ capacity for causing the sort of damage that endangers lives.
I believe that we need to draw a distinction and simply give priority to human well-being.
Let us just remember the breaches in the dams, of which we had such a powerful description from our Dutch fellow Members.
That having been said, we do, as legislator, have to consider how we can come to the right decisions given the powers with which we have been endowed.
As the basis of these powers has already, however, been the subject of dispute, considerations of legal certainty demand that this issue be examined with great thoroughness.
If we follow the reasoning of the Commission and this Houseâs Legal Affairs Committee, the basis is Article 175 and that immediately following it.
Since, though, this proposal does not take account of the most up-to-date scientific knowledge, I believe that the whole thing needs to be rejected.
This is too important a matter for us not to seek out the best for animals as much as for human beings.
It should also, of course, be borne in mind that the doctrine of subsidiarity requires that the Member States be given the opportunity to enact stringent animal protection rules, whilst also prioritising the safety of human beings.
Â Â  Mr President, I am not going to break the mould because I too support the idea of rejecting this proposal.
As everybody else has said, it is hard to see any animal welfare benefits in what the Commission is proposing.
I understand that the Commissionâs own Scientific and Veterinary Committee queried the proposal, and there are even some question marks about how it was consulted.
It is also perplexing â and I raised this in committee â to see a list of 19Â species to be covered by the directive and then to discover that some of them were actually protected species in the European Union.
It seems strange to describe how to trap animals that you are not allowed to hunt by law.
I would appreciate the Commissionerâs comments on that.
They say that you cannot please all of the people all of the time, but I am afraid that this proposal does not seem to please anybody at all.
Therefore, I was pleased to hear that the Commissioner is prepared to listen to Parliament and to find an alternative way forward on this issue.
Mrs Scheele has done a very good job and we have a united front in Parliament, which is very different from the debate the Commissioner witnessed on REACH yesterday, the outcome of which we will see tomorrow in the vote.
Â Â  If the purpose of this Directive has been to introduce humane trapping standards for certain animal species, then that purpose has failed.
Its failure to take into account the latest scientific research evidence is contrary to certain other items of EU legislation and it will do nothing to ease the suffering of the wild animals which are trapped.
In terms of the psychological and behavioural development of mammals, the main moral objection to the use of trapping methods as a means of killing is that the period between the animal being trapped and becoming unconscious, or its death struggle time, is too long.
The fact remains, however, that the international agreement entered into by the EU, Canada and the Russian Federation, the environmental component of which this Directive wishes to transpose into EU legislation, is the first of two which deal specifically with the question of wild animal welfare, despite the fact that its primary purpose is to facilitate fur trading.
I would like to draw your attention to Article 5 of this agreement, which comprehensively obstructs the efforts of countries which have already introduced hunting regulations surpassing international standards.
If the existing standards only derive from a set of lowest common denominators, parties to this agreement will not be encouraged to consider developing more humane standards.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to echo the comments that have already been made by several other Members in support of the position of Mrs Scheele, the rapporteur, in her report.
As we have heard, colleagues want to reject the Commission proposal for a number of different reasons; but we are in agreement about the rejection.
As has already been said several times, this proposal has been criticised by anyone who is involved in this area â by the scientists, by animal welfare groups, by pro-hunting groups â because it is not based on the latest scientific research evidence and it certainly does not prevent, or even reduce, the suffering of animals in traps.
This Parliament has often shown its political will to protect animals and this weak proposal certainly does not achieve that.
The standards here are not humane.
We are not talking about a few animals, but about millions of animals that are trapped every year in the European Union.
There are many areas where the proposal falls short of what can be achieved or what could be achieved to improve animal welfare.
For example, it allows traps that are not classed as humane to be used while better traps are developed, but no time limit is put on this.
The priority is for trapping to continue.
There are no safeguards, as we have heard already, to protect endangered species from being killed in traps in some areas where we know those species are found.
The only way to do that would be to ban traps in those areas.
So for these reasons, and for many other reasons, it is not acceptable and the Commission should produce a new proposal.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Commissionâs proposal concerning trapping leaves a very great deal to be desired.
Under the proposal, traps are to be tested according to strict standards, special training for trappers is to be introduced and home-made traps are only to be permitted in exceptional circumstances.
If this proposal is adopted by the European Parliament, it will, in practice, be impossible to engage in trapping in the Nordic countries.
It is gratifying that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety rejected the Commissionâs proposal.
Hunting issues must be decided at national or local level, not in Brussels.
I want to draw Membersâ attention to the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs has issued an opinion concerning the proposalâs legal basis.
This opinion has been incorporated into the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and recommends that Article 175 form the legal basis for the proposal.
This article concerns the EUâs environmental policy.
The protection of wild animals is not, however, a part of the EUâs environmental policy and does not even come within the EUâs competence.
If Article 175 were to constitute the legal basis, there would be a great danger of more and more matters such as this being regarded as EU issues and dealt with at EU level.
I agree with the rapporteur, MrsÂ Scheele, that the Commissionâs proposal should be rejected.
MrsÂ Scheele is proceeding, however, on the basis that the proposal is not sufficiently far-reaching.
I am of the opposite view.
Of course, rules are needed, including in connection with trapping, so that, for example, animal protection is guaranteed.
These rules must, however, be laid down by the Member States and not in Brussels.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I understand that this proposal will probably be rejected tomorrow.
That is partly because powerful forces here in Parliament seem to want to regulate trapping in detail and almost put an end to trapping as such.
It appears almost as though the ultimate objective is that trapping should not take place in Europe.
For such people, this proposal is quite simply not sufficiently far-reaching.
Even though they are often described as friends of the environment, they often make demands that are anything but environmentally friendly.
The fact is ignored that trapping is an important part of caring for wildlife and the environment.
I can quote, as an example of this, something I heard about the other day, namely that there are species of sea birds that depend on Finns catching, for example, raccoon dogs, which do not naturally belong to the local fauna but which have been imported.
In my opinion, the Commissionâs proposal is not too limited.
On the contrary, it really goes much too far.
Moreover, the Commission is trying to extend its powers to issues that the Member States really are best placed to deal with.
I have two arguments I hope the Commission will take on board with a view to possible future proposals.
Firstly, I think that we must take the existing international agreements as our starting point and not try to extend them in a way that is in danger of creating new barriers to trade.
In the last analysis, doing that only hits individual manufacturers and hunters and creates problems.
What is more, I think that, instead of taking a cue from the Commission and extending the agreement, it would have been enough to demand that the Member States themselves implement parts of this agreement.
Secondly, this proposal would give rise to a lot of bureaucracy, which might be done away with.
Member States such as Sweden have efficient systems whereby all traps are tested.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, it should have been possible to approve the results of tests already carried out on various traps.
I hope that the Commission will take these arguments on board and not just listen to the arguments of those who wish to put a stop to trapping.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner spoke earlier on about our international obligations.
I would argue that the so-called international agreement is at best ambiguous.
I am no legal expert, but the Commission must agree that there are serious legal inconsistencies between this proposal and other EU policies, to which both Mrs McAvan and Mr Blokland, from different starting points, have drawn attention.
Mr Maaten mentioned the Habitats Directive.
However, there is also the protection of laboratory animals in research.
These and others are serious and sound policies for the protection of wildlife and animals that are sadly used in laboratories.
This is an important subject; it cannot be left merely to the luck of the toss.
Air in the atmosphere and the air we breathe is rightly considered a subject necessary for environmental legislation at EU level.
I would say to the previous speaker, Mr Fjellner, that this proposal falls into the same category of being important and necessary, but at the moment it fails to take account of many previous decisions.
As Mr Schnellhardt noted, we have to work with other countries in the world â the United States, Canada and Russia.
However, for our own credibility, I would argue that we can do better than this and we have to do so.
I commend the rapporteur for her work and, speaking on behalf of this Parliamentâs Intergroup on Animal Welfare, I too call for withdrawal of this proposal, because, sadly, it will do nothing for the welfare of animals.
In the light of what the Commissioner has heard tonight, I suggest that to avoid humiliation tomorrow, he withdraws it before it is put to the vote in plenary.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I naturally agree with both my own group and the others that have put forward arguments against the Commissionâs proposal, and I shall not go over these arguments again in this Chamber.
In actual fact, I asked to be given the floor just to remind people that animals that live almost unobserved in the wild have better lives than animals kept in cages.
We have seen dreadful pictures from China of bears kept in cages for the sake of their fur, but it is not, of course, only bears with which we are concerned here.
In Denmark, we have large fox farms, and these are dreadful too, no matter what type of trapping is practised.
Fox farming is outright cruelty to animals.
I think that we must include other animals as subjects of this debate instead of ignoring this problem and only taking an interest in the cruelty to animals caused through trapping.
I should like to emphasise that we must broaden our perspective in order to avoid legitimising the brutal treatment of animals on farms in both China and Denmark.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I could not disagree more with the previous speaker.
I think the farming of animals for fur in Europe is in much better shape than farming animals in China.
Deer farming, fox farming and mink farming are totally different issues.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my support for Mrs Scheeleâs conclusion that the Commission proposal should be rejected. However, I do not agree with her reasons for doing so.
Firstly, the legal basis of the Commission proposal is questionable.
This proposal seeks to implement a trade agreement allowing the EU to comply with its international trade obligations, but its contents relate to the welfare of wild animals, for which the EU does not and should not have competence.
The Treaty only empowers the EU to take responsibility for animal welfare in the context of agriculture, transport, internal market research and areas such as the welfare of farmed animals, fur farming included.
Secondly, the Commission has failed to provide an impact assessment of the proposed directive.
The estimated cost of testing for a single type of trap varies from EURÂ 30Â 000 to EURÂ 100Â 000.
Carrying out the testing by technical means would make the requirements more reliable, cheaper and easier to measure and standardise across the Member States.
But there is a problem, as Mr Evans said.
Laboratory animals are animals too and we have to take care of their welfare as well.
Furthermore, the idea that home-made traps would require a special permit for each use is hallucinatory.
How does the Commission think the permit requests of tens of thousands of Finnish trappers would be handled in Brussels?
Thirdly, like many of the previous speakers I would like to underline the detrimental effects of the proposal on the conservation of wildlife and nature.
The raccoon dog, which is not a native species of Finland but is an extremely efficient predator of birds and other wildlife, can only be effectively managed by trapping.
If the trapping were made as difficult as the proposal suggests, the loss of biodiversity would be enormous.
In general, it is essential to rely on local knowledge in applying trapping and hunting legislation.
Only local people have sufficient knowledge of the local flora and fauna to help set up balanced legislation.
The wrong kind of intervention at EU level can compromise an otherwise noble objective, as in all areas where subsidiarity should be upheld.
I sincerely ask the Commission to withdraw this proposal in order to avoid humiliation tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to encapsulate much in a short space of time.
Hundreds and thousands of animals are caught in traps all over the European Union, and the practice is primarily used to manage animals living in the wild and, in particular, to combat pests, of which muskrats are but one example.
It was in 1998 that the EU, together with Canada, Russia and the USA, concluded the agreement on international humane trapping standards.
These countries are the principal exporters of furs and pelts, and the EU, in two decisions, rightly justified this by reference to its competence in general economic policy and, in particular, in policy affecting the internal market.
The present proposal for legislation constitutes an attempt at transposing this agreement into EU law; the substance of it is that the Commission is arguing for a balance â which certainly stands in need of further discussion â between the need for the avoidable suffering on the part of animals to be limited and the need for trapping as a means of catching them.
It has to be said, though, that the proposal takes environmental policy as its primary basis, but the EU is responsible for the well-being of animals only in conjunction with other policy areas, such as agriculture, transport, the single market or research.
It follows that it possesses no general competence with regard to the well-being of animals in the wild.
This House, of course, is â as of course, am I â all in favour of safeguarding the well-being of animals in the wild, but that, as a subject for legislation, is a matter for the Member States.
It is because the European Parliament, as the European legislature, must respect the Member Statesâ rights under subsidiarity that it must reject this proposal for legislation irrespective of the good intentions it contains.
I have to tell the Commissioner that the enactment of relevant regulations by the Member States will discharge the European Unionâs obligations.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to start by saying that democratic procedures include the rejection of proposals and I do not consider that to be humiliating or embarrassing.
It is part of the democratic process which we must take into account.
As I mentioned earlier, I have taken account of the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety concerning the rejection of the Commission proposal and I have heard this evening all the different opinions formulated here, opinions which may in numerous instances have had various starting points but which almost all arrived at the same conclusion.
The proposal for a directive being debated would have filled a legal gap, given that, if we exclude the 1991 Council regulation, there is no other legislation on trapping standards at European Union level and, at national level, the existing legal framework is very restricted.
In all events, this proposal would add to the existing legislation of the Member States, not subtract from it: where there is stricter legislation, this would continue to apply.
Nonetheless, given your concerns and taking account of the Council's position, I wish to inform you that the Commission will examine its next steps on this proposal very carefully, including of course the possibility of withdrawing it.
At the present stage, however, I would like to say that we need to examine all the relevant parameters.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
- A6-0292/2005 by Mr Romeva i Rueda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the Council's Sixth Annual Report according to Operative ProvisionÂ 8 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports (2005/2013(INI)),
- A6-0297/2005 by Mr Kristovskis, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction: a role for the European Parliament (2005/2139(INI)), and
- A6-0288/2005 by Mr Wuermeling, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Green Paper on defence procurement (2005/2030(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like firstly to thank not just my fellow Members, but also the Commissioner, for being here, although I must express my regret that the Council, significantly, is not here.
It had promised to attend but, owing to a last minute change to the order of business, it cannot be here.
I do not believe that this problem is the fault of the Council, but rather the Bureau, and I regret that we cannot now hold this debate together with the Council.
Given that my report evaluates the Councilâs actions, its absence is particularly regrettable.
Nevertheless, this is an important, fundamental, issue, as demonstrated by the interest shown by many sectors of civil society in the issue of both arms control and the lack of such control.
Selling arms is not like selling fridges, t-shirts or computers.
It is an issue that has very serious repercussions at many levels and the consequences of mass uncontrolled sales may therefore be disastrous.
We must remember a significant fact: every minute somebody falls victim to a firearm.
Furthermore, spending on this kind of export and this kind of purchase prejudices other investments that are often much more necessary for economic and social development.
Moreover, those exports and purchases often have a destabilising effect from a regional point of view, because they often lead to an arms race which will ultimately present us with a huge problem.
For all of these reasons, transparency and control in relation to this kind of export is fundamental.
The figures are clear.
In 2003, the international arms trade turned over between 34Â 000 and 43Â 000 million dollars and the main exporters include European countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Germany, from which 25% of total world exports originated.
We Europeans therefore have a great responsibility.
Furthermore, of the main importers, we must stress that China and India are two of the countries that receive and buy the greatest quantities of these types of products.
We have a code of conduct in Europe approved in 1998 which is insufficient â as we have been saying for a long time.
It is weak and it is not legally binding.
In the report that we debated last year, therefore, for which it was also my honour to be rapporteur, we proposed making it legally binding â which we have also taken up in this new review report.
In fact, the report approved a few weeks ago by the Committee on Foreign Affairs clearly specified the need to strengthen the code of conduct and turn it into a legally binding text.
Furthermore, this report raises other issues that are also important: for example, the fact that transfers of production capacity are subject to the code and that special monitoring mechanisms are established for cases in which it has been decided to lift the arms embargo.
I would just like to say that, with regard to the specific case of China, we must remember that, once again, this House has stated that it is not in favour of lifting the arms embargo in the current circumstances.
Firstly, because sufficient and reasonable conditions are not in place for doing so and, secondly, because doing so would send the completely wrong message, not just to China, but to the world in general, about how seriously we take this kind of embargo.
The report also mentions aspects that relate to arms brokering, the regulation of torture equipment, the impact of enlargement and also the role to be played by the European Union in relation to the United Nations.
The Dutch Presidency promised us â and we are pleased about this â that there would be a review of the code and that it would be strengthened, and also that it would be turned into a common position.
We are at the end of 2005, two more Presidencies have gone by and we are still waiting.
We must acknowledge that the British Presidency has placed great emphasis on the need to conclude it and we hope that this will have been done by the end of its six months, but for the moment we are waiting.
Finally, on the subject of presidencies, I would like to end by expressing my regret that one thing is unfortunately missing from the priorities of the coming Austrian Presidency: there is no mention of the issue of small arms.
Given the importance of this issue, not just in this House, but in civil society in general, we believe that its absence is very worrying and that it must be included within the context of the need and commitment the Council and this House have repeatedly expressed in favour of an international arms treaty.
I would insist that this report represents a step forward and I hope that we do not waste more time in relation to this issue, since we do not have time to waste.
Â Â  . Commissioner, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this eveningâs debates about combating the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction confirm the European Parliamentâs understanding of the need to actively participate in solving the greatest threat to contemporary civilisation.
It has to be said that the drafting of the report was politically and technically complicated, taking into account the global character and special features of the threats caused by weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
However, the European Parliament has been able to tackle the complexity of this issue.
In this connection, as rapporteur, I would like to express my gratitude both to my colleagues in Parliament and also to the specialists in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Personal Representative and her office, as well as to the Commissionâs specialists for their active and constructive collaboration in drafting the report over a period of many months.
In my view, the most important conclusion is the concern about the fact that, unfortunately, among the international organisations and Great Powers involved there is no common understanding or agreed action with regard to restricting the proliferation of WMD and the materials and technologies connected with them.
This is worrying because the most influential international organisations and states acknowledge, at the same time, that WMD and their proliferation pose the greatest potential threat to the safety of mankind.
Among criminal and terrorist circles, there is a growing interest in WMD and their constituents.
What is more, since the cold war era this threat, far from decreasing, is actually increasing.
Therefore, the report contains an assessment not only of the jointly implemented policy of the European Union and its Member States with regard to WMD non-proliferation and restriction, but also an examination of aspects of the activities of the USA, Russia and other states that are jointly responsible.
The report voices dissatisfaction regarding the inability of the international community to reach a consensus at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference held in New York in May this year.
This is seen as a serious blow for multilateralism.
As is well known, the 40-plus priority measures put forward by the European Council and Commission to improve the situation did not receive adequate support.
This confirms the diversity of interests, tactical thinking and action among states with international influence.
Such a lack of trust does not foster multilateral cooperation but devalues the activity of the International Atomic Energy Agency and other special chemical and weapons control organisations.
Their information is frequently critical in keeping the issue of weapons of mass destruction subject to international control.
Similarly, when the report was being debated within the European Parliamentâs Committee on Foreign Affairs, differing opinions were expressed concerning steps that could be taken internationally on a multilateral basis.
For example, there were differing views about Iranâs current politically sensitive nuclear programme.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will touch on one more aspect of the report which is, in my view, particularly pressing.
I believe that the success of the European Unionâs common strategy on WMD proliferation is now to a large extent dependent on the available financial aspects of the European Unionâs strategy for restricting the proliferation of WMD.
It has to be said that currently the absence of a goal-oriented, distinct funding heading is undermining successful implementation of the strategy.
Unfortunately, there is no clarity at the moment either in the European Parliament or in the other European institutions about the funding of the priorities laid down by the Councilâs Personal Representative or of the programmes accepted by the Commissionâs global partnership of eight.
This is absurd, since it would be necessary, according to previous political decisions, to allocate more than 900Â million euros over the next five years for the various measures in European Union programmes planned for the restriction of WMD proliferation, for disarmament and for weapons destruction.
This figure and this level of funding demonstrates the European Unionâs ambitions in previous years, but there is a time when the political will to fulfil commitments that have already been undertaken has to be demonstrated.
This means that the Commission and the Council first of all need to be able to agree on drafting a goal-oriented, effective financial instrument for the needs of the WMD programme within the framework of the next Financial Perspective, as well as within the Community budget, and the funding framework of the European Councilâs Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The problems that have arisen confirm the need for the European Parliament, as an institution with budgetary powers, to participate in ensuring consistent provision for the European Unionâs security strategy.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue with which my report is concerned is fundamentally different in character from the things we have just heard addressed.
It is not about how we deal with weapons at the international level, or about arms limitation, but rather about whether we want to make it possible for the procurement of military equipment to be liberalised within the European single market.
I would like to start by expressing my very warm gratitude for the input provided by those Members who had a hand in drawing up the report, whether as rapporteur in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or as shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
My discussions and conversations with them have been a source of very useful suggestion, which have been incorporated into the report.
I also want to thank the Commission for its very good cooperation, which involved it being willing to delay the adoption of the subsequent White Paper until after we had delivered our opinion.
I am also grateful to the interested parties for taking part in our hearings and thereby helping to prepare the sector for these changes.
The topic is a decidedly delicate one, as the procurement of military equipment can be said to touch upon the very heart of national sovereignty.
It was for that reason that the Treaty establishing the European Community, back in the 1950s, included a derogation clause safeguarding the interests of national security.
Over the past decade, though, we have, progressively and continuously, moved closer together even on fundamental matters of security policy, and the debate on the two preceding reports is a demonstration of how we, in these areas, are taking a fundamentally global approach to policy.
The procurement market within the European Union remains, however, utterly fragmented, with every country having its own preferred suppliers and purveyors by appointment.
Instead of competition, there is a fragmentation that prevents our industry from being competitive internationally and entails very high costs in the purchase of military equipment that might be available on more favourable terms elsewhere, and that is a burden on the wallets of the taxpayers who, ultimately, have to pay for it all.
It was for that reason that we, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Foreign Affairs arrived, on parallel lines, at the conclusion that the time has come for us to venture a bold step.
We endorse the Commissionâs proposal that this derogation clause, Article 296, should be clarified and made more precise, and we do so because we have established that it is widely abused.
This clause is used as a pretext for removing practically the whole of the military equipment procurement sector from the internal market.
There is a black hole in the internal market, and that with a total expenditure of EURÂ 160 billion per annum.
We want the public to get the message that the mutual opening-up of procurement markets testifies, among other things, to the Member Statesâ trust in one another.
Let us â we want to say to them â take a step forward that will make it possible for state expenditure to be cut back, and let us set in motion a process that will eventually make us more competitive and perhaps even enable us to free ourselves to some degree from certain dependencies on suppliers outside Europe!
I need only mention the current procurement arrangements for the refuelling of aircraft or for guided missiles, where we are largely dependent on supplies from other markets.
Let me conclude with a few brief words on the amendments that have been submitted.
I believe that the key to our reaching a common mind without regard to party boundaries on this matter has been that we said at the very outset that we would concentrate on the issue of the single market and would not allow the discussion to get bogged down in general policy issues relating to security, the armed forces and peacemaking.
The result of this has been that Mrs Beer, from the Greens, and I, as a member of the CSU, began the deliberations with largely identical reports.
These amendments, which are somewhat ideological in character, have made them less so.
I therefore recommend that you endorse the report, but vote for none of the amendments except AmendmentÂ 5.
Â Â  . Mr President, the rapporteur Mr Romeva i Rueda should again be commended for putting together a report that challenges Member States to attain better, more stringent, harmonised controls on arms exports.
Whilst the report's primary focus is on stimulating improvement in European practice, it also recognises the EU's potential to stimulate best practice in the European Neighbourhood and in the wider world.
It advocates an international arms trade treaty.
The Commission strongly supports opening negotiations on a legally binding arms trade treaty.
We believe this would be of great value, not least in reducing the spread of illicit small arms and light weapons, which help fuel human insecurity, crime and conflict around the world.
This is an area where the Commission does not take the lead but where we are fully associated under the CFSP.
The Commission is regularly involved, with other international organisations and NGOs, in dealing with the consequences of inappropriate or illegal arms sales.
We are also contributing, through implementing specific projects, to reducing destabilising accumulations of weapons around the world.
As the report points out, around half a million people die each year as a result of small arms violence.
In the face of these sobering statistics we cannot be complacent.
Turning to the second part â the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction â I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kristovskis, on this very important work.
It is now two years since the adoption of the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The non-proliferation regime is seriously challenged.
The risk of terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction is considered by many a very serious threat.
The European Union is defining its budgetary priorities for the coming years.
All of this makes the report not only important but also very timely.
The area is not new to the Commission.
As mentioned in the report, the Commission has long been engaged in cooperative assistance programmes to reduce the risks associated with WMD-related materials, equipment and technologies, particularly in the area of the former Soviet Union.
The Commission has also gained experience by implementing EU joint actions on non-proliferation in Russia under the CFSP framework.
These actions constitute the core of the Commission's contribution so far to the G8 global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
I, along with the rapporteur and the honourable Members of Parliament, very much regret that the negotiations on non-proliferation in New York were not very successful.
This does not send a good signal to countries like Iran.
The EU strategy calls for the creation of a specific Community budget line in this domain.
The Commission has responded to this call by inserting important non-proliferation objectives in its October 2004 proposal for the Stability Instrument.
This and subsequent proposals are under consideration here and in the Council.
A positive outcome to these negotiations is essential.
While the overall financial issues are being discussed, I would like to express my appreciation to Parliament for enabling, in agreement with the Council, the Commission to implement a series of pilot projects in this area.
They help to define how Community instruments might best contribute to strengthening EU non-proliferation assistance.
In early December a high-level interparliamentary conference will take place in Brussels, where a series of independent studies on the way ahead will be presented and debated.
I am grateful for the excellent cooperation with Parliament in organising this event.
We hope to see many parliamentarians present on that occasion.
As requested in the report, the Commission stands ready to provide further information to Parliament on past and ongoing Community programmes supporting WMD non-proliferation and disarmament goals.
It goes without saying that the Commission looks forward to continued good cooperation with the Council and Parliament in support of these overall objectives.
Let me now turn to defence procurement.
The role of the European Parliament in such a sensitive debate is crucial, and I am glad that the Commission will now be able to take Parliament's contribution into account.
As you know, in the next few weeks the Commission will adopt a communication on the results of the public consultation that has taken place over the last few months.
It is very important that this communication adequately reflects the position taken by Parliament.
I warmly thank, on behalf of Commissioner McCreevy, all those who made this possible, in particular MrÂ Wuermeling, Mrs Beer and Mr HÃ¶kmark, who did a remarkable job in their respective committees.
The Commission, which was urged back in 2002 by the European Parliament to take initiatives in this field, is particularly happy with the content of this House's contribution.
The ultimate objective of the Commission in this field is to open up defence markets, which are today, as the rapporteur said, highly fragmented, and to increase the efficiency of public spending by encouraging competition and transparency in these markets.
This should benefit both buyers and taxpayers but also the European defence industry, which is suffering from a market structure which prevents it from competing in the global market place.
The public debate carried out over the last few months and the various contributions received show that the majority of the stakeholders share the same objective.
Even Member States now seem convinced that something has to be done quickly in order to move things forward.
The current negotiations within the European Defence Agency on a code of conduct clearly show the political will to put an end to a situation that is unanimously considered unsatisfactory.
The Commission is, therefore, ready to play its part in this process.
In particular, it could clear up those issues where the consultation has shown that different interpretations of the existing rules have led to differences in implementation.
This could be done easily and quickly, by means of an interpretative communication, under the Community's and the Commission's sole responsibility.
But also â and perhaps more importantly â it could propose new, more flexible rules for the procurement of defence material, rules which better suit the specific nature of this material.
This would be neither quick nor easy.
It would require a new legislative proposal.
At this stage, a specific directive on defence procurement seems to be, therefore, the most appropriate legal instrument, which could address all the important issues that national authorities need to take into account when they procure defence material, such as security of supply, confidentiality or particular urgency.
The Commission will carry out the necessary preliminary assessments and consultations and the European Parliament will be closely involved in this process.
I thank you very much for your support and for your three very important reports.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I am to talk about defence procurement and should like to say thank you to MrÂ Wuermeling for his report on this issue.
I think it important to state that defence procurement will play a decisive role in enabling Europe to be a leader in military terms and in terms of technology.
However, defence procurement is also crucial if we are to play a role in terms of research and development in this area.
This means that we need to have large companies that can operate on an international basis and come up with the best products.
What we are concerned with here is obtaining better value for money, but we are also concerned with playing a part in developing military technology enabling Europe to hold its own in terms both of security policy and of cooperation with other parts of the world.
One basic issue is that of how we are to obtain the industrial capacity to be at the leading edge in terms of developing modern technology.
Europeâs problem is that we have a fragmented market because of historically differing security interests.
With a declining number of purchases and lower defence appropriations, together with â and this is something important to remember â a significant increase in the need for research and development, Europe is not well placed if developments on our continent are to be more or less in balance with, for example, those in the United States.
One of the more crucial tasks is therefore to ensure that, when it comes to the type of defence procurement falling within the framework of Article 296 of the Treaty, we can obtain increased cooperation in terms both of procurement and of open competition among producers.
If we do not succeed in obtaining all this, we shall not be able to compete or play our part in developing the most advanced defence equipment, for such equipment is covered by Article 296, which permits derogations for the Member States.
If we are to be able to alter this situation, the very first step is to obtain a common code of conduct and, in the longer term, a directive.
It is, however, important for a start to be made on this work.
Otherwise, the foundations of the European defence industry will be undermined.
Â Â  . â Commissioner, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank RaÃŒl Romeva i Rueda, the rapporteur, for the work he has done in evaluating the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.
Since I was entrusted with the task of drafting the opinion of the Committee on Development on this issue, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the fact that we were able to agree on the inclusion in the report of the aspects which the Committee on Development considered most important.
On behalf of the Committee on Development I would like to express my conviction that the export of arms to poor, conflict-ridden states cannot be tolerated, since it fosters poverty and violations of human rights.
It is paradoxical for governments to talk about combating poverty and strengthening the rule of law, but at the same time to allow SALW trade to repressive regimes and states experiencing extreme military conflicts.
It has to be said that the impact of SALW trade is particularly detrimental for development policy in the Cotonou Agreement states.
We can see a similar view in the 2000 report.
For this reason, the Committee on Development calls on the Council and the Commission to formulate SALW guidelines precisely for developing countries; emphasises the need for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration measures; repeats the need to draw up a package of new post-embargo instruments, and calls on the European Union Member States, the Council and the Commission to encourage the African Union and Africaâs regional bodies and to strengthen the arms control export requirements regionally and nationally in accordance with the standards of the European Unionâs code.
The need to make the code of conduct on arms exports legally binding is emphasised.
The Committee on Development would also like to draw attention to the need for a trade agreement on weapons to be in an internationally legally binding form.
I hope that the opinion of the Committee on Development, which has been put forward for the first time, is an important contribution and reaffirms the truth that security is the primary precondition for development.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, according to Operative Provision 8 of the code that we are examining, Parliament and the Council are obliged to re-examine this document every year.
It is a fundamental provision, which should in future become the main means of introducing amendments to the code.
It has already enabled us to improve the code, making it a dynamic instrument that can adapt from time to time to the problems and changes associated with the arms export trade in the European Union.
Suffice it to say that the ten new countries that have joined the European Union have been able to add their valuable contributions because of this review mechanism.
The most important development introduced by the sixth report concerns the possibility of transforming the code of conduct into a common position, thus making it legally binding.
The Council ought to start working towards this without delay, because a policy regulating arms exports, based on a legally binding common code, can play a key role in fighting terrorism and preventing conflicts.
The second welcome new element is the âtoolboxâ, intended for countries where an arms embargo has just been lifted.
In this respect, I think the report is right to emphasise the European Parliamentâs courageous stand against lifting the embargo on China until that country significantly improves its record on human rights and on civil, religious and political freedoms.
There are obviously some aspects of the report where we should have liked to see more tangible progress, for instance as regards information exchange and the denial notification system.
Nonetheless, the positive results achieved so far bode well for the future.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is unfortunate that it is at this late hour that we are debating a number of topics that are actually very important and certainly very urgent, namely the problems relating to the non-proliferation target and the non-proliferation treaty.
That is why I also regret the presidencyâs absence this evening, especially since the country currently holding the presidency of the European Union is also a recognised nuclear power.
Maybe the message could be passed on that the presidencyâs presence is very much wanted during debates of this kind.
There is once again a pressing need for campaigns aimed at stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
If anything, the number of states that have nuclear weapons appears to be growing, and that is setting a bad example to other countries and at the same time, as the Commissioner already said, there is a real and evident risk of terrorists getting hold of weapons of mass destruction or nuclear material.
The international framework must be reinforced as a matter of urgency in order to be able to face up to those risks.
Just now, though, we can perceive a trend towards settling disarmament matters outside of international frameworks.
This year, the international community, including Europe, has failed to adjust, revamp and strengthen the non-proliferation treaty, while the United States increasingly wants to pursue its own disarmament policy, particularly where the fight against the spread of nuclear weapons is concerned.
Both are highly detrimental to the credibility and effectiveness of the global non-proliferation regime that is still an essential pillar of our policy.
That is why it is of the utmost importance for us to counter this trend and get a better grip on the spread of not only weapons of mass destruction, but also of nuclear technology and nuclear chemical and biological material; the same applies, in fact, to the exports of conventional weapons.
The European Union will need to lead the way in terms of where the non-proliferation treaty is heading, but is also doing good work in many other areas, such as the recent proposal, or lobby, for an international arms export treaty.
At the same time, there are more contradictions in the international regime, which also involves European countries.
The recognised nuclear powers in the world have a particularly significant responsibility.
They exert most pressure on countries that want to break free from the international system, and at the same time, they consider modernising the nuclear arsenal, and one of them even refuses point blank to subscribe to the ban on nuclear tests.
Europe is one of the driving forces â that is another contradiction â behind the international non-proliferation regime.
One of the absolute priorities in the European Security Strategy is, under European guidance, to try to find a peaceful solution to the Iran issue; at the same time, we invest far less in the clearing of nuclear arsenals than the Americans.
The Kristovskis report is therefore right to call for increased financial backing for this political priority.
Finally, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament sets great store by the rule of international law.
In the Committee, we discussed at great length the paragraphs in the Kristovskis report on the use of violence to prevent non-proliferation, the spread of nuclear weapons.
We still think that the clause in the report does not do enough justice to our opinion about international rule of law and the role of the United Nations in this.
If those paragraphs remain unchanged and if Parliament decides tomorrow to back this clause, then I do not rule out an abstention from our group when we come to cast our final votes on this report.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like Mr Wiersma, I would have liked this debate to have been held at a rather more civilised hour, since it is one that I â as a member of both the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and also the Committee on Foreign Affairs â regard as particularly important.
We are all, of course, aware of the fact that the Member States currently evade the rules of the internal market where armaments are concerned by claiming, under Article 296 of the European Communities Treaty, an essential national interest in the procurement of new weapons systems, while not limiting this to real weapons systems, but practising it in the procurement of all types of military equipment.
Since it appears, on closer examination, that only some 4% are covered by Article 296, it is necessary to find a way of bringing about greater transparency in the award of the remaining 96% of public tenders.
The Commission has earned our gratitude by taking the initiative, and the reportâs rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, has argued in favour of the drafting of a communication interpreting Article 296 and of a directive on public contracts in areas with relevance to security.
Speaking on behalf of my group, I recommend endorsement of the report, although we do not want to exclude the option of a code of conduct as an additional instrument for creating greater transparency.
The advantages of a unified system of awarding contracts under the common European defence policy are obvious.
Europe currently spends some EURÂ 160Â billion on defence, and we must ensure greater efficiency in this; we owe it to the taxpayers to do so.
Vendors can achieve economies of scale if the quantity demanded is large enough, and so a considerable amount of tax revenue can be saved.
In cost-intensive research, too, a joint approach will become more and more important in the future.
It is also of the utmost importance that we should strive for uniform technical standards, thereby enabling troops from different states to carry out operations together, and far from the least important consideration is that shared defence structures help intensify political integration and make for greater solidarity in the European Union.
I therefore recommend that the House endorse the Green Paper, and also that all three proposed instruments for improving transparency be employed.
The Commission proposal goes in the right direction for achieving Europeâs strategic repositioning in security and defence policy, which is made necessary by the prospect of our external policy tasks being added to rather than being reduced in number.
We live in a new security environment, with new threats, terrorism, unstable states, conflicts over the sharing out of natural resources, religious and political fanaticism.
No EU Member State can face these challenges alone; âEuropeanisationâ must be the watchword.
Only a European Union with a single foreign policy, one that makes full use of its own capacities, sings from a single hymn sheet and has made structural fragmentation a thing of the past, will succeed in doing that.
The fact is that the cost of operations will rise, especially if the armaments market in the EU of 25 Member States continues to be fragmented.
What is needed to counteract that is better, more standardised policies, and they will also improve the interoperability of European troops, for that is an area in which there are still glaring differences.
We must aim to enable our troops to operate together.
According to Eurobarometer, two thirds of the European public are in favour of closer cooperation within the EU in security matters.
Our security depends on there being a functioning armaments market, and it is for that reason that we welcome the Commissionâs initiative and the rapporteurâs report.
I might also add that I believe that we should be having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to take this further opportunity to refer specifically to the report by Mr Kristovskis.
I believe that the issue of weapons of mass destruction genuinely deserves special attention, particularly in view of something that has already been said: if we want to have credibility on the international stage, particularly in this field, the European Union must begin to offer an example.
The report points clearly to the need to highlight the role of nuclear disarmament and to make a success of the demands of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
I believe that this is an issue on which we must increasingly insist.
Secondly, however, we must also remember another point: there are certain NATO countries, including the United Kingdom and France, which, ignoring the situation, are initiating what could be a new nuclear arms race.
We must warn that this constitutes a risk that must be reduced, and we must be consistent, from this point of view at least.
I would finally like to draw the attention of this House to one issue: the recent news that United States troops have used white phosphorous in the streets of Fallujah.
If this is the case, I believe that it is a clear violation of certain key principles that must be respected and which this report demands to be taken into account.
Â Â  . Mr President, you could say that, here in this House, the weapons come out at night.
On our order of business we find three reports: Mr Romeva Ã­ Ruedaâs on arms exports, Mr Kristovskisâ on weapons of mass destruction, and Mr Wuermelingâs on the European military equipment market.
There is plenty of explosive material in all three of them and they are interconnected.
My group takes a generally positive view of the report on arms exports, even though there is still room in it for improvements, such as more precise criteria, and even though considerations of peace policy of course make an outright ban on arms exports preferable from my point of view.
Let us not forget that the production, export and deployment of weapons go together and that there is no war without them.
Arms exports put peace at risk, and so it is all the more important that the code of conduct be at last made legally binding, which is what the report calls for, and which everyone here in this House would evidently welcome.
Mr Romeva has earned our gratitude by accepting an amendment from my group, which makes it possible for the code to be made legally binding also with regard to goods for dual use.
The European Armaments Agency, which has been in existence for a year now, is seen by armaments experts as not only promoting the export of weapons, but also as making monitoring and control that much more difficult, and that is why our amendment moves that this agency, which is claimed to be to do with defence, be abolished.
I would like to appeal in particular to my fellow Members from the Socialist and Green Groups in this House to join with the Left in bringing about the replacement of the Armaments Agency by an agency for the control of arms exports.
The Kristovskis report presents us with quite different issues.
It was actually meant to discuss the means whereby the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction might be combated, but what we have before us is a fire report, which views the Iraq war â a crime in international law â in a positive light.
I appeal to the House not to support this report â and not merely to abstain from voting, which is what we have just heard the Social Democrats recommending and not to endorse the amendments calling for a tougher line on Iran from the Europe of the Nations Group, to which MrÂ Kristovskis belongs.
I appeal to the conservatives in this House not to endorse an interpretation according to which Iran, where weapons of mass destruction are concerned has, for the past 17 years, done nothing but sown and reaped mistrust; that is just so not true.
The report appears to regard the war on Iraq as a blueprint for an attack on Iran, even though now not even the former Secretary of State Colin Powell asserts that Iraq actually possessed weapons of mass destruction at the time and is now ashamed of his performance before the UN Security Council.
When it comes to the Westâs weapons of mass destruction, the report is hypocritical in the manner customary in this House.
We therefore propose that the US nuclear weapons be required to be removed from European soil, that the French and British nuclear weapons be mothballed, and that Germany should once and for all renounce its potential for enriching uranium in its research reactor at Garching.
Turning to the last of the reports, I have to say to MrÂ Wuermeling that he asserts not only that our industry is not competitive on the international stage, but also, and at the same time, that there was no connection between the reports.
If competition is what it is all about, then that applies also to competition in export markets and that is why this Article 296 must go.
I regard this report on the military equipment industry as very frank and honest.
It is about close cooperation with NATO and the USA, and our group will be voting ânoâ to this report too.
Â Â  . Mr President, in these three reports we have another proliferation of crackpot ideas from the European Parliament, but they do show where this place and the European Union intend to head.
They call for the rejection of a new generation of nuclear weapons, for progressive and significant steps towards nuclear disarmament by Britain and France and for the harmonisation of arms exports â all this when the world is growing more dangerous and not less so.
The incompetent left-wing utopian dreamers who predominantly make up this deeply stupid and corrupt place do enough damage with their legislative efforts without meddling in defence issues.
National governments might one day, eventually, be able to undo the EUâs idiotic policies on agriculture, fishing, commerce and finance, but if the EU manages to take control of defence there may be consequences that cannot be undone.
All these reports are building blocks for a common European security and defence policy.
This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that a harmonised defence procurement policy appears in one of these reports, despite being an element of the failed European Constitution.
Britainâs armed forces are being merged into a European army.
Britain is sleep-walking towards the day when we will wake up and find that we have no independent military and defence capabilities.
If the day ever dawns when Britainâs national defences are controlled by the European Union, then God help us.
Yes, may He help us, you bunch of buffoons.
Â Â  Mr President, I feel deeply offended by the previous speaker.
I do not know why he was allowed to continue to say those absurdities to this House and to us.
I feel personally offended and I ask you to take action.
Â Â  It was my personal problem if I thanked the previous speaker.
I promise to refer the matter to the Bureau for a decision.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, wars are often waged under the cover of darkness.
It is a sign of the times that the fight for peace is also being waged by the Members of this Parliament at night.
Military spending reached USDÂ 956Â billion two years ago, and last year the figure topped USDÂ 1Â trillion.
We are witnessing the return of record levels of spending last seen during the Cold War.
Military expenditure is increasing by around 10-11% per year, which equates to a fully-fledged arms race.
The proverb has it that, âif you want peace, prepare for warâ, but we must ask ourselves whether this is the right response to the problems of the 21st century.
Is it not the case, as the Vatican representative said at the 59th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, that âincreased reliance on guns â large and small â is leading the world away from, not towards, securityâ?
We should support the UN initiative to build a culture of peace, and promote the civilisation of love advocated by Pope John PaulÂ II.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, MinisterÂ Kristovskis, for having drafted a sensible report that is based on a compromise.
The paragraph concerning the risk of proliferation of Cold War stockpiles of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons is of particular significance, as is the reference to the ban on nuclear weapons tests in space, which was adopted 38Â years ago.
I should like to conclude by saying that our emphasis on the fact that even a justified use of military force must comply with the UN Charter, and be preceded by the use of all possible political and diplomatic means, is to be welcomed.
The European Parliament cannot work wonders, but it may well be in a position today to give peace a somewhat better chance.
Â Â  Mr President, there are three important reports we are debating in this Chamber this evening.
As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in connection with the report on weapons of mass destruction, I think that the report is sound, robust and well-balanced.
It is a very comprehensive report, but the subject too is, of course, very important.
The rapporteur has done a sterling job.
In the period in which we live, in which the threat comes not from the Cold War but from rogue states and terrorist organisations, it is crucial that monitoring should take place of who possesses these weapons and crucial that the latter should not fall into the wrong hands.
We neither can nor should get rid of our nuclear weapons, which form a part of NATOâs defence strategy and which are one of the reasons why the Cold War remained cold.
We must, however, constantly work to ensure that countries that must not have nuclear weapons give up developing them.
Obviously, I am thinking particularly, in this case, of Iran and of the problems in relation to North Korea.
We must also work to ensure that countries that possess nuclear weapons illegally, that is to say Pakistan, India and Israel, sign up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Means must be linked to ends.
If the EUâs strategy for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is to continue to have some clout, it will be necessary to give priority to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and, especially, to give high priority to this particular area in the future too.
I should like, finally, to say how very pleased I was with MrÂ Romevaâs report.
Specifically, I am delighted that Parliament is united in recommending that the arms embargo against China not be lifted.
Let us each individually work to ensure that this also remains the attitude of our respective countriesâ governments.
Â Â  â According to a recent US Congress report, arms contracts to developing countries signed by the four main European exporters in 2004 totalled just under USDÂ 5Â billion.
This is a fivefold increase on the 2003 figure.
This will serve to hinder development by fostering the proliferation of conflicts in Africa and possibly in other continents, too.
Against this backdrop, strict and effective rules on arms exports are required, now more than ever.
Europe cannot promote construction with development aid with one hand, whilst causing destruction, via the unregulated export of conventional arms, with the other.
It is for this reason that we believe, in common with the excellent Romeva report, that the code of conduct must be made legally binding as a matter of urgency.
Along with the Commissioner, we welcome the Councilâs decision to fight for a proper universal Treaty at the UN containing common rules on the global armaments trade.
The arms embargo on China, a country that has repeatedly threatened Taiwan, must not be lifted until China has been held to account for the detention and disappearance of those involved in Tiananmen, and has improved its human rights record as a whole.
The Wuermeling report contains an aspect that is key to the future of the common European defence and external policy project, and this is reflected in Amendment 6 tabled by my Group.
No world power has completely open defence equipment markets; the United States protects its defence companies with a âBuy American Actâ.
We have a great deal to learn from our American friends.
European preference must be introduced when it comes to the Member Statesâ defence procurement.
This is essential if we are to ensure the survival of a sector that makes a significant contribution to the Lisbon Strategy, to technological innovation and to the Unionâs strategic autonomy.
Let us not be naÃ¯ve and delude ourselves: aeroplanes are not bananas and tanks are not refrigerators.
Let us not treat this subject as though it were a simple question of markets.
Parliament must take the lead in what is, more than anything, a political and strategic debate, and what we are proposing is a first step in that direction.
Lastly, I turn to the report by Mr Kristovskis, which I also welcome.
I feel that it is not possible to have a coherent and effective non-proliferation strategy while the five authorised nuclear-weapon states, including two EU Member States, fail to honour their undertakings to disarm gradually, under Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and continue either to neglect, or take action against, nuclear powers such as Israel, India and Pakistan that are not signatories to the NPT.
This is all the more serious when, in addition to other countries, non-state actors or terrorists seek to get their hands on illegal weaponry.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the most dangerous weapon of mass destruction is the nuclear bomb.
This bomb, this weapon, has been used twice by the USA, killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in a split second.
It has also been used by Britain, France, Russia and China in nuclear tests, causing immense environmental damage.
These countries, along with Israel, India and Pakistan, belong to the fearful nuclear club of eight that holds the whole world to ransom.
They terrorise the entire international community with their warmongering irresponsibility, threatening each other with deadly nuclear games of annihilation, and they violently insult our intelligence by trying to force upon us their view that nuclear suicide is a form of deterrence.
The governments of these countries, using a logic intelligible only to single-minded warlords ready to sacrifice the whole of humanity in their quest for short-term economic profit, are spending astronomical amounts of money in building a nuclear arsenal capable of destroying the world many times over â and all that we can manage to do is to pass resolutions on ineffective strategies calling for non-proliferation.
Why do not we call loudly and clearly on the nuclear bomb countries to get rid of their stockpiles of weapons now?
Why do we tolerate in our European Community nuclear-bomb disaster countries like Britain and France?
Why do we not pass resolutions or take measures against these two countries?
And why should a small country like mine, Cyprus, live with the threat of a nuclear disaster because Britain wants to store, against our wishes, nuclear bombs in its colonial British bases on the island?
The answer is, in my view, shamefully simple: we lack political courage.
So, we choose to be hypocrites instead â and life goes on as usual.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in his report, MrÂ Wuermeling maintains that the discussion is not about foreign, security or defence policy in general, but only about the procurement of goods and services.
However, there is of course a link between defence procurement and defence policy.
Together with the setting up of the European Defence Agency, a common market for defence procurement is a further stage in the military rearmament eagerly welcomed by the European defence industry.
On the pretext of increased economic efficiency and a reduced burden for European taxpayers, the rapporteur argues in favour of harmonisation and standardisation in accordance with accepted NATO standards.
If that is not a contribution to the debate on defence policy, I do not know what, in fact, it is.
For me, it is clearly about increased and intensified militarisation.
Using George Orwellâs newspeak, I could say that war has become peace.
Instead of all the talk about increased resources for research and development into new weapons, the EU and the Member States should invest their resources in research into peacemaking and conflict resolution.
I believe that this is something that the EU really must do.
It is through disarmament and demilitarisation that we build peace, not through further militarisation and the acquisition of more weapons.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, on the one hand, the great powers, such as Russia, are downsizing their weapons arsenals, while, on the other, the number of states and, alas, criminal organisations who possess the know-how needed to manufacture weapons of mass destruction is on the increase.
We know that, in 2004 alone, secret services across the globe recorded over 300 instances of illegal handling of nuclear material.
The more widespread the necessary know-how, the more difficult it becomes to get at it by conventional methods.
The war in Iraq and the silence in the face of North Korea have given not a few governments the impression that nuclear armament alone is sufficient to deter military interventions.
It is the possession of nuclear weapons by countries such as Israel that leads others, such as Iran, to believe that they have to develop their own, thus heightening the risk of such weapons getting into the hands of terrorists, and what is called for is rigorous action to counteract this development.
It will certainly send out a powerful message if we can tighten up the code of conduct for arms sales and thereby prevent EU Member States selling weapons to third states that then use them on their own peoples or for the purposes of aggression directed at other states.
This code of conduct must not, however, be some kind of toothless tiger, or else we will not only be putting at risk the security of innumerable people but also exposing ourselves to ridicule.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, if you ask me, todayâs debate is a missed opportunity.
Firstly, regarding the time of day, this debate was actually scheduled to take place at 11Â a.m. today in the presence of the Council. It is now taking place at nearly midnight, after an undoubtedly fascinating debate on trapping standards for certain animal species.
Secondly, the heading is incorrect.
It is not arms that are at issue here, but the European Security and Defence Policy.
If, for example, we were to discuss our course of action regarding Iran, this would not be a matter of arms, but of politics.
Thirdly, I very much regret the absence of the Council, as the defining element of the European Security and Defence Policy is the close dovetailing of civilian and military crisis management.
This can only be achieved through joint action between the Commission and the Council, and I know how difficult that is.
How are we to discuss these issues if the Council is not even present?
Another reason why this is a missed opportunity is that the field of security and defence, in particular, presents great opportunities.
Even in the presence of a founding father of the European Constitution such as MrÂ Brok, I would venture to say that the Constitution is currently at a standstill.
We are currently at a standstill on the financial issues, too.
What is not at a standstill, however, is the further development of the European Security and Defence Policy, as just recently the European Defence Agency was brought to fruition.
This had only been envisaged in the draft Constitution, of course, and is already a reality.
We have assumed responsibility for security in BosniaâHerzegovina; there are troops there under European command.
The mutual defence commitment, which had also first been envisaged in the draft Constitution, is now a reality.
That means that we are making progress in this field, and I am convinced that we are on the path to a European Security and Defence Union, which is also our common objective.
This is not a debate that should be conducted in camera, as we are doing this evening.
I should also like to say a few words to my colleague MrÂ Lambsdorff.
I think that Strasbourg is the right place for this debate, as it is the seat of the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by adding my voice to MrÂ Matsakisâs protest.
During my twenty years in this Parliament, I have never seen a Member behave with such disdain towards this institution and its Members.
I would therefore ask that effective action be taken against that Member, so that there may be no further incidents such as that one.
As Mr von Wogau has said, this is not a debate about arms; it is a broader debate, it is a debate on common foreign and security policy, although I will only be able to comment on the report by Mr Wuermeling, on defence procurement.
I believe that the Commission is right to point out that Article 296 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which currently represents a constitutional obstacle to the development of what we may call a European defence market, may to a certain extent be overcome on the basis of the judgments of the Court of Justice in recent cases, such as the Johnston case, or the case of the Commission against Spain, of 1997.
Constitutional restrictions remain however.
That is to say, in the field of foreign and defence policy, there is still a high degree of state sovereignty.
In this field, therefore, we must act very prudently, from legal and political points of view.
Until the European Constitution is adopted, which I hope can be done soon, we will have to make do with the legal instruments we have, and there is little we can do with those instruments, but I am very pleased that the Commission is gearing its work, firstly towards a Communication and, possibly, towards a proposal for a Directive, as Mr Wuermeling suggests.
We must, however, be prudent from a political point of view, because the objective of a common European defence market cannot be to transform the European Union into a military industrial complex, as in the case of certain foreign powers.
Arms are dangerous.
I have some military training; what surprised me was that, most of the time, I was not being taught to kill, but rather to protect myself against arms.
Arms are not toys.
We cannot use them, for example, for economic or industrial development.
The purpose of arms must be to protect the European citizens and also to protect those friendly, peaceful and democratic nations that need them for their own defence, but not to do business with them or to turn Europe into a kind of enormous industrial market place which, at the end of the day, will come back to haunt us.
I believe that the Commissionâs proposals are positive, that these proposals will lead to the creation of that common defence market, but that the common defence market must be an instrument for achieving peace in Europe and also peace throughout the world.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the report shows the Unionâs commitment to making the multilateral agreements on non-proliferation and against the development of new-generation weapons universally applicable.
The report calls for sanctions to be applied to countries that do not comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540.
Nonetheless, although it is a fact that the European Union Member States are signatories to the multilateral non-proliferation agreements, it is also a fact that two Member States are nuclear states, that Turkey, a candidate country for accession, is a nuclear state and that, even more seriously, US tactical weapons are deployed on the soil of many Member States, including Germany, Italy, Greece and the Netherlands.
The hundred points of the resolution being examined say very little about Israel, India and Pakistan, which have not signed the non-proliferation treaty.
With regard to the civilian nuclear programme in Iran, however, the legitimate economic and regional security interests of that great country are ignored and its government is called upon to supply verifiable guarantees as to the peaceful nature of every one of its nuclear programmes.
This is a ridiculous resolution, which would even have the European Union and NATO persuade the United States administration to give up its programmes.
It also welcomes the huge sums of European taxpayersâ money â hundreds of millions of euro â that are to be spent on the strategy to reduce weapons of mass destruction.
The proposed report is an utter travesty of good sense and is therefore totally unacceptable.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the three rapporteurs, MrÂ Wuermeling, MrÂ RomevaÂ iÂ Rueda and MrÂ Kristovskis, have addressed important fields that need to be considered together to a much greater extent, rather than in three separate reports like this, as they are only outwardly contradictory, and are in actual fact connected.
We live in a world in which the threat posed by terrorists, who could also potentially come by dirty weapons, is more dangerous now than ever before.
Assuming that Iran cannot be prevented from producing nuclear weapons â it is already producing rockets with a range of 3Â 000Â km â we shall have a region that extends over Iran, Pakistan, India, China and Russia: one large region â the largest in the world â that is in possession of nuclear weapons.
We have to consider how to guarantee our security as a small corner of the world.
This can only be done via collective security within the transatlantic alliance, which also means that Europe cannot leave this alliance, as that would mean we were susceptible to blackmail: on various grounds and by various regions of the world.
Secondly, we have to make clear that only by producing our own arms will we, too, be in a position to set a course in industrial policy, that this will create jobs, and also that it will give us independence because, if this industrial-policy approach is not open to us and we do not have our own arms industry, we shall be reliant on purchases of additional arms from other regions of the world.
This will make us constantly susceptible to blackmail, since we cannot do what we want or, consequently, make a contribution to our own security.
At the least, it will be very much more expensive, because we shall not be making use of the synergies that this European approach provides.
The European Union and the Commission need to be given more money for research and other fields, therefore, to ensure that we are in a position to guarantee our own security and to form alliances whilst having independence and immunity to blackmail.
All of this must be integrated into a code of conduct, which would lend credibility to our fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
In my view, this code of conduct should be legally binding.
Yet more desirable in my opinion would be the deletion of the Treaty derogation exempting arms exports, unlike all other trade, from the competence of the Commission â which is one of the weak points both with regard to control and with regard to the capacity for action of the European Union as a whole.
The relevant approaches to this should be sought.
Therefore â in order to save money, guarantee the security of our citizens and at the same time ensure a more peaceful world â I would invite us to increase the focus on this.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I welcome the report on the code of conduct and arms sales and draw to the Houseâs attention the fact that many of the demands we made in our previous annual debates on this subject have been realised: in particular the new trade regulation on torture equipment, the common position on brokering, and the new obligation to stop exports if there is a risk to international humanitarian law.
Most of all I welcome this yearâs commitment to make the code legally binding.
Could the Commissioner comment tonight on the fact that practice sometimes falls short?
Why is it that Austria, Luxembourg and Greece, for example, do not produce their annual reports?
This year information has been published that shows that France has exported bombs and grenades to Burma and Sudan, and Italy has exported firearms to China and to Colombia?
Will she comment on the position of our arms exports to Colombia, a country where there is now ample evidence of human rights abuse by the Colombian military?
Many speakers tonight and some of the amendments have referred to the UK position.
I am proud that my own country, in its previous Presidency, oversaw the agreement of the EU code of conduct on arms sales and in this Presidency has overseen agreement by the European Union, for the first time, to support an international arms trade treaty.
We take seriously our obligations as a nuclear weapons power.
The UK Government has reduced the stockpile of nuclear warheads by more than 70%, has reduced the number of warheads on each Trident submarine, from 94Â toÂ 48, and has dismantled all of the WE-177 nuclear bombs.
At the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference on 5Â May the British Government spokesman said: âwe recognise that we have particular obligations as a nuclear weapons state under ArticleÂ 6 of the Treaty.
We reaffirm our unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmamentâ.
Like everyone else here tonight, I share the concerns about the failure to come to a strong consensus as an outcome of the NPT conference earlier this year.
But I believe it is wrong to for us to focus on individual countries, whether it be the UK or France.
We should ensure that all nations undertake their obligations under that Treaty.
We should welcome the fact that there was an EU-agreed common position in advance of the NPT review conference and take up the mantle of issues, where we, as the EU, should take a lead, such as withdrawal from the Treaty, the universalisation of rigorous safeguard standards through the IAEA additional protocol, and also the question of the transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technologies.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Commissioner, in discussing defence matters we are entering into important and sensitive areas of national sovereignty.
Many of us feel that the EUâs defence ambitions are wholly misplaced.
If you want to empower the European Union as a global actor or if you believe in an integrated European State or, indeed, a European Defence Union, as we heard earlier, then you will have a different view.
We are opposed to EU meddling in defence, both in principle and in terms of its practical consequences.
However, we recognise that there are areas in which a multilateral approach can be beneficial, and this is particularly true in relation to non-proliferation and arms export controls.
Turning firstly to defence procurement, the Wuermeling report is driven by a very strong integrationist impulse.
It even poses the question, in paragraphÂ 12, as to âwhat extent any meaningful distinction at all can still be drawn between national and common European security interestsâ.
Certainly the report seeks to entrench the European Commissionâs role in defence procurement and wants such matters dealt with under EU rather than national legislation.
We already have a situation where the British defence procurement market is open to foreign competition in a way in which the market in France, for example, is not.
We see British defence companies â important national strategic assets â being taken over by foreign firms.
While British Conservatives are most supportive of measures to strengthen a genuine single market in most sectors, defence should continue to be the exception and should be safeguarded.
On the subject of WMD, we attach enormous importance to combating proliferation and to strengthening the security of component materials.
At the same time, the UKâs independent nuclear deterrent force continues to be a vital element of our defence strategy and one which has not lost relevance in spite of the changed security environment in which we live.
The British Government must not only take the necessary decisions to maintain our nuclear capability; it must also be prepared to adapt our weapons and the doctrine for their use.
On the subject of arms exports, while we welcome calls for better verification of the end-use of exported goods and the maintenance of the arms embargo on China, we continue, however, to have difficulty with the idea of a legally binding code of conduct.
This would extend judicial authority into areas that are more properly the preserve of government and would further extend the reach of EU institutions, including the European Court of Justice.
Tonight we have a dangerous mixture under discussion.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, let me start by saying a few words to MrÂ Batten.
It was interesting listening to this speech by a representative of a list of candidates that also includes two people who, in very quick succession, have been publicly found guilty of abusing the secretarial assistance allowance in recent weeks.
We should intensify our offensive against this band of hypocrites in this House and in our public-relations activities.
Now to come to the point.
It does not make sense for various companies in three major EU Member States to work on the Unmanned Air Vehicle project, for example, in separate projects that have nothing to do with one another, and to duplicate earnings, as it were.
The European taxpayer does not deserve this.
Nor does it make sense for three major EU Member States to develop, separately from one other, electronic identification systems for infantrymen, and for there to be insufficient clarity as to whether troops from one and the same European battle group, for example, could identify each other in action if they came from different countries.
We should also bear in mind that even in 10 yearsâ time the armies in the EU will still have to use 23Â different types of armoured vehicle.
We can all imagine the kind of compatibility and supply problems that would entail in operational conditions.
I should also like to warn against one illusion, however: a single European Defence Equipment Market cannot be achieved if enterprises operating under market conditions have to compete with those that are government-backed.
This is an aspect that has not yet been raised in todayâs debate, and I should also like to suggest that it might make sense for MrÂ Wuermeling to take a closer look at this implication of the debate on ArticleÂ 296 and draw conclusions from it for the future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission Green Paper and the Wuermeling report, in particular, respond to the wishes of the population: the European public.
The publicâs answer to the question as to what objectives the EU should set itself is that it should become a Security and Defence Union.
When the public is asked what it wants, its reply is: a common foreign policy represented by one face and one person, not 25 vested national interests.
When we look at how the security environment has changed, we do have to ask ourselves the question whether each Member State alone is capable of ensuring sufficient security given the general atmosphere prevailing and the present financial situation of the Member States.
The answer is ânoâ.
That is why we need more Europe in this field, not necessarily more money. If, however, we need more Europe but do not have any additional money, we must change our behaviour somewhat.
We want a common foreign and security policy, we want the evolution of the EU into a political union, we want a strong internal market and we want to reduce our dependence on the United States.
What needs to be done, therefore?
We need common European technological standards in this field, to enable and strengthen cooperation.
We need to create common defence structures, which are important as regards enhanced political cooperation, integration and solidarity.
Of course, in view of the maxim âmore Europe, but not more moneyâ, we need to make more efficient use of defence resources, increase the competitiveness of the European Union, improve military equipment and reduce costs, increase the European dimension in the field of equipment and training, improve cooperation and thus help increase efficiency.
This debate has shown that we need to increase the European dimension; which may also explain the absence of the Council, because although the large Member States, in particular â I am thinking here of the United Kingdom and France â talk a great deal about common ground, they rank among the stumbling blocks on the path to a stronger Commission in this field.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the safety of workers and citizens must be guaranteed in defence manufacturing processes, and the companies themselves must operate as efficiently as possible.
Clear rules on defence procurement are therefore required.
European citizens must be made aware of the importance of having modern and efficient defence firms, within the innovative SME structure, working with technology for civil or military use.
Moreover, there must be strategic coordination of existing defence companies in various Member States, with the European Agency acting as one of the focal points for technological innovation and for perfecting the products and processes of European firms working in defence-related sectors.
In any event, we must never allow a military-industrial complex to be set up in the Unionâs Europe which would restrict political powers, the kind of complex whose powerful influence General Eisenhower bemoaned when he left the US Presidency.
Contracts must be transparent.
Clear and transparent rules on defence procurement can help a great deal in this regard.
Otherwise, the market will become concentrated on these companies, thereby, in practice, blocking free competition in the European internal market.
There is similarly an urgent need to encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to take part, as far as possible, in the defence industryâs global manufacturing process.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should like to conclude by saying that the EU needs to maintain constant links between its external policy and the rules on international trade, with particular regard to embargoes.
In the future, nobody will understand why defence companies in the EU would support the outbreak of unjust wars or prop up dictatorial regimes.
This is not what Europe was originally set up to do and nor is it what the EU should be doing.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeking to make history by dismantling the established practices of Member States as regards the armaments trade.
The Green Paper on defence procurement and any future directive therefore require strong political backing, as they will need to penetrate the hermetically sealed environment of the European defence market.
The aim is no less than to impose far-reaching restrictions on derogations from the general rules of economic competition â Article 296 of the Treaty enables Member States to use and abuse the derogation system â and a number of national monopolies have been profiting from this at the citizensâ expense.
The defence market is practically sealed off behind purpose-built barriers and dominated by monopolies, and it is difficult to monitor it, since secrecy is maintained even where there is no security reason for doing so.
The lack of transparency when it comes to public procurement, fragmented research programmes and inadequate standardisation lead to low quality and poor interoperability, and in turn to ineffective national defence systems.
There is, therefore, ample justification for opening up the EURÂ 160Â billion defence market, not least because most Member States are finding it hard to honour their obligations as regards NATO defence policy.
If the Commissionâs proposal obtains the support of all 25 Member States, they should be expected to work together on innovative strategies, to cut costs and to create fresh opportunities for businesses, not only large corporations, but also small and medium-sized manufacturers and suppliers of logistics equipment.
The fundamental condition for the opening up of the defence market, however, both for myself and for a number of Members of this House, is to ensure that the EU Code of Conduct on Exports of Military Equipment is rigorously complied with.
My call for compliance with this Code was incorporated into the text of the report, with the aim of cracking down on the illicit export of arms from advanced democracies to developing countries.
This is an essential prerequisite and I call on the Commission to ensure that monitoring is made as easy as possible.
My view is based on the salutary experience of an armaments deal that took place in the Czech Republic 10Â years ago.
I am deeply dismayed that the Council has failed to be present today.
Â Â  Mr President, I too wish to express my concern at what Mr Batten said, and urge that action be taken to have him withdraw those insulting remarks relating to Members of this House.
Commissioner, the European Code on Arms Exports has a number of shortcomings, the most glaring of which is the fact that it is not legally binding.
There is also, however, a need for clarification of the language and the application of the code.
There is a need for its scope to be broadened, and indeed there is a need for greater transparency and accessibility of information in relation to, in particular, the annual reports and the denial notifications.
A number of Members have mentioned that some EU Member States are actually in breach of the code, while declaring themselves determined to prevent the export of equipment which might be used for internal repression or international aggression, or indeed contribute to regional instability.
They have allowed arms and security equipment to be transferred for illicit end use.
Finally, on 20Â September, in reply to a question I put to you, you indicated that you intend to draft a communication on small arms and light weapons before the end of 2006.
Might I suggest that it would be more appropriate to have that communication published and debated in this House before the middle of next year, which is in fact when the United Nations are holding a conference on small arms and light weapons.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this late hour, we are debating whether we need military technology in Europe, and what we can do to bring about a European common foreign and security policy.
First of all, on the subject of something my fellow Members on the other side of the House have called into question, I should like to say â and in so doing explicitly agree with my colleague MrÂ Brok â that the reason that the European Union needs military technology is that we Europeans cannot be dependent on third parties or leave ourselves open to blackmail when it comes to our security.
Some fellow Members have also mentioned that the European public expects increased common action among the Member States in the field of foreign and security policy.
There have already been a few successes in this regard: the mission in Bosnia mentioned earlier is only one of many accomplishments.
However, if we are quite honest, we have to say that there is still a long way to go before we have a genuinely common foreign and security policy such as that envisaged by the public.
That is why I expressly welcome the fact that the Commissionâs proposal in the form of its Green Paper on the Defence Equipment Market, and the report by my colleague MrÂ Wuermeling, point in the right direction.
Through the common rules for procuring military defence equipment, they oblige the Member States to take an important step towards the development of common defence structures and towards stronger political integration.
The increased efficiency that will result with regard to the considerable expenditure on defence will automatically produce further unification of the European market and thus explicitly benefit the taxpayer.
I should like to express some views on the form this common code of conduct could take.
Back inÂ 1958, the Commission developed materials and regulations that could be used as a basis for shaping ArticleÂ 296.
Unfortunately, to date these have never been published or used, but it would certainly be worth having a look at what was considered important at that time.
The creation of a code of conduct must ensure that decisions by the European Armaments Agency on the one hand and the Commission on the other do not contradict each other.
In this regard, the achievement of optimum coordination between the Commission and the European Defence Agency should be ensured.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to use this debate as an opportunity to highlight the impact that small arms and light weapons are having on the human rights of so many people.
It is not the so-called weapons of mass destruction that are currently causing the vast majority of tragedies and conflicts across the globe.
It should perhaps be small arms and light weapons that are considered to be the weapons causing the most mass destruction.
I am impressed with and support the report before us on EU arms exports and I want to congratulate the rapporteur for the job that he has done.
The EU voluntary code of conduct has had some success in ensuring standards.
However, the end goal must be to bring about an acceptance for a legally binding code and this Parliament should be consistent in calling for that.
Time and time again, the EU is happy to take the high moral ground on human rights issues and on calling for adherence to international standards and law.
We must show leadership and lead by example on the trade in arms to have credibility to bring about change outside the Union in arms trade standards.
We should not fear a legally binding code but see it as an opportunity for the EU as regards raising standards in arms export policy.
The four major EU arms suppliers have dramatically increased their share of arms sales to the developing world in the last year.
In 2004, USDÂ 4.8Â billion of business was done, which is more than 22% of total arms sales.
When one considers that almost half a million people are killed every year by small arms, then the significance of the small arms trade becomes clear.
I support the concept of the creation of a so-called blacklist of countries that should not have arms sold to them from the EU.
The criteria for such a list should be applied equally, however, on a set of standards based on human rights violations and instability.
Finally, I want to urge the Commission to use all opportunities available to it to promote an acceptance for an international small arms treaty in order to move forward a common standard approach for arms sales internationally.
Too many rogue states, irresponsible governments, military dictators and gangland-style leaders have easy access to weapons that are used to brutal and corrupt effect, resulting in a spiral of demand for small arms and light weapons in the many small-scale conflicts that persist.
The fact that the developed world continues to tolerate the sale of weapons to such people should be a cause for serious and continuing concern in this House.
Â Â  .
Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the fact that here in Parliament, during the course of debates on my report, certain differences of opinion have arisen, and in order to find a compromise, I propose certain changes to paragraph 34.Â Thus, after the words âtakes noteâ the following would be inserted:
â... as stated by Hans Blix, that the credible threat of the use of force has played an important role in facilitating the disarmament work of UNSCOM and UNMOVIC.â
After that I would like to delete the rest of the paragraph.
I believe that this proposal will enable also the socialists, who said that they would abstain, to vote for this paragraph.
Â Â  Thank you, but you will have to bring that up as an oral amendment during the vote tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, even though it is late I think it was a very interesting discussion.
I agree that this discussion could have been much broader.
We have spoken on rather specific topics, but some of you have said very clearly that there are many more dimensions, taking in a common foreign and security policy and a common security and defence policy.
I shall now make a few specific remarks.
Firstly, on arms exports, the Commission can only agree with the substance of the discussion today.
We are probably already one of the regional actors with the strictest arms controls in the world, but progress has to continue, to strengthen the rules and their implementation.
Making the code of conduct a common position will be a major step at European Union level.
In fact the code of conduct on exports of military equipment that was adopted in 1998 contains many common criteria against which applications for export licences are assessed.
As is stated in the code of conduct, the decision to transfer or deny a transfer is at the discretion of individual Member States and the Commission is therefore not in a position to comment on alleged circumventions of the code of conduct with regard to any country.
I say that specifically regarding the question on Colombia.
One of the most important criteria is always the human rights question.
It is one criterion among others, such as regional peace, security and stability, but it is for the Member States to comment on that issue.
A reinforced code of conduct which has already been finalised at technical level and which will be introduced at an appropriate moment will increase the scope of controls.
The reinforced code of conduct will go beyond physical exports of goods and technology.
It will include brokering and transfer of intangible technology, and it will also contain more explicit language on reverse engineering and on unintended technology transfer.
Moreover, the criterion on human rights will be further strengthened.
The European Union is now trying to come up with an arms trade treaty. This is at the instigation of the British Presidency.
Such a treaty on conventional weapons would be based on statesâ existing responsibilities under international law and would establish transfer criteria that are consistent with internationally accepted standards of human rights and humanitarian law.
It should be legally binding, be a separate and self-standing initiative, cover all conventional arms transfers, set out the principles defining illegal transfers, include monitoring, and be broadly based.
On weapons of mass proliferation, it is now two years since we developed a fully fledged strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Commitments have been made both by the European Union and the G8 global partnership.
In this context, it is critical to ensure that financial means will be available for the future.
The combination of the CFSP and Community tools would allow the European Union to maintain better visibility and also more credibility.
However, a lot has to be done, as I said earlier, for instance, within the framework of the United Nations, where we were very disappointed at the last negotiations on weapons of mass destruction.
On the third issue â defence procurement â let me again thank all of you, and the rapporteur in particular, who supported this report and therefore the proposals put forward by the Commission.
The political sensitivity of this file cannot, and should not, be underestimated.
However, I agree with Mr Wuermeling when he points out that it mainly concerns the internal market.
The report correctly focuses on this issue and on the objectives that are pursued by the Commission with its initiatives.
As I have said, more efficient public spending on defence will contribute to the prosperity of the Union, because it means that taxpayersâ money could be reduced.
This will be done within the limits of our Community competence and also in full respect for the prerogatives and the sovereignty of our Member States.
As usual, we will continue to work very closely with the European Defence Agency, as suggested in the Wuermeling report.
I am glad that the Commission and Parliament share the same views, not only on the objectives to be pursued but also on the measures to achieve them.
In conclusion, let me say that I am looking forward to discussing these and other questions again, in the high-level interparliamentary conference in early December in Brussels.
I also thank Mr Brok and Mr von Wogau for this initiative. It is highly welcome.
Perhaps we could also pursue a more security-oriented policy, which has been lacking so far.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  , The European Unionâs approach to weapons of mass destruction has been defined, and now we also have to convince other peoples of its validity.
The EU must prevent the failure of future conferences on the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and it must necessarily strive for all countries to sign the treaty, for the treaty to be obeyed, and for the inspection mechanisms to be reinstated, with the full support of the UN authorities and with the aid of sanctions where necessary.
We call for a more forceful strategy, involving all EU Member States, that severely sanctions activities that contribute to proliferation and reinforces the ban on chemical and biological weapons.
The strategy must involve the European Parliament more closely, so as to impose a code to regulate arms exports as well as clearer rules on defence procurement.
We also stress the need for a moratorium on impoverished uranium munitions.
The European Parliamentâs determined stand against the use of weapons of mass destruction is due to the awareness that such use causes not only the loss of human lives, but above all the erosion of those ethical values â the common heritage of the peoples of the European Union â that underlie our history and inspire the present and future existence of our Community.
Â Â  We are going to have a very long and complex vote on REACH.
In fact, I have been told that this is one of the longest and most complex votes in the history of this House.
The services that have prepared the vote, as well as the technical staff of the political groups, have done outstanding work in preparing the vote.
I should like to congratulate them.
In principle I believe we can get through this vote in not more than three hours, but in order to do that I must ask two things of you: first, please remain silent and concentrate throughout the vote âŠ
and second, please raise your hands.
Please.
The vote will be long and I understand that you will get tired, but please raise your hands when we vote.
Here we go.
Good luck.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that a large number of people are still signing, so I think it probably be best if we waited for another couple of minutes, and in that time, I would like to say that the main entrance to the Parliament building has been closed for two months now.
As a result, I, for one, have suffered a bad fall and have sustained a fracture.
I would like to ask you to instruct the relevant department to ensure that the entrance area is made safe again.
We want chemicals to be handled with care, but the same care should apply where the safety of the people here is concerned.
Â Â  We have noted your request.
Â Â  Mr President, I should just like to call the Bureauâs attention to one matter.
At the beginning of this week, I discovered my name on 18 amendments that I had not seen and that I had definitely not signed.
What is more, I did not share the views expressed in these amendments.
I hope that nothing similar will happen again because it caused a host of problems when I needed to explain that I did not support these amendments at all.
Â Â  Mr Andersson, your comment shall now appear in the Minutes and in the voting list, and you may therefore rest assured that the matter is clear.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would just ask that, following the vote on all the amendments, we have a five-minute break in which to find out what has been adopted and to decide whether to vote in favour of the proposal or against it, or else abstain from voting in the end.
Â Â  Granted, Mr Bonde.
Â Â  Mr President, the proposal is that the following be added at the end of Amendment 356: âhighly-diffused inorganic substances or substances on which there is sufficient risk information, such as sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium oxide, gold, silver, aluminium, magnesium, silicates, glasses and ceramic fritsâ.
In other words, it concerns substances on which information is already available.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in actual fact, I had requested to speak fearing that the vote on the amendments would have had a different outcome.
Instead, it seems to me that the vote has been very positive and has made the regulation more balanced.
Furthermore, I believe that, also as regards the parts on which we voted in favour of a decidedly very strong position, such as the part relating to authorisation, the conditions have been created to achieve convergence with the Council as soon as possible.
In the debate the day before yesterday on all of the key chapters, the Council demonstrated that there is a strong possibility of convergence between what we are preparing to vote on â and I am hoping for a positive final outcome â and what has taken shape in the Councilâs work.
Â Â  . Mr President, it appears to me that we have secured a victory in respect of registration, which accounts for the lionâs share of red tape, but we have suffered a defeat with regard to the granting of licences, or authorisation, which was not helped by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe not lending a hand.
Unfortunate though that is, I know that the British Presidency will be very cooperative on that score.
I also know that on account of the narrow majorities, we have lost at least the key topics by ten or so votes only.
I also know that at second reading, this House will see to all omissions that have now been adopted.
I would therefore advise our group to cast a resounding vote in favour.
Â Â  I note that the approach followed by ourselves in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe with regard to enhancing the environmental aspect, clarifying the existing ambiguities and simplifying procedures for small undertakings has overwhelmingly carried the day.
We shall therefore be voting in favour of the proposal.
I should first and foremost like to thank MrÂ Sacconi for his extremely patient work, but also the Commission and the Presidency, which are unfortunately not represented in the Chamber.
We now have the opportunity to devise a very strong piece of legislation.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot join with the majority that has endorsed the system of approval, and it is for this reason that we have voted against it.
What can be adduced in the reportâs defence is what it has to say about registration, which was accepted by a broad qualified majority â the only important block and the most important issue to be adopted by qualified majority here in this House.
This is a decision that will carry weight both in the Council and in the Commission.
It is only with that in mind, and explicitly rejecting the approval, which we know will be corrected by the Council, that I vote in favour of the report.
Â Â  With this vote and the compromise on registration, we are going to get a REACH couched in weak, indeed unduly weak, terms.
We have, however, obtained a good decision with regard to the granting of authorisations.
We would rather have a weak version of REACH than no REACH at all.
We shall therefore vote in favour of the proposal, but do so without enthusiasm.
Â Â  Since all the other groups are stating their views, we understand that this has been a complicated vote.
It has now, however, been stated that the only positive aspect of the proposal, that relating to the granting of authorisations, will be undermined in the Council.
It has also been undermined through certain exemptions during the vote.
As a result, a large majority of my group cannot accept REACH in its present form.
Â Â  , . Mr President, the majority of my group will not be supporting this compromise either.
In our view, registration in the environmental area has not been thrashed out very well.
A compromise has been reached in a few other areas, but only by a narrow majority.
Our concern is, then, that this is not a sound proposal, and it is for that reason that we will be voting against it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for kindly allowing me to take the floor.
It seemed almost impossible to speak in this fine Chamber during the debate on the highly important REACH provision.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has decided to vote in favour, because we are satisfied as regards the registration procedure and we wholly agree with the content of the regulation in connection with the OSOR principle.
We do, however, have some concerns with regard to the procedure for authorisation.
Nevertheless, we are generally in agreement regarding this project, and I should to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Sacconi, for his commitment and for the work he has done.
Â Â  Mr Clark has the floor for a point of order.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, in view of the controversy on the massive number of amendments, I quote Rule 53(1), which reads: âWhere the Commission proposal as a whole is approved, but on the basis of amendments which have also been adopted, the vote on the draft legislative resolution shall be postponed until the Commission has stated its position on each of Parliamentâs amendments.
âIf the Commission is not in a position to make such a statement at the end of Parliamentâs vote on its proposal, it shall inform the President or the committee responsible as to when it will be in a position to do so; the proposal shall then be placed on the draft agenda of the first part-session thereafter.â
Commissioner, we in this House are as respectful of the Rules of Procedure as the Commission, at least, and you have therefore been invited to set out your position on each of the amendments.
I believe that âeachâ must be interpreted flexibly, and you may therefore speak as you see fit and then we shall vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, for some of the amendments our position is positive and we agree in full; for some amendments, we agree in part ...
... for some we agree in principle; some we reject, and for some we reserve our position.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commission takes note of the position taken by Parliament and will not hesitate to draw all the necessary conclusions from a possible rejection by your Assembly, taking account of the Councilâs position as well.
The Commission will have to reflect on the best way to move forward in this area.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to request a fresh vote, since most of those voting clearly supported the proposal.
You, however, concluded that the report was rejected.
I hereby request an individual vote.
Â Â  No, Mr Baco, there has been a very clear majority of votes against.
We have therefore taken the correct decision.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express one regret: since we were dealing with a report assessing the actions of the Council, it would have been very worthwhile and important for the Council to have been present last night.
It is true that it was an inconvenient time, but it could have attended the debate.
I believe that this is something that should be provided for in the future, in order to ensure that the Council is here to listen to Parliamentâs views in relation to this kind of report.
Â Â  . â Ladies and gentlemen, late yesterday evening there were also wide-ranging debates on the issues of weapons and the arms problem and, in view of the fact that it was necessary to dispel a few concerns in connection with my report, I have carried on working at this time, with the result that two oral amendments are necessary.
So, after paragraph 33 there is a new section and, in order to dispel concerns and to ensure the full support of the socialists, I fully confirm that the title of the section has been changed, and is [in English] âStrengthening effective multilateralismâ.
The second oral amendment relates to paragraph 34 and is as follows â the following words shall be included after:
â... takes note, as stated by DrÂ Hans Blix, that the credible threat of the use of force has played an important role in facilitating the disarmament work of UNSCOM and UNMOVIC.â
Thus the whole of the last sentence is deleted.
That, then, is my oral amendment.
Thank you for your attention; I ask you to support it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to ask before the final vote whether we adopted this oral amendment by the rapporteur, otherwise we have to abstain.
I do not think we voted on the oral amendment.
Â Â  I understand that we have already approved it, Mr Wiersma.
Â Â  That concludes Question Time.
Mr President, I speak on behalf of the great majority of the GUE/NGL Group.
We voted in favour today, even though this legislation it is not as strong as we would have wished, because we need legislation that will protect lives and workersâ health, as well as the environment.
We are very pleased that the packages we have agreed with others on authorisation and on the duty of care have been accepted.
The regulation of chemicals within the EU must give proper protection to workers, consumers and the environment while, at the same time, being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of European industry and thereby ensuring jobs.
We are very disappointed with the Nassauer-Sacconi compromise on registration.
The challenge was to agree a registration package for collecting the information needed to assess the risks.
With the deal that has now been agreed, the necessary information will not be available.
What we need is a strong REACH regulation that will give us the information needed to assess whether chemicals are dangerous, even those chemicals produced in low tonnages.
We want legislation with mandatory substitution of the most dangerous chemicals.
The burden of proof must be with the companies and not with public authorities.
It is with these principles in place that public health and workersâ health is best defended.
Every serious impact assessment of the REACH proposal shows the immense health benefits of a workable chemicals policy and this is in stark contrast to the exaggerated industry calculations.
REACH should be a matter of common sense.
Companies should know what they are doing and should be held accountable for their products.
Â Â  â Mr President, I believe that the REACH compromise is a text that will serve as a good basis for negotiations with the Council.
My group and I have voted in favour of the part on authorisation being adopted, and we did so, even though we are opposed to temporary authorisation for substances being restricted to five years.
We wish to state in this regard that we are, in principle, in favour of this block, but would have welcomed it if these five years had been deleted, since decision-making on a case-by-case basis is vastly preferable and would be much easier for the industry to manage.
On the whole, though, we have achieved something unprecedented up to now, namely a degree of environmental protection that is unique in the world.
Â Â  Today I voted against the amended proposal and legislative resolution on REACH because, as the votes progressed, amendments to ease the burden on SMEs were generally lost.
Thus, the balance shifted in favour of restrictions which are so burdensome that they have the potential to drive parts of our chemical industry out of the EU.
Â Â  Despite some excessive provisions, particularly with regard to administrative authorisations, I voted for the amended draft regulation on the control of chemicals (REACH).
Actually, these provisions replace some obsolete texts that were unsuitable for the encouragement of innovation and for adequate protection of people in an increasingly complex, dangerous and changing environment.
The amendments proposed by the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and, in some cases, voted for by Parliament, safeguard business interests, particularly those of the SMEs, whilst ensuring the proper functioning of the legislation allowing for the setting up of a European Chemicals Agency.
With my colleagues in the UMP we shall keep a close watch to ensure that products imported into the European Union are also subject to these Community rules.
This text, adopted at its first reading, forms a sound working basis and I am delighted because it is an advance for health in terms of respecting the environment, while, at the same time, safeguarding business interests in this very important sector.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the compromise negotiated on REACH between the Socialist Group and the Greens, Liberals and United Left concerning scope, substances, authorisation information, transparency and limitation of animal testing and the compromise with the EPP on registration.
These compromises are not ideal, but they appear to be the best deal currently possible, given the political majorities in the Parliament.
We do need to test chemicals.
Recent medical evidence shows that each one of us has 300 more chemicals in our bodily tissues and blood than our grandparents did.
We also know that there are increasing rates of asthma, cancer and other diseases which probably originate from chemicals.
Some in the chemical industry argue that such testing is costly.
But anyone who recalls the asbestos tragedy will know that money invested in the testing now can save thousands of lives and millions of pounds downstream.
With the burden shared with our fellow countries in the European Union, this is well worth doing.
And if it can be done while minimising animal testing, so much the better.
Â Â  . I, along with many of my colleagues have been deeply involved in many meetings and discussions on this particular dossier.
Indeed the level of divergence on this issue is reflected by the many amendments which have been put forward and which led to such a long and arduous voting session.
Even though I have many concerns with regard the approval of many of the amendments, and also on the many inconsistencies which these have raised, I voted in favour of the report, firstly to allow the first reading process to completed and secondly, because I believe that when we return to this issue at second reading the text will have been improved.
I obviously wish to see human and public health being protected, as well as the environment, however we must not loose sight of the fact that to allow new processes to be developed, new products to be created and new innovations to be made available for the greater good, we cannot impose huge restrictions on businesses, which would prevent them from having certainty with regard the business, regulatory and administrative environs within which they must operate.
Â Â  . I have been campaigning for over three years in support of a strong REACH.
Today I cast my vote against the report of Mr Sacconi because I believe that the amendments by Parliament have produced a proposal which would be too weak to protect our health and safety.
This is one of the most important pieces of legislation that the Parliament has dealt with since I was elected in 1999.
Its purpose is to protect human health but the substantial influence of the chemical industry has resulted in a proposal full of loopholes.
I do not believe that we can compromise on the health of future generations.
We know that our bodies are contaminated by chemicals now.
Children have a right to be born chemical free but today's proposal will not achieve that.
Therefore I could not vote for it.
Â Â  Throughout the extensive voting the following principles were followed:
1) We supported the repatriation of authority to member states and within that general statement where possible we supported the interests of SMEs
2) We supported all reductions in the use of animal testing
Â Â  â After the vote in the different committees and having listened to the views of both the industry and the NGOs, the European Parliamentâs Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety had established a balance between the need to protect health and the environment and the need for industrial development in the European Union.
It has been approved almost unanimously by the Socialists, the Greens, the members of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and a large number of the liberals on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, in my opinion, this compromise of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is the position to support.
I voted against the compromise proposed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the registration procedure, because it reduces considerably the number of substances to which REACH applies.
A majority voted for obligatory substitution in order to assure European citizens that harmful substances will be withdrawn from circulation and replaced by safe products where they exist.
Other important points have been adopted and I voted in favour of Mr Sacconiâs report.
Â Â  . This vote is the final step in a long process of negotiation, which has been characterised by huge pressure, mainly on the part of the powerful chemical industry. This has led to the huge economic costs that may arise from the entry into force of standards contained in the first version of REACH.
Indeed, the UK Presidency accepted Germanyâs request to postpone the decision on REACH, scheduled for the next Council of Ministers, on the pretext of the countryâs new government being delayed in taking up its duties.
In any event, this is the first reading of a text that is very much a backward step, although there were some positive aspects on which progress was made and which must now be promoted until negotiations with the Council have been concluded.
REACH creates a single integrated system for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals in the EU, the purpose of which is, firstly, to control and replace the most dangerous chemicals (which cause cancer, change DNA and damage the reproductive system, among other serious health consequences); secondly, to provide safety information on all chemicals at registration stage; and, thirdly, to pass on information to consumers, workers and distributors.
If we continue to buckle under pressure from the European chemical industry, the aims of the programme could be watered down and devalued. This would actually make it far more damaging than the current legislation, if public health and safety are not safeguarded.
Â Â  . In the expectation of the second reading stage bringing us closer to a solution to the controversial areas of protection of intellectual property and the temporary approval of substances and imported items that will take into account the interests of all parties, I have today, in the final vote, voted in favour of the REACH draft.
Â Â  . The new regulation on existing commercial chemical substances, REACH, serves to plug glaring gaps in the law and in our knowledge of the products to which we are exposed on a daily basis.
The register of substances gives the European Chemicals Agency, also created by this regulation, the authority to demand more tests than those provided for under each category, should there be grounds for so doing.
A strong and efficient agency will provide assurances that products will not be placed on the market without the necessary precautions being taken.
The sharing of data is strongly encouraged in this regulation and animal testing is only permitted if absolutely essential.
Further welcome aspects of this regulation are the imposition of a time limit for all authorisations and the mandatory submission of a substitution plan for chemicals considered to be dangerous.
Although I was pleased with the final result of the vote, I must point out that I object to the inclusion of substances in tobacco products, as they are already covered by their own legislation.
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of this text.
Chemicals are present everywhere, and the recent increase in certain types of cancer or leukaemia has to make us question the use of certain chemicals.
I wanted to approach this text from the angle of public health and environmental protection.
A powerful REACH system is at least some guarantee for all our people.
It is right, however, in this text, to safeguard the competitiveness of our enterprises and to avoid all stifling bureaucratic procedures.
In the same way, it is important to exclude all natural substances from this system.
On the other hand, I was in favour of the amendment calling for the chemicals involved in the making of cigarettes to be subject to the rules of the system put in place.
The desired balance, apart from all emotional considerations, accompanied by the creation of a strong and independent European agency, should make it possible for us to achieve these important objectives for our health, our environment, and also for our industry.
Moreover, I strongly urge that all products imported into the European Union should also be subject to these Community rules.
Â Â  You do not wait for an aeroplane to crash before you test it for safety, and neither should we for chemicals in household products.
This new legislation will require manufacturers to prove chemicals are safe before they are used, ensure that the most dangerous chemicals are replaced with safer alternatives, and introduce a right to know about the health rules of chemicals in products we use.
Only 143 chemicals have been subject to official controls in the last thirteen years, yet this new EU law at a stroke introduces a comprehensive system of regulation for all 30,000 chemicals on the European Market.
The Women's Institute, including representatives I met with this week from Cambridge and Bury St. Edmunds, said we should put the environment and consumer safety first, and I am deeply proud that the European Parliament as a whole has been persuaded by their campaign.
Â Â  . I should like to take the opportunity presented by my statement of how I voted on REACH to congratulate the animal welfare and environmental protection organisations on their great and wide-ranging commitment.
Rain, wind and cold did not deter their dedicated members from getting involved in something of great importance to people and the environment and drawing attention to the problems associated with the controversial Chemicals Regulation.
Not least in order to prevent millions of animals from being used in experiments and in order to promote the use of tests that do not involve them, amendments to the Commission proposal are indispensable.
Â Â  I have always supported four requirements in the REACH dossier.
1. An extensive and rigorous system of registration for chemicals in order to recognise them, to evaluate their risk, to give information about them to users and to avoid those that are harmful.
2. For those products that are harmful to a certain degree, there must be a strict system of authorisation, and the authorisation for their use must be time limited.
3. The principle of substitution: substitution must be made obligatory for harmful products.
If no known substitute exists, research must immediately be instigated and authorisation for use must be limited.
4. The setting up of a strong European agency that, while being supported by a network of national institutions with expert knowledge, has the final say in implementing this legislation.
I voted against the compromise by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe concerning the registration procedure because it reduces considerably the number of substances to which REACH applies.
Â Â  . From the very outset of the debate on a new European law on chemicals, I have argued in favour of the Commission proposals being revised in order to secure better protection for health and the environment in Europe than was formerly the case, while reducing excessive bureaucratic demands.
I have therefore supported the line taken by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
With this end in mind, todayâs vote saw the adoption of a number of improvements to the Commission proposal:
1. the compromise reached by Mr Sacconi and Mr Nassauer on the subject of registration, which markedly reduces bureaucratic demands;
2. the exclusion of substances regulated elsewhere or not presenting any potential risk;
3. the tightening-up of requirements in respect of chemicals present in tobacco smoke.
It has to be said, though, that the vote saw the adoption of a number of negative and indefensible points, notably amendments imposing time limits on authorisation.
This is impractical, bureaucratic and unnecessary in terms of the protection of health and the environment.
Since improvements had been made to three essential points in the Commission proposal, I voted âyesâ in the final vote.
I hope that the Council of Ministers will reject the nonsensical proposals, such as that for a five-year time limit and will accept those that are more rational, and that the end-result will be that we end up with a workable REACH.
Â Â  . â There should not be any secrecy or ambiguity surrounding the composition and toxicity of chemical substances.
For months, a number of chemical companies have tried to torpedo a measure that has been necessary for the environment and public health for a long time.
Today, no majority could be found for the strong REACH that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported, but, at the same time, this House rejected many proposals tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which firmly took up the case of the chemical industry.
Only those proposals on which Social Democrats and Liberals were able to agree received a majority.
This has resulted in a weakened REACH, in which registration has been eroded and a positive result was secured only with regard to licences.
Like others, though, we take the view that a weak version is better than nothing.
The fact that the PPE-DE Group and Union for Europe of the Nations Group have declared here that they can still endorse the proposal, given that the Council and the required qualified majority in this House will ensure that the licensing provisions will not survive at second reading, is reason enough for the two representatives of the Dutch Socialist Party to vote against the proposal.
Â Â  . â I have been a Member of Parliament for 40 years, 25 of those in this venerable House. The REACH dossier is the most voluminous, the most controversial and the most complicated matter that I have had to deal with in all these years.
This dossier, however, is also the one that, most of all, has given rise to false information, to threats and even to attempts at blackmail.
Those few people from Luxembourg who enjoy putting their signature to a threatening letter prepared by a powerful organisation, and, similarly, a press campaign denigrating my so-called lobbying in favour of the chemical industry, have not weakened my determination to vote with the majority of my fellow Members, and this is on the basis of well-documented information that I have diligently researched.
If the directive becomes a reality in that form, it will constitute, at a global level, the best guarantee for protecting health from dangerous chemical substances, without jeopardising thousands of jobs, or putting small and medium-sized enterprises into an impossible situation, nor giving away any manufacturing secrets.
I hope today that I have made my contribution to countering the perfectionists and the extremists of all kinds in this essential dossier for Europe.
Â Â  . After a long a complex vote my initial assessment is that Parliament has just about struck the right balance between the vital issues of protecting human health and the environment on the one hand and not over-burdening industry or creating a legal requirement for unnecessary animal testing on the other.
Parliament will have to examine the package that now emerges from Council to ensure that the delicate balance between these objectives has been maintained.
Â Â  . If it is the case that 85% of all chemical substances in circulation are not tested to ascertain to what degree they present a risk to people and the environment, then it is high time that this omission was rectified once and for all.
No longer can we tolerate our people being used as guinea pigs for chemicals to be found in such everyday products as computers or toys, which are absorbed through the skin or the airways, and the risks inherent in which have never yet been put to the test.
We are already being presented with the bill for this culpable negligence in the shape of increasing incidence of allergies and thousands of cases of bronchial or skin disorders contracted at work.
It must, of course, be a matter of the highest priority that all those substances suspected of being carcinogenic and/or mutagenic should be tested and taken off the market.
Things should never have been allowed to come to this pass, in which people work with substances about whose side-effects no information is available.
The essential thing in future is that it be ensured that newly-registered substances are harmless.
Quite simply, there must be no more horror stories about toxic dyes in clothing, aggressive fragrances in cosmetics or fire-retardants finding their way into mothersâ breast milk.
We will certainly not achieve this objective, though, if the original proposal is so watered down that, out of 100Â 000 untested chemicals, 88Â 000 stay that way.
It is for this reason that I voted against the reports.
Â Â  . I voted in the REACH debate as I did because, as a Labour MEP, I support the overall objectives of REACH: the protection of human health and the environment through increased knowledge about potentially hazardous chemicals.
I would like to see a rapid, efficient system for collecting the necessary information on chemicals and for tackling those of most concern, whilst minimising animal testing and maintaining the competitiveness of the chemical industry.
I believe that vertebrate animal testing should be kept to the absolute minimum necessary to ensure that sufficient information is available for decision-making on health and environmental protection.
I support the UK's proposal for a system of 'one substance, one registration', whereby all manufacturers or importers of the same substance would work together to provide one set of 'core' data for registration.
That would ensure that an agreed package of information would be assembled at registration, thereby providing coherent information for the benefit of users and consumers.
Â Â  . I should like to clarify, at the end of this vote, that I have voted in favour of Mr Sacconiâs report solely in order to express my endorsement of the compromise on registration worked out by the rapporteur and myself.
I certainly do not wish to express my approval of its other aspects, most especially not of the approach adopted towards authorisation, since I firmly repudiate the idea that the authorisation of substances should be limited.
Â Â  . Our duty in this, as in all, discussions is to protect the interests of the citizens, whether they be immediate interests, or interests which are not yet apparent but which will take on vital importance in the medium and long term.
I personally voted on the basis of criteria that I consider crucial when there is conflict â at least apparent conflict â between the interests of industry and the interests of protecting the environment and public health.
First and foremost, I feel that protecting public health and the environment should be a priority, but I do not believe in fundamentalist solutions that take a broad brush to everything, overlooking the economic impact of measures and, more importantly, failing to take account of the global dimension of these issues when it comes to economies that have no compunction about environmental dumping.
I am also convinced that our strict requirements benefit European industry itself, and act in the interests of competitiveness and technological innovation.
Lastly, I believe that there is an urgent need to relaunch the European economy and that we must pull out all the stops to ensure that this happens.
In light of the amendments introduced, I opted to vote in favour, not least because there will be further opportunities to introduce any necessary corrections, as in the section on authorisation.
Â Â  â It is with reluctance that I feel myself forced to abstain on this crucial vote.
For me, this is by no means a way of avoiding the issue, but rather the only means of expressing my opinion on the contradictory signal that our Parliament is giving out today.
I feel satisfaction on the one hand, concerning the principle of substitution for problematic substances: obligatory substitution (Amendment 232) and research for safer alternatives (Amendment 214).
It is the first time that the European Parliament has declared itself in this way in a text of this importance.
Having said that, it is impossible for me to take any pleasure in it, when, in the same text, and before the process, Parliament totally alters the registration procedure for two thirds of the substances concerned by REACH, those of less than 10 tonnes: tests reduced in the extreme and depending on risk and not tonnage.
In my opinion this does not afford even basic safeguards with regard to health and safety for the people most at risk.
Here we have totally undermined the very foundations of REACH.
On this point, however, it is salutary to note that the Council is more ambitious than Parliament.
Long may it so remain.
Â Â  . â What the world witnessed today is that it is easy to mislead a democratically elected parliament.
All it takes is a few half-truths and total falsehoods.
This House has shown the world that whoever shouts the loudest eventually wins the argument.
Profits in the chemical industry in Belgium alone amounted to EUR 1.7 billion last year.
That figure will be affected more by the high oil price and the low dollar than by the introduction of REACH in whatever form.
Not so long ago, Europeans contentedly patted each other on the back for the progressive environmental policy that they pursued.
We were the pioneers in the world, or so we thought.
Those days are over.
This watered down version of REACH shows how things should not be done.
The White Paper that preceded REACH gave the chemical industry full responsibility.
They had to be able to prove that the products, from which they derive their profits, do not entail unacceptable risks for health and the environment.
So many back doors have since been created that it is difficult to locate the main entrance.
This REACH is a missed opportunity and one that will probably not come round again.
Â Â  . The REACH vote is one of the most important before this House.
I would like to record my support on authorisation for block 1 and Amendments 232 and 214.
I am pleased that these amendments passed.
Public health is vital and we must decrease our exposure to dangerous chemicals.
Replacing chemicals which cause cancer and which affect human reproduction is essential.
Â Â  . â Anyone may guess the consequences of a European Chemicals Agency.
First of all, evaluation in the interests of safety cannot give any certainty.
We have antibiotics to show us that.
Nitrate fertilisers have brought about the agricultural miracle that is in part responsible for a 20-year increase in life expectancy nowadays.
With REACH, for the sake of protecting rivers from pollution, we would have malnutrition in Europe.
In other words, under the guise of safety precautions, REACH is really just a preoccupation for the rich and for the Amish.
The fundamental principle of this project is the post-modern obscurantism that springs from fear in a society that is so concerned with its quest for eternity that it no longer believes in progress.
The disaster at Seveso, the Aral Sea tragedy, all those ecological catastrophes, none of these will make us forget the miracle of chemistry that, day by day, enhances every moment of our life, with new fabrics from new materials, thousands of colours and thousands of perfumes.
If God had had to register his human product, born of organic chemistry, with the Agency in Helsinki, the very real potential dangers would have led to authorisation being refused for Man to be put on the market of the living world.
Hereâs the slogan that sums up REACH: âNo futureâ.
Â Â  . Although it forms part of the broader discussion on the REACH regulation, the proposal for a directive before us addresses a subject on which wide-ranging agreement is easier to obtain.
Ensuring consumers are kept fully informed is a key factor in a genuine market in which there is real freedom of choice.
The objective here is to adapt the existing arrangements to the needs arising from the new regulation, whilst ensuring that consumers are protected.
Hence my vote in favour.
Â Â  The June Listâs efforts are directed towards ensuring that cooperation within the EU is restricted to genuinely cross-border issues, which include both the internal market and many environmental issues.
We welcome a robust Chemicals Directive that makes the industryâs responsibility for imported chemicals clear.
