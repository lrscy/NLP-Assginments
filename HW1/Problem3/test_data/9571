Poorer countries have traditionally benefited from the achievements of richer countries, and this should continue to be the case.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a French proverb that says that âhe who grasps at too much loses everythingâ.
If too many goals are set, too little will be achieved, and we should take a clear and detailed look at this issue.
Many thanks, MrÂ President.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapid growth experienced by Asian countries and the United States has presented Europe with a major economic challenge.
This means that faster economic growth based on science and new technologies is needed in the European Union.
A coherent research policy should be formulated to provide support for the latter.
The report sets out the key areas of research for the EU as a whole.
In view of the huge differences in the research potential of the various Member States and regions, particular attention should be paid to poor countries and regions, which lack the necessary resources but which have enormous human potential, in order to ensure cohesion between Member States and harmonised development.
Certain groups have expressed the view that there is no point investing in science if the necessary resources are lacking, and steps should be taken to prove this view wrong.
Special attention should therefore be paid to research policy in the countries and regions in question, in order to prevent the gap in intellectual ability and development opportunities widening instead of narrowing.
The guidelines for EU research policy included in the reportâs motion for a resolution highlight the key areas for the development of research.
This is entirely correct, but the development of science and technology throughout the EU should not be neglected.
I thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, MrsÂ Locatelli, I should like to thank you for your excellent work, and I should also like to thank our shadow rapporteur, MrÂ Brunetta.
We are all aware that we face a huge challenge in achieving the Lisbon goals.
Our aim is to spend 3% of GDP on research, of which two thirds should come from the private sector.
Put quite simply, if we demand this of industry, we should be aware that 50% of gross national income is generated by small and medium-sized enterprises.
Even more importantly, two thirds of all employees work for small and medium-sized enterprises, or in other words for companies with fewer than 250 employees.
The Sixth Framework Programme set a goal of 15%, which figure the major horizontal projects did not, in the end, achieve, even though the energy programmes were heavily oversubscribed.
I should therefore like to ask Commissioner PotoÄnik to consider ways in which research activities can be prioritised in the field of small and medium-sized enterprises.
I believe that it is also necessary to determine at long last where the responsibility lies for efficiency and evaluation in the field of academic research.
Research generates know-how and values, and this process must be measured and evaluated.
Greater transparency is needed, and I would specifically ask that an -Research Programme be established.
We must ask ourselves how the simplest possible methods can be made available on the Internet for submitting applications to research programmes and providing funding for these programmes, and how we can ensure that the Commission also complies with the Late Payment Directive, which is applied in all other fields, but which the Commission has so far refused to accept.
We need top-quality automated processes and better instruments to make research findings more widely available.
Â Â  Mr President, I should first of all like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Locatelli, who has tabled an excellent and interesting report.
Research in the Seventh Framework Programme is important to us, certainly in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
A good working relationship between research centres and industry is essential.
I should like to make three points.
Firstly, it goes without saying that science should be autonomous, but that is not the same as being noncommittal.
Scientific priorities are not a pastime for scientists; they must be issue-driven.
I fully share MrÂ Hammerstein Mintzâs view that the public research agenda must be guided by social problems.
The second point is the unnecessary red âtape, which has been mentioned before.
It turned out too often that the chances of success in the Sixth Framework Programme were very minimal compared to the efforts that were being made.
Certainly for small businesses and small institutions, it is a well-nigh impossible task to complete the paperwork and answer the questions.
That is why we would ask for a two-step procedure, consisting of a brief description of the research project, followed by a selection procedure, so that the participants in the second round have reasonable certainty that their proposal will actually be accepted.
Thirdly, I would urge you to combine forces.
European research funds continue to be only a fraction of national budgets.
Article 169 offers the opportunity of combining forces.
We have already gathered experience in the area of clinical tests for developmental diseases.
We can use this experience to carry out joint research into such things as the introduction of a low-CO2 economy, into hydrogen cells, and into improving energy efficiency.
A bundling of forces is also what society wants, and that is what we have to work towards.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report; it is now up to you, Commissioner PotoÄnik, and your fellow Commissioners to ensure that the research priorities are implemented.
I should like to focus on just one of these priorities, which in all probability will be absent from tomorrowâs report, namely defence research.
After consulting the rest of my group, I have withdrawn an amendment on this matter in view of the confusion it could have caused, in connection with the Council.
Why have I decided to speak out in favour of defence research?
Our future Constitution provides for the development of the common foreign and security policy, which means that we will need to carry out research in this field, some of which will be secret.
We must therefore be capable of copying the Americans by adopting a âblack boxâ approach to individual projects.
Yet we should step up transatlantic research cooperation in other fields where research lies in the interests of humanity as a whole.
This will give rise to a research dialogue between equals that would be appropriate in the case of a number of other countries, as well as the USA.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
I should like to congratulate MrsÂ Locatelli on having drafted an excellent report, and to thank CommissionerÂ PotoÄnik for joining us.
In my opinion, the majority of those present in the Chamber are former researchers, and that this is why we share the same views.
It is my belief that CommissionerÂ PotoÄnik has never worked in the field of research, however, and can therefore adopt a more distanced and somewhat less passionate approach to our proposals.
I hope that this will provide a good outcome.
I should like to point out that the current Sixth Framework Programme is the first in the European Unionâs history to have been drafted and implemented within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
There is another new feature to the Seventh Framework Programme, however, as it has been drafted and will be implemented after enlargement, with the involvement of the ten new Member States.
How can we use this enlargement to ensure that our science policy is effective and to implement the Lisbon Strategy, and what can the ten new Member States offer the EU as a whole?
They can offer it three things, namely a highly-educated population whose knowledge is often wasted, lower research costs and a thirst for success after half a century of isolation from Western civilisation and development opportunities.
How can we make the most of these opportunities, and how can we improve the way we exploit the research potential of the new Member States?
I have five proposals.
Excellence should not be the only criterion used when determining funding priorities, and additional criteria should be considered in order to make it possible for research centres in the new Member States to be integrated.
These centres have had limited opportunities to implement European research programmes in the past.
Secondly, we are counting on smaller projects being approved, as our research centres are also smaller.
Thirdly, procedures need to be made simpler.
The new Member States are inexperienced in dealing with complicated procedures, and they find them a major burden.
We are hoping that clear and transparent rules will be put in place to govern investment in research infrastructures in the new Member States.
Fifthly and finally, integration also means a common market and full freedom of movement for persons and services.
Until this is achieved, we will not be able to boost research or succeed with the Lisbon Strategy.
I thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, who could possibly disagree that the tool for promoting growth and competitiveness in Europe is a sustainable research and development policy?
It is not a choice; it has become a necessity.
Europe has already lost its pole position to Japan and America.
The aim that we are promoting, that is, 3% of GDP within a period of five years, is ambitious.
We are also stating that two-thirds of that funding is to come from the private sector â let us hope.
But as with everything in life, it all depends on money.
This is where the general discussion on the budget comes in.
However, we must realise that if we do not invest, the rich will become less rich and the poor will become poorer.
The policy of investment in research and development is not a matter of choice.
As I said, it has become a necessity.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking MrsÂ Locatelli both for her careful work and her truly exemplary cooperation with all sides.
I wish in my intervention to emphasise and confine myself to one amendment.
In particular, we all know that we are living in an age of uncertainty and increased mass risks, especially environmental risks.
The recent catastrophic tsunami in South-East Asia should have convinced even the most incredulous among us that there is an immediate and urgent need to fortify our continent against this sort of catastrophic natural disaster.
The scientists who study these phenomena come from many and varied sectors: seismologists, geologists, oceanologists, forestry experts and others.
I believe that it is very important for the safety and welfare of European citizens for strong momentum to be given to these areas of research, especially as they appear to be converging continuously and increasingly into a risk and crisis management model.
That is why I think that we should make special reference to natural dangers.
An amendment to this effect has been tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats; I refer to Amendment 8.
An additional reason for this, no less important, is its link with the Lisbon Strategy.
In fact, both the Commission communication on the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the resolution we adopted today emphasise the importance of eco-innovation to sustainable development in Europe.
This means that, in the revised Lisbon Strategy, environmental technologies and high environmental standards will hold an important position.
Ladies and gentlemen, the amendment we are proposing does not simply set out yet another thematic priority; it aims to make express reference to a research sector which comes within the philosophy of the revised Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, research and innovation are the key to solving a great many of the problems Europe faces.
This is something that has been highlighted on a number of occasions, as has the fact that our aim is to increase funding.
I should merely like to point out that the road ahead of us is a rocky one.
Delighted though I am that Parliament and the Commission are agreed on the need for increased funding, I really am extremely concerned at the signals coming out of the Member States.
As an example, I find it intolerable that the current government of Germany, my own country, has put forward official proposals to the finance ministers aimed at reducing the amount of money the EU spends each year on research in the European Union.
This is the precise opposite of what we ought to be doing.
Although we agree, then, on the need to aim for increased funding, I do believe that we should nevertheless bear in mind that a great deal of money still comes from the national research budgets, and that the Member States should increase these.
At present 5% of funding comes from the Commission and 95% from the national research budgets.
Although the Commission may one day provide 10% of funding and the Member States 90%, this ratio is unlikely to change substantially.
It follows that European added value must be our main concern when selecting our priorities, and I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of Amendment 7 by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I should, however, like to make it clear that I do not share the view of MrÂ Lundgren, who is unfortunately no longer present, that the measures taken to date have barely provided any European added value.
There is a great deal for Europe to do; having studied medicine myself, I know that in this field alone European cooperation is needed, in particular in the fight against rare diseases and childrenâs diseases, and indeed to achieve any kind of success.
We must therefore provide greater support for such cooperation.
Â Â  The 21st century will be the century of science, research, and technical development.
The document before us starts from the recognition of that, and sees correctly that the EU needs the utmost effort in this field, so that it can stand its ground against ever fiercer competition.
Because of this I hold this report as something to be supported.
Allow me, however, in the short time at my disposal, to bring a worry to your attention.
Perhaps not too far from this topic is a quote from Albert Einstein I would like to draw on: âthere are limits to knowledge, but imagination is infinite.â
Now, when the Lisbon Strategy is on the dayâs agenda, perhaps it is not churlish to put the question: what guarantee is there that the ambitious targets formulated in this document will not remain parts of the empire of imagination, rather than serving as a basis for true knowledge?
From the Hungarian perspective, for example, the ratio of 3% of GDP, though appealing, still seems very distant today, and this is sure to be the case with most of the recently acceded countries.
It is my belief that there is only one way to dispel this worry.
We must stimulate and support research and development in the new and the old Member States, each in line with their own and different situations.
This is so that there should not be a situation where we keep funding for R[amp]D as something to be decided by each countryâs level of economic development. This would preserve the existing differences and lead to a weakening of cohesion.
It is also true that the Union is only as strong as the strengths and efforts of its Member States.
If in this area there are no states or regions falling behind, only then will we be able to say that Europe has successfully faced one of the greatest challenges of the new century.
And if that will be true, then it was worthwhile preparing this report.
Â Â  . Mr President, there are four major areas to be addressed.
Cooperation is the principal one: continuity in this area, a thematic approach but one that is based much more on industrial needs than in the past.
The second is ideas: we want to create champions of thoughts and new-frontier ideas in the European Union, because we really need them.
The third is people: there is no research without people and how good we will be in delivering and really creating depends a lot on how well we do in research.
The fourth is capacities.
All these areas need to be addressed in a proper way so that we will get the best for the European Union.
Everything must be done with more flexible instruments than we have had until now.
They must be transparent, understandable, simple and, I hope, efficient and based on a kind of upgraded continuity leading on from the Sixth Framework Programme.
Some of you mentioned ethical questions.
It is true that they are not easy.
They are important in science because peopleâs perception of science is certainly crucial to the success of the issue we are discussing.
These are definitely not easy questions that can be addressed in a limited amount of time, but I agree that we need to address them in an open and tolerant way.
I also think that a special role should be given to the existing ethics committee, which discusses and considers all sides of these important and sometimes difficult questions.
Small and medium-sized enterprises have been mentioned.
They are extremely important because the European Union has a different structure to some of our competitors.
As a proportion we have more of them, and they should and could participate more in research than they do today.
Regarding enlargement and capacities, I would make two comments.
One is that enlargement happened first in the areas of science and research, as scientists from the new Member States were able to participate earlier in these areas than in any others.
On the other hand, it is more difficult to have full integration in these areas than, for example, in the political field, where people can sit at a table and discuss vexing questions.
So we need to do all we can to address that matter, but we also have to be clear that proper funds are required if it is to be addressed properly.
I believe that science and research funds should primarily address the question of excellence.
We need to have a highly competitive European Union.
Only if the Union as a whole is competitive can we rely on all the issues connected with questions of solidarity being properly addressed.
I have listened carefully to all your comments.
You have my promise that I will do my best.
Your support is good for me, although it does not make my task easier.
We all have high expectations, and rightly so, because the future of the European Union also depends greatly on the future development of the scientific and research field.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on oral questions on the transfer of passenger data:
â oral question (B6-0014/2005) by Baroness Ludford and others;
â oral question (B6-0154/2005) by Mrs Buitenweg;
â oral question (B6-0156/2005) by Mrs Klamt, MrsÂ CederschiÃ¶ld and Mr Coelho;
oral question (B6-0160/2005) by Mr Catania and MrsÂ Kaufmann;
and on data retention and data protection:
â oral question (B6-0017/2005) by Mr Alvaro, MrsÂ Roure and Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler;
â oral question (B6-0020/2005) by Mrs Buitenweg;
â oral question (B6-0155/2005) by Mrs Klamt and others;
â oral question (B6-0159/2005) by Mr Catania and MrsÂ Kaufmann.
Â Â  Mr President, it is quite strange that this debate concerns the Internet and the retention of data on the Internet, and yet it is not being broadcast as normal on Parliamentâs website.
I should like to complain about that.
Â Â  Mrs Mastenbroek, late-night sittings have never been broadcast over the Internet in the past, as resources are limited in this respect.
There has not yet been a single instance of a late-night sitting being broadcast, and so at present this is the rule rather than an exception.
If we are to discuss anything, it should therefore be whether this rule should be changed on a permanent basis.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Frattini for attending this debate tonight, which is the first on data protection during this parliamentary term, on the initiative of my own Group, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
This is not the first time that Parliament has examined the issue of PNR, but it is almost two years to the day since Parliament first raised this issue.
Tonightâs debate is therefore intended to take stock of what has happened since then.
I have been appointed rapporteur on the initiative by four Member States relating to data retention.
That is why some months ago we tabled two oral questions on the issue of PNR and the issue of data retention, with a view to having a public debate on two issues that raise serious concerns from the point of view of fundamental human rights, and to get more information from the Commission on these issues.
Commissioner Frattini, we were pleased to hear during the EP hearings of candidate Commissioners that you attach a great deal of importance to defending fundamental rights, and I know that you are personally committed to defending citizensâ privacy.
We appreciate that stance, but also want the Commission to bring forward the proposals on data protection under the third pillar that we have been promised for so long.
The European Parliament finds itself in quite a conflictual situation vis-Ã -vis other EU institutions.
We have strongly disagreed with the Commission and Council on the PNR issue, challenging their decisions before the Court of Justice, but unfortunately will have to wait a long time before the Court issues its decision.
On the data retention issue, I am unconvinced by the four Member Statesâ initiative, with regard both to the content and the legal basis.
I know that the Commission shares these doubts.
In general terms, the European Parliament is extremely worried about the compliance of these provisions with international and European human rights norms, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, and the related jurisprudence, as well as with EU law.
That is why we are here tonight.
On the issue of data retention, we know the Commission has raised the scrutiny reservation on the correctness of the legal basis of the four Member Statesâ proposal.
The Commission believes that a third pillar basis is not correct, and that a first pillar basis would be the right one.
We would be keen to view the Commissionâs legal responding, since I have the same doubts and have requested Parliamentâs legal service to make the same legal check.
However, we also have doubts on the necessity and proportionality of European data retention provisions.
That is why we would ask the Commission whether it supports the four Member Statesâ initiative not only in terms of the legal basis but also in terms of the content.
Secondly, we would like to know whether the Commission will ask the four Member States to withdraw their initiative, a move the Commission has not yet made.
We would also like to know if and when the Commission will propose a first pillar instrument.
The Commission 2005 working programme schedules for this month the adoption by the Commission of a directive on the retention of data for law enforcement purposes.
Will this deadline be respected and what will the content of the proposal be?
Thirdly, we would like an update on the long-overdue third pillar data protection instrument that Commissioner Frattini personally promised would be brought forward.
Let me underline that the Article 29 Working Party has already drafted a proposal for harmonised data protection principles for the third pillar.
We would be honoured to hear your remarks on this issue.
On the PNR issue, Parliament has a keen interest and a right to have an update on the current action before the Court of Justice, with Parliament objecting to the signing of the international agreement of 28 May 2004 that makes the transfer of air passenger data to the US possible.
First of all, Parliament has consistently requested the development of a push system, most recently in the amendment adopted to the 2005 budget.
Can the Commission inform Parliament whether there have been any developments?
With a view to the protection of the privacy of European air passengers, could the Commission inform Parliament of the volume of passenger data which the authorities have access to and whether there is an effective filtering of sensitive data.
Also, are intra-European flights excluded?
The Commission has published a communication on a global EU approach on PNR.
However, the Commission is evidently not following a coherent approach, since on the one hand it has not finalised the international agreement with Australia, while on the other hand it is ready to negotiate with Canada on standards that are entirely different from those which apply to the US.
Will the Commission follow up on the communication and will it start adhering to a truly global EU approach?
Finally, why has Parliament never been informed about the negotiations on PNR at an ICAO level?
The current practice is not democratic, transparent or justifiable.
Thank you, and I look forward to hearing your answers.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I will not repeat the questions that we sent to you.
On the other hand, it is worth restating that last year, in AprilÂ 2004, the European Parliament rejected the agreement negotiated between the Council, the Commission and the United States and referred the matter to the Court of Justice.
I would also remind you that ArticleÂ 7 of Directive 95/46 provides an exhaustive list of circumstances in which personal data may be processed.
These authorisations must be understood as being laid down by Community law or by the national law of a Member State, and not by the law of a third country.
Do you not think that, in the absence of an opinion from the Court of Justice, and in view of the European Parliament's negative opinion, the automatic transmission of passenger data to the US authorities violates European citizens' right to protection of their private lives?
I would remind you that the US authorities cannot guarantee the level of data protection that we require in Europe and that we also ask of other third countries such as Australia and Canada.
In particular, we have no way of knowing who has access to these data.
The issue should be settled with respect for fundamental rights and in line with the principles defined by the European Parliament.
Thus, we need to define what data can be transferred automatically and what data can be transferred on a case-by-case basis.
We would like the list of serious crimes for which an additional request can be made, the list of authorities and agencies that can have access to the data and the data protection conditions that must be met to be determined.
We would like to know for how long these two types of data will be kept.
We know, of course, that data relating to the prevention of serious crime must be exchanged in accordance with the EU-US agreement on mutual legal assistance and extradition.
We would like to satisfy ourselves that passengers will be guaranteed the ability to correct data relating to them.
Do you think, Commissioner, that the transfer of data complies with the principles of finality and proportionality advocated by the Article 29 working party?
Moreover, we would like to have assessments and figures and to know the results of this practical experience.
Finally, do you not think that it is all the more urgent to deal with the issue of data protection under the third pillar, with a framework decision?
An initiative has been proposed by France, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden regarding a draft framework decision on data retention, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is also currently working on it.
We would like to know, Commissioner, whether you support this?
What, in fact, are your plans with regard to data protection?
Do you want to put forward your own proposals?
We in the Civil Liberties Committee need to know the legislative basis on which we have to work, and we would be grateful if you could answer all these questions precisely.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to take some time this evening to reminisce about the previous Commission and the things it promised to do.
You may remember Mr Bolkesteinâs letter to the American Minister, Tom Ridge, about the transfer of passenger data, in which he even quoted Benjamin Franklin with the well-known phrase: âThey who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security deserve neither liberty or securityâ.
Today, we would like to know what exactly happens with our citizensâ data.
In previous debates, the transfer of sensitive data, such as the personâs religion or their state of health, proved extremely controversial.
MrÂ Bolkestein promised that âpending the installation of filters by airlines, the United States should filter them and then delete them altogetherâ, which suggests that the United States gets its hands on the data, but is not allowed to read it.
Has the Commission meanwhile checked whether the United States actually abides by this rule or do you simply take President Bushâs word for it?
What is the latest on the development of those filter systems for airline companies?
Last year, the Commission considered Parliamentâs lawsuit to be generally unnecessary, because they could get the push system off the ground within a few months, six months at the most.
What is happening with it now?
The Americansâ interest in the European publicâs personal data cannot be seen in isolation from their efforts to set up a Global Computer Surveillance System.
It is their desire to create a profile of as many citizens worldwide as possible on the basis of their travelling behaviour and their credit-card purchases.
On 11 March 2004, the Commission response indicated its willingness, under certain conditions, to help develop this CAPPS II system and said that at the present time, the American authorities are not yet carrying out tests with our passenger data.
I would ask the Commission whether, a year down the line, this situation has changed, so that they are now testing our passenger data.
Have you checked this?
What is the latest on the CAPPS II system or perhaps its successor?
Is the Commission now involved in the development of this system with the United States?
I should like to have precise answers.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that Mr Frattini has read our questions and will certainly also answer them this evening.
I am also convinced that he knows that Parliament supports a balanced viewpoint where combating crime comes up against the issue of privacy, as in this case involving data storage.
All day long, we have discussed the Lisbon Process and how we are to become more competitive.
It cannot, then, be the right time to impose upon enterprises, authorities and citizens enormous costs for which we do not even have an impact assessment; in other words, costs for which there is no basis.
It seems to me entirely unreasonable and illogical to take decisions before such an assessment has been carried out while, at the same time, discussing competitiveness and Lisbon.
It would be unreasonable to make people pay for this surveillance of themselves.
I believe that it must always be the party who requests the information who pays.
Otherwise, the situation would work in favour of a Big Brother society.
Moreover, it has not been demonstrated that this approach is necessary, something that is essential before any decisions can be taken.
Should the Commission submit a proposal, it is logical for the Member States to withdraw theirs.
I hope and believe that Mr Frattini realises that it is a good idea â even necessary â to ensure that the protection of peopleâs privacy on a third pillar basis is at least as good as the same protection based on the first pillar.
I share my fellow MEPsâ viewpoint that it would be interesting to hear how you intend to deal with this matter.
Â Â  â Mr President, as regards the issue of the transfer of passenger data, I would like to add my voice to the questions raised and the criticism made by my fellow MEPs in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
For my part, I shall concentrate, in my comments, on the issue of the storage of personal data.
The proposal currently before the Council entails a very clear conflict between personal integrity and respect for privacy, on the one hand, and societyâs need for surveillance, on the other.
I believe that this draft goes way too far in infringing privacy, for it is based in practice on the concept of surveillance even when no crime is suspected and is actually based on a kind of underlying suspicion of everyone.
This is clearly in conflict with the European Convention for Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, particularly ArticleÂ 8 concerning respect for private and family life, home and correspondence.
The Member States signed this Convention from the Council of Europe on the assumption that the EU as an institution would also do so.
Are we serious about this if, at the same time, we can adopt legislation that clearly infringes international conventions?
This is a key issue concerning our credibility, which the Commission must address.
Another important point is the severe criticism made of this proposal by what is known as the Article 29 Group.
This comprises some of the foremost experts that we have in the Union when it comes to data protection.
It would also be interesting to hear the Commission comment on the Article 29 Groupâs criticism in this area.
It is in times of crisis that the rule of law is put to the test, and it is in times of crisis that the rule of law is needed most of all, in order to protect people, partly from unwarranted surveillance by society itself.
Following the terrorist attacks in the USA a few years ago, we saw that, once the line concerned has been crossed, it is that much easier to cross it again.
That is why it is important to stand up for the fundamental values of the rule of law.
The Commission and the Council must therefore also be prepared to debate this legislation in good time.
Far too often we have discussed these issues â on many occasions without getting answers â only to find that it is then too late.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am sure that no one in this House would hesitate to agree that data protection is a key task.
Yet there can be no question that prioritising the fight against crime is equally important, particularly in this day and age.
It is extremely difficult to weigh up data protection against opportunities to fight crime, and I am genuinely open and ready to discuss this matter.
With regard to this draft report, however, I must say that no definite answer has yet been provided to a question that was asked quite clearly several months ago, namely whether there is actually any need for this report.
I can therefore fully understand why all the groups within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs believe â as I, indeed, very certainly do â that the scheme that is being pursued is absurd.
We need a clear answer from the Commission.
If these measures are necessary, then we can discuss them.
Yet if they are unnecessary, which I currently believe to be the case, then we must do everything in our power to stop them.
What worries me is that this process will go on and on, and that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or at some other point in the future, we will be presented with a proposal that we will carry on debating, and that there will no longer be any way to escape the process, even though every Member of this House believes it to be misguided.
I would therefore be extremely interested to hear the Commissionâs views on this.
We have been discussing Lisbon and our desire to see less regulation, but we are well on the way to regulating something that is absurd and that noÂ one wants apart from the four Member States which backed the initiative.
Furthermore, given that all groups in the House are in agreement and have expressed their concerns on this matter, I would expect the Commission to explain to the House whether â and, if so, when â it intends to present a proposal and what the substance of this proposal will be.
I do not want to wait around too long before we are told what we will be agreeing to, and who will bear the costs.
Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld asked a short while ago who would foot the bill â will it be the public, industry, or those who called for these measures, namely the Member States behind the initiative?
Additional questions can then be dealt with at a later date.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission shares the overall concern that Member States are aiming to address with the envisaged framework decision on data retention, which is to guarantee the capability of law enforcement authorities to access certain data related to electronic communication to underpin their efforts to fight crime, including terrorism and organised crime.
From a legal point of view, the initiative of France, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom on data retention currently under discussion was tabled under Title 6 of the Treaty on European Union.
However, the Commission is of the opinion that the provisions of the draft instrument that deal with the harmonisation of obligations on electronic communication providers to retain data related to the provision of electronic communication services fall under the European Community Treaty, notably in view of the existing provisions of Community law on the subject.
As a consequence, the Commission will present an alternative proposal on data retention based on Article 95 of the European Community Treaty by early spring 2005.
Personally, I hope that the four Member States in question will withdraw their proposal.
The Commission is fully aware of the possible cost implications of data retention obligations on the providers of electronic communication services.
An impact assessment will be carried out to determine to what extent the creation of obligations to retain data will have economic implications.
Regarding a third pillar general data protection instrument, the Commission intends to issue the first comprehensive proposal in the second half of 2005; in October or November.
To that end, the Commission has started consultations with experts representing the relevant ministries and data protection control authorities of the Member States and the Schengen States.
As regards the transfer of passenger data to the United States joint review, a number of questions concerning the transfer of passenger data â the PNR issue â are related to the implementation of undertakings by the US Customs and Border Protection agency.
Those undertakings provide for a joint review on their implementation to be conducted by the US authorities and the Commission, the latter assisted by representatives of European law enforcement authorities and data protection supervisors.
This joint review will take place in the first half of this year, i.e. during the first year of operation of the agreement and associated undertakings, which entered into force on 28 May 2004.
The review aims to provide a clear picture of the way the undertakings function.
It is my intention to inform this Parliament of the outcome of this joint review and any important developments in this file.
As I have already mentioned, national data protection authorities will be part of the Commission-led team conducting the joint review. This should allow the Article 29 Working Party to participate to assess fully the implementation of the undertaking.
I am pleased to tell you that, in spite of differences of opinion on the US PNR package, there is excellent cooperation on the implementation of this package between the Article 29 Working Party and the Commission.
As regards passenger information, as an example of that excellent cooperation between the Article 29 Working Party and the Commission, the Working Party has issued a passenger information notice, which airlines and travel agents use in order to inform airline passengers of the fact that personal data are transferred to the US Customs and Border Protection agency for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism and other serious crimes.
As regards data transfers to third countries, according to information we received from the United States, no passenger data have been transferred so far to third countries.
No doubt this issue will be looked into during the joint review exercise that will take place very soon.
As regards âSecure Flightâ and CAPPS II, you will be aware that the US Transportation Security Administration has dropped its controversial computer-assisted passenger pre-screening system â also known as CAPPS II â in favour of a new programme called âSecure Flightâ.
That programme will use passenger data for pre-screening passengers on US domestic flights against a terrorist watch list, with the aim of helping to identify potential terrorists.
Unlike CAPPS II, âSecure Flightâ, for the time being, is limited to US domestic flights, which make it much less problematic than CAPPS II from a new data protection point of view.
âSecure Flightâ is only in its testing phase.
That is why, for the moment, no negotiations are planned.
This is an issue to be watched very carefully.
As regards the EUâs global plan for PNR policy, the Commission issued a communication in December 2003 on the EUâs global approach on passenger data, advocating a comprehensive and balanced approach.
The Commission indicated in the communication that it will pursue its task with other third countries requesting passengersâ data.
The Commission has entered into talks with Canada and Australia.
Concerning Canada, we will soon seek Parliamentâs opinion on a draft Commission document and an accompanying international agreement.
Talks with Australia are also well advanced.
In both cases the Article 29 Working Party has issued a positive opinion.
As you can see, the Commissionâs strategy as outlined in the communication of December 2003 is being put into practice.
Finally, as regards the International Civil Aviation Organization, that organisation established the passenger name record access study group in June 2004, following an initiative by several states within that organisation.
They called for the development of a harmonised set of principles under the auspices of the ICAO.
Guidelines are currently being prepared.
The European Commission and several EU Member States are participating actively in the work of the study group.
I will keep you well informed about further developments in that programme.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Frattini, I welcome your response on data protection and in relation to the announcement of the Commissionâs initiative.
Like you, I hope that the four Member States will withdraw their initiatives.
With regard to PNR, this is an issue that has concerned Parliament for two years.
As you know, Mr Frattini, the need for cooperation at Community level and at Transatlantic level is not the issue here.
What we are highlighting is the need to maintain a balance between the citizensâ security, freedom and rights and we wish to emphasise our view that data transfer can take place only if the third country in question is able to guarantee adequate levels of protection.
It is also absolutely crucial that a legal and secure framework be established on the transfer of PNR.
We would advocate a âpushâ system accompanied by the appropriate filters and would like to see the necessary guarantees with regard to the accuracy, security and supervision of data.
Furthermore, the principle of reciprocity must always underpin any exchange of information with the US authorities or those of any other third country.
We welcome the comments that you made on the involvement of Article 29 and on your readiness to continue to give Parliament all of the information on this dossier.
We sincerely hope that the ongoing negotiations with Canada and Australia set the standard for other countries, in particular the United States of America, to follow.
There was no reference to the issue of the chip in passports in the information â the response â that you gave.
We understand that the United States is planning to insert a non-encrypted chip enabling remote reading and this is a further concern heading into these global talks on transferring data between the Union and the United States of America
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to CommissionerÂ Frattini for having already announced that the Commission will propose its own initiative.
I have a number of questions regarding the retention of data in telecommunications networks, to which I hope your proposal will be able to provide answers.
My first question relates to costs, as long-term data retention is a major financial burden, in particular for small telecommunications firms.
The proposal put forward by the Council and the four Member States makes no provision for compensation.
Who is meant to pay for these measures, and what is their cost-benefit ratio?
It is quite clear that longer retention periods will not mean increased security for citizens.
Data protection experts, and even law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Criminal Police Office in Germany, have expressed doubt as to whether there is any need for the measures outlined in the Council decision.
The has even stated its opposition to the minimum period for retention of traffic data, and it is calling on the Federal Government to withdraw its support for the proposal.
How can we expect to achieve greater security if terrorists and those involved in organised crime still have alternatives open to them that are not covered at all in this proposal?
What measures will be taken to deal with Internet cafÃ©s, flat rate lines, public telephone boxes and calls using telephone providers based abroad, and who will be in a position to monitor and retain all this data?
Data protection is another extremely important issue as regards the transfer of data to third parties.
It is also quite clear that what we need is effective security, and more of it.
No one is opposed to fighting international terrorism or organised crime, but we have absolutely no need for unnecessary monitoring.
I hope that you will provide answers to all these questions in your proposal.
It is quite obvious, and we firmly believe it to be true, that although it is good that checks should be carried out, it is even better if people have confidence in them.
As it stands, the proposal by the four Member States will not foster confidence among the public.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, I am pleased to hear that this new Commission will be rectifying a number of mistakes made by its predecessor.
That is important because my country, the Netherlands, will, in a few monthsâ time, be holding a referendum on the Constitution.
I would like to be able to look those members of the Dutch public who are rather sceptical about it straight in the eye and tell them that this Constitution, those constitutional rights and the protection of personal data are really serious and not simply lip service.
Let me turn first to the protection of personal data, which is a matter of general interest.
You said that you personally are opposed to the proposal tabled by the four countries.
I should like to hear what this means in institutional terms.
As for the transfer of passenger data, the PNR issue, concerning which there was a report on which my predecessor Mrs Boogerd-Quaak worked very hard, will the Joint Review, which you mentioned a moment ago, also state how many attacks have been pre-empted and how many criminals have been arrested?
That, in the final analysis, is what this is all about.
Secondly, you stated that information is already being handed out to the passengers, but what about the duty to ask for explicit permission before their data can be transferred?
Finally, I should like to find out from you what steps the Commission has taken so far in order to introduce the push system.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, your response leaves a great many questions unanswered and raises new ones.
I can tell you that the European public is far from happy with this regulation, and that there are a great many people who say that they no longer wish to fly to the United States because they do not enjoy being treated like criminals.
Such views are now widespread among the public, and cannot therefore be ignored.
I should like to ask a number of questions following on from the answers you provided.
You said that a review is now to be carried out after one year, and that Parliament will be informed of its outcome.
Am I to assume that you cannot yet tell us what will happen in the meantime with data that is being retained this year?
Am I to assume that you cannot provide us with any information on the way in which this data is currently retained, used and filtered, or that you do not wish to do so?
I should like to inform the Commissioner that this presents us with a major problem in terms of communication with the public.
This leads me to ask what approach is being taken to the issue of data protection, as this is something by which the European public sets great store.
What people want is information, Commissioner, and you should therefore be more open in your dealings with this House.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, it is always good to see you.
I would first like to say something about the procedure, and then move on to the content.
The procedure is extremely vague.
We in this House have been asked to assess a proposal which, technically speaking, does not yet exist.
Indeed, the Council has tabled a proposal on the retention of traffic data, but this is still being drafted and it is not clear what the proposal will ultimately stipulate.
In the first pillar, a ban on data retention has been agreed upon before and it is abundantly clear that some governments have tabled this proposal only because they cannot get it past their own parliaments.
That is how the Council takes advantage of the democratic hole in the European Union, because as you know, this House only has an advisory role in this respect.
I heard a moment ago that you are in agreement with us, or at least that is what I inferred from what you said.
I should like to spell out once again, though, that the European Union is not designed for whitewashing failed national proposals.
As for content, it is for this House to decide whether or not the final proposal is proportionate.
We must assess how proportionate this limitation of communication secrecy is in terms of how much this limitation is needed.
How can we assess a proposalâs proportionality if its content is still unclear and proof that it is needed has never been given?
You said a moment ago that, if the Commission were to table a proposal on this, you would weigh up the economic consequences of such a proposal.
That is, in all honesty, a little too fast for my liking.
I would first like to see proof for such a proposal.
In other words, why is it necessary?
It has never been proven that it is.
Dutch research has shown the reverse, if anything.
The Dutch Government had kept that research secret, but our Government Information (Public Access) Act eventually obliged it to come clean.
I would now like to make a general comment on terrorism.
As I stand here, I do not feel terribly comfortable, because I have the feeling that I am giving up the fight against terrorism.
I think it is an important fight, and also think it is a disgrace that the European Council should put this House in a position where we have to stand on the brakes where proposals intended to fight terrorism are concerned.
To do so is to take advantage of our position.
I would like to discuss what we should coordinate at European level and I would like to do this in a democratic manner.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to all the Members who have spoken.
The first thought is that the Commission is trying to reconcile two great European values, which are the peopleâs right to security and the peopleâs right to have their freedoms and fundamental rights safeguarded.
I do not think these two fundamental rights are contradictory.
We in the Commission will work to show that proposals are possible which give greater security and greater freedom, that is to say greater safeguards for the fundamental right to personal data protection.
I mentioned a data protection initiative under the third pillar.
The Commission will, of course, base it on ArticleÂ 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I can briefly give Parliament a foretaste of certain principles: the principle by which processed data must be used transparently and only for specified purposes, the principle by which the interested partyâs consent is required, the principle by which the legal basis must first be established by law and therefore cannot remain uncertain, and lastly the principle by which monitoring by an independent authority is required.
These are guidelines that will enable the Commission, by the end of the year, to submit a proposal under the third pillar laying down a new generation of guarantees.
More guarantees are needed that will take account of the times and changes in technology.
As regards the initiative by the four Member States in relation to the first pillar, I have stated our intention of formulating an alternative proposal, because I am convinced that the legal basis on which those Member States have proceeded is incorrect. I have therefore also said that I will try to persuade them to withdraw their proposal.
With regard to the question on biometric information on travel documents, especially passports, I am sure that rules are needed to encrypt the most sensitive data, such as fingerprints.
This principle is contained in the actions and initiatives that the Commission is developing.
Lastly, on the subject of the joint review, I am not in a position to anticipate the results, simply because the joint review has not yet been completed.
I myself have not received any report on the outcome of the inquiry, but I confirm that I shall inform Parliament of it as soon as possible â within a few weeks, I expect, and no later than a month and a half from now.
The last topic is the âpushâ system.
We are working to convince as many non-EU countries as possible to adopt this system, which I am certain is the best.
You probably know that, during our talks, Canada agreed to start off with the push system, and I cherish a certain hope that the United States too, given a little persuasion, will come round to believing that it is the best system.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in April.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0049/2005) by Mrs Margrete Auken, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on financing Natura 2000.
Â Â  â Mr President, first and foremost, my thanks to all the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their constructive cooperation.
Immediately after the voting on Monday, I thought that perhaps the report had come to resemble a Christmas tree when a newly-married couple combine their Christmas traditions for the first time.
After more careful study, however, I can clearly see that the tree is not only decorated but also maintains a consistent theme.
Firstly, it has now been established that Natura 2000 is to be funded.
The amount is not up for negotiation.
We have international commitments, and nature will need help for the foreseeable future.
The European Environment Agency in Copenhagen has, time after time, drawn attention to the alarming situation, and we need to reverse the trend.
Consequently, to include the Commissionâs own minimum amount of EURÂ 21.35 billion for 2007-2013 in the report is merely stating facts, because this amount is not up for discussion.
We only know that if we do not get moving right away, matters will simply become more and more expensive day by day.
I have seen in Poland how huge Danish and American pig farms are spreading out over a fine and vulnerable landscape with no regard for biodiversity.
In Denmark, many farmers are bagging pollution permits in Natura 2000 areas.
As a result, they will be able to earn a pretty penny when the government wants to buy them back.
This type of behaviour must be stopped.
What is actually up for negotiation is how the money is to be obtained.
In this respect, it is pleasing that the Committee is united in believing that Natura 2000 should be incorporated not just into rural development policy, but also in a broader framework.
Just as the Commission has stated, Natura 2000 must be incorporated into all EU policies.
The committee has, however, been even more realistic than the Commission.
We mention environmental considerations generally and not just Natura 2000, and we know that the goal cannot be achieved unless amounts are earmarked in these funds and conditions introduced.
To date, we have seen little sign of environmental considerations, despite the fact it is already possible to incorporate them into the funds.
On the contrary, the funds often work against the countryside.
If, however, consideration for the countryside is integral to the way the funds are used, farmers will then have an interest in the environment and in environment-friendly farming and other production in the areas concerned, earning twice as much in the process.
I am convinced that this will heighten their sense of the wealth that biodiversity represents â including in economic terms, as the Commission has, moreover, so rightly pointed out.
There are small areas that cannot be helped via the funds.
For these, we must use the âLIFE+â dedicated fund, which is also designed to ensure that management and other organisational tasks are carried out.
More than once we emphasise the need for the rural development fund in particular â in other words, the second pillar of the common agricultural policy â to be significantly increased, if the task is to be achieved in a justifiable way and in harmony with those who are to implement it.
Naturally, we can call for more money in the budget for this purpose, but it is more relevant and realistic to obtain a considerable part of the money from the first pillar of the common agricultural policy, where the really large amounts of EU funding are committed.
We must not forget, however, that a substantial part of the amount must come from the Member States.
It is their commitment, and I believe it is important that we emphasise that the Member States have an obligation themselves and that this is not something to be funded solely by the EU.
After all, it would be appalling if we expanded the idea of the eternal existence of subsidies â as we know all too well from agricultural policy, where the Member States are now of the opinion that practically the whole thing should be paid for by the Community.
No, they must pay for this themselves.
Cofinancing by the EU is above all an important helping hand, and we expect that, in any event, half of it will be covered via the EUâs budgets and thus, primarily, via the funds.
Parliament must now have confidence that both the Commission and the Member States will comply with their responsibilities, listen to Parliament and incorporate Natura 2000 into all the relevant policies.
The heads of government made a commitment to do so in Gothenburg and on various occasions subsequently, and this is something they owe both to the citizens of the EU and to our descendants.
Â Â  Mr President, before we start this debate, I should like to ask briefly, obviously without wishing to detract from Commissioner Frattiniâs qualities, whether you know why the Commissioner for the environment is not here to take part in this very important debate on Natura 2000.
I can only deplore this and find it unacceptable.
Â Â  I am afraid I noticed you too late during the previous debate, MrsÂ Brepoels.
As you are next on the list of speakers, Commissioner, you can, if you so wish, answer MrsÂ Brepoelsâ question now.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise to the honourable Member, but I can only say that the Commissioner responsible, MrÂ Dimas, informed me that he would not be able to be present in the Chamber today because of personal commitments.
Of course, I do not know the exact nature of his commitments, but I willingly agreed to replace him.
In any case, I believe the speech I am going to make in this Chamber was drafted by his office and his Directorate-General, and Commissioner Dimas himself fully agrees with it.
The commitment made by heads of state and government in GÃ¶teborg to halt the decline in the use of biodiversity by 2010 is recognised as a key element of the EUâs sustainable development strategy.
Nature and biodiversity are included in the main priorities for action.
The successful implementation of the Natura 2000 network will be the cornerstone of the EUâs effort.
Ensuring that Natura 2000 is adequately financed is therefore one of the top priorities.
It is in that context that, on 15 July 2004, the Commission adopted its communication on the financing of Natura 2000.
The communication looked at all possible options, including the establishment of a separate fund, and concluded that the most effective approach would be to integrate the funding of Natura 2000 into existing Community financial instruments.
The new structural fund regulations now under discussion in the Council provide for the financing of Natura 2000 and also include mechanisms for guidance and control by the Commission of the programmes the Member States submit.
The Commission is aware that there is concern in Parliament about the priority Member States will give to Natura 2000 when faced with competing demands on limited budgets.
It is argued that firmer guarantees and ring-fencing of funds are needed.
The Commission cannot support such a rigid approach.
It is not possible at this stage to give a precise indication of the amounts likely to be spent annually on cofinancing Natura sites from 2007 onwards.
The needs of Member States will probably be very different.
Therefore, on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, it will be up to each Member State to decide on the requirements of its Natura 2000 network in drawing up national programmes for different funding regulations.
Nevertheless, the Commission has proposed an element of ring-fencing that will assist the second axis of Natura 2000 in land management or rural development regulations.
That requires Member States to allocate a minimum of 25% of the total for this fund to this axis, which means that at least EUR 22.75 billion will be available for land management during the 2007-2013 period.
Support from the European Parliament in safeguarding that amount will be crucial.
In preparing their structural and rural development fund programmes, the Member States will need to take note of the priorities to be identified in the strategic guidelines, which will be issued by the Commission following approval of the funding regulation.
As Natura 2000 has been clearly identified in a structural and rural development fund proposal, Natura 2000 will be identified as a Community priority in a strategic guideline for the relevant fund.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe that the report by Mrs Auken sends a very strong message to the Commission that proper funding for the Natura 2000 network is a very high priority for this Parliament too.
I am pleased that the main points of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development have been taken on board in the report.
The structural funds must be part of the funding mechanism for Natura 2000, but there must also be a clear commitment that the money will be spent on specific, authorised objectives; in other words, that the money earmarked and that the release of that money is conditional on national Natura 2000 financing plans being in place in the Member States.
Mainstreaming environmental considerations into all EU policy work is the way forward.
I welcome the integrated approach of the Commission.
One of the most important features of Natura 2000 is that it reflects that integrated approach; it puts people at the heart of the process and, in particular, people who live and work in our rural areas.
As well as aiming to stop the decline in biodiversity in Europe, Natura 2000 creates and sustains jobs, supports agriculture, forestry and rural development and provides tourism and educational opportunities.
But the truth is that support from the structural funds or the rural development budget will not be enough on its own to fund Natura 2000.
That is why it must go hand-in-hand with Life+ and a dedicated fund.
Our main concern is that we have effective funding options to ensure that this ambitious scheme to safeguard and support Europeâs natural heritage actually succeeds in its aim.
Â Â  . â âNatura 2000â is an ecological network to protect designated natural habitats, animal and plant species of communal significance.
The European Parliament owes it to the citizens of the Union that we stop the decline of biodiversity in Europe.
To reach this goal, however â as with any other large-scale enterprise â money is needed.
All the Member States, the Council, and the Commission were in agreement when they created the bird and habitat protection Directive.
Equally unanimous was our decision to build up a European network for nature protection.
Therefore let us now undertake to carry out our decision, and with our joint resources create the material conditions for it too!
In the Peopleâs Party and the Environmental Protection Committee we heartily welcomed the European Commissionâs Recommendation for financial support for the âNatura 2000â network.
The integrated approach in this case would be financed by the Regional Development Fund, the Structural Funds, and also the supplemented LIFE+ fund, however it is workable.
This could be workable, insofar as [1] the funds just named would handle nature protection goals as a real priority, [2] appropriate guarantees would be built into the provisions of the various financial instruments, [3] due to the greater number of tasks, these funds would be supplied with extra money.
Therefore we take it as given that the individual Member States will take part appropriately in financing this, and that the danger of their being knocked out by other, more economically competitive, projects will not threaten programmes targeted at safeguarding biodiversity.
The Commissionâs answers to our questions, however, have strengthened our misgivings in connection with the effectiveness of the integrated approach.
Because of this, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believes we must review this financial solution and consider a financial instrument created specially for this purpose.
I would like to thank Mrs. Margaret Auken for her work, compiling an in-depth and expert report and for giving us her fullest cooperation.
Our recommendations for compromise amendments bear witness that with common interests every party group and specialist committee moves in the same direction.
Â Â  . Mr President, just recently the Hungarian National Assembly presented a sculpture named âThe Rediscovered Europeâ as a gift to the European Parliament.
This sculpture reminds us once again that Europe is not just a continent, or a political and economic unit, but also an imaginary person.
Europe not only needs competition, development and infrastructure, but, like any woman, she also needs care in order to preserve her beauty and natural assets.
Many natural assets such as lakes, rivers, forests and fields have already been destroyed by industry, urban planning and intensive agriculture.
Now it is really our last chance to save the remaining natural sites in our Member States.
That is why the Socialist Group welcomes the Commissionâs Natura 2000 initiative without any hesitation.
We also welcome every further step to strengthen the programme.
We have consulted many environmental NGOs in Brussels and at home and have built their suggestions into our amendments.
Natura 2000 can work only with the active support of local communities, NGOs, and rank and file people â men and women, young and old, who just like the beauties of nature without any political statement.
The Socialist Group is committed to providing a clean natural environment for every European citizen.
The Commissionâs original communication envisaged EURÂ 6.1Â billion per year for the project.
We considered it a brave and encouraging step.
Later, we heard that, due to co-financing, the Member States would have to cover half of that sum.
For new Member States like my country, Hungary, it is not easy to secure money, but we are committed to doing our best to save our unique and untouched natural sites.
However, at least half of the sum should be guaranteed by the EU, which is why I have tabled an amendment to ensure that at least the minimum sum of EURÂ 3.05Â billion per year, or EURÂ 25.35Â billion between 2006 and 2013, is guaranteed by the Commission.
On Monday evening, the amendment was carried unanimously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
It is very sad to see that the PPE-DE Group has changed its mind once more and wants to delete the reference to a concrete sum in the report.
I am very disappointed by that approach.
Without money, we can tell fairy tales for 1001 nights, but not a single tree or one square metre of a lake will be spared from destruction.
The Socialist Group keeps to a straight path and we do not change our standpoint from one day to the next.
We support the report as it has already been accepted by the Environment Committee, and ask other Groups to also say ânoâ to those who try to start cutting the budget for nature and the future of Europeâs environmental assets.
The voting list for tomorrow will speak for itself.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, find it regrettable that Commissioner Dimas is not here, but I would like to thank Commissioner Frattini for agreeing to be present for a debate that does not really fall within his competence.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, our rapporteur, MrsÂ Auken, most sincerely on the quality of her report and also, I would like to say, for her tenacity in defending our common objectives.
Tomorrow's vote, as I am sure we all appreciate, is crucial.
NaturaÂ 2000 is the main tool for protecting biodiversity and endangered species in the EU.
Despite the slow pace taken by certain Member States, the local administrations and players have set to work.
Today, NaturaÂ 2000 covers more than 18Â 000Â sites, 64Â million hectares and nearly 15% of the landmass of Europe.
With regard to the issue of financing, yes, we must guarantee the viability of the financing, of the co-financing, of NaturaÂ 2000 by turning, as the Commission proposes, to existing sector financing instruments: the CAP Rural Development Fund and the Structural Funds.
The integrated approach is certainly the most logical one in this regard, and we must now follow this logical path to its end and ensure that it is made compulsory to include NaturaÂ 2000 in the funds in question.
This is also the main criticism being levelled at you, Commissioner, by the players on the ground and which is supported by no fewer than 15 Member States and the European Parliament: as NaturaÂ 2000 is by definition a concrete example of local governance, it is clear that, if local councillors and officials are not compelled to clearly promote the conservation of habitats and species in special areas, the money will be used for completely different things, for example road construction or the implementation of social or economic development projects.
This is what is said in the important point 8 of our resolution, which our group strongly supports.
Finally, we are also in favour of point 5, which calls on the Commission to make a commitment to amend the new financial instrument LIFEÂ + to include a specific item on 'nature conservation' and also to guarantee a minimum amount for NaturaÂ 2000 in the next financial perspectives, an amount which, as for other European policies, must match up to our ambitions.
Those ambitions are clear: for all of us to endeavour to protect the environment.
Mr President, I have a point of order that relates to the French translation and is important for tomorrow's vote in plenary.
If I am not mistaken, and I do not think I am, the French translation is incomplete. I am referring to point 5, which is a crucial point, as I have just said, since it relates to financing and to the level of that financing.
I think that the English translation, which is the other text that I have here, must refer to this matter, because it is seven lines longer than the French translation and those seven lines make specific reference to what I have just mentioned, in particular the proposed minimum amount of EUR 21.35 billion.
I therefore think that we will need to point out tomorrow that seven lines are missing at the end of the French text.
We also need to be told which language version is authentic.
Â Â  Many thanks for pointing this out, MrsÂ Ries.
Your comment has been noted, and we will ensure that the French version is also complete.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to start by congratulating Mrs Auken on her excellent report which raises the real issues of NaturaÂ 2000.
In contrast, I am quite stunned but I am not holding it against you, Commissioner by the text that you read to us giving the Commission's position.
Indeed, I have the impression that Mr Dimas has sent you into battle and is washing his hands of it, because, when it comes down to it, we have not learned anything new that the Commissioner did not reveal to us two weeks ago.
The issue being raised which is the subject of MrsÂ Auken's report is the financing of NaturaÂ 2000.
In your explanation, though, the Commission has once again failed to state that it will guarantee the financing of NaturaÂ 2000 for seven years.
Our fellow Member is right to ask about the figure.
These are not fantasy figures, produced by NGOs that may have taken certain liberties.
No, the figure comes from the Commission, which has estimated the costs of managing NaturaÂ 2000 as at least EUR 6.1 billion per year.
I really do not understand why you cannot assure the European Parliament that the Commission will fully guarantee three billion per year of EU funding.
The proposal you are putting forward does not guarantee that.
Thus, we are no further forward today than we were two weeks ago, and we would like to have a response from the Commission.
Â Â  .
Mr President, before turning to the question of Natura 2000 itself, I would like to raise an objection to the way in which the Committee on Regional Development was bulldozed into an emergency meeting on this matter on Monday night.
There was very little time to consider.
We were told there would be an enormous outlay of EURÂ 6Â billion, and now the Commissioner says that a minimum of EURÂ 22.75Â billion will be made available for the 2006-2013 period.
To compound matters, there was only one translation available, in English.
I was disappointed to see the Committee on Regional Development voting in favour, although it did not do so unanimously, as Mr Hegyi stated, as I and several others voted against.
This episode is a perfect illustration of the cavalier way in which this Parliament too often goes about its business, and that is no laughing matter given the profound effect the EU has on peopleâs daily lives.
Natura 2000 is a case in point.
Although we all appreciate that the environment is very important, the livelihood of human beings has to be the priority.
Natura 2000 has had a negative effect in this regard.
Let me give a good example from the Czech Republic, where an area has been designated to create feeding habitats favourable to partridges and quails and to reduce the erosion of soil and nutrients.
My Czech colleagues tell me that this has been very good for the quails, but disastrous for the human beings who live and work there!
In the United Kingdom too, chalk downland, dry bog and hedgerows have been destroyed in the name of EU standardisation.
The Habitats Directive, from which Natura 2000 derives, seeks to establish a common framework for nature protection as though wildlife were subject to academic theory.
Nature, by definition, cannot be standardised, nor can real human lives, which is why UKIP opposes the dead hand of the EU wherever its grip extends.
Â Â  Mr President, I mentioned in my speech the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, of which I am a member.
That committee voted unanimously on the report.
I did not mention the Committee on Regional Development, so I was not mistaken.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
Ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that the NaturaÂ 2000 programme is a cornerstone of the European Unionâs efforts to protect biodiversity.
The debate initiated by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in this House on the impact of the programme and how it should be financed is therefore extremely important.
The benefits derived by the public from this programme are indisputable.
The most significant come under the heading of public health, yet it should not be forgotten that tourism has also been boosted and job opportunities created.
It is estimated that 125Â 000Â jobs have been created in the 15Â old Member States alone.
For a number of years, however, it has been apparent that developments in the NaturaÂ 2000 network in Europe have not been backed up by appropriate funding for the creation and maintenance of this network.
Admittedly, the European Commission has announced that it will adopt a strategic approach to financing the programme.
What worries me, however, is that the proposal to cofinance the NaturaÂ 2000 network from various sources, for example the Rural Development Fund, the Structural Funds and LIFE+, the financial instrument for the environment, will make it impossible for theÂ network to be implemented in a comprehensive, coherent and timely fashion.
The fact that potential beneficiaries will need to apply for money from various funds will undoubtedly make it harder to obtain funding for specific protection measures.
It will also become more difficult to monitor the implementation of the network at national level.
According to the criteria currently used, certain areas do not qualify for funding under the various structural instruments.
The latter have a number of different aims, which frequently relate to various types of land use, and sometimes even to specific regions.
Separate funding is therefore needed to ensure that the NaturaÂ 2000 network can be established.
If this money is not safeguarded, there may be gaps in the networkâs funding during the next Financial Perspective, which covers the period from 2007 to 2013, and this could mean that a large number of protective measures are not implemented.
As an example, in my country, Poland, most of the land that is covered by the NaturaÂ 2000 programme does not qualify for the above-mentioned funds, either because the land is part of the national forests, or because it is not used for agriculture.
It is for this reason that I hope that appropriate funding will be earmarked to support the establishment of the NaturaÂ 2000 network during work on the next Financial Perspective.
I thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am sorry to say that, despite all MrsÂ Auken's efforts to improve the document, we are not doing well.
I say this because I have never seen an initiative like Natura 2000 which has been backed by all MEPs and political groups and yet generated so much confusion, and in many cases, conflicting positions.
Why is this?
Because the document itself is poor.
It is a document born of good intentions, but technically speaking it is incomplete and muddled.
Firstly, because it fails to distinguish between the different categories covered by Natura 2000: for example, between forests and agricultural land â the vast majority â where the land is farmed or a protected natural environment, as opposed to rivers, the sea and the sea bed.
It would be folly to envisage applying rural development to the sea bed.
How would it be funded?
The same problem arises in the case of rivers and wetlands.
The different categories are not clearly defined, nor is the subject of funding dealt with clearly.
For example, we see that the Structural Funds rules would need to be changed in order to finance Natura 2000, but the Structural Funds are based on statistics rather than qualitative terms, as is the case with Natura 2000.
At the same time, when funding rural development, there should be an initial awareness-raising campaign because, in reality, environmental concerns and agriculture are relatively incompatible, and because the policy underlying Natura 2000 caused many landowners to lose land or have their activities curtailed.
In addition, there has been no work to assess the extent to which rural development contains environmental elements that could be used to get farmers enthused about future landscape conservation and environmental projects.
Unfortunately, as a result, this document has not been returned to the Committee, despite the importance of the subject to this Parliament and the good faith currently being demonstrated by its actions.
In my view, both Parliament and biodiversity deserve a better document.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, in order to guarantee funding for Natura 2000, we need to be practical.
We have spent a lot of time working on the subject in this Parliament, and as everyone has said, we are very concerned about the future of the Natura 2000 network.
Three months ago, I had an opportunity to meet MrsÂ Day, the Director-General of DG Environment.
At the time, Mrs Day made it clear that she had no plans to create a special fund for Natura 2000, no matter how legitimate requests from this House might be.
The Socialist Group is therefore supporting the compromise solution agreed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
It is an agreement which still allows for cofinancing or the creation of a separate fund whilst also leaving an extremely attractive option open within the new LIFE+ programme for all those activities that cannot be classified under rural development in their own right.
In view of this, I would like to make an appeal for tomorrow's vote.
My Group does not understand the last-minute amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group.
We do not understand because we do not feel it is worth creating division at the eleventh hour and throwing away the huge efforts made on all sides within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
We need to ratify the position.
At the same time, we are also very pleased that the text to be voted on tomorrow includes a reference to the principle of proportionality when allocating funding, whereby, given that the network benefits the Union as a whole, countries such as my own, which have much greater biological diversity and more extensive protected areas, will not be required to shoulder greater costs.
We would like to remind the Commission of this principle, although it is already enshrined in the Habitat Directive.
The Natura 2000 network is one of the best moves made since the Union's inception.
For this very reason we must continue to support the programme at Community level, working closely with the Member States.
We are not opposed to cofinancing, but we are extremely concerned about the future of the network, particularly as many parts of the network are still unprotected at the moment.
I call on the House to endorse the work done made by the Environment Committee, and in particular paragraphÂ 5.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, although I have every sympathy for you, I must tell you that we find it very regrettable that Commissioner Dimas is not here, because, during the last session in Strasbourg, we were not satisfied by the answers he gave us and we would have liked to express our dissatisfaction to him once again.
NaturaÂ 2000 is a compulsory policy within the framework of preservation of biodiversity, and we are obliged to implement it.
The European Commission proposes to finance NaturaÂ 2000 by integrating it in the ERDF fund and in the rural development fund.
In my opinion, this constitutes a twofold error, because, even if the concept of transversality is a good one, in practice it is completely unrealistic.
The European Union's priority is, quite rightly, growth and employment, and one could wonder what the weighting of matters relating to biodiversity will be in comparison with economic development projects.
It is therefore unrealistic to integrate this financing into the Structural Funds or the rural development fund.
How can we guarantee that NaturaÂ 2000 will get the funds it needs?
The members of the Committee on Agriculture, and those of the Committee on Regional Development, consider that there is a risk that this will also have a detrimental effect on the financing guarantees for those funds.
We have thus all reached the same position: we consider that, under those conditions, NaturaÂ 2000 will not be financed correctly.
Furthermore, some NaturaÂ 2000 areas are neither agricultural nor forested, and are not covered by either the Structural Funds or the rural development fund.
In this case, these classified areas will not get any Community funding.
How will we explain to the owners of this land, on which NaturaÂ 2000 classification has been imposed, that they will not benefit from the financial instruments?
In our opinion, only the creation of a specific fund will make it possible to guarantee that all land classified under NaturaÂ 2000 can obtain Community co-financing.
We call for this fund to be implemented as part of the new LIFEÂ + instrument, because we cannot talk constantly about biodiversity within the framework of sustainable development and at the same time dangerously compromise those few financial instruments that make it possible to act to promote biodiversity.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too would like to congratulate MrsÂ Auken on her excellent work, especially since she has incorporated nearly all of the proposals made by the Committee on Regional Development.
Commissioner, we are concerned about the funding for Natura 2000.
We agree with the strategic approach, but we also want to ensure adequate funding for Natura 2000, and we fear that if environmental projects have to compete for funding against other projects of greater socio-economic interest, they may well come off badly, especially when â as you yourself have said â the budget available is limited.
We are definitely in favour of paragraph 5, because this opens the way for providing appropriate funding for Natura 2000 using a specific instrument within LIFE+, or of course, by increasing the Structural Funds and rural development funding to include a separate section for Natura 2000.
We therefore ask the Commission to take this report into consideration since it covers all the factors which provide stability and genuinely guarantee appropriate levels of funding for Natura 2000.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, noÂ one would argue with the fact that Natura 2000 is an extremely ambitious programme with demanding targets.
It does a great deal to protect nature and the environment, and is also highly regarded by the public.
The land we value so highly was developed and cultivated and is now maintained by European farmers, forestry workers and landowners, and safeguarding this land is also a key goal of Natura 2000.
Appropriate funding must be guaranteed if we are to achieve these ambitious goals.
Although Natura 2000 has been in existence for a number of years, and even though landowners have had to tolerate certain restrictions for a great many years, this is the first time that thought has been given to appropriate financing at European level.
The Commission is proposing that the Natura 2000 network be cofinanced under the Rural Development Fund and the Structural Funds.
As rapporteur for rural development, I must stress the need for a guarantee that Natura 2000 really will be financed under both funds, which will mean that we will need a larger budget for rural development.
The property rights of our farmers and landowners must not be encroached upon without a guarantee of full financial compensation.
Unless we safeguard funding in the long term, levels of uncertainty will continue to rise.
Commissioner, as a result of the decisions taken at Brussels, which included a cap on the agriculture budget until 2013, and following CAP reform, which moved funding for modulation from the first to the second pillar â or in other words to cofinancing for rural development â the priority must be to ensure that landowners and farmers in particular get compensation for their efforts.
We farmers have declared our support for sustainable agriculture.
More Europe cannot be achieved with less money, especially not now there are 25Â Member States.
Â Â  It is evident that the funding of the Natura 2000 network is still very precarious.
As you have already heard, we have no problem as such with the integrated approach, as long as the Commission provides firm guarantees or guidelines, which are currently lacking, and, if I have understood the Commissioner correctly, will be lacking for some time.
Funding, though, is a very important matter; this House has done its level best and has made every effort to convince the Commission that playing Pontius Pilate is all too easy an option.
Putting things into practice is a different matter altogether, though.
When we return home on Friday and a local government, farmer, environmental association or, indeed, our neighbour asks what we have agreed on, what it means to them in concrete terms and how things should progress from here on, we will be unable to give a reply.
Yet, it is important to create a solid social support base to set up the Natura 2000 network.
Since the procedure for the implementation of the Bird and Habitat Directives was carried out without input from the public, we are still â in my country at least â waiting for its publication, because it is a very sensitive issue politically speaking.
If we want to give Natura 2000 a fighting chance and not again give people the impression that the matter is being decided from the top down, it is important to inform them as soon, and as accurately, as possible about the implications of this decision.
To the public, it really makes no difference whether the funds are sourced from a special fund, a structural fund or a rural development fund.
What they do want to know is whether, and by whom, they will be compensated if certain things are no longer allowed or if their land has been reduced in value.
Questions such as âAm I allowed to build a house?â and, in the case of agricultural land, âwhat about the fertiliser issue?â will most certainly surface.
It therefore follows that the Commission must communicate in plain terms as quickly as possible.
There is too much uncertainty, which certainly does not benefit the environment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall probably not succeed in giving all the answers that Members are expecting, but I shall try at least to give some clarification.
It is obvious that the need for adequate funding for the Natura 2000 programme is something that the Commission accepts.
It is also obvious that, as the rapporteur said, Natura 2000 falls within the scope of European Union cofinancing.
First of all, we have to see how to guarantee this funding.
On behalf of the Commission, I can assure you that financing Natura 2000 from existing funds will be made even more effective.
That will be possible because the priority of financing Natura 2000 will be included in the strategic guidelines relating to the various funds designed to finance the initiatives which are soon to be presented by the Commission and which will help the Member States in presenting their programmes.
We believe that, by placing this priority right among the strategic guidelines, we shall be able to adequately guarantee its financing.
Secondly, we have to see how the Commission can contribute to the appropriate use of the available funds.
I can tell you that by the end of this year the Commission will publish a guidance manual designed to explain the funding procedures for Natura 2000, while in 2006 workshops will be organised in every Member State to explain the funding opportunities.
The Commission is committed to launching these initiatives, which are intended to encourage the submission of programmes that can be effective and will thus meet the requirements for obtaining finance.
Some speakers underlined the possibility of using the Life+ programme.
That programme does not exclude the funding of specific initiatives included within the Natura 2000 network.
In that respect I can mention just a few examples.
There are certain actions that the Commission considers can be financed through Life+, for instance initiatives in the field of communication, support for setting up local partnerships for the specific promotion of areas and sites that are part of the Natura 2000 network, the development of initiatives relating to the marine environment, which is an extremely important aspect, and innovative schemes for protecting animal or plant species.
These are just a few examples that show how, in the Commissionâs view, even Life+ can be used to finance Natura 2000.
Lastly, I would recall the possibility of financially supporting marine sites.
You are aware that the Commissionâs proposal on the European Fisheries Fund does not specifically mention the Natura 2000 sites.
The Commission understands, however, that this proposal allows for the possibility of supporting activities designed to develop the marine environment.
In that spirit, therefore, the possibility of financing activities that promote the marine environment will be considered.
I believe that the points I have mentioned provide at least some further reassurance that the Commission certainly does not intend to call the priority of Natura 2000 funding into question.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would simply like to say that it is now extremely clear to me how wrong it is that it is not Mr Dimas who is here.
We have simply heard someone reel off the options that exist within the existing sources of funding â something with which we were already very familiar.
That was already established at the outset.
What we drew attention to is the fact that if no commitments are introduced, matters will not work.
All our previous experience shows that such opportunities are not utilised.
It is rather disappointing that the Commission stands here giving us a lecture on the options that currently exist instead of answering the questions put in the course of the debate.
I am well aware that Mr Frattini is not in a position to do that, but to send a Commissioner who is not responsible for this area and who can therefore only make general comments is not the right way to treat Parliament.
Â Â  Commissioner Frattini has also convinced me of his expertise on Natura 2000.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Commission by JosephÂ Daul and Jean-ClaudeÂ Fruteau, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the forthcoming reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar (B6-0013/2005).
Â Â  Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and as a sugar producer and grower, I will not be taking part in the final vote today.
However, I will take part in the debate.
That does not necessarily apply to the Commission proposals when they come out.
But today I will not be voting in the final vote.
Â Â  I take note of what you have said.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Fruteau, I shall be very brief, because I am anxious to give my friend Mr Fruteau, who has written the report, the speaking time which he needs.
I should simply like, Commissioner, to mention three points.
First of all, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Parliament, by means of the vote which will follow at midday, are asking you for market management via a system of quotas and a safety net in order to avoid a drastic fall in prices.
Secondly, we very much hope that this reform will make it possible to establish a market organisation which will foreshadow a new way of approaching our relations with third countries, and in particular the ACP countries, with which we are linked through the sugar protocol.
I am against the liberalisation of agricultural products at any price: it is the sort of dogmatism that can only lead to disaster.
I would like there to be regulatory tools making it possible to stabilise prices within the European Union and at the level of the international economy.
That is why, Commissioner, together with my fellow MEPs, I believe that we should have instruments prohibiting triangular trade between competitive countries such as Brazil, poor countries and the European Union.
We need to keep an eye on this type of trade which is in the process of becoming established, both in the context of the GSP and in the context of the new organisation of the sugar market.
Thirdly, I should like to draw your attention to the difficulties which the Community sugar market is currently experiencing.
According to my information, the sugar surplus in the European Union is 850 000 tonnes compared with last year.
It seems that these stocks are the result of incorrect assessments of available stocks and of consumption in certain Member States.
This has given rise to unusual trade flows.
In these circumstances, Commissioner, an in-depth study should be carried out into this illogical solution which is currently in place on the Community sugar market, in order to determine the cause and find a way of managing this problem.
That is what I wanted to tell you on the three points with which we are concerned.
I shall now leave the rest of my speaking time to MrÂ Fruteau, who has worked very hard on this dossier.
Ladies and gentlemen, of course, after this speech, I am asking you to adopt the resolution, which has been approved, practically unanimously, by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 21 February the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, by 31 votes out of 35, adopted a common position on the reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar.
This large majority demonstrates the degree of equilibrium which we achieved and which takes into account the opinions of most of the political groups and nationalities represented in this House.
The subject is a complex one.
On the one hand, bearing in mind the international economic context, the reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar is now necessary and unavoidable.
On the other hand, however, it must not neglect the position and the future of the men and women who depend on this sector, both in Europe and in the countries that are our trading partners.
From this point of view, the draft resolution lays down clear guiding principles: adjusting the sugar COM in line with the rules of world trade, increasing the competitiveness of the sugar sector, guaranteeing a decent standard of living for those engaged in the sector â a social objective â either by enabling them to keep their jobs or, if necessary, retraining them, and at the same time complying with the principle of Community solidarity which takes account of the most vulnerable regions and States within the Union and also our historical trading partners, the ACP countries and the least-developed countries.
In order to respond to these demands, we need to define four principal themes which will guide the future reform of this sector.
First of all, as far as the timetable is concerned, the forthcoming reform must remain effective until the end of 2012, so that those engaged in the sector can have the long-term outlook which they need if their investments are to succeed.
Secondly, the lowering of prices and quotas must be limited to what is strictly necessary in order to take into account the interests of European farmers.
It must also be backed up by a level of compensation which really corresponds to what is needed.
Finally, as a replacement for the quota transfer mechanism, which is unfair and destructive for the most vulnerable countries, the resolution proposes the setting up of a special fund, managed by Europe and budget-neutral, which will make it possible to organise the restructuring of the sector.
Fourthly, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have at last come out strongly in favour of a system of market regulation which makes use, in particular, of an adaptation of the âEverything but Armsâ initiative in the sugar sector.
This major theme is aimed at maintaining the consistency and viability of the COM by requiring the European Union to be in a position to retain control of the supply of sugar on its market, while at the same time responding to repeated requests by the least-developed countries themselves, who are well aware that the illegal triangular trade which may be encouraged by unlimited access to the European market will not provide any profit for the development of the economic and social structures in the least-developed countries.
Finally, together with these four main themes, the draft resolution emphasises the need to take into consideration the special situation of the extremely remote areas of the Union, looking at their geographical and structural constraints as well as their specific economic and productive development needs.
Emphasising the important and irreplaceable role which the growing of sugar cane plays in some of those regions, the report comes down heavily in favour of total compensation for any loss of revenue which overseas farmers might suffer and demands, equally firmly, that the essential mechanism of marketing aid should be retained.
Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the current blockages to which the Commissionâs radical measures have given rise within the Council of Ministers, only the European Parliament is currently in a position to act as the driving force in defining the detailed rules for the implementation of the sugar COM.
This is the ambition of our report, which adopts a position which I regard as balanced, consistent and proactive, and tending towards a reform which will be effective but also based on solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Daul, Mr Fruteau and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have done.
The drafting of the resolution and the hearing on 30 November last year make valuable contributions to our thorough preparations for this important reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar.
Allow me to make a few introductory remarks before responding to your questions.
The need for reform of the sugar sector is inevitable.
Based on the consultations I have had with stakeholders in recent months, it is my clear impression that this view is widely shared.
The question is âhow farâ and âhow fastâ we should move.
I sincerely believe that we need an ambitious reform.
I should now like to make a few comments on the major issues you raised in your resolution.
With regard to price and quota cuts, I am convinced that there is a future for sugar production within the European Union, but that it must be based on competitiveness.
We therefore need to accept that sugar production should be concentrated in the areas where it has a sustainable long-term perspective.
The price cuts proposed in the communication will keep us well below current world market prices.
I am therefore convinced that the proposed 33% price cut and the 2.8Â million quota cut are a necessary minimum to achieve an effective reform, balance the market and respect our international obligations.
The less thorough we are now, the more likely it is that we will have to reform again in the near future, with ensuing uncertainty for the sector.
It is clear that the reform will force farmers and producers to take important, and sometimes difficult, decisions about their future in the sector.
We have to offer them a clear outlook.
I therefore consider predictability to be a key issue.
I have taken good note that this is a concern shared by Parliament.
I therefore do not intend to include the idea of a mid-term review in two or three years in the legislative proposal.
Instead, a long-term perspective will be offered.
Farmers will receive compensation equal to 60% percent of the reduction in the institutional price, through the single farm payment scheme.
This will offset the loss in revenue.
Past experience shows that income loss at farm level does not equal the price cut.
That is especially true for sugar, where the farmers will no longer carry the cost of the production levy.
In any case, the reform needs to be budget-neutral, which limits the degree of compensation.
If we go beyond 60% then other sectors will have to pay, through a reduction in their direct payment.
With regard to the quota transfer between Member States, the communication introduces this as one of the key elements in driving the necessary restructuring within the sugar industry.
Quota transfers could facilitate production moving to regions where the production conditions are best, and at the same time provide regions that are not competitive with an opportunity to give up their quota and invest the proceeds in alternative economically viable activities.
Your concerns about the quota transfer have not gone unnoticed.
If our objectives can be achieved through alternative instruments then that deserves thorough consideration.
I have been particularly interested in the ideas put forward in the resolution on making the transfer subject to some degree of control by Member States and farmers, and on the setting-up of a special fund.
I am currently exploring those ideas.
The creation of a specific fund forms a particularly important element of my reflections.
Let me be very clear on the âEverything but Armsâ â EBA â initiative, which is one of the cornerstones of our trade relations with the least-developed countries, the LDCs.
It was the result of an unprecedented unilateral concession made by the European Union, and a logical step given our commitment to the development of these countries.
It would be a wrong signal to roll back our privileges to the LDCs, particularly in a year where we are trying to convince the rest of the developed world to follow our example and increase market access to developing countries.
I am therefore against a renegotiation of the EBA initiative.
Furthermore, a system with regulated imports at remunerative prices would lead to a price reduction which is too small and thus inefficient.
We should not give incentives for unsustainable investments within the EU or in Third World countries.
We recognise that the sugar reform will imply certain adjustments of the sugar sector in the ACP countries concerned, but we have also clearly indicated that we are prepared to accompany this process.
On the basis of an action plan the Commission presented on 24 January, a dialogue with the ACP countries is currently taking place.
It is the Commissionâs intention to submit the final action plan on accompanying measures in the form of a communication to the European Parliament and the Council in mid-2005.
The last point I want to address is the WTO.
The final ruling of the WTO Appellate Body is fixed for 28Â AprilÂ 2005.
Our reform proposal will take due account of its outcome, and with that we will have brought the common market organisation for sugar into line with our existing WTO obligations.
Let me conclude with the timetable.
For internal and external reasons I consider it absolutely necessary to reach an agreement on the sugar reform by November at the latest.
In fact, the current sugar regime expires on 1Â JulyÂ 2006.
The sector has to know sufficiently in advance what the new sugar regime looks like in order to make their decisions for the common marketing year 2006-2007.
Furthermore, we have a clear interest to indicate to our WTO ministerial partners, before the conference in December this year, what the basic elements of our sugar reform are.
Otherwise we run the risk of the sugar issue spoiling the Hong Kong meeting in the same way that cotton did the CancÃºn meeting.
The UK presidency has scheduled discussions in the Council in order to reach final political agreement in the November Council.
To meet this timeframe I will present the legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council by the summer.
I know that I can count on your cooperation to make this timetable possible.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish particularly to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, and the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Mr Daul, for the excellence of their cooperation on the motion for a resolution on the reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar.
I also, however, want to thank all the other Members of the House who have made constructive contributions to making this motion for a resolution what it is.
On my travels around my electoral district in Bavaria, sugar beet farmers ask me why it is necessary to amend, root and branch, the market organisation for sugar, which has stood the test of decades.
The farmers and workers concerned are very disappointed by the Commissionâs proposals of 14 July 2004.
I then explain to them that the market organisation needs to be reformed in order that sugar beet may continue to be cultivated in Europe in the future.
What we want our motion for a resolution to achieve, Commissioner, is that sugar beet may in future continue to be grown in the European Union and sugar cane in its border areas, with sugar factories continuing to produce sugar.
This concerns 350Â 000 farming families in Europe, and 230 sugar factories with an untold number of employees.
The Commissionâs proposals go too far; in many European regions, sustainable cultivation of sugar beet would be a thing of the past, and sugar cane would no longer be grown in the border areas.
The only beneficiaries from the reform would be a few major sugar-growing countries such as Brazil, which, in contrast to the EU Member States, invariably produce their crops to very low environmental and social standards.
Our environmental organisations would scream blue murder if, in Europe â as happens in countries such as Brazil â whole rivers were to be pumped dry in order to irrigate land, and if hundreds of thousands of hectares of land were to be burned off, with the animals living there having no chance whatever of escaping the flames.
Such a way of producing sugar cannot be the yardstick against which European sugar production is to be compared.
The argument that consumers in Europe would stand to gain from reduced sugar prices is one that leaves me cold, for, although cereals now cost not even one-third of what they did 40 years ago, the price of bread has multiplied over the same period of time.
The EUâs Council of Agriculture Ministers, at its meeting on 18Â NovemberÂ 1997, described the multifunctional tasks of European agriculture in the following terms: âThe Council believes that European commercial farming must be multifunctional, sustainable, competitive and spread throughout Europe.
It must be capable of caring for the countryside, maintaining the natural environment, making a substantial contribution to the vitality of rural areas and meeting consumersâ needs and requirements in terms of the quality and safety of food, and the protection of the environment and of animals.â
If you want that sort of multifunctional agriculture in Europe, then you have to grant it protection accordingly.
We therefore call for imported sugar to be produced subject to the same social and environmental standards as sugar produced in the EU.
We urge the Commission to comply with the demands of the ACP states and give consideration to how the EU, using a regulation for this purpose as part of the âEverything but Armsâ initiative, can continue in future to manage the quantity of sugar supplied.
We also expect the Commissionâs legislative proposal to contain explicit proposals on how to prevent what is termed âtriangular tradeâ being carried on through the least-developed countries.
Let me close by adding that I would not want to see a global market in which production lacked the environmental dimension.
I do not want a global market that exploits people and entire regions.
I urge you to give the motion for a resolution a broad majority, and thereby get the Commission to incorporate our demands in its legislative proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, nobody in this Parliament questions the need for reform in the sugar sector.
You explained the reasons why it is necessary very well in your speech.
What we do question, however, is the proposal presented by the Commission and, from my point of view, there are two fundamental reasons for this: firstly, because it creates an unbalanced distribution of reductions within the European Union, placing the burden on the least-favoured regions; and, secondly, because it does not guarantee that the income of producers of beet will be maintained.
In fact, in my country, Spain, its application would mean, in practice, the disappearance of much of the 118Â 000 hectares of crops in Castilla y LeÃ³n, in AndalucÃ­a and in Castilla-La Mancha, and would affect 23Â 000 producers.
The problem, once again, Commissioner, is that the Commission is presenting proposals despite the fact that the impact study has not taken account either of the effects of these reductions in prices and quotas on the incomes of family farms, or of the loss of jobs in the industry and its affect on the rural life of the States in question.
Commissioner, we believe that the reduction in prices should be smaller and more gradual, and should remain coupled to a significant proportion of the aid in order not to unravel the economic and social fabric of the producing areas, which, in my country, are located in the least prosperous regions.
Furthermore, the reduction in quotas should begin with surplus quantities and those intended for export, which do most damage to the international market in this product.
We are completely against - and I would put it that strongly â the transfer of quotas between Member States.
We believe that this method would produce, or could produce, a relocation of jobs and economic activity within the European Union, which would create the greatest imbalance in the least competitive States, and would create a dangerous precedent within the CAP.
With regard to the external element of the proposal, the âEverything but Armsâ (EBA) initiative should include quantitative instruments for controlling imports similar to those that already exist for ACP countries.
That is what the representatives of the ACP countries and of the LDCs are asking for, and this is fully reflected in our resolution.
I would like to end, Commissioner, by asking you to take account of something that both Mr Daul and MrÂ Fruteau, my two fellow rapporteurs for this proposal, have said: this resolution has been approved with a broad consensus in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development; so please present suitable legislative proposals that reflect the observations made in it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I should like to call for us to have the EUâs common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector reformed as soon as possible and the way prepared for a liberalisation of the whole market in sugar.
The reforms have been a long time in preparation.
This gives rise to uncertainty as to how long the present arrangements will last and, especially, as to when they will be changed.
European sugar producers are ill served by this uncertainty.
I therefore welcome a final settlement concerning the organisation of the markets in the sugar sector.
The WTO has pronounced its judgment upon the organisation of the sugar markets â a judgment that calls upon us to get something done about it.
I also agree, of course, that we must wait for the appeal over the next two months, but we need to accept the consequences of this appeal once its result is made known.
European sugar production is both efficient and competitive.
Some changes will of course occur, especially regarding where production will take place in future.
It is very important, however, for us to make it possible for production and, thus, also the quotas, to move to where production is best and thus also cheapest.
That is the very best we can do for the European sugar producers, while we of course have a duty to equip producers to face the competition that exists in the world market.
We must not disregard the concerns expressed either in the EBA agreement or by the worldâs poorest countries.
The latter have arranged their production in accordance with an artificial price in the European market, and they must naturally be helped in the transitional period that will exist on the way to freer competition in the world market.
It is no help, however, sticking to the present arrangements so that they can sell what they produce at artificially high prices in the EUâs internal market.
In fact, quite the reverse is true.
Last but not least, it is of the greatest importance for us to ensure that every country in the world removes its subsidy for sugar production so that there can be competition in a free and fair market.
We must of course demand that imported sugar be produced in accordance with the same social and environmental standards for sugar production with which we are familiar in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commissioner spoke of the need for reform, and I agree with her; the common market organisation for sugar has itself been corrupted by the sugar industry, which was geared to consumption plus privileged access for sugar from the ACP countries.
A situation then developed in which C sugar, too, was, in effect, dumped on the global market, and in which the quantity of sugar arriving from the ACP countries was re-exported, which cost the budget another EURÂ 1.5Â billion.
You say, though, that you want to cut the quantity by 1.8Â million tonnes.
If we include the C sugar, the cut will have to be by between 4 and 5 million tonnes, which will end up on the global market.
It follows that you must reduce quantity rather than price.
We can accept a reduction in price, but, if you are proposing 33% without allocating a quota to the least-developed countries â something that does not go against the rules that we have, but simply prevents them from becoming transit countries â then this 33% is not enough, for, even under these conditions, the multinationals will use these countries as transit routes through which to dump their sugar back in the European Union.
It follows that you will have to cut the price again to make that less appealing, so it would be better if you were to describe this as liberalisation, without beating about the bush.
If you want to maintain a market organisation, you have to get to grips with what matters â the quantities rather than the prices.
I am strongly opposed to bonuses being paid for the reduction in quantity that I regard as perversion and for which the sugar industry itself bears responsibility.
It makes no sense, and does not benefit the farmers, for these 1.3 or 1.5 billion to be paid out as bonuses â they are swallowed up and do not benefit the farms.
Instead, what matters is that the sugar business should be arranged in such a way that the cultivation of sugar makes money.
That does not happen with C sugar, and that is why C sugar must no longer be allowed on the global market.
Farmers can do with it whatever they like â anything, that is, other than dumping it on the global market.
That is something we have to lay down, and what we have to do with the EURÂ 1.3 billion that are not going to be used as a bonus is to put them in a fund for the development of the rural economy and for diversification in the least-developed countries and in the ACP countries, in order to enable their economies to develop.
Nor does it make any sense whatsoever to compensate these countries, for if they are compensated for no longer making any money out of sugar, from what are they meant to fund their economic development?
We put money into these countries, and we have to put it to work â not by paying it as compensation, but by initiating economic development, by making them dependent on things other than sugar, enabling them to earn money by supplying sugar to the European Union with the preferences and quotas that they have, whilst at the same time enabling them to provide for themselves and promoting rural development in the artisanal and technical spheres.
It would be a forward-looking strategy if we were to use the market organisation for sugar as a means to come up with a development strategy and to consider the fundamentals of the shape global trade should take.
Liberalising tendencies are present in all our political groups; that much is apparent from the amendments, including those from my own group, and you, Commissioner Fischer Boel, are â perhaps without even wanting to â making concessions to those tendencies by having to take the next step in five yearsâ time, when you will, in essence, be doing away with the organisation of the markets in sugar.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Commission proposal for the new sugar regulation and today's statements by the Commissioner basically come within the framework of the reform of the CAP â even if she does not admit as much â and, of course, of the spending cuts on agriculture.
The proposed 33% reductions in quotas and prices and the abolition of intervention and intervention prices will cause unemployment casualties on small and medium-sized farms and in sugar factories.
The drastic reduction in prices and the reduction in quotas will erode the income of beet producers and force them to abandon farming, with no alternative means of survival other than unemployment.
At the same time, sugar factories which are not viable â and they are quite numerous â will close and entire areas will be abandoned, both in northern Greece and in Calais in France and in other countries.
In Greece, factory closures mean dead towns and, more importantly, dead towns in remote areas.
Nevertheless, imports will increase.
However, imported sugar will be cheaper for the industries which use it as a raw material, but not for consumers, who never pay less for any product, even if its price drops.
Beet producers in the countries with which the European Union has preferential agreements will also lose, because it will import sugar at lower prices.
Consequently, it is hypocrisy to say that poor countries will benefit.
The real reason for these changes is the drastic reduction in the agricultural budget, so that it can be used for other repressive and reactionary policies and to favour exports of products from the European industrial monopolies to Brazil, India and elsewhere, thereby sacrificing and condemning beet producers and workers in the sector, who will join the armies of the unemployed.
Minor improvements and minor changes, with limited and meagre subsidies, compensation and funds do not change the spirit or the objective of the proposed regulation.
They are no solution.
The only solution is the coordinated fight by farmers and workers to change this anti-farming and anti-grass roots policy.
Â Â  Mr President, over-production of sugar is another manifestation of the obscene common agricultural policy that protects certain producers for political reasons and penalises consumers for the same political reasons.
The French produce 160% of their domestic requirements in sugar, and dump the rest on the Third World.
The British produce 50% of their requirements, and import the remainder from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.
British sugar producers act responsibly and are not the cause of the problem.
They will suffer through ill-considered so-called reforms.
Real reform for Britain will only be accomplished when we withdraw from the common agricultural policy, and indeed from the European Union itself.
This resolution has left a sour taste with British sugar producers, many of whom have written to me and my British colleagues.
The UK Independence Party will vote against the resolution and its amendments, which will damage the interests of British sugar producers.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is undoubtedly a need for reform of the regime governing Type C Sugar, partly in view of the latest developments at the WTO, but we believe this should be included within the key points of the overall CAP reform.
That means making the necessary changes, while not losing sight of the essential aim of keeping the sector internationally competitive over the medium and long term.
Instead of this, we have the impression that the European Commission, in complying with the constraints of production cut-backs imposed by international treaties and free trade agreements, is intending to sacrifice certain producing areas, which are frequently the weakest.
That will be facilitated by the Commissionâs planned mechanism for the purchase of quotas by one Member State from another.
On a European level, the closure and abandonment of many sugar plants and the move away from sugar beet production by many agricultural enterprises all confirm that competitive pressure is constantly on the increase as a result of the reduction, in real terms, of the guaranteed price for volumes produced.
To conclude, the measures proposed by the European Commission should certainly be viewed as unacceptable, since the excessive reduction in the benchmark intervention price, the major fall in sugar beet prices, the partial 60% compensation and the introduction of private storage put the survival of the sugar beet sector at great risk.
In our view, the future proposed law should instead be based upon quotas and guaranteed prices, linked to real national production quotas.
It should also protect the European single market, by introducing import restrictions; it should introduce more effective customs rules for checking the origins of products, reduce quotas to a level which would suffice for internal consumption and introduce or maintain measures to reduce the structural disparities â for instance, authorisation for state aid in order to protect the interests of farmers living in the Union's under-privileged areas, guaranteeing the continuation of a multifunctional agriculture throughout the European region.
Â Â  Commissioner, I agree with you that the analyses confirm that our only prospect lies in the enforcement of the market in the sugar sector as well.
But, as indicated, the most important thing is to control the gigantic spectre of vested interests, behind which stand thousands who are profiting from the market as it is currently regulated.
I think that a key question for us in the European Parliament is whether we will more or less succumb to these vested interests, or whether, as the highest political agency of the European Union, the Parliament will decide in principle whether fundamental market values should prevail in the sugar reform, or whether bureaucratic principles will continue to dominate.
Today, Commissioner, I am among those who see here, in the draft resolution, a willingness to give priority to a more extensive influence of the market in the sugar reform, which is why I also support it.
I personally do not think it is necessary to discuss the exact elaboration of the related procedures, as this is a technical, rather than a political problem.
In conclusion, I would like to confirm that we support the view that only more genuine competition in the European market, the sugar market included, will enable us to hold our own in competition in the dynamic and developing global market.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that society has, over recent years, started to make quite different demands of agriculture, and when I say that, I am thinking not only of CAP reform and of the current WTO negotiations.
If these demands are to be met in every area, it is understandable that the common market organisation for sugar has to be reformed.
That having been said, Commissioner, the role of policy must be to create fair framework conditions under which our farmers can continue to produce sugar in the European Union, and do so sustainably, economically, and in a socially acceptable way.
The communication presented by the Commission in July 2004 on the reform of the sugar sector does, however, by its approach, involve profound effects on, and changes to, the existing market organisation for sugar.
Although this Houseâs Committee on Agriculture is not opposed to such a reform, our motion for a resolution does advocate a moderate approach.
We reject the quota transfers that the Commission originally envisaged, believing as we do that quotas should remain with the producers, that is, with the farmers.
We also take the view that the planned cuts in prices and quotas will add up to considerable losses in income, and that we cannot disregard alternative uses either, for which there is a great deal of potential, particularly where biofuels are concerned.
Our farmers can expect to lose income, and for that they must be compensated accordingly.
I am confident, Commissioner, that this House will, when it votes today, endorse the compromise that the Agriculture Committee, over and above all party boundaries, has made such a good job of hammering out, and I very much hope that the Commission will listen to its messages when the time comes for it to present its legislative proposals.
We say âyesâ to reform of the sugar sector, Commissioner, but it needs to be done with sensitivity.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, MrsÂ Fischer Boel, the sugar market may be seen as the last of the Mohicans when it comes to products whose regime has not been reformed over recent years and which have so far escaped the philosophy behind the new common agricultural policy.
Which direction should the Commission's legislative proposals take?
First, they should ensure that all sugar-producing regions are treated equally.
Secondly, they should apply the philosophy behind the reformed CAP to the new measures.
Thirdly, they should express the international solidarity of the European Union with developing countries.
In view of the foregoing, I consider the following to be particularly negative points in the Commission communication:
First, the lack of compensation for beet producers' incomes following the reduction in support for products; when the CAP was reformed for cereals and beef, compensation covered 90% of the reductions in direct subsidies, whereas for sugar they only cover 60%.
Secondly, the system of transferring quotas between Member States proposed by the European Commission will result in the concentration of production in specific regions only.
Thirdly, the external aspects of the regime require especially careful handling.
In particular, commitments in the sugar sector should not exceed the limits which are absolutely necessary within the framework of the WTO.
Similarly, the economic and social repercussions in less developed countries should be handled tactfully and efficiently on the basis of the choices of the developing countries themselves.
To close, I consider that it should be clarified and maintained that quotas belong to beet producers and compensation for producers in third countries cannot be financed from the agricultural social fund.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the sugar reform being discussed is an extension of agricultural policy reform.
Its central component is price reductions, amounting to almost 40%, and quota cuts.
This would involve a price cut of roughly EUR 2.5 billion.
As it is industry that uses most of the sugar, approximately 75%, price cuts would hardly be reflected in the consumer prices of manufactured products, but would mainly constitute a benefit to the sugar industry.
There is a certain feature of the reform of the sugar sector which has been absent from previous agricultural reforms.
Fundamental to it would be the notion that sugar production quotas could be transferred from one country to another.
This way it would be clear to all that sugar production was being transferred to the regions best suited to its cultivation, and it would end in countries that were unfavourable in terms of their natural conditions.
This would be of no benefit to the EU budget.
Such a solution would be a dangerous precedent.
I earnestly appeal to you, Commissioner, that such a lack of solidarity among Member States should not come about.
I was happy to note that in your opening speech you were prepared to re-examine this point.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would thank the Commissioner for sticking with a reform of the sugar markets, however modest this may be.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Developmentâs resolution is, however, appalling, at least if global solidarity has even a minor role to play in political life.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development believes that sugar production in the EU and, preferably, throughout the world should be regulated by quotas.
That is a profoundly odd point of view.
Sugar production should instead be set free.
The committee makes a few polite nods in the direction of the developing countries, but it is transparently obvious that its main concern is sugar production in the EU.
We do not help poor farm workers in, for example, Brazil by making export conditions there worse.
It is possible that, if the market were opened up, a large part of the profits would go to the landowners, but it is impossible to argue that such opening-up would be directly to the financial detriment of farm workers.
In the EU, half of the aid goes, moreover, to the sugar industry.
If there is a genuine desire to do something constructive to benefit the poor sugar-producing countries, it is the ILO that should be strengthened and, in Brazil, President Lulla too.
In Brazil, negotiations with the government could be proposed to make sure that the plantations comply with the ILOâs demands.
To impose quotas and the EUâs social and environmental standards upon all the other countries would be to disregard the âEverything But Armsâ agreement which says that, by 2009, the least-developed countries should be able freely to sell sugar to the EU.
The concerns expressed about the developing countries are hollow.
This is also apparent from the fact that what the EU saves on export subsidies for sugar is now to be used to secure incomes, and not for the developing countries.
The proposal to use sugar as a fuel is beyond the pale.
I support all the amendments by the Socialist group, and I also think that others should do so, for the sake of the developing countries, agriculture and the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, for the sake of some vague compromise with the WTO, we are getting ready to throw tens of thousands of workers onto the street, to close down dozens of undertakings, to deal a terrible blow to European agriculture, and to call into question the development of many countries.
Yet who will profit from this reform?
Will it be the farmers?
Who could possibly believe such a stupid idea, when the gross loss of income is announced as being 50%?
Perhaps it will be the consumers?
That is really hard to believe, because a fall in the producer prices paid to farmers has never had any effect on the purchasing power of households.
How about small producers in the Southern hemisphere?
Our experience of the coffee market and of sugar production in Brazil is hardly going to convince us.
On the other hand, the multinationals in the agri-food industry have cause for celebration.
Thanks to the Commission and the WTO, they will be able to force more young children to work on the sugar-cane plantations.
They will be able to exploit a little more the suffering men and women who are often paid less than 100 dollars a month.
They will be able to watch their profits swell enormously on the basis of a social disaster.
This reform is also giving rise to terrible anxiety throughout the most remote regions.
Our group recently visited RÃ©union, at the invitation of Mr Verges, and we were able to see for ourselves the extent to which this reform was a catastrophe for that island.
In addition to the need for total compensation, a problem of consistency has also arisen.
Despite the fact that, for over 40 years, the greater part of the European Unionâs investments have been devoted to the development of the cane-sugar sector, and the fact that that sector represents one third of final agricultural production, 25% of electric production and three quarters of exports, it is now proposed to call into question the very existence of this strategic development action, without there being any possibility of an alternative which could cope with the consequences.
We must understand the full scope of the consequences of this reform.
At the request of MrÂ Verges, our group would like the Commission to undertake to submit to Parliament a study of the impact, particularly the social impact, on the real situation of the outlying regions.
We would also like the same type of study to be carried out on a European scale.
Mr President, let me finish by saying that we are convinced that there are solutions to be found within a real policy on the regulation of the sugar market, of which Europe should be the promoter.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar runs counter to the aims of the common agricultural policy, namely ensuring a dignified standard of living for farmers and the sustainable development of agriculture, and it also contradicts the Lisbon Strategy.
The proposal to reduce both the A and B quotas is unacceptable.
Its impact will be strongest in the new Member States, particularly in Poland, where the sector has already been cut drastically in recent years, and only 43 out of the original 78 sugar processing plants remain.
There has been no investment in modernisation.
Instead, workers are being condemned to unemployment, and consumers are paying more for their sugar, not less.
There is a real threat that sugar production will be concentrated in just a few plants due to the transfer of quotas between Member States.
As a result, sugar would be produced in the regions where farming is most expensive.
It is also incorrect to claim that importing more sugar from the poorest countries into the Union will improve the financial situation of those countries.
On the contrary, only speculators and trading companies will profit.
EU taxpayers and farmers, including those from Poland, will be the ones who pay for this.
Poland will become an importer of sugar, whereas previously it was one of the main producers.
The Commissionâs proposal for reform of the sugar market will result in a monopoly by the large undertakings that are already absorbing their competitors.
This is all to be promoted by quota cuts and by the so-called transitional reduction in prices, lowered to dumping levels.
It appears that the common agricultural policy is only common for a select few, and that is dangerous.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I have, as you know, used every available opportunity in this Parliament to raise the matter of the sugar industry.
Sugar beet growing and sugar processing have a long tradition in my country, dating back almost 80 years.
The impact assessment adopted earlier by the Commission shows that Ireland is one of countries particularly vulnerable to price reductions for sugar and sugar beet.
The implications of the proposal on price and quota cuts, even allowing for compensation, would make sugar beet growing no longer viable in Ireland.
The proposals in their current form would be devastating for the Irish industry at both growing and processing levels and there would be a direct threat to the 3,800 farmers currently growing sugar beet.
On the manufacturing side, the industry has in the past provided a very important employment opportunity in the sugar plants, in addition to supporting employment in associated industries.
Some of these jobs have already been lost.
The Carlow plant in my own constituency has announced its closure, with all the associated socio-economic problems.
The uncertain future of the sugar sector has, in my opinion, seriously contributed to this closure.
The European Commission's initial reform ideas are already causing unacceptable casualties.
This view was also expressed by the agriculture ministers of 10 Member States, including Ireland, in a joint submission to the Agriculture Commissioner.
We all accept that reform of the existing regime is necessary.
However, reform should aim at maintaining the existing distribution of sugar beet and sugar production in the entire European Union territory.
Reform should be based on the following principles.
First, an import system from third countries should be put in place, which will ensure predictable and regular import quantities.
Secondly, the price reductions should be significantly less than what is currently proposed and implemented more gradually.
Thirdly, the impact of the quota reductions should fall mainly on those Member States that are net exporters of sugar.
The transfer of quotas among Member States should not be allowed.
In recent days, the Commission has approved excise relief for a bio-ethanol pilot project in Ireland using rapeseed oil and I particularly welcome that.
A few years ago a feasibility study was commissioned by the sugar processing sector in Ireland, with a view to producing bio-ethanol using surplus sugar beet.
Surplus beet is of limited value to growers and an ethanol plant would provide an alternative outlet for a significant quantity of such beet.
Apart from the obvious benefit of bio-ethanol as an alternative energy source and its potential contribution to a cleaner environment, some of the by-products produced would also be of value to the fertiliser and animal feed sectors.
I know you accept this, Commissioner, and you have said so in a previous response.
Because of the current reform process in the sugar sector, it is time for all the governments concerned, all the relevant Commission directorates and the commercial sector to act and seriously re-examine the possibility of developing a sugar-based bio-ethanol industry.
In Brazil, the rain forest is being destroyed to grow sugar that nobody wants, so sugar-based bio-ethanol is being produced instead.
It can be done; the technology is there.
Commissioner, I appeal to you again to have another look at your proposals, come back and be mindful of the people that you represent.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the system of national limits creates unfair divisions in the European sugar market.
It works to the advantage of the multinationals, and of those holding a sugar monopoly.
These enterprises make enormous profits at the expense of individual consumers and producers.
Nonetheless, the issue of reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar should be approached very carefully.
MrÂ Daulâs and MrÂ Fruteauâs motion for a resolution is very well-balanced, and provides for the interests of all the parties concerned.
It rightly draws attention to the difficulties experienced by new Member States as a result of cuts in production quotas.
Any future reform of the sugar market should maintain production and fully compensate farmers and workers employed in sugar plants for the losses incurred, guaranteeing them a dignified standard of living.
Â Â  Mr President, the beginning of 2005 marks the introduction of the EU's new CAP reforms. The CAP reforms require European farmers to become more competitive and efficient, while maintaining sustainable environment-friendly farming practices.
The single farm payment requires farmers to produce the goods demanded by the marketplace.
