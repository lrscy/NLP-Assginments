Over the ten years since Mr Grant's death, UNICEF seemed to become a vehicle not for promoting children, but a political agenda focused on women's rights, which was not the appropriate place: it was a children's agency.
Ms Bellamy, who directed UNICEF after Mr Grant, was forced to resign last year.
Although criticism was building over nine years of her tenure, the UN structures as they have evolved did not allow any internal investigation of UNICEF.
Only from the outside did an accumulation of critics and a growing scandal about the neglect of children's programmes eventually force her resignation.
Last year, amidst the final crescendo, publications such as were reporting that UNICEF's failure to develop a coherent strategy for child survival and its shortcomings were contributing to 10Â million child deaths per year.
For an organisation to tolerate this, such a publicly known problem, shows it needs reform.
There is no disgrace in reform.
No, there is only disgrace in resisting reform where it is needed.
Success will come when we realise that the UN is an ideal that needs to be fostered and that we need an efficient organisation that can serve these ideals.
Â Â  Mr President, General de Gaulle used to refer to the United Nations as .
Today, now that the 60th anniversary of the UN seems to have ended up in a performance reminiscent of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, we can honestly ask ourselves whether the wise words by the former French Head of State do not hold true today.
Indeed, it took weeks and weeks to discuss a 35-page document that ultimately â for let us call a spade a spade â is not much more than a vague declaration of intent.
Sixty years on from its foundation, the UNâs weakness has yet again been clearly exposed.
The UNâs human rights committee, so discredited by its past inclusion of such countries as Cuba, Zimbabwe and Sudan, is being replaced by a human rights council.
About the composition of this new institution, or about measures to bar such countries from it, the text, however, has not one word to say.
While all countries condemned terrorism, this committee failed to reach agreement on the definition of the term.
Neither did it reach consensus about the principles of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and, last but not least, the so desperately needed reform of the Security Council is being postponed once again.
Seen in that context, it is really mind-boggling that Japan, to name but one example, should fund 19% of the cost price of UN peace operations, yet has no say in the decision-making process â not quite a democratic way of going about things, one might say.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the ambitious challenge of the Millennium Summit was human globalisation, human rights, peace and prosperity for the whole of humanity, and we can conclude that, fundamentally, what that Summit has achieved has been to restrain the attempts to dismantle the United Nations and to point, though with many shortcomings, to certain areas of progress.
I would like, Mr President, to mention an important one of these: the initiative of the Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, who has taken on board the proposal of the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr RodrÃ­guez Zapatero, and of the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Erdogan.
What we have seen this morning in this Chamber demonstrates the importance of that initiative on the alliance of civilisations.
Mr President, I would like to end by saying that we must also bear in mind that the European Union is not currently a Member of the United Nations, but it is a key member of the WTO.
That is a challenge that we must face with generosity and in a multilateral spirit.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, so, what had to happen has indeed happened.
There has been no real reform of the UN, and Europe will not have a seat on the Security Council, a point on which everyone is keeping quiet even though, it has to be said, it was the EUâs main hope at the summit.
One of the consequences of this failure is that the European Union, which will not have a Foreign Minister any more than it has any kind of common foreign policy, will remain a kind of international forum with no external visibility.
All of this was quite obvious, despite the balanced comments just made to us by MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, who, in passing, given that she is speaking on French soil, could have spoken in French; in any event, she is not listening to me, as she is well able to do.
If the European âmachineâ had been a bit more realistic regarding its own importance, we could have spared ourselves these long debates into the vacuum on the so-called European seat, which will be consigned to the back of the wardrobe with the deep piles of our shattered illusions.
However, we must reflect on this failure nonetheless, because it should put us on our guard, as the failure of the Constitution, or the European deconstitution, did on a larger scale, regarding the narrow limits within which our ambitions must be contained.
The impossibility of reforming the UN, which was predictable, and which we did indeed predict in our previous speeches on the subject, was itself written into the conditions of international activity.
The principle that governs and will always govern international life is the pre-eminence of sovereignties.
While, within states, there can be legislation that applies to all and legitimate means of coercion that can make relations between people more peaceful, at international level there is no legitimate referee, nor will there ever be, whether it is an international organisation or a state that claims to have sole responsibility for peace among nations.
That is because, faced with a referee State, in reality an imperial state, just as when faced with any supranational organisation, the other states will never lose sight of their own interests, their own personality and, I repeat, their sovereignty, as my colleague Mrs Goudin said.
That does not necessarily mean that the world is a jungle: it simply means that peace is based solely on the balance between nations and groups of nations and that all international law can do is marginalise the natural games of states that, however devoted they claim to be to the cause of peace, are still heartless monsters and will never stop calculating their power.
This should therefore be a lesson to us: the multilateral framework can achieve certain things where, and only where, by some miracle, the interests of the nations happen to coincide.
I hope that realism will open our eyes and that we will finally be able to see the narrowness of the framework within which our actions are confined, by the very nature of things.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make just six comments.
Firstly, I would like to condemn the actions of the United States administration, which torpedoed the United Nations in general and these New York meetings in particular.
They torpedoed them by appointing Bolton as the United Statesâ representative in the United Nations and tabling 750 amendments to the draft final text, which the international community had spent a long time working on, negotiating and agreeing, in order to empty it of any content.
It is absurd that, when the United States finally have to make a couple of concessions, there should be so many expressions of gratitude and congratulations just because they have not entirely completed their latest attempt to remake âApocalypse Nowâ.
Secondly, I acknowledge that the European Unionâs role in the summit has been relatively commendable and positive.
It has also been relatively effective, when its Member States have acted in a coordinated and agreed fashion.
Thirdly, I would like to stress that the best example of this can be seen in what is undoubtedly the most worthwhile aspect of the New York Summit: with regard to the Millennium Development Objectives, we have not moved backwards, despite some peopleâs efforts to do so.
The European Union acted firmly and at least ensured that the commitments and the timetable approved five years ago were maintained.
Fourthly, it is regrettable that the essential reform of the United Nations failed, a point that is as illustrative as the previous one, but in a negative sense.
In this respect, our Member States arrived with differing visions and the Union was incapable of expressing itself, either through its positions or by exerting any influence whatsoever, and is therefore partly responsible for this failure.
Fifthly, we are pleased that the Summit has supported Kofi Annanâs âalliance of civilisationsâ strategy, accepting a European initiative such as that proposed by the Prime Ministers of Spain and Turkey.
And sixthly, we are delighted that Europe has contributed to keeping the United Nations afloat, saving it from the shipwreck that some people had been preparing for it.
It is not, however, sufficient to keep the United Nations afloat, but it is essential to relaunch the organisation definitively.
The European Unionâs objectives must be geared towards that objective, but to that end, our Union will have to be rather more than simply afloat.
I shall end with something that an African politician said to us: âThis world does not inspire enthusiasm, in fact it often causes disgust, but it is terrifying to think what it would be if Europe were not operating as a force for rationality, balance, a degree of coherence and, at times, solidarityâ.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Council, Commission, fellow Members, ladies and gentlemen. The UN summit made clear the need for cooperation in combating terrorism, climate change, international crime and weapons of mass destruction and in dealing with migration.
It made it clear that more, rather than less, cooperation is required.
The Peacebuilding Commission was given a lot of scope.
This is something that the European Parliament now has the opportunity to follow up.
Following the initiative taken by the Swedish Foreign Minister, involving 13 female foreign ministers and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, we now have the peacebuilding work on which to adopt a position.
We must involve more women and, above all, have one woman for every man at all levels, with this equal representation enabling women and men to make better contributions.
Why is this so important?
Well, because, in modern wars and conflicts, the great majority of the victims are innocent women and children.
In the transition from conflict to a sustainable peace, all resources and civil solutions are needed.
How do we now follow this up in the EU?
When the Millennium Goal was debated, it became obvious that the donor countries must be more generous.
It was therefore with great delight that we learned at the weekend that debts were to be written off by 18 countries.
I regret that it is only Sweden and another four countries that provide aid amounting to 0.7%.
We must do better.
In the year 2000, Sweden reached the level of 1%.
Given how much we pour out here in the EU, we should easily be able to fill the glass.
Â Â  â I was a Member of Parliamentâs delegation at the Second World Conference of Speakers of Parliament, organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in New York on 7, 8 and 9Â September.
In my address to the 145 delegations in attendance, I reaffirmed Parliamentâs recent positions as regards the reform of the United Nations and the commitment towards the Millennium Development Goals.
My message was given greater resonance by the fact that previously all European Parliament resolutions on issues such as this were disclosed to the national and regional political delegations.
With specific regard to the reform of the United Nations, I told the delegates that Parliament stands four-square behind the positions adopted by the UN Secretary-General, such as his view that world security is intrinsically linked to economic and social development, respect for human rights and environmental protection.
I also mentioned the need to press ahead with changes to the composition of the Security Council; I believe that the EU should eventually have a permanent seat, and that new seats should be created at the earliest opportunity enabling new countries and emerging regions to be represented.
My last point on the United Nations General Assembly was that not only should there be reform of working methods but also that there should ultimately be a proper United Nations parliamentary assembly.
My plan was to contribute to the debate with this brief overview, which will also act as the report on the mission that I am required to make to Parliament.
Â Â  .
Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to respond to this debate.
I thank Members of Parliament for their insightful questions and challenging comments.
I will endeavour to address as many of your points as possible in my closing remarks.
At the 2005 Millennium Review Summit our heads of state and government and those of another 166 countries took up the challenge set by Kofi Annan of reforming the United Nations to make it more efficient, more effective and indeed more relevant to today's challenges.
The summit outcome document, to characterise the discussion we have had this afternoon, should be seen not as a glass half empty, but instead understood for what I believe it to be: a clear mandate for further change.
I believe that we all share the view that a stronger, more effective and appropriately resourced United Nations is the only way to ensure global stability and prosperity in this interdependent world.
As the European Union set out in its statement to the General Assembly on 17 September: 'Without a shared effort to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, rich and poor countries alike face a future of increased instability.
Failure in UN-led efforts to tackle the threat of terrorism and proliferation would endanger the prosperity of the developing world as much as the developed.
The United Nations should not be a forum for countries to push individual agendas, but one in which the international community can agree common action for the benefit of all of the world's citizens.'
That seems to me the appropriate context in which to address a number of the important points raised by honourable Members today.
Mr MillÃ¡n Mon, MrÂ Lambsdorff and Mr Schmidt raised the issue of Security Council enlargement.
In relation to this issue, while European Union partners agree that the Security Council should be reformed, it is the case that there is no European Union consensus on the model.
On the related issue of whether the European Union should have a seat on the Security Council, I would respectfully remind Members of this Parliament that the United Nations Charter is very clear on this point: it allows only individual member states to hold seats on the Council, not regional organisations.
There is, therefore, no question of a single EU seat on the Security Council.
Mrs Kinnock paid fulsome tribute to the work that had been achieved and painted, I believe, an accurate picture of the progress that has been made, albeit against a context of much further work still to be undertaken.
Her contribution is the rightful opportunity for me to pay tribute not just to her tireless efforts on this agenda over so many years â both before entering this Parliament and then thereafter â but also to the experience and expertise of so many other Members of this Parliament, which I believe has enriched the European Union's discussion of these issues and indeed Europe's voice in international fora.
It will not surprise her to hear that I am indeed supportive of the references to the need for innovative funding mechanisms in relation to the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals.
In relation to her other specific question, whether Member States are already starting to roll back on their aid volume commitments, I would categorically say no.
The 25 Member States signed up to collectively provide at least 0.56% of GNI by 2010 and, in the case of the EU 15, to all spend at least 0.7% of their GNI on aid by 2015.
As I told the party conference I addressed only a couple of days ago, to imagine that 15 countries within Europe would make such a commitment even only a few years ago would have been a dream for many of us who have long pursued that objective.
The European Union reaffirmed that commitment in its statement at the Millennium Review Summit.
The Commission and the Council will monitor progress on an annual basis.
It is vital that guarantee is in place.
I would also point out that the European Union is on course to exceed the targets for 2006, which is 0.39% of the EU average, set in 2002.
There is no reason at this stage why we should not do so again.
The next point raised was by Mr Portas.
He expressed views towards the United States with which I candidly disagree.
However, on the specific issue of non-proliferation, let me make clear the following points.
It is important to reflect the fact that we all share the disappointment of many Member States within the United Nations, and indeed of many Members here in this Parliament, including Mr Leinen, about the lack of an international commitment to non-proliferation displayed in the ultimate inability of states to agree any language on these subjects.
I can assure you all that although I speak for the Presidency today, the United Kingdom has worked tirelessly and literally to the last minute both nationally and in other fora representing the European Union as Presidency, to seek the best possible outcome on non-proliferation and disarmament at that Millennium Review Summit.
I can also assure this House that we will continue to seek sensible and pragmatic solutions to overcome this deficit that will enhance the nuclear non-proliferation regime.
Turning to the questions posed by Mr Guardans CambÃ³, I would respectfully say that smaller European Union countries did play a vital role in formulating the shared views of the European Union in the run-up to the Millennium Review Summit.
To suggest otherwise would be a disservice to the contribution made by a number of countries other than the larger Member States of the European Union.
Mrs Vaidere then went on to question whether there was a role for a new international organisation to replace the United Nations.
Again, I would say respectfully that I have to disagree with that proposal.
Rather, the challenge on the basis of what I and some Members of this Parliament have made clear today is that we need to give tangible expression to the words agreed back in the United Nations Millennium Review Summit only a few days ago, and ensure that the further words that are now on paper can be translated in the weeks and months ahead into further action.
Mrs BelohorskÃ¡ addressed questions to the Commission about the Beijing follow-up summit.
I can inform her that the European Union did not send anyone to the unofficial Beijing conference on 29Â August and 1Â September.
The tenth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action was commemorated at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in March 2005.
On that occasion the European Union was represented by the Luxembourg Minister for Gender Equality.
Mr Deva made a powerful case for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the operation of the United Nations.
I believe there has been a broad consensus throughout this Parliament today on the need for that further action to be taken now.
Mr Pistelli asked â given his disappointment about the somewhat patchy nature of the progress, as he characterised it â in what areas the European Union could push further ahead for more progress to be made given the constraints of the summit's final document.
I can give him the following assurances.
We are encouraging interlocutors, including Kofi Annan, to move forward urgently on the reforms that are important to us, but were not included or were unsatisfactorily worded in that final Summit Outcome Document.
Specifically, on the issue of management reform â about which there has been much discussion in this debate today â Kofi Annan has been mandated by the summit outcome to propose further reforms for the UN organisation and secretariat in the first quarter of 2006.
We have already urged the Secretary-General to make bold proposals, not least in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal, as it is important that such steps are taken.
The European Union supports the Summit Outcome Document's strong condemnation of terrorism â a matter that was again addressed by a number of honourable Members â and its call for an effective UN counter-terrorism strategy.
However, we believe the text should have gone further.
For nearly a decade the United Nations has been discussing a global convention on terrorism that seeks itself to define terrorism.
We want to see that definition agreed in terms that are unequivocal.
It would leave no doubt what an act of terrorism is and that such acts are utterly unacceptable.
Finally, let me make this other specific point.
We agree entirely with the UN Secretary-General that the lack of non-proliferation and disarmament language in the Summit Outcome Document was a significant disappointment.
The European Union worked literally until the last moment to try to broker agreement on those key issues.
Despite this setback, I reaffirm that the European Union will continue to seek out opportunities to strengthen the non-proliferation regime in all relevant fora.
Mr Romeva i Rueda expressed his disappointment on the Security Council.
I have spoken about that already.
We share, however, the disappointment that he expressed on the failure to pursue a treaty on the international arms trade.
Again, I am conscious that I speak to this Parliament today representing the Presidency rather than any one individual Member State.
However, I can assure him of our continuing commitment to this issue, not least because my own party was recently re-elected in the United Kingdom on an explicit manifesto commitment to try and take forward progress on an arms trade treaty.
Mrs Sinnott said that even the tidiest house sometimes needed to be spring cleaned.
I certainly agree that reform has a real contribution to make to the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals and that is why we are so determined that the words of September are translated into action in the weeks and months ahead.
Mr Dillen quoted General Charles de Gaulle.
I was tempted to reply in kind, but I shall resist that and leave that for another day.
Instead he went on to raise the question again of United Nations Security Council enlargement and I have spoken at some length about the position of the Presidency in relation to that question.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo raised an issue which frankly I expected we might have heard more of in the course of the debate today, which is the centrality of the World Trade Organization talks, just ten working weeks away, in pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals.
It is hard to overstate the significance of the challenge that collectively Europe, the United States and the other representatives of the World Trade Organization face when they arrive, and in the weeks before arriving in Hong Kong.
There is simply no doubt that 2005 will already be remembered as a year of real progress in relation to debt reduction and increases in aid flows, for all the reasons that I have described.
The opportunity for Europe now is once again to grasp the leadership potential that is within its grasp and move actively and aggressively to try and make sure that the very development dimension to the original Doha Declaration is given expression in Hong Kong.
I was heartened in that regard by the remarks of Pascal Lamy last week, in his first press conference as Secretary General of the WTO, for I believe that only by being clear as to the development dimension of the Doha round in HongÂ Kong, will we see the kind of progress that I believe many Members of this Parliament would wish to see made in early December.
Mr CoÃ»teaux raised the issue of a seat at the United Nations, which I have already addressed, and Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez spoke of the United States.
As I hope I have already made clear in my contribution in winding up this debate, it is with some relief that I speak on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, rather than any other Administration, so I will leave it for others to answer for the actions of those outside the European Union.
Mrs SegelstrÃ¶m raised the issue of terrorism and the need for more cooperation, something I wholeheartedly agree with, and heard very strongly articulated in this Parliament when Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom, made a powerful case that it is not by building thicker or higher walls that we will effectively counteract terrorism, but rather by deeper and more fulfilling cooperation between the Member States of the European Union.
She also made an important point in terms of gender representation in the high levels of office represented at the United Nations Millennium Review Summit.
I certainly acknowledge the significance of that point and therefore respectfully suggest that perhaps the Commissioner is better qualified than I to answer it.
The final contribution came from Mr dos Santos, in which he explained his own presence at an important international meeting that preceded the Millennium Review Summit.
Again, I would simply take this opportunity to reiterate the sincere gratitude, both of the Commission, I believe, and certainly of the Presidency-in-Office, for the tireless efforts of many Members of this Parliament in pursuing what was achieved in the United Nations Millennium Review Summit.
I fully accept that there is some disappointment that the Summit document ultimately did not go as far as many of us would have wished it to, but I am absolutely convinced that but for the effective action of members of the European Union, we would not have achieved the progress that we did in New York.
For that, I believe, we can feel a real and genuine sense of shared pride.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I shall be brief and just say at the beginning that we were delighted to see a parliamentary delegation in New York.
I thank Mrs Kinnock, Mr Deva and Mr Lambsdorff for having been there.
I must say that this was very positive because you have seen for yourselves the positive and the rather negative side of this Millennium Summit.
Many of you have mentioned seeing the glass as half-full or half-empty.
The picture was a mixed one, but I think it was very important that this Millennium Summit ended with a declaration from where we can go on, and this is the most important thing.
Knowing the UN as I do â I was chief of protocol for Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1994 and 1995 â I know that it can only be as good as its member states, and as good as the member states that are ready to go for a compromise.
There are 191 member states, so it is not easy for a European Union with 25 member states and some associated member states with the same positions to bring the issue forward.
The European Union has done a very good job, and this has also been mentioned by Secretary-General Kofi Annan and many others.
It is true that in the Human Rights Council, as I mentioned at the very beginning, on the definition of terrorism for instance, we have not achieved everything.
Let me just go into this question a little.
I would say the clear and unqualified condemnation by all governments of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations committed by whomsoever and wherever is a very important element, and it is a strong push, given that this agreement has been negotiated for nearly ten years.
There is a good chance that at this General Assembly before the end of the year there might even be a conclusion of this agreement.
If this were so this would be another positive outcome.
Let me also say with regard to women's issues that I was present at the evening dinner of the women's network.
I was a foreign minister, but now I am a Commissioner for external relations.
It is very important to think of the other part of the population that is not yet always represented in an appropriate manner, and therefore we think women can make a special contribution to peace and to peace-building, on which we have placed particular emphasis.
I would also like to say that the issues that we have mentioned today â and the issues of dialogue and alliance between civilisations and cultures â are a very crucial item.
It has been around for a long time, but now it has been mentioned as a new concept and we will certainly work and cooperate with this concept because this might bring the peoples at large again to a common understanding that there has to be tolerance on religious civilisations, but that at the same time we share common values.
On the whole I can again say that the EU is indeed the natural partner of the United Nations and both organisations have been born out of the same experience, the experience of war, and are founded on the same conviction that acting together is much better than acting alone, even if we sometimes have to compromise in order to go on.
But there is a very strong commitment from our side to go on, with an excellent President of the General Assembly.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I had asked the Commission and the Council for their opinion on when Parliament can expect the representatives of Commission and Council to be combined in New York and at the other sites of the United Nations, in order to achieve better coherence in the Unionâs representation at the United Nations.
I should be grateful if the Council and the Commission would respond to this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Lambsdorff, you know as well as I do that the Constitution has not yet progressed and has not been ratified.
The Council Secretariat now has an office in New York; the Commission has observer status at the United Nations, and we work extremely closely together.
Even so, there are at present no plans to amalgamate the two.
Â Â  â I have received six motions for resolution(1) in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday 29 September 2005 at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0331/2005).
Â Â  . The Council considers that separate collection systems have been and will continue to be widely implemented to achieve the objectives of Community directives on waste.
Separate collection leads to higher recycling rates and makes final disposal safer.
A number of Community directives on specific waste streams provide for separate collections of wastes, especially for end-of-life products that would otherwise enter the municipal solid waste stream.
Much has been achieved in Member States through Community legislation to meet this environmental challenge.
Important hazardous waste, such as waste oils and batteries, has been tackled.
Recycling and recovery targets have been set for some key complex waste flows, such as packaging, end-of-life vehicles and waste from electrical and electronic equipment.
Some of these measures have still to be implemented in some Member States.
Changing behaviour, whether that of producers, consumers or public authorities, takes time.
This is particularly true with regard to achieving a specific environmental outcome requiring significant investment in infrastructure.
Therefore, future initiatives on waste will need to have realistic timescales to allow the stakeholders concerned sufficient time to plan their investment.
The experience of Member States shows the importance of heightening public awareness of waste-related issues.
I am confident that the Commission will take full account of this when it brings forward its thematic strategy on waste.
Â Â  â Thank you for your reply, Minister, but when I went down to Greece from Brussels I got the opposite impression from the one you have given and I ask the Council if it has evaluated the direct and indirect damage to date and the damage which will be caused in all the Member States from their failure to comply with the directives.
Â Â  . Clearly each Member State is subject to the obligations imposed upon it by European Union law.
Therefore it is important to recognise that, particularly in relation to directives that have been passed, there are processes whereby infringement procedures can follow.
Whilst we recognise that not all Member States have implemented EU waste legislation fully, in general I would suggest that implementation of European Union environmental law has actually improved in recent years.
Â Â  . I really could not agree more with the honourable Member about the importance of these issues, not least following the attacks in Madrid, and in London on 7 July.
The Council has always endeavoured to strike a balance between providing security to European Union citizens while simultaneously guaranteeing their human rights and civil liberties, regardless of religious belief or ethnic origin.
On 13 June 2002, the Council adopted a framework decision on combating terrorism.
This framework decision approximates Member State legislation as regards acts of terrorism, offences relating to a terrorist group and offences linked to terrorist activities.
It is specifically mentioned in Article 1 of the framework decision that it 'shall not have the effect of altering the obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty'.
It is in particular in defence of those rights that the Member States need to combat terrorism, which is the antithesis of human rights as we see it in democratic societies.
In his address to the European Parliament on 7Â September, my colleague, the British Home Secretary Charles Clarke, emphasised the need to find a balance between civil liberties and the increase in security.
On that occasion the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, also stressed the need for a balance between law enforcement activities and the protection of fundamental rights.
Â Â  May I, once again, welcome the Minister back to this House.
It is very pleasing to see you here, to provide a detailed answer to the question that I had tabled.
You make reference to statements made by your colleague, the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom, Mr Clarke.
May I draw your attention to comments that he has made since the date that you mention and ask you to what extent the Presidency is committed to doing away with certain provisions of the Convention on Human Rights?
Â Â  . Let me address the question by being very clear that the priority of our Presidency, not least given the attacks in Madrid and London, is to give renewed momentum to the EU Counter-terrorism Action Plan, which has been agreed by all Member States.
We believe that, by focusing our efforts on this plan, we can achieve the harmonisation and establish the common ground of which I spoke earlier.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, the European arrest warrant is a very sensible and welcome measure to try and counter terrorism, but it has not been implemented by several Member States because of a fear that people extradited under the warrant will not receive a fair trial, appropriate legal support or appropriate language support.
Will you examine this, as the President-in-Office, to see if you can reassure all Member States that the arrest warrant may be implemented in full?
Â Â  . I can give an undertaking to the honourable Member that this is an issue which we should have concern for, given our commitment not only to the common arrest warrant but also to action to take forward a common evidence warrant across the European Union.
If there are practical reasons, given concerns within Member States, which are preventing the deepening of the cooperation of which I spoke earlier, then that is exactly within the concern of the Council.
In particular I will ensure that the honourable Member's remarks are brought to the attention of the Home Secretary.
Â Â  . First of all, I should like to congratulate the European Parliament on the launch of its own website before I try to defend the Council's website.
Let me do my best.
The objective of the Council's website is twofold: to provide information on the role and activities of the Council and to enable the institution to comply with its obligations as regards access to documents.
Thus, in addition to the homepage of Javier Solana, the Secretary General of the Council and High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Council website provides access to press releases and a wide range of information of particular interest to the media on the activities of the Council within the different policy areas.
In addition, the website includes the public register of Council documents and provides information concerning the use of the register and about the rules governing transparency and access to documents.
It should be pointed out that the somewhat specialised Council website has been designed with a view to avoiding, as far as possible, overlap and duplication of work in relation to the interinstitutional website Europa, which is managed by the European Commission and addressed to the public in general.
Â Â  'Yes, Minister!'
Is the Presidency-in-Office aware that when asked to consider the inadequacies of the Council's website, journalists and NGOs seem at a loss whether to laugh hysterically or to gnash their teeth in anger?
Would he agree that if the European Union is to connect better with its citizens, then the public sources of information need to reflect the principles of openness and transparency?
Will he take steps to initiate a review and public consultation aimed at sweeping aside the backward-looking approach of the Council Secretariat and providing the public with a first-class source of honest, factual and accurate information?
Â Â  . On the basis of my inquiries since this question was tabled, I have some sympathy with the points raised by the honourable Member.
I can assure him that the structure and content of the Council's website undergoes continuous review and this process will be continued in parallel with the improvements to the Europa website, of which I spoke a moment or two ago.
I feel the only point of difference between us, in terms of the question that was put to me, is to suggest that in the first instance the public should visit the Council website, rather than the Europa website.
I think there is a genuine question as to how we ensure the kind of duplication, which has been all too common amongst the government websites of Member States, and ensure that the product offered to the citizenry of Europe better reflects the single access point that we wish the public to move towards.
That, most clearly, in terms of the public, is the Europa website.
The Commission has recently announced its action plan to improve communicating in Europe and I am sure that will have a direct bearing on the Europa site.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, perhaps you would like to visit a website that really does frustrate one, that really does contain inaccuracies.
That is the UK Liberal Democrat website, which, for example, claims that Liberal Democrats are the main opposition to the British Government and that they have policies.
Â Â  . Ever mindful of my responsibilities as a representative of the Presidency, rather than speaking as a partisan figure here today, I would respectfully suggest that those inaccuracies are perhaps not so much technological as ideological.
Â Â  I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to kindly answer Mr Davis' original question: is the Council aware of any website maintained by a public authority which is better designed to frustrate?
He did not actually answer the question.
Can we therefore take it that he agrees that the Council's website is the worst of all public websites?
Â Â  . I suggest to the honourable Member that if he believes it is an efficient and effective use of the Council's time to visit every public website on the worldwide web, then I would respectfully disagree with him.
Â Â  . As pointed out by the honourable Member, the European Union institutions are required by law to keep a register of documents and to grant direct access to documents in electronic form.
By setting up its public register of documents, which I understand became operational in January of 1999, the Council fulfilled that requirement well before the relevant regulation entered into force.
The number of users of the Council register has been steadily increasing ever since.
Thus in 2004, close to 300Â 000 different users logged on to the Council's public document register, as opposed to roughly 180Â 000 in 2003.
This represents an almost 63% increase in the number of users in one year.
The total number of visits increased by just under 20%: 920Â 000 in 2004 against 770Â 000 in 2003, representing more than 2Â 500 visits per day.
Consultations in terms of number of screens viewed totalled more than 5.5Â million.
As these figures on the use by the public of the register of Council documents indicate, the register has indeed become a frequently used research tool for citizens wishing to closely follow the development of Community affairs.
This is all the more understandable as the Council register is constantly updated via an automatic archiving system.
By 9Â September 2005, the Council register contained references to more than 640Â 000 documents.
Moreover, a considerable amount of Council documents are automatically made available, in full text format, via the Council register as soon as they are produced.
Thus in 2004, around 70Â 000 documents, or roughly 60% of the more than 100Â 000 documents produced and registered that year, could be consulted full-text online immediately upon circulation.
Provisional agendas for meetings of the Council and its preparatory bodies can be consulted online as soon as they have been circulated, thus enabling users of the register to easily identify the reference numbers of documents discussed at any given meeting.
Moreover, apart from the document number entry, the users of the register can search for documents on a given subject via other entries of the register, such as the meeting date, the interinstitutional file number or a subject code.
Nevertheless, in order to further improve the quality of the register, the Council will study the technical feasibility of performing an automatic search via interactive agendas for documents on a given issue or that are part of the same file.
Â Â  I should like to thank the Presidency, but let me give an example.
If you put 'data retention' â a subject much in the news â in the subject-matter search box, you get no documents at all.
It is as if Charles Clarke's frenzy of activity on this topic was a mirage.
If you put the words 'data retention' in the title box you get 45 documents, but with no way of navigating what meeting they relate to.
You have not answered the specific request in my question.
Will you copy the Parliament's Legislative Observatory to make the Council website easy to navigate?
If you use the help section on the website, you get 'regarding suffixes on documents'.
There may be multiple suffixes indicating the different versions, for example, REV 1 (the first revision), REV 2 COR 1 (the first corrigendum to the second revision), COR 1 REV 2 (the second revision of the first corrigendum).
I do not believe that helps public enlightenment.
Â Â  . I am not entirely convinced that public enlightenment is assisted when what I clearly stated in the final paragraph of my answer appears not to have been heard.
So, let me repeat it for the record.
In order to further improve the quality of the register, the Council will study the technical feasibility of performing an automatic search via interactive agendas for documents on a given issue or being part of the same file.
Â Â  . The Council is aware that various organisations have voiced concerns over the alleged adverse effects of fisheries agreements between the Community and third countries.
The Commission, in response to such criticism, issued a communication on 27 December 2002 on an integrated framework for fisheries partnership agreements with third countries.
Subsequently, in July 2004, the Council endorsed the policy changes advocated by the Commission in its communication.
It is important to stress the word 'partnership'.
This is about more than just buying up fishing rights from third countries and denuding their stocks.
The Community will enter into a dialogue with the third country on the basis of scientific evidence to establish whether there are surplus fishing possibilities which the Community vessels can extract sustainably.
The Community will discuss with the third country how the money paid can be used for the benefit of the people of that country.
As these are fisheries partnership agreements, the Council will seek to ensure that this money is to the benefit of the local fisheries sector, including fishermen and the coastal populations.
Finally, in the preparation of new agreements or renewal of existing ones, the Commission systematically presents to the Council assessment reports on the effects of these agreements.
The Council considers these agreements to be beneficial to both parties and looks forward to concluding future fisheries partnership agreements with third countries.
The United Kingdom Presidency is also working with the Commission to host a seminar later this year on the question of third-country agreements.
Â Â  Minister, I find it absolutely extraordinary that a government such as yours and that of your leader Tony Blair â who has made such a big play on Africa, what is going wrong in Africa, and what we have to do to try to help Africa â can be turning a blind eye to this issue.
I am afraid that these third-country fisheries deals are the most appalling combination of European commercial greed and bad African government corruption.
There is absolutely no question if you look at every independent report that in environmental terms these fisheries deals off the west coast of Africa are the environmental equivalent of setting fire to the Serengeti!
The local populations are being left without any hope of earning a living and I am very disappointed that you will not at least promise us an inquiry.
Â Â  .
I have no doubt that the honourable Member is sincere in his comments and I am respectful of the organisations that he consulted in preparing his contribution to this debate today, so I would be grateful if he could forward, both to the Commission and to the Council, the evidence he referred to in his question and I will ensure that it is passed on to the relevant officials.

Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
I clearly do not have the unerring experience of fisheries questions that my colleague, Mr Farage, has just demonstrated.
I did serve, however, representing Cornwall and Plymouth.
Fishing in that part of the world relies totally on partnerships and agreements.
If there were no agreements â and I disagree with Mr Farage here â what happens is that a number of mavericks simply abuse the quantity of fish stocks present.
It seems to me an excellent idea that the European Union concludes these agreements, and I personally hope that they continue.
Â Â  . I have great sympathy with the point that the honourable Member has made.
It is a debate which is in some way similar to the debate on economic partnership agreements in general.
Few would disagree with the principle that partnership agreements of this kind can genuinely be of benefit to the developing countries concerned.
However, if in practice the effect of those agreements is inimical and detrimental to their very objectives, then that is rightfully a matter of concern.
That is why I have undertaken, if evidence is produced, to pass it on to the relevant individuals.
Â Â  It is extraordinary that Mr Farage should raise this issue when he barely attends the Committee on Fisheries, and I would urge him to attend on a more regular basis, so that he can put forward his views on this.
I worry that what he is referring to is every fishing agreement.
For example, the Norwegian fishing agreement is vital for Scottish fishermen.
He needs to be consistent in his approach.
Â Â  . I shall resist the very considerable opportunity that has been presented to me to discuss the inconsistencies inherent in UKIP's position and simply say that I fully recognise, not least on the basis of the tireless work in Scotland of the honourable lady who asked the question, that fisheries partnership agreements can have a very important role to play.
It is a clear example of where working independently rather than in partnership offers no future either to Europe or, I would suggest, to fish stocks.
Â Â  .
The future of Serbia and Montenegro is within the European family, as I was indeed able to communicate when I recently visited the Western Balkans and had the opportunity to meet with the authorities in that country.
It follows that the participation of all ethnic groups in the democratic process is crucial to that country moving towards a European future.
However, we do not recognise that the situation in Serbia is as bleak as the question implies.
While the political situations in Kosovo and Serbia are not directly analogous, we judge that there are opportunities for minorities in Serbia to enjoy full involvement in parliamentary politics.
One of the first measures taken by the new Serbian Parliament in early 2004 was to abolish the threshold for parliamentary representation â that is, 5% â in the case of parties representing ethnic minorities.
Therefore at future general elections minorities are also likely to be represented in the parliament.
The Serbian local election law stipulates a 3% threshold but interethnic relation councils are also set up in ethnically mixed municipalities and comprise members of all ethnic communities, accounting for more than 1% of the municipal population.
In addition, questions concerning national minorities can be brought to the attention of the central government of Serbia, notably through the National Council of Ethnic Minorities, established in 2004.
That is a forum in which all relevant issues for minorities can be discussed.
We hope to open stabilisation and association agreement negotiations with Serbia and Montenegro during our Presidency.
To conclude this agreement Belgrade will need to meet a range of conditions set down by the European Union.
To eventually join the European Union Belgrade will need to have met all the Copenhagen political criteria.
The honourable Member is right to highlight the need for democratic standards in Serbia to be at the heart of this process.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am obliged to the President-in-Office for his very good, very specific answer.
I should just like to add that the PreÅ¡evo Valley, that is to say, the Albanian-inhabited region of southern Serbia, has no parliamentary representation at all, whilst the Serbian minority in Kosovo is guaranteed seats, at least in theory: they have not yet been taken up.
Could the President-in-Office envisage, as part of a solution to the Kosovo issue, endeavours towards a bilateral settlement â so that borders do not have to be changed, because of course we do not want to change any borders â which gives the Albanians in Serbia the same rights as the Serbians in Kosovo?
Â Â  . With the greatest of respect to the questioner I do not believe, especially at this time of some sensitivity and anticipation, that it is right to anticipate Ambassador Eide's report in relation to Kosovo.
We only have to wait a little longer for that report, and it in the light of it will be better able to continue the discussion on the final status of Kosovo.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Alexander, I would like to call to your attention the fact that there is a province in northern Serbia named Vojvodina that had the same status as Kosovo before 1989, whereas now it is practically a âterritory on paperâ only, without a status.
No one knows why its status cannot be restored five years after the fall of Milosevic.
Since the large native Hungarian and Croatian minorities do not have a representation in the parliament of Belgrade, they are politically discriminated against in Vojvodina.
When saying that there are positive ethnic changes in Serbia, I wonder whether you are aware of the fact that members of a European nation, namely of the Hungarian nation are persecuted and assaulted only because they speak Hungarian, while the police refuses to record their complaints, there are more and more judges of a doubtful reputation from Kosovo and Krajina in the region, and now there are murders ...
Â Â  . I would respectfully suggest to the questioner that an awareness is needed of what the legitimate responsibilities of the European Union Presidency are and what the responsibilities of the Serbian Government are.
In relation to the specific matter of concern, the recent attack on JÃ³zsef Kasza, the Chairman of the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians, and the general position of the Hungarian minority, I believe a quick and decisive approach by the Serbian Government did much to calm the fears of the ethnic Hungarian community that the attack on Kasza might be the beginning of a series of further attacks.
We are thankful that no one was hurt, according to the reports we have received, but I am aware of the concerns that the honourable Member has expressed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am glad that negotiations with Croatia are now actually set to begin in a few daysâ time.
This represents a considerable step forward for the British Presidency.
When does the President-in-Office expect accession negotiations with Belgrade to begin?
Â Â  . There seems to be a presumption inherent in the question which I am not in a position to echo in my response.
There are still further reports to be received in terms of the position of Croatia, not least in terms of the Croatia Task Force.
That is where matters rest at the moment â no further than that.
Â Â  . We are aware of the issues raised by the honourable Member.
While freedom of religious belief is guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, and the European Commission's 2004 Regular Report on Turkey's progress towards accession noted that freedom to worship is largely unhampered, important issues in this area remain outstanding.
Under the revised accession partnership adopted in May 2003, Turkey is required inter alia to establish conditions for the functioning of non-Muslim religious communities which are in line with the practice of European Union Member States.
However, the Council notes that some Muslim and non-Muslim religious minorities and communities continue to experience difficulties connected with legal personality, property rights, training, residence rights and work permits for Turkish and non-Turkish clergy, schools and internal management.
The European Union is particularly worried by the continuous confiscation by the state of property belonging to non-Muslim religious foundations.
The European Union has urged Turkey to adopt promptly a law on foundations that fully complies with European standards and expects the Commission's comments on the draft law that were sent by Commissioner Rehn to the Turkish Foreign Minister GÃŒl in June to be seriously considered.
The European Union has also urged Turkey to reopen the Halki Greek Orthodox Seminary.
As the honourable Member is well aware, on 16Â and 17Â December 2004 the European Council, when deciding that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria to open accession negotiations, clearly stated that the Union would continue to monitor closely the progress of political reforms in Turkey.
The Council can therefore assure the honourable Member that it continues to follow developments in this area very closely indeed.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office, the European Parliament considered, in a resolution passed just today, that the specific legal arrangements are inadequate.
Does the Council share this appraisal?
Have you made any comments on the specific bill?
Do you intend to put these issues on the negotiation agenda and, if so, when?
While we are on the subject of religious freedoms, does the British Presidency have any comments on the unacceptable and disparaging treatment of the Pope by the Turkish Government, following his invitation from the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch to visit Istanbul?
Â Â  . I am not sure whether the honourable Member had the opportunity, as I did this morning, to participate in a three-hour debate on the issue of Turkey in this Parliament.
I can assure you that the British Presidency is fully aware of the range of issues involved in Turkish accession.
I would however suggest that many of us believe that the very process which Turkey has been through, and which it would continue to move through, is the best guarantee that these very issues that need to be addressed are being addressed and will continue to be addressed in the future.
Â Â  Obviously, the issue of religious freedom is absolutely critical in negotiations with Turkey.
In the next few weeks the NGO First Step Forum will be visiting Turkey to investigate the situation on the ground and I will be happy to forward a copy of its report to the President-in-Office.
Can the President-in-Office reassure me that religious freedom and expression thereof will be emphasised throughout the accession process with Turkey?
Â Â  . I can give that assurance but I would also point out to the honourable Member that leaders of Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Syrian Orthodox churches in Turkey have said that as a result of the European Union harmonisation reforms, their communities now find it easier to worship and that attitudes towards them have changed.
I fully recognise that there is a great deal of further work still to be done, and that is why I pay due tribute to the work that Mrs Stihler and other members of the NGO community have undertaken in this field.
Nonetheless, I think the words from the leaders of the Catholic, the Greek Orthodox and the Syrian Orthodox churches in Turkey to which I have just referred tell their own story about the real progress that has already been made.
Â Â  . As I made clear earlier this month in this Parliament, this is not an issue for the Council, but for the Irish and Colombian governments.
Â Â  Minister, is that answer not a pitiful and cowardly cop-out?
The Council, with collegiate emphasis, has repeatedly stressed its commitment to the fight against international terrorism and yet when faced with flagrant contradiction of that commitment through a Member State harbouring notorious international terrorists, all it can do is shrug its shoulders in lamentable indifference.
This is a challenge to the Council.
Is it in a position to prove its credentials in fighting international terrorism, or is it only interested in ducking its responsibility?
You can do better.
The question is: have you the will to do better, or is all the talk mere platitudes and empty words?
Â Â  . With the greatest of respect to the questioner, I would suggest that the issue is not one of will, but one of locus, and given that the Council has received no request from either of the two governments involved, the Council does not have a direct locus in this matter.
Â Â  I find the President-in-Office's remarks quite amazing.
Considering that he is part of a government that has taken such a strong line on international terrorism, the way in which he has ducked the issue â his cop-out here this evening â is totally amazing.
Would he not agree that he should be encouraging the two governments of the Republic of Ireland and Colombia to ensure that there is no hiding place for those people who were convicted in Colombia, sent to jail, and who then absconded?
Would he not agree that he should be leading to ensure that in the light of international terrorism he takes a positive role and does not try to duck out of this position?
Â Â  . It will not surprise you that I reject the terms of the accusation levelled at me by the supplementary questioner.
I am somewhat intrigued, given the position of his party in relation to the importance of the nation state, that he does not accept the basic legal proposition as to where the legal locus to take action in relation to this matter lies.
That legal locus lies with the Member State and I would suggest that, rather than rehearse the arguments that we first had the opportunity to discuss in this Parliament earlier this month, he should express his concern directly to those governments which have it within their powers to take action on the matter.
Â Â  I am not that keen to get into this issue, but I simply want to say that the legal and justice provisions in the Republic of Ireland are already under way.
That system is independent of the political influence of any party in the Republic of Ireland, as I am sure the system also is in the UK, including Northern Ireland.
I want to appeal to you to take Question 9, which is the next one and in my name.
I would particularly like to put a supplementary to the Council representative on the issue of the temporary agency workers directive.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am grateful to you for that direction.
I would suggest that, given the concern expressed by the questioner and the pressure I am under to catch a plane, it might be best if we were to correspond so that he can have a full reply to his concerns in relation to the directive.
Â Â  My question is Question No 32 on the list, but you have already answered by saying that it will be answered in writing.
I look forward to that reply.
I hope the Minister catches his plane.
I look forward to continuing this discussion.
Â Â  Questions 9 to 38 will be answered in writing(2).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission declaration on Belarus.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had very much hoped to be with you to discuss this point.
She has been highly engaged developing the Commission's activities on Belarus since we took office.
On behalf of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and the Commission, I am pleased to have this opportunity to exchange views with you on the situation in Belarus and on the Commission's work to support democratisation and civil society.
The Commission is deeply concerned about the absence of democracy and the rule of law and the lack of respect for human rights in Belarus.
Belarus is in clear breach of its international commitments under the OSCE and UN charters.
We have recently seen a worrying deterioration in the situation.
The regime restricts human rights even more and is taking further steps against non-governmental organisations, undermining the rights of minorities, imprisoning citizens for political reasons and curtailing freedom of expression.
We have condemned firmly the acts of intimidation by the Belarussian authorities against the Union of the Poles in Belarus.
These incidents occur in the context of growing repression of political parties, NGOs and independent media outlets in Belarus.
We believe such interference undermines minority rights, thereby contravening standards of governance to which Belarus has signed up as part of its commitments to the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe.
In addition, Belarus has introduced decrees that place even more restrictions on foreign assistance, thereby isolating itself and the Belarussian people still further.
You may ask how the Commission has reacted.
In response to the growing repression in Belarus we have increased our funding for democratisation and human rights by transferring EUR 2 million from the TACIS Programme to the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights Programme, one of the two instruments which do not require the consent of the government.
The TACIS Programme was refocused to address the needs of the population with the full participation of the civil society.
This year we have already signed 27 small contracts with NGOs worth EUR 3 million.
We shall issue a further call for proposals under the EIDHR Programme in October, with a total budget of EUR 420 000.
We are also in the process of allocating more than EUR 1.7 million for three specific new projects for Belarus.
These will be implemented by OSCE - ODIHR, the UNDP and the Nordic Council of Ministers.
These projects will focus on human rights, democratisation, civil society and independent educational institutions such as the European Humanities University-in-exile.
We shall continue to address the broader needs of the population with the TACIS Programme and focus on health and social issues, higher education, training and environmental matters.
When alleviating Chernobyl-related problems, our approach is to fund project proposals put forward by the local communities.
One of the most significant developments in our assistance is our support for independent broadcasting.
In response to the suggestions from this Parliament and elsewhere, starting from 1 November we shall fund a daily radio news programme.
The idea is to increase awareness of human rights and democracy issues in the Belarussian population, and provide it with factual news on developments inside and outside Belarus, which would not otherwise be available.
The broadcasting will kick off in Russian, and Belarussian programmes will be phased in as soon as possible.
The start of independent broadcasting is a major step, and I am delighted that we were the first donor to launch such initiatives for Belarus.
In addition, we shall open a Commission office in Minsk early next year.
The office will be headed by a . This will facilitate our contacts with local civil society and it will also assist our coordination efforts and the follow-up of our activities.
We have also looked at how best to ensure that all our policies towards Belarus are consistent and coherent.
In trade we have carried out an investigation into violations of trade union rights under the Generalised System of Preferences and looked into the definition of annual textiles quotas.
We also keep the EU list of senior officials covered by the visa ban under continual review.
The Commission has taken the lead in the discussions on how to improve cooperation among the donors active in Belarus.
We have organised three donors meetings this year.
The first one was in Vilnius in March, followed by one in Kiev in July, and the latest one was held last week in Brussels.
The process of democratisation in Belarus and the wellbeing of its people are matters that are very close to our heart and to the Commission's objectives.
We are doing all we can to support those striving for the development of a democratic and pluralistic society in Belarus.
In particular, in addition to keeping up our focus on democratisation and human rights, we encourage the Belarussian democratic forces to work closely together.
This is crucial in view of next year's presidential elections.
We look forward to welcoming Belarus as a full partner in the European neighbourhood policy, as soon as the country lives up to its commitments on democracy, the rule of law and human rights, not only in words but also in deeds.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, earlier today the House adopted a resolution on the legacy of the Solidarity movement born 25Â years ago.
It was more than a historical resolution, however, as it was also partly an appeal to solidarity within the European Union.
We are now working on a resolution concerning Belarus, and this resolution should be an expression of our European solidarity towards those who need solidarity shown to them at present, as is certainly true of our friends in Belarus, the Belarussian people.
One might well ask why another resolution on Belarus is needed, when the last one was only adopted in July, just before the summer break.
As the Commissioner rightly pointed out, however, the situation in Belarus is changing very rapidly.
The political situation is getting worse with every month.
The latest development to come to our notice concerned MrÂ Lukashenkoâs administrationâs crackdown on the democratically elected leadership of the Union of Poles in Belarus.
The whole of the civilised world saw for itself how the largest organisation in Belarussian civil society was persecuted and its leaders brutally deprived of their office.
As a Polish Member of the European Parliament, I would like to offer sincere thanks to the Members of this House who helped and supported us in those difficult times.
Representatives of all the political groups were involved.
I believe the help and support provided by other Belarussians who share the same fate as Poles in Belarus was equally important.
In particular, I should like to thank representatives of the Belarussian opposition for their support of the Union of Poles in Belarus at this difficult time.
It points to the emergence of a network of solidarity in Europe. This network enables people who often needed help themselves in the past to support those who are currently in difficulty.
In my view, the European Commission should also be congratulated on the matter referred to by the Commissioner, that is, on the first signs of a review of the European Unionâs policy towards Belarus.
These are good signs, and I trust the good work will be kept up.
Â Â  . Mr President, events in Belarus do not concern just a limited number of Member States, such as Poland or the Baltic States, because of obvious historical, political, geographic and social reasons.
These events should be of concern to each and every Member State here.
This is one of the deficiencies in our approach: not all of us consider Belarus as our backyard issue, as indeed it is.
I will not be repeating what has been said.
Instead, allow me to register the fact that significant progress has been registered since the last time we met and tackled this subject in this Chamber.
As you said, Commissioner, the Commission is opening a representative office in Minsk and a broadcasting project is kicking off, even though some of us are not that happy with the way it is being tackled â and they may be right.
Nevertheless, this is a first step on which we have long been insisting and the Commission should be commended for having kept its word.
But we must not stop here.
The statements made by the country's President during the United Nations Summit are not a good omen.
Some of our colleagues are still in prison â I mention Mikola Statkevich as a symbol for them all.
I hope that this interest in Belarus will not wane, as political appointments in certain Member States come and go.
The situation in Belarus is too delicate to be used as a political football.
It should be a long-term commitment â and, let us hope, not that long-term; let us hope that the situation is solved in the medium term.
But it should be a commitment of the European Union.
Â Â  . Â MrÂ President, Belarus is an anomaly on the European continent.
It is governed by an individual who has himself declared the Soviet Union to be his homeland, and who regrets the disappearance of that wonderful country from the map of Europe.
This individual is attempting to cut Belarus off from Europe.
He is clearly afraid of the wind of freedom that swept through Europe precisely as a result of Solidarityâs activities.
I think it would be extremely important to ensure that as MrÂ Lukaszenko introduces charges for crossing the border, the Member States of the Union start to issue free visas to Belarussians, thus making it abundantly clear that Europe is not turning its back on Belarus as its leader maintains.
It is not simply a matter of gestures of this nature.
Activities in Belarus need to be supported also.
I was delighted to hear the Commissioner say that the European Commission is launching programmes for Belarus, but I am distressed that all this has taken so long.
After all, the year is drawing to a close.
I understand that there were technical obstacles to overcome.
If these are permanent obstacles, it seems to me that there is a will in this House to cut through bureaucratic red tape and help the Commission to act efficiently and effectively.
If we fail to do so and do not help Belarus, then not only will Belarus be a stain on the map of Europe but it will also be a stain on our consciences.
Europe needs to be synonymous with freedom, and that means freedom for Belarus too.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, we are united in our criticism of the alarming development in our neighbouring country.
A dictatorship with no respect for human rights or for democracy is being systematically installed before our eyes.
This convergence of views even extends to the Commission and the Council.
We must finally take action and use all means at our disposal to promote democracy and pluralism in Belarus.
Those were CommissionerÂ Ferrero-Waldnerâs words.
I am not, however, satisfied with what has been done to date.
The Commission has left the Polish/Baltic/Ukrainian initiative out in the cold.
There is a very tricky danger on the eastern border, tensions among the neighbouring states, and no common foreign policy.
Civil society, the only source of democratic potential and of hope in that country, is not receiving sufficient support.
What the Commissioner has proposed up to now is insufficient.
Our repertoire of diplomatic protests has been far from exhausted.
The use of sanctions should be much more modulated and targeted.
Talk is not enough.
There must be much more financial support for civil society.
I call on the Commissioner to develop a special programme and to hasten to sit down at the table with the Council, so that genuinely coherent political, financial and economic measures can be taken and thus 2006 can see the beginnings of democracy in Belarus.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to concur with the sharp criticism of the Lukashenko regime heard in the Chamber this evening.
We have seen a serious deterioration in an already bad situation in Belarus, and the regime is now, more and more, showing the classic characteristics of a political dictatorship.
I am, in general, able to agree with all the positions put forward in the resolution, but I believe that one area could be developed further, namely the significance of the independent trade union movement in Belarus.
Independent trade unions have been among the key organisers of the opposition to the Lukashenko regime, but they are now fighting for their survival and existence under the tyranny.
There is a great deal of cooperation between trade unions in other EU countries, for example Sweden, and independent trade unions in Belarus.
I hope that they will be informed about the EUâs support for the democratic opposition.
We have been reminded this week of the significance of Solidarity in Poland, and it is of course important to have a strong and independent trade union movement in order to achieve the changes required in Belarus.
Â Â  . Mr President, 11 years ago, immediately following his assumption of office, President Alexander Lukashenko made a significant pledge to his Belarussian electorate.
He said he would revive the Soviet Union.
Lukashenko has delivered on his promise.
The historic white-red-white Belarussian flag is banned and Russian is the official national language.
This absurd antinational policy has now reached its nadir with the existence, in Minsk, of an underground lyceum, which is the only secondary school left in the country in which lessons are still taught in the mother tongue, until such time, that is, as the secret service tracks down the private dwellings that also function as classrooms these days.
Against this background, I support the Commissionâs initiative to contribute financially to independent radio transmissions for Belarus.
In fact, that is what the Polish Government is already doing.
Brussels would do well to take a leaf out of their book.
Not only do the Poles earmark considerably more funds, but their programmes will also start straightaway in Belarussian this autumn.
Meanwhile, the drastically deteriorated relation between Lukashenkoâs Belarus and the three eastern EU Member States â Poland, Lithuania and Latvia â must be weighing heavily on the Commission.
The oppressive regime in Minsk even acts as if a NATO intervention were underway.
This may result in a small border conflict.
The major security risks for the European Union of 25 inherent in this prompt me to address a few questions to the Commission.
What does it make of the initiative by Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Ukraine to coordinate their politics in respect of Belarus?
Has the Commission taken steps to persuade Russia to shoulder its responsibility as President of the G8 and make a positive contribution to reducing the tensions caused by Lukashenkoâs domestic and foreign policy?
I would ask you Commissioner, as you are replacing Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, to pass on those questions that are, after all, essential to the EUâs security policy, not least in view of the CFSP.
I look forward to an answer.
I have gathered from church contacts in my own country and scientific information from Germany that fellow citizens in the EU Member States ...
Â Â  . MrÂ President, violations of human rights are an everyday occurrence in Belarus.
The latest in the long list of such violations was the nationalistic hounding of Poles, culminating in the Union of Poles in Belarus being declared illegal and its activists persecuted.
There is a lot of ground to cover, but this does not mean that we should be content with a âsoftly softlyâ approach.
On the contrary, we should drive forward relentlessly in our dealings with Belarus.
If we are not to revisit the issue of violations of human rights in Belarus on a weekly basis, a permanent rapporteur for Belarus on the Commissionâs side is needed.
So too is an effective method of funding the democratic forces, and it is hard to envisage how such support could be offered without a specific instrument devoted to human rights.
This instrument should be as flexible, fast and effective as possible concerning the provision of support in unfavourable legal circumstances.
The fact that we are holding yet another debate on Belarus testifies to the weakness demonstrated by Parliament and the European Union in this regard.
This is the fifth time Belarus has been on our agenda, yet we have still not succeeded in prioritising the issue and making it a condition of the development of good relations between the European Union and Russia.
It is true that the European Commission has been promising more and more, but it is still dragging its feet and acting reluctantly, slowly and passively where Belarus is concerned.
As a result, the European Unionâs credibility in this area has been compromised.
I would simply like to point out that even the administrative procedures adopted by the quasi-grotesque regime in Minsk have proved more efficient and effective than ours in the case of radio broadcasts.
Belarus is broadcasting to the European Union, but from our side there is nothing but a deafening silence.
I should like to conclude with a more general observation, namely that Europe has cast itself in such a ridiculous light with regard to Belarus that it has rendered its declaration on the Unionâs common foreign policy completely meaningless.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, this House has already occupied itself with Belarus repeatedly in the past, but it was only a small minority that did so: MrsÂ Schroedter, my colleague MrÂ Gahler and a few others.
I am pleased that we are now working actively on this important issue.
This is due to our Polish fellow Members, in particular, and I should like to thank them explicitly for this.
It shows that history has an impact.
There have been negative, nationalistic eras in history, but also repeated positive examples of coexistence.
One such example was the coexistence of Poles, Lithuanians and Belarussians in a federation in the Middle Ages.
That was Europe in miniature, and that Europe has repercussions today, in that we and our Polish fellow Members are all supporting not just the Polish minority in Belarus, but the Belarussian people as a whole; a people which is suffering oppression on a massive scale and which is unfortunately also threatened with attempts to restore the Soviet Union in one form or another.
Such attempts are absurd and doomed to failure but, as we know, these ideas are being toyed with further east.
It is in the fundamental interests of the European Union, therefore, to give our neighbour Belarus and its people and civil society, much greater support than we have been doing and, in particular, to ensure that media freedom is pushed through.
I should also like to criticise in no uncertain terms the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, which broadcasts its programmes in that important European country in Russian: that is to say, in the language of the colonial power that oppressed Belarus for many years and shares responsibility for the situation now prevailing there.
It is the right of the Belarussian people to be respected as a unique European culture, and this should also be reflected in the media promoted by the European Union.
This culture forms an important part of the community of the European peoples.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, the Internet has become one of the main sources of independent information in Belarus over the last few years.
The number of home computers and Internet connections is increasing.
In mid-2005, 2Â million people in Belarus were connected to the Internet out of a population of 10Â million.
Almost 450Â 000Â individuals used Internet CafÃ©s in Minsk in 2004.
At the same time, however, the state firm Beltelecom which is a subsidiary of the Ministry of Communications, continues to hold a monopoly over Internet connections.
MrÂ Lukashenkoâs regime is doing its best to control use of the Internet by civil society.
It is also persecuting and oppressing individuals active in cyberspace, invoking undemocratic articles of the criminal code for the purpose.
The European Union should be exploiting the most modern means of communication as it strives to promote human rights in Belarus.
The role of the Internet in providing independent information should be the same as that of the radio in overthrowing dictatorships in the 20thÂ century.
The Union must increase the funding devoted to exploiting those new forms of communication through the Internet and mobile telephony that could serve the interests of Belarussian civil society.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, we all have experience of unhealed wounds and injustices that may define the present-day situation for us.
This also applies to Belarus.
We should therefore bear three things in mind.
We should try to gain an objective understanding of the situation in the country, or in other words avoid picking and choosing our sources of information, and instead try not to ignore anything that does not fit in with a black-and-white view of Belarus.
We should also not exclude anyone from discussions, even if we do not necessarily always agree with their views.
Finally, Belarus is not merely Lukashenko, or vice versa.
EU policy should strive to improve the situation of the country and its people.
I do not take the side of Lukashenkoâs government, nor do I support its abject failures, but I would like to warn that a policy of force using sanctions, demonisation of the regimeâs representatives and propagandistic simplification of the problem usually only serves to escalate the situation, and resolves nothing.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, the harassment and persecution endured by the Polish minority in Belarus are widely known.
The 1995Â Council of Europe framework convention on the protection of national minorities is being systematically and brutally infringed as regards the Union of Poles in Belarus and also other minorities such as the Roma.
All this is happening in a European country located just across the Unionâs external border.
The European Parliament traditionally and quite rightly responds to violations of human rights, including the rights of national minorities in different parts of the world.
Parliament cannot therefore remain indifferent to events in Belarus.
The Independence and Democracy Group supports the draft joint resolution, especially concerning the situation of Poles in Belarus.
I therefore call for priority to be given to supporting the Union of Poles in Belarus and its legitimate leaders.
Aid should be channelled primarily through Polish bordering regions.
It should be clearly understood that the key to a genuine solution to most of the problems in Belarus is not actually held by MrÂ Lukashenko, but by his Russian godfather MrÂ Putin, a former KGB officer.
MrÂ Putin and MrÂ Lukashenko both resort to the methods of the secret services of the former Communist regime.
The European Parliament would do well to keep this in mind.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Unionâs policy to date in relation to the Lukashenko regime has been completely spineless.
The European Commission does not have an adequate action plan to foster the development of democracy in practice.
Occasionally it seems that, as far as the Commission is concerned, Belarus does not exist â it simply is not there.
The coordination of action and information between European Union institutions, the Council of Europe and the United Nations is totally inadequate.
The democratic forces in Belarus are currently totally fragmented.
I would like to call on the Commission to draft an action plan to bring the forces of democracy together.
Similarly, the Commission must continue to demand the immediate release of Mihail Marinich, the opposition leader who was convicted on political grounds.
In relation to setting up an independent broadcasting station for Belarus, I would like to draw attention to two matters.
Firstly, I would like to express my extreme disappointment at the fact that, because of the conditions of the competition that has been announced, the broadcasting organisations of the Baltic States and Poland cannot in practice participate.
They cannot even take part in a consortium. However, it is precisely these neighbours of Belarus who have the greatest expertise regarding the processes taking place in that country.
Secondly, broadcasts must be primarily in Belarussian, as Mr Posselt has already mentioned, so that the population can perceive them as their own.
The fact that many people in Belarus know Russian better, and do not know Belarussian, is a direct consequence of Russification.
That is a process we should not encourage.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the opposition parties, non-governmental organisations and national and religious minorities in Belarus are all eagerly awaiting the impact of the action by the European Commission and by the Council.
This impact remains to be felt, however.
Funds from the European Initiative for Democracy have yet to be allocated.
The solidarity fund for families of oppressed politicians is still under discussion.
The Venice Commission has not been requested to conduct an international study on the validity of the referendum enabling PresidentÂ Lukashenko to continue exercising totalitarian rule for further terms in office.
No European office has yet opened in Minsk, although the Belarussian Governmentâs mission is active in Brussels.
Individuals who have oppressed non-governmental organisations, minorities and the Protestant churches are able to travel freely across Europe, because the visa sanctions only apply to a couple of them.
I therefore urge the Commission to be more proactive and to display more commitment to these issues.
I suggest drawing up a report on the situation in Belarus in conjunction with hearings and in-depth research, with a view to drafting a plan for the Unionâs dealings with Belarus in the short and long term.
This report would also be useful in establishing needs and threats, and the resources and types of action the European Union and the Member States should take.
Such action must be undertaken in a cohesive and synchronised manner for it to have any chance of success, however.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, how many more dictatorships have to collapse, and how many more dissidents have to suffer death or the ruination of their health in prison, before dismal dictators like MrÂ Castro or MrÂ Lukashenko understand the harm they are doing to their nations?
How much longer must dissidents continue to be hounded for their convictions, defending fundamental human rights and standing up for freedom and justice?
All citizens of the free world and especially those of us who come from the part of Europe that endured Communismâs iron rule, have a special calling to combat totalitarianism and contempt for human rights.
That is why I very much hope that the European Commission and the European Council will stand shoulder to shoulder with us and help us in our struggle.
Commissioner, whilst I am grateful for the action taken to date, I feel the time has come to adopt a more determined stance.
How much longer can we tolerate the fundamental values on which the European Union is founded being held in such contempt in Belarus, a country with which the Union has a common border?
Sooner or later dictators fall, leaving devastation behind them.
I refer to fractured and terrorised societies where individuals lack a spirit of independence and belief in their own worth.
We need to help the people of Belarus to topple MrÂ Lukashenko, and we should also help them to lay the foundations for a free civil society and educate the younger generation.
We should support the democratic opposition in Belarus and condemn violations of citizensâ freedoms and human rights.
The Commission ought to support Belarussian culture, of which the Belarussian language is a part.
It would therefore be a mistake to support radio and television broadcasts in Russian.
We should not be party to the russification of Belarus, as ordered by MrÂ Lukashenko.
European funds should be devoted to radio and television broadcasts in the Belarussian language.
I would like to point out to the Commission that such broadcasts already exist.
Broadcasts in Belarussian from radio and television stations in Poland are being received in Belarus, and this work deserves support.
Similarly, support should be given to the proposed radio station to be set up by free Belarussians in Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine to broadcast to Belarus.
Those of us who hail from Central Europe remember well what a beacon of hope Radio Free Europe was for us.
Europe will always be a beacon of freedom, and I therefore call for a Radio Free Belarus to be set up.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank you for your substantive and serious interventions in this debate concerning Belarus and the state of its democracy and human rights.
I take note of the points raised and will pass them on so that we can digest them seriously.
I would also like to thank you for your support for the Commission's work, including the opening of the Commission office in Minsk.
As Mr Onyszkiewicz said, we cannot fail Belarus; we cannot ignore it.
I agree with the various speakers who are very concerned about the road Belarus is still taking.
I am also very concerned about the lack of focus on a strategic interest of Europe, something which is all too common today.
We should not, in our ongoing existential reflection, neglect the question as to how we can best enhance a stable zone of liberty and democracy in our south-eastern and eastern neighbourhood, be it for instance Turkey or the Western Balkans, Ukraine or Belarus.
This implies, inter alia, that we use to the maximum and further develop the policy tools that are available under the European neighbourhood policy.
There were some specific questions addressed to the Commissioner, and as I have said, I have passed them on to our services.
However, I would like to make a point concerning the language question.
Why do we support broadcasting in both Russian and Belarussian?
There is one simple fact which we have to take into account: 65% of the Belarussian population speaks Russian at home, while 5% speak Belarussian at home.
In order to get our message across, we have to take into account the fact that the majority of the Belarussian population speaks Russian at home.
This is precisely why we have opted for broadcasting in both languages, Russian and Belarussian: Russian for pragmatic reasons â that is what most people speak every day; Belarussian for symbolic reasons â this is the language that heralds a new free Belarus, which we are all in favour of.
The voice of the European Parliament and its support for our initiative adds tremendous weight to the European Union's efforts to push for greater democratisation and respect for human rights in Belarus.
This has never been more essential than today, in the run-up to the elections, which if fairly conducted could be a turning point in the country's destiny.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Rehn.
At the close of this debate I have received seven draft resolutions tabled under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1).
The debate is closed.
The vote on the draft resolutions will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  â Thank you, MrÂ President.
I speak on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party.
All too often recently, this Parliament has found itself debating the behaviour of the Belarussian Government, the last bastion of Communist authoritarianism in our continent.
President Lukashenko is continuing his illiberal policy by stifling the voices of a great many, mostly young people, who are demanding a future of freedom for their country.
Some fundamental rights of the individual are being constantly and deliberately denied by central government, which is instead tightening its grip and preventing citizens from freely expressing their thoughts, their political beliefs and their faith.
Minorities in the country do not enjoy adequate protection but instead are often subjected to abuse and discrimination.
It is intolerable that all this is happening on our doorstep.
While we support President Barrosoâs approach, we believe that efforts should be stepped up to increase the European Unionâs presence in Minsk: to distribute information, carry out coordination and support activities, and monitor the situation, particularly regarding human rights.
Europe needs to have the ability and strength to take effective political action, not least through closer cooperation with the opposition political forces in the country, who, with growing support from the people, are fighting to ensure a different and better future for Belarus.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0256/2005) by Emilio MenÃ©ndez del Valle on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on EU-India relations: a strategic partnership [2004/2169(INI)].
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Members from the different political groups whose amendments have contributed to improving my report, as well as the Committee on Development and the Committee on International Trade for their opinions and, of course, the officials of this House, whose work has ensured its success.
My starting point was the Commissionâs Communication on a strategic partnership between the European Union and India, of June 2004, and the excellent and well-researched response of the Indian Government in its strategic document of August of the same year.
I have taken account of the various meetings held since then by Indians and Europeans and, of course, the 5th bilateral Summit in The Hague, of November of last year, the cornerstone that officially launched the strategic partnership and which accords India the status of privileged partner, similar to that granted to other important countries.
Finally, where possible, I followed the preparations and meetings prior to the 6th bilateral Summit in New Delhi, on 7 September of this year, which gave the green light to the expected joint action plan of the strategic partnership.
I believe that, in certain areas of the report, I am going further than the Commission and the Council and there can sometimes be a degree of disagreement between my position and theirs, though more because of omissions rather than concrete actions on their part.
Nevertheless, I believe that, if my report is approved during tomorrowâs sitting, we will be justified in saying that the three Institutions mentioned â Parliament, Commission and Council â fully share the desire to promote, consolidate and enrich our relationship with the largest democracy in the world, in a manner that benefits both parties mutually.
We cannot forget that we are talking about a country, India, which is in fact the largest democracy in the world.
Furthermore, it is worth pointing out, as I do in the text, that some of the objectives indicated in the Councilâs Communication and in the recent joint action plan require specific funding which, if we are serious in our intentions, we must not avoid.
Otherwise there will be little point to any political dialogue.
In this chapter, I propose that Parliament express its support for the strategic partnership prioritising political dialogue, although I would stress that the achievement of the Millennium Objectives and the effective fight against poverty must continue to be the central elements of the Unionâs strategic commitment to India. The latter is in itself a political act, because without the political will to approve the appropriate financial resources, no development objectives can be achieved.
India is faced with the task of completing the great development project that is already underway.
I am working on the basis that she and the Union share the view that trade, investment and free competition are key factors for development, but also that, in order for this to be harmonious and equitable, fundamental social requirements must be taken into account which strengthen economic and social cohesion, the environment and the rights of consumers.
I would therefore like to call upon New Delhi to deal rigorously with these factors.
The day before yesterday â I would like to tell you â the editorial of an influential British daily newspaper said that the honeymoon between the Indian Government and the private economic-financial sector is over and it accused the Indian Government of having allowed the leftist allies â and I quote â of the governmental coalition to block the promised reforms.
In spite of this, the daily newspaper explicitly recognises that the Indian economy has the wind behind its sails, growth may exceed 7% this year, business profits are increasing, the information technology sector is growing in strength, the stock exchange is buoyant and huge amounts of capital are still pouring in â end of quote.
Nevertheless â according to that newspaper â the Indian Government cannot take credit for any of these achievements, which are due â it says â purely to good luck, past reforms and the efforts of the private sector.
I quite frankly believe that that influential daily newspaper is being fanciful.
I did not know that good luck was an active determining factor for the economy.
The fact is â and I shall end here â that India is making progress, as is its strategic relationship with the Union.
My five-minute speech has no room for any more.
My intentions are laid out in detail in the Explanatory Statement and in the Motion for a Resolution.
I would simply like to remind the Indian Government and society of certain issues such as the following: the death penalty must be abolished, the United Nations Convention against Torture must be ratified, it must sign up to the International Criminal Court and it would also be a good idea to sign up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as should Pakistan and Israel, by the way.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to pay a warm tribute to Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle for his excellent report on the EU-India strategic partnership which will serve as a very useful stimulus to the policy of the European Union in this field.
There is much food for thought in this report for us to digest.
The rapid emergence of India and its impact on the world scene is a phenomenon of tremendous importance.
As the new India defines itself economically and politically, the rest of the world, including Europe, must adjust its own vision of this country.
Europe has clearly indicated that we take India very seriously.
The last EU-India summit held two weeks ago endorsed an ambitious joint action plan which provides the framework for a qualitative transformation in the way we engage with India.
This action plan paves the way for closer cooperation on shared strategic goals for the development of trade and investment in enhanced cultural cooperation, participation in Galileo and even foresees India's participation in ITER.
This action plan provides a roadmap for the concrete implementation of our strategic partnership.
We noted the emphasis in the report on the fact that the EU and India, as the largest democracies in the world, share a commitment to values which contribute to global peace and stability.
We share fundamental values, be it our commitment to democracy and human rights or a joint attachment to institutions of global governance.
The new India sometimes seems like one world in a single country.
It combines first-class capabilities in information technology, pharmaceuticals and biotech with Third World levels of poverty.
Indians buy 2Â million mobile phones a month, but 300 million Indians still live on less than a dollar a day.
The Commission shares the view eloquently expressed in the report by Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle that open trade and increased inward investment are key factors in economic development, but that if such development is to be harmonious, sustainable and equitable it must take into account fundamental social needs.
Finally, the Commission is determined to support India's course of economic reform and modernisation.
Our regulatory dialogue, student exchanges and scientific cooperation will all serve to underpin ongoing reform.
Our relationship with India cannot be built only through bilateral cooperation.
We must look forward to working closely with India to make the Hong Kong WTO Ministerial Meeting a success.
The EU and India must show leadership in bringing the Doha Development Agenda to a successful conclusion and indeed India, as our partner, is in a unique position to make a case for open trade in goods and services as a powerful tool of development.
Â Â  . â Mr President, strategic relations between the European Union and India, especially the recent joint action plan, mark a shift in cooperation to higher and more stable levels.
I consider it positive that the new cooperation framework is not a compilation of individual objectives and means, but reflects an overall approach based on equality and reciprocity.
The dynamics of cooperation and the anticipated benefits for both sides alone are sufficient to justify the new endeavour.
However, we also need to give an important position to the dissemination of the product of bilateral cooperation in the area of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, in which India plays a central role, and within the framework of the global trade system.
As draftsman of the opinion and focusing on the pillar of the economic dimension, especially trade, I wish to observe that the challenge is to further strengthen trade and investment flows.
Greater opening of the Indian market, which will be beneficial to India itself, economic reforms, which will demonstrate systematic convergence and support for teams in the sector of science and technology are creative meeting grounds for both sides.
An eminent opportunity for constructive cooperation, as you yourself said Commissioner, is without doubt the current WTO round, the Doha round.
Finally, I trust that the particular weight which India has at G20 will take on the characteristics of a fruitful and creative contribution to bridging the positions between the developed and the developing countries.
My warm congratulations to the rapporteur.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will benefit greatly from the work done by the rapporteur and those Members who have devoted themselves over recent months to the topic of cooperation with India.
We are moving towards a strategic partnership that we hope the Commission and also the European Council will formally consolidate, while we, as the European Parliament, must strongly demand an active role in the area of cooperation with the Indian Parliament.
The rapporteur, MrÂ MenÃ©ndez del Valle, has produced an excellent report which, however, requires the ongoing commitment of the European Parliament.
The document that we will put to the vote tomorrow is extremely analytical and examines in depth a great many aspects of cooperation between the European Union and India.
We are the two largest democracies in the world, working together to promote development and cooperation not only in the economic sphere but also in the social sphere, in order to guarantee a worldwide balance.
These two leading powers must form an alliance to guarantee the rule of law, human rights and â I must stress this â the need to protect workersâ rights.
That is why, if we want to commit ourselves alongside India to achieving a new balance for peace and development in any shape or form, it is vital that an interparliamentary delegation between the EU and India should be created, that there should be annual meetings between the two parliaments and, in short, that in practical terms our Parliament should guarantee its ongoing commitment to all the items called for in the directive on which we shall vote tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle on his excellent work.
As chairman of Parliament's delegation covering India, I believe his report is balanced and demonstrates the complex and valuable relationship between the EU and India.
It also marks a real turning point in our long-shared history.
The EU and India are natural partners and, as we have heard several times today, two of the largest democracies in the world.
In a few decades India will be one of the largest economies in the world.
It possesses immense geopolitical strength and it is timely for us to shift our relationship to a higher and a more intensive level.
Both the partners are well placed to be significant players in the global, knowledge-based economy.
In the words of Tony Blair, it is crucial for the EU and India to create an equal partnership for mutual benefit, especially with our own declining demographic trends and with half of India's population being under 25.
However, while we often hear about India's highly-developed technical sector, it is important not to forget that there are still huge challenges in India where we could play a pivotal role: poverty and deprivation and over 600 million people reliant on farming.
That is why our response needs to be more than just rhetoric.
I support what Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle said about needing more resources.
The Commission and the Council need to seriously address the request for India for EURÂ 1Â billion each for health and education, recognising that one of our main priorities is the Millennium Development Goals and India makes up 40% of the MDGs.
At the same time, the Commission needs to have progressive aid policies that stimulate the entire country and not just certain regions.
Beyond all the warm words, how do we make a difference?
Our partnership needs to reach beyond economics, to be more political.
We cannot talk about an increasing political dialogue but then set up only a high-level trade group.
There is an urgent need to create and upgrade our contacts between parliaments.
I really welcome the forum of parliamentarians set up by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, but both sides need to adopt a roadmap for enhanced political dialogue, including parliamentary support.
Â Â  . Mr President, globalisation is a challenge for the world's established economies.
In Europe, we must ensure that we establish stronger ties with countries that share our values.
The proposed EU-India Strategic Partnership therefore represents an opportunity for both the EU and India and has the potential to have a positive effect on the whole of the South-East Asian region.
Whilst it is all too easy to see this partnership in purely economic terms, to my mind it represents much more than this.
Clearly, India is one of the nations at the forefront of the economic emergence of Asia.
In India, we also see a country that has our shared values of democracy, the rule of law, an independent judiciary and free media.
There is still much work to do, but all of these factors allow investors to have confidence in their dealings with India and should instil in us the confidence to take these steps towards partnership.
Within this partnership there will also be scope to raise issues in other areas, whether this be on human rights, child labour, education, development, poverty eradication, women's rights or the rights of minorities.
There must always be a willingness to raise these issues with our partners, but always to do so on the basis of equality in exchange for mutual benefit.
India is a nation rich in culture and history.
Its history is intertwined inseparably with European history.
These shared experiences provide a solid foundation from which we can build.
The growing importance India has in South-East Asia places upon it extra responsibilities.
There will be times when we learn from India's experience, but equally, at other junctures, we should be willing to provide our opinion and support to ensure that these responsibilities are fulfilled.
It is only by doing so that we can truly give our sincere commitment to the partnership.
In our global village, South-East Asia represents an area of great opportunity and it is here that our relations with India can help bring about peace, stability and closer cooperation between the South-East Asian nations.
They, of course, have their issues, whether it be water or self-determination, but there remains here a distinct possibility that South-East Asia could emerge as a closer union.
Â Â  . Mr President, having worked a 13-hour day, I will soon be contravening the Working Time Directive.
I am on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, so perhaps I will report to the chairman, but I will cope, which is more than millions of people in the Indian sub-continent can say.
Here we have the astonishing spectacle of the EU pouring funds into the three SEI organisations, relocating thousands of jobs in the call centre software services sector to India, just part of the relocation of so many jobs to Asia.
That it makes European unemployment worse is not the point.
What is relevant is the reason for the job relocation.
We all know why: cheaper products, primarily because workers in that part of the world are paid less than European workers, which means less than the legal minimum European rate.
If that is not the case, there is no reason to relocate in the first place.
They will also have longer working hours, actually promoted by three SEIs.
Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle actually boasts of up to five-and-a-half hours more per day available.
Worse, he admits to unemployment abuses in India, including child labour.
So we have cheaper products by breaking EU rules for wages and for the hours worked by employees who, I have no doubt, are often working in circumstances which an EU health and safety inspector would shut down.
In short, the EU is exploiting sweated labour, the same evil practice it is so keen to eradicate here.
What a disgrace!
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, the strategic partnership between the Union and India can be described in very simple terms.
It is a partnership between democrats.
The Union and India are the two largest democracies in the world, as has already been stated in the House.
Of course, democracy on the Indian sub-continent is rooted in specific traditions and value systems but it is democracy nonetheless.
India is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and also an emerging economic power.
It already has observer status at the G7.
It is a country of paradoxes, as I was able to observe during the couple of weeks I spent there.
On the one hand there is the very latest technological and computer equipment.
On the other, as MrsÂ Gill mentioned earlier, over half a billion people live off farming and 370Â million people, almost 35% of the population, live below the poverty threshold.
We should also remember that between 17.5 and 35Â million children have to work.
In addition, India is a country that needs to import 70% of its energy from abroad, and is dependent on foreign support.
We do not yet know whether India will be granted a permanent seat on the UNÂ Security Council.
It might not be appropriate to adjust the composition of that body, as doing so is bound to give rise to strong feelings in various European and non-European states.
There is no doubt, however, that Delhi will soon be playing a leading role on the world political and economic stage.
A strategic partnership between the Union and India is a necessary step in the right direction for both parties.
We should not gloss over certain issues such as the as yet unresolved conflict in Kashmir or the fact that the latest round in the so-called cricket diplomacy between India and Pakistan does not take account of the wishes of the people of Kashmir.
Above all, it is the people of Kashmir who should be consulted on the future of their region, not just the politicians in Karachi or Delhi.
Important as it is, that consideration should not be allowed to detract from the fact that India needs the Union and the Union needs India.
Â Â  Mr President, one of my proudest achievements in this House was to co-found three years ago the informal intergroup, Friends of India.
Since then India has gone from strength to strength and is now a strategic partner with the EU, which I warmly welcome.
India remains a stable secular democracy, which therefore disproves the Chinese position that size of country is a bar to democracy and human rights.
The Sixth EU-India Summit in New Delhi on 7Â September between EU Council President Tony Blair, Commission President Barroso and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was a great success, with the signing of the joint action plan for an EU-India strategic partnership.
This sets up a high-level group to study differences over intellectual property rights, anti-dumping and non-tariff barriers.
It is clearly in India's interests to join forces in the WTO negotiations to lower protectionist barriers, particularly in services such as accounting, law and finance, as this will free up trade and generate greater investment flows.
India now has a 220 million-strong middle class and India-EU trade volumes touched USDÂ 35.37 billion last year and are growing at an astonishing 20% per annum.
India recently bought Airbus, and in my country we are outsourcing call centres and even healthcare to India, which I â unlike my UKIP colleague â welcome.
India, though, still only represents 1.5% of the EU's external trade, compared to the EU representing some 20% for India, so the growth potential remains enormous.
More could be done to facilitate so-called Mode 4, free movement of professionals â particularly research scientists â and India is now participating, as mentioned, in the Galileo project.
I was responsible for the amendment to the report asking for India to be granted privileged status in the exchange of information with Europol in fighting terrorism.
I was pleased that this was raised at the summit.
Lastly, I thank India that in spite of its Communist Party protest it voted with the US and the EU on an IAEA resolution on Iran's nuclear programme.
India deserves its own dedicated European Parliament delegation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to congratulate my colleague MrÂ MenÃ©ndezÂ delÂ Valle on his excellent, balanced report.
The strategic partnership, which was reaffirmed in early September in New Delhi, also contains commitments.
I think it would be contradictory if the Commission were to cut the funding for India instead of increasing it; it would be incongruous, somehow.
I also think that the EU needs to increase its visibility in India.
On the British Prime Ministerâs visit, it was often unclear whether he was there as the President of the Council of the European Union or as the Prime Minister of a Member State.
We must clear up this confusion; we must make it clear that we are speaking on behalf of the EU and not just of one Member State.
The issue of the economy has been raised.
This is one basis for this strategic partnership.
I, too, believe that possibilities for trade have been far from exhausted.
Bureaucracy needs to be reduced, barriers dismantled and infrastructure, ports and airports increasingly expanded.
As has been said several times here, fair trade is also needed, however, as well as respect for workersâ rights, the abolition of child labour and respect for intellectual property.
This is part of the package, and I absolutely disagree with Mr Clark of UKIP: India is investing in Europe.
Thousands of jobs are being created in Europe, too.
For example, an IT company was recently established in Northern Ireland, with the creation of 600 jobs.
This is not a one-way street, but rather an exchange.
With regard to the political issues, I should like to see India showing commitment to multilateralism, for example recognising the International Criminal Court and acceding to the United Nations Convention Against Torture.
I believe that both parties have a good deal more planned with each other.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank MrÂ MenÃ©ndez del Valle for a successful report in which human rights questions have been incorporated into the partnership in an exemplary manner and not set aside as if they were a separate category, as is often the way.
Indiaâs development in recent decades has been remarkable.
Its technological development is looked upon with envy universally, and at the same time it has managed to preserve its multiethnic, multireligious, multicultural and linguistically diverse society.
EU-Indian relations are close; we are friends.
We have a particularly high regard for the way this, the worldâs largest democracy, is trying, through legislation, actively to rectify the defects observable in its society.
One example of this is the practice of positive discrimination.
Good legislation is not enough, however: time and effort must be invested in its implementation.
The Indian Human Rights Commission has already done a remarkable job, but local authorities should also systematically comply with good political decisions.
The EU could provide support here by means of its development programmes, for example, which would focus on the fight against discrimination.
Approximately 35% of Indiaâs billion or more inhabitants live below the poverty line, and a large number of people are still totally deprived of basic rights.
The single most significant reason for this is the caste system, which legitimises human inequality.
Especially worrying is the plight of women and the more than 160Â million Dalits (Scheduled Castes), whose exploitation is socially accepted and commonplace.
Those Dalits who try to break away from the caste system by marrying into a higher caste or, for example, by acquiring education or land legally, often become victims of physical violence and social outcasts.
Local authorities are all too ready to interpret the law to the benefit of a higher caste.
We Members of the European Parliament have on many occasions raised the issue of human rights violations resulting from the caste system, but so far we have seen little practical action on the part of the EU.
Now that industry is talking openly about the leaps in technology that India needs and which the EU can help realise, the EU should be providing India with more tangible support in issues of human rights in order for it to be able to put its excellent political will into practice.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and India are predestined for strategic cooperation and for strategic partnership.
Together we make up the two largest democracies in the world.
These democracies are based on respect for human and civil rights and on the principle of the rule of law.
The EU and India are predestined for strategic cooperation in global, political and security matters, be it on a bilateral level or within the United Nations, for example.
The EU and India are predestined to be economic partners, with the EU being Indiaâs largest trading partner, and, as has already been mentioned, with India investing massively in Europe.
In my own country, the Czech Republic, for example, Mittal Steel has successfully restructured the Czech steel industry.
India and the EU are also predestined to cooperate on the environment, agriculture, human rights, in meeting the Millennium Goals and in the fight against poverty.
I would like to conclude by thanking and congratulating our rapporteur, MrÂ MenÃ©ndez del Valle, for his well-balanced and first-rate report.
I support this report and believe that the House will also give its full support to it in tomorrowâs vote.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0227/2005) by Claude Turmes on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the share of renewable energy in the EU and proposals for concrete actions [2004/2153(INI)].
Â Â  . Mr President, the 21st century will be the century of renewable technologies.
This Tuesday afternoon we organised a conference with major industry representatives and it was really impressive to see the wide diversity of renewables and new developments such as ocean energies, solar thermal electricity and second-generation biofuels.
When we speak about renewables we are not just talking just about security of supply, about the environment; it is also about the future industrial and economic policy of Europe.
Because we have had a small number of dedicated countries, this sector is one of the sectors where Europe is leading the world.
Last week I was in Denmark.
Denmark has won the biggest-ever wind investment in the world, in the US, and it is a Danish company which will do it.
So we have an advance in this technology and we have to keep it.
We therefore need a political approach.
We also need a systemic approach to energy policy.
The best renewable energy is the intelligent use of energy; it is energy efficiency.
A second important systemic approach â and this is something that we often forget â is appropriate energy densities.
Taking electricity to heat or to cool a house is completely irrational and uneconomic.
Via our energy policy we must give up today's inefficient uses of energy and move on to the use of low-temperature renewables or waste from electricity production.
Let us look at the sectors.
In the building sector â we had a concrete example of this on Tuesday â with Commission money we are financing a project in Hungary.
It was a â one of those very bad buildings. There was a monitored 80% reduction in energy.
Then, what was a small 5% of solar heating, if you do an 80% reduction, immediately becomes a 25% of renewable share.
That means more comfort for the people who live there and job creation in Europe.
Especially in eastern Europe, refitting the building stock and then modernising the central district heating systems to bring biomass instead of coal, is a major part of that area.
Now to solar thermal cooling: yes, we can cool houses with solar energy, and this is a perfect combination because when the sun is there, buildings are getting hot, but then the sun is also there to help us produce energy to cool this building.
Therefore in the building stock it is one of the huge opportunities and Mechtild Rothe will mention some policy instruments in that area.
In the electricity sector, ocean energy will be the next big development and we have to put money into solar thermal electricity development.
For the southern part of Europe, that is a big opportunity and in the sun belt of the world there is also a big industrial opportunity for our industries.
But we have to put the functioning of the electricity market right.
Commissioner, we talk a lot about it.
I think we have to act more fiercely.
We need ownership unbundling.
We need to stop subsidies for coal and nuclear energy and we need a stable framework for renewable electricity.
My final words go to the transport sector.
Transport is the most inefficient sector.
A car only has an efficiency of 10-12%, whereas in the electricity sector we are at 40%, and in the heating sector we are at 80-90%, so the first work in transport is efficiency through mandatory efficiency for cars, moving trucks from road to rail and so on, and only then do biofuel and second-generation biofuel make sense.
There again we need a stable framework until 2020, otherwise investments in second-generation biofuels will not happen.
Lastly, I would like to thank all those colleagues who were with me.
I think we did a good job and I hope that we will see a good vote tomorrow.
Â Â  . I would like first to express my gratitude to Mr Turmes, the rapporteur on the Commission communication on the share of renewable energy in the EU, as well as to all of his colleagues who contributed to this report.
This issue has increasing importance not only with the current high oil prices but also for the medium- and long-term policies in the European Union.
We have already had the chance to speak about this today.
I would like to emphasise that even if in the renewable sector we have made quite substantial progress, still a great deal should be done, even with the target that is for overall consumption from renewable sources such as green electricity and biomass, we are still far from fulfilling the targets we have for 2010.
The Commission is doing all it can to encourage and pursue the Member States to stick to those targets.
It is clear that we need to and can do better.
I really enjoyed reading the report.
It presents a cohesive and comprehensive overview of the possibilities that exist in the short and medium term as regards renewable energy.
I understand that there have been amendments to alter certain parts of the report.
As this is an own-initiative report from Parliament, I will not comment on all elements in the report or the amendments, but take some of the key points of the report.
First of all I was impressed with the broad overview of the possibilities that renewable energy allows us.
It goes to show that we can make changes in our energy mix in the future.
Furthermore, I was very pleased to see the complex and systemic way that Parliament is approaching energy.
You rightly say that liberalisation is linked with fair conditions for renewable electricity.
You also team energy efficiency with renewable energy.
You have a vision for the use of research, market uptake and support schemes.
Furthermore, you argue convincingly that renewable energy is part of the global solution to our global problems on energy.
And finally, but also very importantly, you also link competitiveness, security of supply and environmental protection.
I want in particular to welcome the points devoted to biomass.
This sector is very important in the draft.
I can inform you that an action plan will be adopted by the Commission at the end of November.
The energy potential of biomass in the Union is significant and needs to be developed.
I share the view that biomass energy is intimately linked to other European policies.
In the recent Commission proposal for a Council decision on rural development, the Commission proposed the integration of biomass and biofuels in rural development as an important new market in a sustainable agriculture.
It is obvious that direct support measures will remain essential in the future to ensure sufficient penetration of renewable energy in the market and to meet our agreed targets.
As you know, the Commission aims to adopt a communication on support schemes on renewable energy sources at the end of November.
This communication will be a good opportunity to evaluate the many different support schemes which actually exist in Europe.
It will also address the barriers which are hampering the development of renewable energies.
These include complex licensing procedures and poor integration of renewable energy in local planning.
We have to do a thorough analysis of the various national systems.
On the basis of their impact we will have to decide on a larger-term perspective.
On heating and cooling, I welcome the own-initiative report from Mrs Rothe which will also contribute to bringing the appropriate initiatives forward.
I have seen the amendments on heating and cooling, and the Commission will carefully consider what more can be done in this respect.
In the current context of high oil prices we have to react with determination and ambition.
I outlined my five-point plan earlier today, a plan which has the support of the Commission.
I once again thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for taking the initiative to prepare the report that allows us to have the debate today, and will help the Commission to come up with appropriate initiatives.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to thank the rapporteur and to congratulate him on his important report.
Given the important advantages of renewable sources of energy, the question is how we can further promote their development, so that the citizens of the future can enjoy their advantages.
Steps have been made but, as the Commission recently reported, there is a significant delay in relation to the targets set in Directive 2001/77/ÎC.
Consequently, we need to do more and I believe that we need to do more on four counts.
Firstly, we need to create a more favourable political environment for renewable sources of energy.
The role of governments is decisive here given that, unfortunately, the large multinationals are still investing first and foremost in oil.
So we need a fabric of incentives to encourage alternative energy investments and create profitable markets.
Secondly, we need to create a suitable legal framework which will support renewables.
A framework which will go beyond the confines of an energy system which, together with its legal bases, was built at a time when renewable sources of energy were more or less unknown.
Thirdly, we also need immediate public and private investment in research to develop better and cheaper technologies in relation to renewables and
fourthly, we need to set binding quantitative targets up to 2020 both for overall production from renewable sources of energy and for electricity for heating and cooling.
Two hundred and fifty thousand jobs could be supported with planned investments in the future of renewable sources of energy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for his work and his consideration of the views of the Agriculture Committee on this important report.
I suppose there has never been a better time for a report on renewable energy.
As I came down to this debate the price of oil is at USDÂ 67 a barrel, and as we know its supply is finite.
And all the while, if you look at rural areas of the European Union, where much of the renewable energies will come from, they are screaming out for sustainable alternative enterprises.
It is deplorable, in my view, that the EU is unlikely to meet its 12% renewable energy consumption target by 2010.
It is obvious that in some Member States there is neither the will nor the inclination to take seriously the need to generate renewable energy, while others are forging ahead.
The Biofuels Directive sets targets of 2% market penetration for biofuels by the end of this year, but in Ireland a target of only 0.03% for biofuels has been set.
As for the whole area of biomass production â this so-called sleeping giant of renewable energies â which the Commissioner has just mentioned, I am pleased to see that we will have an action plan in this area.
It is very much to be welcomed.
The contribution of the common agricultural policy towards renewable energy production must be recognised in both biofuels and biomass.
Renewable energy can assist rural areas by providing diversification options, securing farm income and generating jobs.
But incentives are required to make sure that the many renewable options reach their full potential.
Specifically, taxation policy must not hinder the expansion of renewable energy.
While we are keen to encourage diversification by our farmers, I want to add a word of caution.
There is a concern that there may be a conflict in time between the production of crops for food and for non-food usage, and that would be regrettable.
Both must be sustainable and provide incomes.
I agree that the rural development policy in the future must have as its priority the promotion of renewable energy.
I will finish by saying that yesterday in Ireland, 60Â 000 people were at a ploughing championship, many of whom were talking about this whole area of renewable energies, and one researcher, who has worked tirelessly for 20 years, said to me: 'At last, I think, our time has come'.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, wish to join in thanking MrÂ Turmes, our rapporteur.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of renewable energy, but we have occasionally had to remind MrÂ Turmes of the need for the matter to be approached with more realism.
Indeed, we did partly succeed in this when it came to the vote in committee.
The report has many positive aspects.
The subject of biomass was very important to us, and I am pleased that we succeeded in voting in a whole chapter.
We want to see harmonisation of European support systems in the electricity field over the long term.
We know that this cannot be done overnight.
In the long term, however, we must create a single European market for this, too, with all its benefits; one of the purposes of which â and this is another important point for us â being to reduce costs.
We have limited funds, and we have to achieve as much as possible with those at our disposal.
This is why support systems have to be oriented with a view to reducing costs.
We still take issue with a few aspects of the present draft of the report.
For example, we feel that the target of 25% by 2020 presents problems and have tabled amendments on this.
We believe that not only the positive aspects of wind power should be discussed, but that issues of grid stability and the local peopleâs objections must be taken into account.
We believe that more attention should be paid to the field of heating and cooling than the report already does, because a great deal can be achieved in this field with little money: considerable reductions in the quantity of fossil fuels used and of carbon dioxide produced.
These are also the reasons why we want to promote renewable energy: we want to reduce dependence on oil and gas, and we want to bring the problem of climate change under control.
For these reasons, I ask for support for the PPE-DE Groupâs amendments.
There should be no doubt, however, that Europe must cooperate on renewable energy.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I, too, should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, MrÂ Turmes, most sincerely for his outstanding report and for his excellent cooperation.
In spite of the few words of criticism from MrÂ Liese, I am very confident that this report will be adopted tomorrow with a large majority.
The current oil crisis, in particular, has made it increasingly clear that finite sources of energy must be replaced with constantly self-renewing sources.
The EU has recently launched a successful strategy for the expansion of renewable energies, which includes legal requirements for targets, for example for electricity from biofuels.
We have achieved market penetration and thus made an important contribution to the fight against climate change.
Creating 300Â 000 jobs and producing an annual turnover of approximately EURÂ 15Â billion, this expansion has also made an important contribution to the Lisbon Strategy.
The efforts being made are insufficient, however.
As has also been noted already, the level of compliance with the biofuel targets is far from satisfactory, and the Commission has had to give a number of Member States strong reminders about meeting the electricity targets.
Obstacles to be removed include bureaucratic barriers, problems of grid capacity and inadequate support systems.
For I have not yet given up on one thing: the idea that we can meet the target of doubling the renewable-energy share of overall energy consumption to 12% by 2010.
There is one thing that remains very important to this end, however: closing the legislative gap in the field of heating and cooling.
This means that we need clear legal requirements with clear targets, in order to create incentives for the Member States to take appropriate action, and in order to exploit the considerable potential of biomass, solar thermal energy and geothermal energy in this field.
This is a very important message to the Commission, therefore: I urge you to take action in this field and table the appropriate legislation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank MrÂ Turmes for his work, for the work that we have done together.
The document is very important because it restores the balance in a situation that seems to favour centralised, concentrated energy production.
Renewable energies have been remarkably neglected.
Now, at last, we can consider redressing the balance and therefore devote to renewables the research effort that they have not enjoyed until now, but which they deserve because of the essential contribution that they can make to our energy requirements.
They contribute to a guarantee of sustainability, in that they are non-CO2 emitting and CO2 neutral, and to our energy independence, as well as to job creation in the European Union precisely at such a difficult time, as we have already seen today in the debate on the oil document, thanks to technology in which we are world leaders.
It will be an effort that should first of all give us precise information on the contribution that each source can make.
I am sure that their contributions will be extremely important in an absolute sense â beyond our wildest dreams â not least because production will be spread out.
That will lead to a greater sense of responsibility and a leap forwards in energy efficiency, through the widespread adoption of electricity generation coupled with heating and cooling at the same time.
That approach should be a priority, because it embodies our commitment.
In particular, I should like to highlight the contribution of biomass; in gas conversion processes it can produce hydrogen directly, and we all know how important that is.
Other renewables like wind power have already made a considerable contribution, and others are extremely promising.
That must be our commitment, and I believe that with MrÂ Turmes and his group we shall succeed in doing a lot more work yet.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I join in thanking MrÂ Turmes for the excellent work we have done together.
Let there be no doubt: the great majority of the scientific community is now convinced that greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause of the rise in global temperature, and there remains a reasonable doubt that the increasing frequency and violence of recent natural disasters are correlated with this warming.
To reduce greenhouse gases we have to aim at bringing the oil age to an end and turning to alternative energy sources, starting with the first alternative source which is energy efficiency.
A policy to increase efficiency and reduce waste can, within a few years, achieve a saving of over 20% in oil consumption; a similar amount could result from a massive switch to renewables such as wind, solar and biomass.
The European Commissionâs Green Paper on energy is a good starting point but, for it to be effective, research programmes need to be prepared that can simulate the development of sustainable and competitive energy systems, including by means of multi-annual demonstration projects â here in the European Parliament, for instance âand policies supporting small and medium-sized enterprises that invest in the sector.
Mass investment needs to be accompanied by financial and fiscal incentives for alternative energies, aiming at the development of the necessary infrastructure â for hydrogen for instance â and at sustainable transport.
The role of the European Union is decisive, not least to spur on national policies and to put Community directives into practice: only by making a coordinated effort across the continent can Europe become a credible player in global energy policies.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would like to commend the rapporteur on his excellent work.
The various energy crises coupled with the prospect of the exhaustion of non-renewable organic fuels in view of increased demand and the need to protect the environment have led to increased interest in sources of renewable energy.
I therefore welcome the decision to debate this issue in the House.
MrÂ Turmes referred to the sun.
Even if all the supplies of fuels such as oil, gas, coal and wood could be burnt as efficiently as possible, the amount of energy obtained would only be equal to the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth in barely four days.
That is something worth noting.
The issue we are debating is of fundamental importance, and it is unfortunate that we are debating it late at night with so few Members present.
There are many aspects to the challenge before us, for instance the technical, research, environmental, climatic, economic, social and defence aspects to name but a few.
Specific action in this regard must be taken across the whole Union, with due consideration for international cooperation.
This should be undertaken in individual countries ...
Â Â  Regrettably, the countries of the European Union do not possess significant natural sources of energy.
AÂ few months ago, the institutions of the European Union addressed the issue of energy security in Europe.
According to one admittedly platonic statement, the dependency of European countries on external energy sources will increase from 50 to 70% in the next twenty years.
If we consider the implications of these facts, then the energy policy of the European Union appears markedly naÃ¯ve, especially from the standpoint of securing an adequate level of energy self-sufficiency.
I certainly support measures in favour of increased energy efficiency, establishing the preconditions for an increase in the share of alternative and renewable energy sources, and energy conservation.
On the other hand, to have a realistic chance of meeting energy requirements, Europeans must overcome their phobia of nuclear energy and of established forms of energy production, operated, of course, in strict compliance with environmental and operational norms.
European institutions should also adopt a more far-sighted approach to the closure of existing energy installations.
In this context, I must criticise the decision, motivated largely by political considerations, to decommission prematurely the nuclear power plant at JaslovskÃ© Bohunice, in spite of the fact that the plant meets operational safety requirements.
This will weaken the energy potential not of only Slovakia, but of the entire European Union, and will draw away resources that might have served, among other things, to finance programmes aimed at supporting alternative forms of energy.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know that the question of promoting renewable sources of energy is of crucial importance.
The recent opinion simply emphasises this.
I think that Mr Piebalgs' recent five-point action plan moves in this direction.
Allow me now to focus our attention on two issues.
Firstly, we need to promote the independence of island systems in the European Union.
In my country, for example, we have a great many islands which are cut off from the national electricity grid.
Advanced hybrid generation technologies, which combine renewable sources of energy and storage technologies, need to be applied to independent energy systems as a matter of priority.
This will allow us to have independent, decentralised energy units, together with constant production and supply of energy to the consumer.
The second issue relates mainly to solar and wind energy.
Connecting them to existing energy networks is causing problems.
The Commission needs to study best practices in managing networks, in order to resolve these problems.
This must be our first concern, if we want renewable sources of energy to penetrate each country's energy system.
