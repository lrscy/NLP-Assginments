Some Member States have agreed a text on the Constitution for the future of Europe and it is ultimately up to them to deliver on their agreement, to make sure they convince their people.
I would never dream of going to France, Holland or Germany and telling the voters there what they should be doing.
It is up to the representatives of those countries themselves to be realistic and not hypocritical, not to play party politics and hide behind doublespeak.
Never was that more highlighted than with the Services Directive.
Governments previously agreed in the secrecy of the Council to have a Services Directive, it was put together and then suddenly pressure was applied and they all backed off and said it must be changed.
Ultimately that played into the hands of Parliament, because it made us look strong.
We could take the concerns of citizens on board and force a change in those amendments.
Plan D must be about proper debate and engagement with people; it must be about respecting the diversity in the European Union; it must be about giving definition to European Union.
But, most importantly, it must be about debunking the myths, not just those in the media but the ones we ourselves perpetuate.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, thank you all for your contributions as well as your criticism.
I think it will help in the ongoing discussion.
When I entered politics many years ago, I learnt that there were three basic tasks for any political party or organisation.
The first: to be able to describe reality, so that people will recognise reality as it is and agree that is the correct way to describe the world in which they live.
The second task is to be able to put forward a vision, to say âthis is where we want to go, that is what we want to achieve one dayâ.
And, thirdly, to be able to change reality, to implement or enforce the changes that we want to achieve.
I think that is still valid.
It is exactly the Commissionâs line.
We have a plan.
We are willing to show leadership, first of all by being able to describe the reality we live in.
Indeed, we have tried to help by describing what we have heard through our Plan D activities and from the Member States and all the institutions involved in these activities, including visits to pubs.
I was in London last Friday to listen to the fears the British people expressed about the European Union.
Secondly, we have been repeating that we want solidarity, prosperity and security, the values that we have set out in our treaties.
Thirdly, we have been showing the way, by changing the reality of the world in which we live.
That is the way to engage people and to prove the added value of the European Union: by working together to change peopleâs everyday lives.
This we know from the Eurobarometer surveys and from all our contacts.
That is what people expect from us.
That is how we can come back and approach the constitutional issues, because that is the way to prove that we have to change the way we take decisions.
We must prove that we have to make the European Union more open and democratic.
We cannot stop that work now and say that we will just wait for a constitution.
We have to do both things.
We have to move in parallel on both those tracks.
That is the only way to regain citizensâ trust.
I feel a lot of frustration, as you do, at having lost a project of the kind the Constitution represents.
But the way to remedy that is not through personal attacks or attempts to engage only in bold rhetoric.
There has been a lack of concrete suggestions as to what to do in France and the Netherlands, where we have had a ânoâ and where we have to engage with citizens again to regain their trust in any constitutional project.
That is really what we ought to discuss.
What kind of agenda can we establish to rebuild trust in those countries that are experiencing many problems?
One idea was mentioned has my strong support.
MrÂ MÃ©ndez de Vigo suggested looking at the costs of a non-Europe.
I think that is an excellent idea and worth exploring.
Let us see if we can do that together and subsequently describe our findings.
We have a number of examples to describe to people the costs of non-Europe: energy policy and the fact that we do not have a foreign affairs minister, etc.
It will make us less effective, less visible, less democratic and less open.
We definitely have to end the blame game, because we are not alone in this: we need the Member State governments.
Why should the Swedish Government, or any other government that has not yet ratified, engage in a project or stick their necks out in a situation where they see that there is no solution?
Nobody has presented a solution so far, but there are at least seven or eight different ideas on how to take this project forward.
The Commissionâs idea is, therefore, to begin by proving the added value of the European project by changing reality and doing our best to respond to citizensâ concerns.
Whether it is energy policy, tackling unemployment or fighting crime and terrorism, we have to take action.
Meanwhile, we should also point out that a constitutional settlement would help us greatly to act even more effectively.
At the same time, we must engage with governments to ensure that we sign up to the things we want to see realised in the future and that we share the same values and ideas for the future.
That is a step towards finding a constitutional settlement.
We do not want a two-speed Europe or core groups.
We believe that Member States should act in unison and that we should hold the European project together.
This means moving on both these tracks at the same time.
We have demonstrated here that we have heard what people have told us regarding the priorities, and I think you agree with me.
The first issues people raise when we speak to them in pubs, universities or elsewhere are the tangible issues.
They want policies to be settled; they want us to take action on things that affect their everyday lives.
That is what they expect from us. This also makes it easier to return to the constitutional issues.
We can definitely follow up the idea of describing the costs of non-Europe.
We should also establish a timetable for a constitutional settlement.
That is why we pointed to the opportunity next year, when we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, for Member States to agree on the way forward.
This is our response to citizensâ concerns. Being able to explain a citizensâ agenda â the peopleâs priorities â is a step forward.
Mr Kirkhope is not here, but let me say that the fight against terrorism is a very important argument.
Are we really convinced that national vetoes should remain?
The European Evidence Warrant is one example, and it is still blocked in the Council.
This is a very important proposal that would help our law-enforcement authorities to do their work more effectively.
We will move forward with these proposals.
The Constitution is not dead.
The Estonians explained that they ratified it, not because they think that this issue will be solved immediately, but as a political statement.
That was their purpose.
However, they also realise that we have to look for solutions that satisfy both the French and the Dutch people and the other Member States, including those who said âyesâ.
It is not that easy to tell those countries that they have to do it again because we have made some changes.
Today we see no immediate solutions to this problem, but we will continue to show leadership on the constitutional issues as well as changing peopleâs reality and will set a policy agenda, a citizensâ agenda.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrÂ Rack on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the second âMarco Poloâ programme for the granting of Community financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system (âMarco Polo IIâ) (COM(2004)0478 C6-0088/2004 2004/0157(COD)) (A6-0408/2005).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am here today to present to you the proposal for a regulation on the Marco Polo II programme.
This regulation is the successor to Marco Polo I, which was adopted in 2003, and has the same objectives.
The new programme, like the old one, aims to reduce congestion on the road network, to improve the environmental performance of the transport system, and to strengthen intermodal transport in order to contribute to the implementation of an effective and sustainable transport system.
The programme will run from 1Â January 2007 to 31Â December 2013, and will have a budget of EURÂ 400Â million, which is higher than that for Marco Polo I. The programme is structured around the granting of direct subsidies to companies to launch intermodal services; it is the most efficient way of providing public funding.
This programme was designed, in the impact assessment, such that one euro of subsidy granted under Marco Polo II will generate more than six euros in terms of social and environmental benefits for society.
Although it is based on the mechanisms of the current programme, the regulation provides for two new types of action: those relating to motorways of the sea and those relating to traffic avoidance.
These actions should help to reduce the volume of international road freight, and thus respond to the strong expectations of our citizens.
The Marco Polo II programme incorporates the concept of motorways of the sea, which has also been incorporated into the framework of the trans-European networks.
It puts forward objectives that are appropriate to services related to these motorways of the sea.
The calls for proposals between Germany and Finland, and between France and Spain, are now in progress.
The actions related to the motorways of the sea aim to reduce road traffic in a specific corridor.
This clearly visible Community added value will be of benefit to European citizens and, due to that, it deserves a Community contribution based on projects planned by consortia involving shippers, transport operators and infrastructure providers.
It is time to get the production sector and logistics systems more actively involved in a coherent sustainable development strategy.
That is why the Commission has also provided for traffic avoidance actions.
The industry has already taken an interest in this problem, in order to rationalise its supply chains and to reduce distribution and transport costs.
Thus, we can see that the measures to improve industrial efficiency and the political will to reduce the negative effects of transport simply by trying to avoid it serve the same interests.
Marco Polo II also extends the scope of the programme to include all of the European Union's neighbours.
Today, Europe as a whole, and not only the Union of 25 Member States, will find itself at the spearhead of an integrated transport market.
Our neighbours to the East - Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and the Balkans - and those in the Mediterranean region form part of a huge integrated market for transport services.
Production and the characteristics of the supply chain do not stop at the borders of the 25 Member States of the European Union.
The Council agreed on a partial general approach on 21Â April 2005.
I am delighted that the rapporteur and Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism have tried to achieve agreement at first reading.
This constructive approach taken by the two institutions should enable us to adopt the regulation quickly and to launch an initial call for tenders under Marco Polo II.
I should like to thank you, MrÂ Rack, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism of which you are the chairman.
With regard to the compromise that has been reached, four points are worth emphasising: aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, the funding thresholds for the various actions, the possible impact of traffic avoidance actions and the particular attention paid to sensitive and metropolitan areas.
Parliament was quite right to underline the difficulties that small and medium-sized enterprises have in accessing this programme, and the new text will quite specifically make it easier for them.
I am grateful to MrÂ Rack for stressing this point.
The minimum subsidy thresholds for the various types of action have been reduced in comparison with those proposed by the Commission, and we will look into how we can deal with the increase in assessment and monitoring work that will result.
I believe that the fear that the traffic avoidance measures could potentially have a negative effect on employment and cohesion in certain regions has been satisfactorily addressed.
The new regulation also aims to give greater attention to sensitive and metropolitan areas.
MrÂ President, I apologise for taking such a long time in explaining this proposal.
I should like to repeat how happy I am that Parliament has taken a very constructive approach to this report, with the result that, in my opinion, today's text is most satisfactory.
I should like to thank you all, in particular the rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, not even the Committee on Transport and Tourism thinks it makes sense to reinvent the wheel, and that is why we welcome the Commissionâs action in consciously flagging up its intention to follow up the success of the Marco Polo I programme by attempting, with this proposal, to continue the approaches that made Marco Polo I successful, and to do so with seamless continuity, which, among other things, means, in particular, ensuring that we will, in time â that is to say, on 1 January of the coming year â be in a position to launch Marco Polo II.
Vice-President Barrot has already described in detail what Marco Polo II is intended to achieve, and so I can, quite deliberately, keep this brief.
In essence, the object is to continue the old programme, but with added value in two respects, in that a great deal more money will be available for Marco Polo II than was for Marco Polo I, and so we will have the chance of even greater success than before in moving traffic onto environmentally safer modes of transport.
Although we have not managed to get the 47 million on which we originally set our sights, I do believe that the compromise â which had to be reached within the limits of the general financial perspective â does show that the Commission, like the other two institutions, the Council and Parliament, regards Marco Polo as an important programme.
Another âplusâ is that we have taken quite deliberate account in the programme of the expansion of Marco Polo I in response to new and changing circumstances.
We are working on the assumption that all the EUâs neighbours to the East, as well as those around the Mediterranean, are meant to enjoy the benefits of Marco Polo II, since it makes sense to intercept traffic, and transfer it to environmentally safer modes of transport, as near as possible to the point from which it started out.
If I may keep to the analogy with the wheel, we have also given the actions a slight âspinâ by adding two new ones â the motorways of the sea, about which the Commissioner has already spoken in detail, and traffic avoidance, although it has to be said that we have had very intensive discussions among ourselves about how this issue might be better addressed.
The Vice-President has already pointed out that the object cannot be to use European funds to move jobs around within the EU or out of it, and quite possibly in large numbers; the measures we are proposing must not have that effect and are not meant to.
The Marco Polo II programme has, then, in essence had an advance green light from all three institutions, and that has prompted us to make the attempt to complete this legislative project as early as first reading and have it ready for use, and it is thanks to a great deal of willingness on the part of the Commission in particular, but also of the Council of Transport Ministers, that we have succeeded in this.
In the ordinary way of things, the Transport Committee does not regard the Council as a partner with whom it has had a long and affectionate relationship, but we have, in this specific instance, managed to work together very constructively.
This House regarded the Marco Polo II draft as already satisfactory and saw little need to make any fundamental alteration to it.
We in this House saw it as important that we should ensure better opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, too, or at least opportunities equal to those that Marco Polo projects gave them.
We have put forward a number of what I hope are sensible proposals, which have to do, in particular, with reductions in the threshold values applicable to the original Marco Polo I objectives.
It is now for all of us to give what we have worked on tangible form, to foster greater efficiency and cut down on red tape.
With this project we are sending out a proper and vital message, and I would like, in conclusion to thank all involved â the Commission, the Council and my fellow-Members of this House â for their constructive cooperation.
Finally, there is something technical to be considered: because we wanted to wrap this up at first reading, we had to ensure that the two documents â from the Council and from Parliament â were technically compatible.
There is still work for the lawyer-linguists in both services to do on this, and for that I ask the Houseâs indulgence.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fortunate development in the transport policy of the European Union that we are debating today the Marco Polo II programme to promote alternative and environmentally-friendly forms of transport, which will contribute to the competitiveness of our economy and, at the same time, to the quality of the environment and our quality of life.
The new Marco Polo II programme provides many opportunities in this direction.
It extends to our entire neighbourhood, as far as Russia and our Mediterranean partner states, it provides opportunities for maritime transport by creating a separate category of actions, motorways of the sea, and it promotes the rationalisation of international transport.
Thank you, Commissioner, for the decisiveness with which you worked on the conception and structure of the programme.
My congratulations in particular to the rapporteur, MrÂ Rack, because his proposals strengthen the added value which the programme gives to the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union and its neighbours.
It gives new room for intervention in small- and medium-sized enterprises, something in which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has often expressed an interest.
MrÂ Rack also intervenes in promoting and strengthening the balance between transport efficiency, reductions in costs, pollution and road traffic, thus contributing to the objective of drastically reducing accidents, which is a primary objective of the European Union.
I am convinced that the development of motorways of the sea will constitute a dynamic element in our planning and in the efficacy of our objectives.
The sea is a force and capital that has not yet been developed in our policy and we must work in this direction.
To close, I thank the rapporteur because, with his proper handling and negotiations with the Council, he made it possible for us to have an acceptable text which we believe will quickly be put into practice.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by taking this opportunity to thank my compatriot MrÂ Rack, the rapporteur, for the good cooperation, and also the Members belonging to my own group for their patience with me and the confidence they have shown in me in this matter, for, as Mr Rack said at the end of his speech, the Councilâs rather roundabout approach to this has, time and time again, made amendments necessary at short notice.
I really am, then, most grateful for your trust.
As we are all aware, the European transport system will face major challenges over the next few years, and they need to be addressed right now.
It is to be expected that there will be an increase in traffic of up to 60%, along with the predictable consequences in the shape of traffic jams, damage to the environment, accidents and the risk of a loss of competitiveness on the part of European industry.
The Marco Polo II programme is, in this respect, certainly capable of meeting the requirements of business and industry on the one hand, but also those of the environmentalists on the other, meeting the needs of the environment and all that is associated with that; that is one reason why I was very glad that it was possible relatively quickly to draft an extended and adapted Marco Polo programme.
There were of course positive and negative aspects to this.
One negative aspect is the budget, which, having originally been quite generous, was then reduced to EURÂ 400 million, which is particularly disappointing when one considers the cuts that will have to be made right across the transport sector, and it appears that the EU has set itself the wrong priorities where the figures in the budget are concerned.
Most of what can be said about Marco Polo II is, however, encouraging; it is in those terms that one can describe the reduction in the minimum grant thresholds, since the programme did not previously apply to small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is also important that the programme covers one aspect in particular, namely the shift onto rails and the modernisation of rolling stock.
I also regard it as a particular breakthrough that, in contrast to the former Marco Polo programme, it is not only the tonnage that counts, but that, for the first time, the volume can be taken into account as well.
This amounts to a considerable step forward.
Finally, I think it particularly significant that the text addresses the jobs issue and that we have taken the initiative on this front too.
I now look forward with eager anticipation to see how this turns out in practice and hope that the programme will be a good one.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, the transport of goods on European roads will increase by more than 60% between now and 2013, and by 2020 it will double in the new Member States.
In addition to the congestion that this is going to cause, it will have a major impact on our environment: what we call âexternal costsâ.
The Commission estimates that, for every euro spent on this programme, six euros will be saved on these external costs.
We are not, therefore, happy about the cuts made in the 2007-2013 financial perspective to the budget of EURÂ 740Â million requested by the Commission for this programme for the next seven-year period.
We are going to support the proposal and the compromise amendments achieved as a result of considerable efforts by MrÂ Rack, but we would have liked projects to have been eligible for subsidy if they would have brought about a net reduction in road congestion, whether or not they transferred goods to other modes of transport.
We would also have liked to have achieved even lower minimum thresholds for the indicative amounts per euro of subsidy, so that a greater number of small and medium-sized enterprises might have accessed the aid from the programme.
However, we welcome the fact that the criterion of the volume of the cargo has been taken into account when evaluating the results of the measures that are subsidised, because it is not the weight of the goods themselves that pollutes and causes congestion, but the volume that they occupy, and consequently and definitively the number of lorries that are needed to transport them.
We also welcome the fact that measures carried out in only one Member State are accepted as eligible for subsidy, provided that they represent at least a 50% improvement in cross border traffic with other States.
Finally, as I do not wish to go on for too long, I would like to reflect on something, although this might be part of a different proposal: we believe that there also needs to be a discussion regarding our current model of production and subsequent distribution of goods.
If we were really incorporating all the external costs of transport without exception, as well as the repercussions of that model on the distribution of the population and land planning, we might have to change the model.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying that the Greens will, of course, support this programme, even if there is too little money for it; that must be made clear.
It was because we hoped that one result of the negotiations might yet be the extension of the programme that we did not immediately give our assent to everything.
The hope may have been there, but it was, unfortunately, not fulfilled.
I have to say quite frankly that the halving of the figures originally proposed was, in my view, a setback, but the programme itself has come out of the evaluation in a positive light, and it is for that reason that we will â as we must â support it.
The fact is that Marco Polo, as a programme, had the potential to â and indeed does â play a core role in addressing the problems to which transport gives rise, and would not only actively help improve modal shift, but also boost intermodal transport, for, this time, the focus is on inland waterways and on short-distance sea transport â which I will not call âmotorways of the seaâ, since that always strikes me as a rather peculiar term â and we have had to accept that certain switches from one mode of transport to another are made impossible by the absence of key points and interconnection points between them.
I regard intervention in this area as crucial and important.
The programme would also send out a message to the general population, who suffer from the adverse effects of goods transport by road, such as emissions, noise, and the other hazards to health and the environment that people talk about, which they regard as tragic and which they wish to reduce.
It is for that reason that this programme is so important to me right now.
It has, unfortunately, appeared to us from some interventions by representatives of the Commission that consideration is being given, in the course of the mid-term review of the White Paper, to regarding the switching of transport to environmentally friendly modes of transport as no longer an objective of the European Union, and that I would regard as absolutely the wrong thing to do.
If we regard the protection of the environment and public health as things to be aimed at, then what is needed is not just a programme costing EURÂ 400Â million, but rather the sort of focused determination that intervenes and says clearly that transport cannot simply be allowed to trundle along as it is doing, but must be guided â which it now is being, albeit in the wrong direction.
If the mid-term review really does entail the abandonment of the âmodal shiftâ change, we will lose credibility in the eyes of the public.
Merely giving way to the interventions of the most powerful lobbyists and forgetting the interests of the people who live along roads constitutes an abandonment of policymaking; such a thing is no longer worthy of the name, for it amounts to nothing more than allowing the economic interests of a small economic sector to prevail.
Â Â  . Mr President, the huge development of the motorway network and a reduction in prices for the customers have resulted in the enormous growth of freight transport by lorry, to the detriment of the environment and pressure on public space.
The White Paper on Transport is right to mention the shift of freight transport from the road to rail and inland shipping as an important objective.
Even after the forthcoming update of the White Paper, this should remain a priority, because without a modal shift, our transport cannot meet the demands of sustainability.
It is likely that, since the financial wings of Marco Polo II, which is to run up until 2013, have been drastically clipped by a reduction from EUR 740Â million to EUR 400Â million, this objective may not be achieved as effectively or on time.
Despite this, my group remains of the opinion that the present programme is of huge importance in order to improve the environment and to curb the growth in road transport that has got completely out of hand.
My group is in favour of extending the programme to include the European Unionâs neighbouring countries and also the extra attention for shifting more of the freight that is being carried along coastal roads to the Motorways of the Sea.
At least as important is the reduction of unnecessary transport by achieving better logistical harmonisation.
The number of miles driven can be reduced by preventing empty runs, by shortening the distances between the different processing stages as much as possible and by higher loading factors.
We have always argued in favour of the principle of transport prevention that was introduced here.
The lowering of the subsidy thresholds will produce additional red tape.
Whilst the proposed volume equivalents are a positive addition to the calculation of saved tonnage miles, the 1 on 1 coefficient that was given for this could lead to a situation in which from hereon in, all applications are submitted in volume units, because this is more profitable for business.
Â Â  . Mr President, the agreement with the Council about the Marco Polo II Programme mainly translates into better access to this programme for smaller enterprises.
Since a huge number of those are active in the transport industry, that is a major advance, which is mainly attributable to projects being combined and a restriction of the financial and administrative burden.
The only fundamental observation I should like to make with regard to this programme is that there is no assessment of Marco Polo I. The lack of such an evaluation means that it is impossible to say whether Marco Polo II will have the desired effect, simply because the link between goal and resources used is unknown.
I am therefore pleased that an assessment will be carried out next year, the findings of which will, hopefully, reinforce the set-up and implementation of the programme.
I should like to finish off by thanking the rapporteur for the result achieved which I will certainly be backing.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the proposals and advances that he has put forward in his report.
As a French Member of the European Parliament, and in view of the geographical position of France as a real crossroads in the European road network, I fully support all the initiatives aimed at reducing congestion on our roads, at promoting ways of transporting goods and persons other than by road and at improving the environmental performance of the transport system in general.
I am also delighted at the position given to motorways of the sea in the Marco Polo II programme, as the development of these motorways will have a positive influence on reducing international road freight.
As the rapporteur stressed, if nothing is done to reduce congestion on the roads, goods transport by road will increase overall by more than 60% by 2013.
We will be faced with an increasing number of accidents, with greater congestion, with more environmental damage and, ultimately, with higher costs for European industry as a whole, which, to the extent that it depends on reliable and profitable supply chains, will become less competitive.
That is why we must focus all of our efforts on developing intermodal transport.
With the enlargement to the East, Europe's maritime borders have been pushed back, and we now have new conditions and opportunities for developing the motorways of the sea.
We must make the most of them.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to warmly congratulate MrÂ Rack on getting the agreement reached at first reading and, at the same time, thank him for the way in which he has achieved this fine result.
This success is due to much perseverance on his part, so let us count our blessings.
Despite the on-going ups and downs surrounding the financial perspectives, an amount to the tune of EUR 400 million is available for this new Marco Polo programme, which is double the amount that has so far been available annually.
All credit to the Commission for extending the scope of Marco Polo II in its proposal to include motorways of the sea actions and a reduction in transport, and also for the fact that there are more opportunities for inland shipping, so that a whole range of alternative and environmentally-friendly modes of transport can help promote the modal shift via this programme.
I am pleased that Parliament, in its negotiations with the Council, has managed to carry out a number of important improvements in the proposed programme, the most important of which is a substantial reduction in the thresholds for awarding support, which, in many cases, have been reduced by half, for in practice, it still proves difficult for small enterprises to use this programme.
I am also pleased that inland shipping has been given a more important position than in the original proposal.
Thirdly, it is a good thing that public bodies, including regional and local governments, can also take part in consortiums.
This too can give small enterprises a helping hand.
The Commission has pledged to look into the possibility of awarding support to small infrastructure projects for the benefit of modal shift actions.
Minor improvements, such as building quay walls, can be decisive in the success of those modal-shift actions.
That is why I would like to ask you if you can inform us of the results of the study and whether you will actually include this possibility of small infrastructural projects in the programme.
I would like to end on a practical note.
The Commission, in its policy programme, has given priority to the reduction of the administrative burden and an improvement of rules and regulations.
Practice, however, has shown that those who submit projects are asked to submit such elaborate details that very often, they do not even know where to start.
I hope that in this respect too, the changes that have been made by Parliament via the rapporteur will lead to an improvement and can encourage enterprises.
I would ask you to keep the finger on the pulse, though, because your services will need to be accessible and accommodating to those who want to apply for projects.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteur for his considerable expertise and cooperative approach to the job.
Since he has set out in detail what Marco Polo is all about and has also evaluated it, I propose to focus on just a few aspects of it.
What is to be seen in a positive light is that the programme is markedly better funded and equipped than its predecessors, ranging from PACT 1 to Marco Polo 1, but it has to be said that its funding and equipment are not going to be equal to the challenge of modal shift, and that is why we need, first of all, to be vigilant in ensuring that the projects are, firstly, genuinely cross-border in nature, so as to ensure an added value for Europe, and, secondly, in ensuring that the reduction by half of the minimum threshold values for grants really does put SMEs in a stronger position and increase their share.
Thirdly, more inland waterway transport projects must be completed than have been in the past, and, fourthly, those national programmes that are either already in place or needed for the future must, at long last, be coordinated.
Fifthly, attention should be paid to reviewing the instrumentsâ sustainability, which will involve the Commission in evaluating which projects are still operational after a period of between six and ten years, with the Commission â sixthly â reviewing which of the rejected projects are completed even without support, so that the induced effects of future programmes may be minimised.
Mr Rack's report is, overall, uncontentious, and should be implemented as policy with the greatest possible speed; the added value of these measures will be immediately visible to the public, and that is something for which time is needed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, faced with risks to safety and the environment, with the practices of a sector that too often treats its employees as modern-day slaves, and with the expected major increase in traffic flows, the Commission seems to be realising that the problem is a serious one and that something needs to be done about it.
Free and fair competition is leading us into disaster.
We have before us a proposal to develop the motorways of the sea, rail and intermodality and to help industrial and non-industrial SMEs.
In parallel to this, however, the Commission is continuing its crusade to privatise the railways, without even reviewing ten disastrous years.
This direction is the right one to take, but there are not enough resources to make it credible.
That is why my group is calling for a separate vote on MrÂ Rack's report and on the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
We will be voting against this opinion, because it can be summed up as 'tell me what you are missing, and I will tell you how to do without it'.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Rack report clearly highlights the challenges and expectations of European society faced with the unquestionable and continual increase in road traffic that we witness every day on so many roads and in so many cities of our continent, and goes so far as to predict the âimminent gridlockâ â to borrow the term used in the report â of road traffic.
It is therefore the duty of the legislator to promote alternative and more environmentally-friendly modes of transport and, above all, to better integrate intermodal transport and to make it as functional as possible, for the purposes of both safety and quality of life, while of course seeking to mitigate the demands of the economy.
In this regard, MrÂ Rack's excellent report presents timely proposals for the Marco Polo II programme, which I hope the budget allocation will make it possible to subsequently carry out.
The party that I represent, the , has always supported the idea of the so-called âmotorways of the seaâ, which Italy itself designed for the Mediterranean as far back as the first half of the last century; such motorways are rightly taken into consideration and relaunched in the Rack report as part of the Marco Polo II programme.
I clearly support â and I call on my fellow Members to do the same â MrÂ Rackâs amendments, which are aimed at revising the Marco Polo II programme for the purposes of reducing the administrative formalities required for intermodal transport.
I believe that this is an excellent report, which I hope will gain the support of Parliament as a whole.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to begin by congratulating MrÂ Rack on his excellent report.
I believe that his objective and that of most Members who contributed to the debate in committee was to address the need, above all, to rebalance the distribution of means of transport in a sustainable manner and to develop intermodality, addressing the congestion problem with efficiency.
There is no other way to combat the anticipated increase in road freight transport, which is forecast to reach over 60% by 2013 in the EU alone.
That being said, the excessive transport of freight on our roads is simply the most visible problem.
Its costs in economic, security and environmental terms are huge.
It is therefore essential to take consistent measures to offset these negative effects.
Reducing road freight transport and transforming intermodality into a competitive and economically viable reality is the right way forward if we are to reverse the current trend.
Against this backdrop, and fine-tuning the previous programme, Marco Polo II contains a broader and more complete range of necessary and welcome incentives and measures, which will be applicable not only on EU territory but also in neighbouring regions, and this is to be welcomed.
It will make it possible to boost investment in rail transport, inland navigation and in the use of motorways of the sea more effectively, making use of European maritime islands and the outermost regions as thoroughfares between those routes â the motorways and inland navigation.
It is also vital to promote the development of technical innovations that could bring competitive benefits for alternative modes of transport, especially as regards trailing loads.
The objective of reducing international road transport, especially that of freight, implies pushing to the fore projects located in sensitive areas, such as urban areas in which traffic is mainly concentrated.
Lastly, Mr President, I shall turn to the issue of funding.
This programme, as we know, has been the subject of delicate negotiations in the context of the financial perspective, the result of which is an overall sum of EURÂ 400Â million, much less than that proposed by the Commission.
This is regrettable as it is indicative of less strategic ambition.
As it is not possible to obtain greater resources, as the Commission rightly proposed, it will be the use and distribution of this sum of money that will dictate the success of the programme.
I must therefore commend MrÂ Rack, the rapporteur, on the proposed reduction of the eligibility ceiling for some products.
This will make this programme more accessible for SMEs, which make up a significant portion of the business world and which employ a significant proportion of the European workforce.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the objectives contained in this report and the solutions that it puts forward will certainly have a decisive impact on the future of Europeâs freight transport, in terms of its fluidity and its sustainability.
It is therefore vital that it obtains Parliamentâs support.
Â Â  I wish to say thank you, and particularly of course to the rapporteur, MrÂ Rack, for the work done by the committee.
As many have said in this House, we must obtain a more environmentally friendly transport system in Europe.
We have a very great deal of environmental pollution.
At the same time, transport is extremely important for our regions and for companies out in the regions.
Combined transport will become extremely important in the future if transport systems are to operate throughout the territory of the EU.
The Marco Polo project also reveals the different conditions under which we live in the various regions of the EU.
In many regions, there are long distances to be travelled.
Companies in these regions are in many cases subcontractors for larger companies in more heavily populated areas.
They are very important for employment in those regions that are a long way away.
The Marco Polo project ought not, therefore, to lead to employment in the EU being relocated.
I have proceeded in the committee on the basis of this view and can now accept the compromise relating to Article 1 of the report to the effect that the Marco Polo project should create added value for the EU without damaging economic, social or territorial cohesion, as well as the future Article 2 to the effect that the project should not adversely affect production or employment.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased to express my gratitude to the Commission by thanking Vice-President Barrot.
I would like to thank him for this proposal, for this initiative and for his speech confirming the positive steps being taken.
I would like to express my appreciation to MrÂ Rack for his work, as we have received a document which could make a significant contribution to more effective use of the transport infrastructure by means of active support for intermodal solutions.
We are well aware that the European Union budget, including that for the period 2007-2013, will have much less funding available for transport than we would have wished to receive.
This means that it will be better all round if the solutions based on using the existing infrastructure are as good as possible.
I would also very much like to stress that this is a historical moment: an enlarged European Union, perhaps with two more members from 1 January 2007.
We therefore have the opportunity to involve the new Member States in shaping a new European transport and logistics system.
It is very important to maintain the role played hitherto by the railways in the new Member States.
Finally, I am pleased that we see an opportunity and a new role for small and medium-sized enterprises, and that we are moving in the direction of stabilising the transport and logistics systems.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all I would like to cordially congratulate the Commission on its excellent proposal, and also the rapporteur and other colleagues, who have improved it in an exemplary and cooperative manner and achieved an early agreement with the Council.
I would also like to congratulate us, the European Union, on the existence and improvement of this Marco Polo programme, which is achieving effective results through its efficient, although possibly too discreet, work.
I value its achievements compared with other programmes and projects due to, among other things, its activities, which are on a small scale but add significant value in return.
In addition, access for SMEs is being improved, along with short and medium-term plans, which gives an immediate visibility to the value of the European Union.
This is a tool that is driven by demand and therefore produces effective and consolidated results.
Finally I would like to highlight its strength as a means of proposing and driving forward innovative measures and policies.
Regarding the addition of motorways of the sea, I must refer to the example of the successful relationship between Valencia and the Italian coastlines and the avoidance of traffic through the integration of logistics, and in the last few days we have learnt that a company like Mercadona â which is now achieving ratios close to those of Carrefour in Spain â is in discussions with RENFE regarding a permanent transfer from lorries to trains.
We think that this is another example driven by this type of programme.
To conclude, I would like to express two wishes: from the experience of Marco Polo I and this improved Marco Polo II, and looking to the review of the White Paper on Transport, I hope that the successes and achievements of this programme will help us to maintain a firm commitment to modal shift from roads to more sustainable modes of transport, and logistics will obviously be the key to this.
Also, and for this I trust in the Commission and the Commissioner, who have the necessary ability and enthusiasm, I hope that the successes and formulas of Marco Polo are incorporated into the discussions on the trans-European networks, which ultimately have the same objective but on a very much larger scale, which sometimes makes them difficult.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I will keep my comments very brief.
I will simply remark that the Commission envisaged EURÂ 740Â million to fund 'Marco Polo II' and that the European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism voted in favour of that sum and restated its keenness to secure proper funding for the programme.
However, we now have a proposal for EURÂ 400Â million over seven years, with new priorities that need to be funded, eligibility thresholds 50% lower and twice the geographical scope.
Just as in the case of the trans-European transport networks, we are spreading ourselves very thinly.
I rather doubt that, under these circumstances, the hoped-for trigger and lever effects will materialise, and I find that deeply regrettable, all the more so because 'Marco Polo II' is a programme that has already proven itself to be effective.
Now more than ever, Europe must keep its promises if it is going to regain people's trust.
We are not going to manage it with this kind of budget, though.
Even though I welcome the efforts made by the members of Parliament's Committee on Transport to limit the reduction of this funding, I cannot vote in favour of this report, and I will be abstaining in the final vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, road freight transport in Europe has increased enormously over recent decades and will increase by more than 60% by 2013.
This is a huge figure.
This increase certainly has numerous negative consequences which we all know about: pollution, congestion of the roads, accidents and particularly high infrastructure maintenance costs.
The way to cut this spiralling increase in road transport and limit its negative consequences is to develop alternative forms of transport and, in particular, to strengthen short-distance maritime transport by creating motorways of the sea and rail and inland waterway transport.
However, this must be done in conjunction with the harmonisation of the networks of areas bordering the European Union, because a great part of the burden comes from there.
The Marco Polo programme may help in this direction, by financing appropriate actions to prevent the risk of our road transport system collapsing.
Certainly, like other programmes for the next period from 2007 to 2013, the budget is ultimately reduced in relation to what we had proposed.
Finally, I too wish, for my part, to congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Rack, on his report.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I will be brief.
First of all, I should like to thank MrÂ Rack and your Committee on Transport and Tourism, and also Parliament in general, for this work, which will allow the proposal to be adopted at first reading.
The Commission supports the compromise reached during the informal trialogue with the Council.
We accept the amendments adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which reflect the Council's position, and the new compromise amendments proposed by MrÂ Rack and supported by the various political groups.
They reflect the compromise from the informal trialogue with the Council.
MrÂ President, honourable Members, I have been struck by the level of agreement in the views expressed by the various speakers.
We are indeed quite determined to avoid the dangers and risks of a continual increase in road traffic on Europe's roads and motorways.
To achieve this, we need, particularly through the Marco Polo II programme, to actively promote all the alternative solutions: motorways of the sea, river navigation and a truly European rail network.
Like you, ladies and gentlemen, I regret that we do not have more funds, but, as one of you said, I think we need to make the best use of the funds we do have.
That is why I rather hope that, thanks to the promotional measures set out in Marco Polo II, we will be able to achieve positive results.
I would add that the same philosophy will inform our decisions regarding the programmes for the trans-European networks.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you once again for your work.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commission for its positive response to the own-initiative proposal of the Committee on Fisheries. The response has been so positive that there will even be a change to the EUâs trade policy.
At long last, we will be able to adopt our own sustainability policy, even in our export policy with regard to fisheries products.
Secondly, this proposal gives all regions in Europe and civil-society organisations scope for implementing policy, something which will be brought to a close in the Commission proposal and probably also in the Council proposal.
I am grateful to the Commission for taking that line.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to raise a point under RuleÂ 151(3) of the Rules of Procedure.
I wonder whether you can help me.
Should you declare Amendments 8 and 16 of this Doorn report inadmissible, since the Treaty of Nice is the only treaty that is in force?
There is no such thing as the âConstitutional Treatyâ.
Although there are many here who wish to forget that, the French and Dutch voted ânoâ in their referendums.
No treaty has replaced the Treaty of Nice.
These amendments should therefore be declared inadmissible.
Â Â  I am sorry, MrÂ Bloom. I got your name wrong.
I called you MrÂ Berlato.
I apologise. How could I have failed to recognise you?
Your point is essentially political and very well made.
We all take note of it, thank you.
Â Â  President Abbas, honourable Members, the European Parliament is very honoured that you are here today with us, and the massive attendance at this plenary sitting is evidence of that.
I would like to thank you for returning to Strasbourg so quickly following your disrupted visit when events forced you to cut short your visit to Strasbourg in March.
You have been in the eye of the storm ever since, because the storm is still raging in the Middle East, and these weeks and months are, and will be, decisive for the future of the Palestinian people and for the Israeli people, and they will also have a very significant impact on the whole region, and consequently also on the European Union.
Mr President, all of us here want to do everything possible to bring about a viable peace process, and we are fully aware that if we do not act correctly, we run the risk of the world being driven towards a period of holy wars, religious wars, brought on by the election of potentially aggressive parties throughout the Middle East.
Therefore, President Abbas, the European Parliament wants to listen to you: because of all your experience and your long, constant quest to bring an end to the conflict through dialogue with the enemy.
No one in Europe has forgotten that, since the 1970s, you have paved the way for negotiations for peace, even way before the majority of your people were ready to accept it.
You negotiated the beginnings of peace with Matiyahu Peled in 1977, and those agreements pointed the way towards a solution based on the co-existence of the two States.
You led the negotiating team in Oslo, you were the person who signed those agreements on behalf of the PLO, and after your election as President last year, you sought to restart the peace process, giving rise to a truce between the armed groups in the territories.
No one can therefore have the slightest doubt as to your commitment to peace and your will to negotiate, on the basis of international law and respect for the agreements already made.
In addition you have the legitimacy of having been elected by 62% of the Palestinian electorate, on the basis of that commitment.
Then came the legislative elections in January, which were a fresh opportunity for the Palestinian people to show their firm commitment to democracy, but at the same time, the results of those elections, which Europe respects and fully recognises, created serious concerns in the international community.
That international community is, however, beginning to realise the dangers of suspending aid to the Palestinian people.
The meeting of the Quartet last week gave the European Union the responsibility to find a mechanism for channelling aid to the Palestinian territories and therefore at least maintaining essential public services.
The plenary of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which I had the honour of presiding over until a month ago, has made an appeal, which was reiterated by the bureau last week in Tunis, in response to the chaos that could result from the lack of international financial support and from the illegal withholding of customs duties that the Palestinian people have a right to.
Mr President, you have the opportunity to talk to the representatives of the people of Europe about all of these matters and you can do so in the knowledge, which we all have, that you are the only person who is capable of talking to all the parties involved.
You are the umbilical cord that can still take us from conflict to peace, and this is why we are so interested to hear your proposals and to help you to find the way to overcome these difficult times.
You have the floor.
Â Â  (1). In the name of God the merciful, the beneficent; Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, allow me first to express my gratitude for the invitation.
It is an honour to address this Assembly, which represents a unique success story for the peoples of the Europe; a story that contains various lessons that can be used as a paragon for many countries and peoples across the world.
When I speak to you today, I convey the message of the Palestinian people to the peoples of a continent we have always been linked to with relations of neighbourliness and as a result of our historical links of cooperation and friendship and partnership and association in numerous sectors.
We would like to launch this cooperation through fruitful dialogue between civilisations and cultures which can enrich both sides of the Mediterranean and help all of us to defuse extremist views in order to ensure that our historically close links continue, and for us to be able to achieve peace in the Mediterranean area.
As I speak to you today, I realise that I am addressing legislators who are very familiar with our problems, and many of whom have been eyewitnesses to the problems and the suffering of the Palestinian people during visits to our country.
Only yesterday, the Palestinian people commemorated the 58th anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba in 1948, which represented the historical injustice when we, the Palestinian people, were uprooted from our land, forced into a Diaspora; when many of us were displaced and forced to become refugees.
Throughout the political course and national struggle of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and following the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994 in the aftermath of signing the Declaration of Principles, the desire for a major, effective and active European role has always been a fundamental pillar in Palestinian policy and diplomacy.
Our people have never forgotten the positive positions adopted by numerous European countries since the early 1970s in support of the Palestinian peopleâs rights and its national liberation movement led by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Our people have not forgotten either the European countriesâ generous political, financial and technical support for building Palestinian institutions and a national assembly, and in helping us to deal with the consequences of the policies of occupation, besiegement and destruction.
This support has strengthened our peopleâs confidence in the justice of our cause and in international law.
At this point in time, another difficult time, we are quite logically looking to Europe, in that our region is open to all options, and that is why we seek and are waiting for Europe to play a leading role in the area.
Despite the horror of the historical injustice inflicted upon our people, we have always been able to formulate a realistic policy to restore the rights of our people to self-determination.
In early stages, European capitals were places where secret, semi-secret and public meetings between PLO officials and Israeli activists from the peace camp took place.
It was in a European capital, Oslo, that the first official contacts took place between the PLO and the Israeli Government.
The initial signature of the first agreement in history between the two sides in 1993 also took place in Oslo, before its official signing in Washington that same year.
When the Palestine National Council approved in 1998 the Palestinian peace initiative and accepted United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, it offered an opportunity to achieve a historical reconciliation.
I must honestly say that this was not easy for our people.
But here I must recall the role played by our historical leader Yasser Arafat.
It took courage to take these decisions; it took courage to put forward a peace formula enjoying the support of our people on the basis of establishing a Palestinian state on only 22% of the land of historical Palestine, which represents the land occupied by Israel in 1967.
Following the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, we have continued our intensive search for peace.
We repeatedly emphasised that the core of the process had to be based on the principle of partnership, a partnership committed to agreement and to the resolution of problems imposed by the legacy of a long, bitter and bloody conflict; a partnership that understood the legitimate concerns of the other and that could lay the foundations for a new and different future for both Palestinians and Israelis.
The severest blow to the peace process, which was supposed to have reached its final stages within a few short years, was a result of the Israeli rejection of the logic of partnership and its insistence on practising destructive policies, particularly on building settlements, constructing walls and confiscating land to create a reality on the ground that would prejudice and pre-empt the outcome of negotiations.
The abandonment of commitments and agreements and the rejection of international patronage have become a main feature of Israeli policy, and have resulted in the loss of momentum of the peace process and the consequent shaking of peopleâs belief in its usefulness.
This policy has developed in recent years to the level of attempting to completely destroy the Palestinian National Authority and its institutions, and to the systematic destruction of our basic infrastructure, which your countries contributed in developing.
For our part, and despite the state of frustration and suffering of an extent that I am sure you will realise and appreciate â particularly those of you who have witnessed it closely â we have been careful not to allow our national struggle to be diverted from its course and to make sure that it has complied with international law.
We have rejected and condemned attacks against civilians.
We have rejected terrorism in its forms.
We have emphasised the importance of building a culture of peace instead of a culture of war, and we have done everything peaceful that we could to resist occupation.
Sixteen months ago, the occupied Palestinian territory observed presidential elections after the death of President Arafat, in which I stood with a clear platform: to declare a truce and emphasise that negotiations were the only way to resolve the conflict.
I also wanted to introduce a policy of reform in various fields, to strengthen democracy, to achieve a period of calm, to foster security, and to promote the rule of law.
I am proud that the Palestinian people trusted me with this task.
Our work started immediately, with the agreement of all the groups and factions, who agreed to respect this truce.
It was the first time in years we had seen an almost complete halt in armed attacks by Palestinians. But our Israeli counterpart responded with the continued construction of the apartheid wall in the West Bank that divides our territories into scattered cantons.
It has continued with its assassinations, arrests and military incursions into our towns, villages and refugee camps.
It has continued its tightened and suffocating sieges; it has continued to reject agreements and understandings, including the understanding reached in Sharm al-Sheikh after the presidential elections in Palestine.
And in spite of all this, we agreed to Israelâs plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip.
We ensured that it was implemented smoothly and calmly, and proved our ability to assume our own security responsibilities, especially in the border areas where monitors from the European Union have assisted us in ensuring the proper functioning of the first border crossing in history that is fully administered by Palestinians.
The Israeli policy of rejecting our extended hand, of rejecting the opportunity of negotiating and giving peace a chance, has increased the frustration of our people.
Israelâs policy has also exacerbated the deteriorating economic conditions in Palestine, and has made movement between one town and another long and dangerous because of checkpoints spread throughout Jerusalem and the West Bank.
These checkpoints oppress and humiliate individuals who only want to lead normal lives, reach their places of work and their fields, travel to their hospitals and universities, take their children to schools or go to mosques and churches.
The frustration and disappointment created by the practices of the Israeli occupation and the absence of a positive outlook for the peace process formed the background for the legislative elections that took place last January.
The whole world witnessed how the transfer of power was smoothly and democratically implemented, and how we established the foundations and the tradition of a democratic process that we have no choice but to follow.
We would reiterate once again that democracy remains without soul in the absence of peopleâs freedom and in the continued occupation.
Over the past four months, we have been going through an unprecedented situation.
The declared platform of the party that won the elections and formed the government does not conform to my platform and the commitments and prior agreements of the Palestinian Authority.
Our approach to dealing with this situation is underpinned by the same principles that led us to carry out elections on time.
We are addressing this problem inside our institutions and in accordance with our laws and regulations.
The political activity in Palestine over the last few months is gradually producing a public opinion that emphasises respect for the agreements and commitments undertaken by the Palestinian Authority, and commitments to international law.
I have asked the new government to amend its platform in order to conform to these international commitments.
We are in a constant and continued dialogue that will take us to an expanded national dialogue in just a few daysâ time.
I hope that this will lead us to the required process of amendment.
Our approach needs the support of the international community.
The new government must be given the chance to adapt to the basic requirements of the international community.
Stopping assistance to the Palestinian Authority, cutting aid to the Palestinian Authority, will only further exacerbate the deteriorating economic and social situation in the country, and will weaken the network of efficient and working government ministries, administrations and institutions that the countries of the European Union played a vital role in building and developing in the first place.
Here, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Quartet for its latest decision to resume providing assistance to the Palestinian people on the basis of a mechanism that will be developed under EU leadership.
In that regard, we call upon Israel to fully release our tax and customs revenue immediately.
The European Union can play a leading role here, and we would ask for your assistance in ensuring that Israel fully releases the tax and customs duties that are owing to us immediately.
The Israeli Government is yet again repeating the slogan âNo Palestinian partnerâ.
You will recall that the Israeli Government used this slogan in the past as an excuse to abandon agreements and to refuse to return to the negotiating table.
We are gravely concerned for the future of peace in our region as we hear about Israeli projects that aim to draw the final borders of Israel inside occupied Palestinian territory.
These projects will foreclose any possibility of implementing the two-state solution because they will annex large portions of occupied Palestinian territory and will turn that which remains into scattered islands that lack geographical contiguity and vital water resources â water resources that the Israelis wish to claim as their own.
This attempt to implement unilateral projects will destroy any remaining hope of reviving the peace process.
It will also lead to another bitter period of tension and conflict, for which peoples in this region have already â for decades â paid a heavy price.
The claim that there is no Palestinian partner or counterpart has no basis.
I reiterate that, based on the constitutional power granted to me by our basic law, which entrusts the PLO Executive Committee, its President and its Negotiations Affairs Department with the responsibility of negotiation, we remain fully committed to returning immediately to the negotiating table to reach an agreement to end this long conflict.
That is a fact I stressed when I spoke to Ehud Olmert by phone to congratulate him on taking office a few days ago.
During that conversation, I stressed our true desire to immediately return to the negotiating table to negotiate peace.
The whole world demands this of us, and we ask that the international community act immediately to support us, in order to prevent the region from sliding into an abyss and a new cycle of conflict that will have a negative impact not just on the Middle East, but on the world as a whole at a time when the region is experiencing other tensions too.
We want action based on international law and the roadmap.
We want negotiations between partners as an alternative to the Israeli policy of unilateralism, diktat and the negation of the other side.
All of this is extremely important for us, because it is only through negotiations that we can in fact unify people in our region, while providing them with the principles of peace, development and modernisation that we share with the people of Europe.
I once again thank you for this invitation and for your hospitality.
I believe that I have just spoken before friends who share with us the dedication to promote the values of freedom, democracy, tolerance and dialogue.
I am confident that you will continue to support the just cause of the Palestinian people until we gain our freedom and build an independent state in the Holy Land on the basis of the 1967 borders with the State of Israel.
Thank you for listening to me.
Â Â  Thank you very much Mr President.
You saw how intently the European Parliament listened to your speech.
Your last words are also our own, as we remain committed to the solution based on the existence of two States.
I am also sure that your words will have encouraged many MEPs to dedicate more time and thought to the Middle East problem.
Since your ruined attempt to be here we have not adopted a new resolution on the subject, but we have held many debates.
The debate that is about to take place in the Conference of Presidents will also help Parliament to be able to better define its positions on the conflict.
Thank you again, Mr President, we wish the best for you and your people.
Â Â  We now resume the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, this information is only for my PPE-DE colleagues, as there were some minor problems with the first amendment.
First of all, we did not have time to discuss the matter in committee.
Secondly, both in the Polish and other language versions, Mr Buzek is mentioned as one of the authors of the amendment.
This is incorrect.
Although it is contrary to our voting list, I would nevertheless like to ask my honourable colleagues to vote in favour of this amendment as well as in favour of the whole report in the second vote.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  The Commission proposes removing customs duties for certain varieties of unpolished rice from India and Pakistan, a development we think is excellent.
We Swedish Conservatives are therefore voting in favour of the proposal.
At the same time, retained quotas are proposed for a number of other varieties of rice from the United States and Thailand in accordance with the agreements concluded by the Commission with the individual countries.
We believe that all the customs duties on rice should be removed, since duties are to the detriment of the exporting country, consumers within the EU and general economic development.
Â Â  . The text of Council Regulation (EC) No 1785 needs to be amended in order to incorporate the amendments to the arrangements for importing rice arising from the agreements established between the Commission and India (Council Decision 2004/617/EC of 11Â AugustÂ 2004), Pakistan (Council Decision 2004/618/EC of 11Â AugustÂ 2004), the United States of America (Council Decision 2005/476/EC of 21Â JuneÂ 2005) and Thailand (Council Decision 2005/953/EC of 20 December 2005).
These agreements established customs arrangements for imports on the basis of the nature of the product and the quantities imported, authorising the Commission to derogate Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 for a transitional period.
As this derogation was due to expire on 30Â JuneÂ 2006, there is a pressing need to amend the text of the regulation in force.
I therefore endorse the Commissionâs proposal and support the Daul report.
Â Â  We have voted against this report.
We believe that, in principle, the trade in rice should be free, thereby reducing consumersâ household expenditure.
Â Â  . Broadly speaking, I am in favour of the adoption of this document.
The collapse of the Fisheries Agreement between the EU and Angola was inevitable in view of the obligations created when the new legal framework came into force in Angola, which run counter to the EUâs principles on fishing agreements with third countries.
I support the idea of making the current Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance more flexible and the derogation measures put forward in this proposal.
I also feel however that, in the name of reciprocity, the EU should be aware of the fishing activities of Community vessel owners who stand to benefit from these measures.
Â Â  The Commissionâs proposal differs from most proposals concerning fisheries agreements with third countries because, instead of extending the agreement or introducing a new protocol, the EU is cancelling the current fisheries agreement with Angola.
The June List consistently votes against extensions to fisheries agreements and thus welcomes the cancellation of this agreement.
We have thus voted in favour of this report.
The reason why the agreement is being cancelled is that the Commission has certain views on the Angolan legislation concerning biological aquatic resources.
The rapporteur regrets that the Community and the Angolan authorities have not succeeded in reaching an agreement.
We regret, rather, that the EU still intends to conclude destructive new fisheries agreements and to extend existing agreements.
The Commission and the European Parliament do not appreciate that the fisheries agreements with third countries have harmful consequences for the populations of the countries in question.
We thus have a quite different perspective to the rapporteur when it comes to our approach to the EUâs fisheries agreements with third countries.
Â Â  . In addition to the loss of fishing opportunities, of jobs and of the added value associated with fishing activities, the denunciation of the agreement will mean that vessels that depend on fishing off Angolan waters will have to be converted.
Regrettable though this denunciation is, we must look into other viable possibilities for the vessels in question to be able to operate in other areas or under other fisheries agreements.
New fishing opportunities or opportunities already in existence that are not being used must be negotiated.
Alternatively, vessels in Angola could stay by means of setting up joint ventures.
That way, jobs can be kept and vessels saved from scrapping.
Measures must therefore be taken to facilitate the conversion of these vessels, for example by exempting them from having to pay back construction or modernisation aid obtained during the previous ten years, and temporary tie-up aid awarded under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance.
Joint enterprises or other types of joint venture with a third country should be based on genuine cooperation projects that are mutually beneficial.
The relocation of the fleet and the fishing industry from Community countries should not be encouraged, with the loss of jobs and economic activity that that implies, both upstream and downstream.
Â Â  â Mr President, the report on the place of supply of services has to do with the taxation of services for persons who are not liable to tax, and resulting as it does from the Commissionâs report â submitted as long as three years ago â on the amendment of the rules relating to the taxation of services rendered to taxpayers, it relates to the business-to-business sector.
There are a number of reasons why this House has not made any substantial amendments to it.
The first is that the Commission proposal constitutes a coherent framework for the amendments to the sixth Value Added Tax Directive, which were proposed all of three years ago.
Secondly, this framework achieves a good compromise between taxation at the place of consumption and European businessesâ ability to administer this tax.
Thirdly, the proposal is an important step towards the reform of the European VAT system in a changed environment.
Fourthly, we hope that the Council will adopt this regulation together with the proposal for the establishment of a one-stop shop for businesses, which will make it possible for European businesses to have less bureaucracy to deal with.
Â Â  . Following the rather inglorious episode involving the Services Directive, another attack on the country of origin principle, this time with regard to the VAT payable on services, would be one more step in the wrong direction.
If the ideas set out in MrÂ Karas's report are put into practice, this will have negative and dangerous repercussions, because the Commission and many of the countries in the Council want the place of consumption to be the determining factor for the provision of services, rather than, as now, the place from where the service is provided.
However, abandoning the country of origin principle would create a complex, bureaucratic, uncontrollable and therefore impracticable system.
Taking account of the place of consumption goes against the principles that, until recently, governed the VAT system applicable at Community level.
The Member States need stability and predictability so that they can manage their public finances.
Given that Community legislation was put in place very recently regarding, for example, e-commerce, it is quite unreasonable to suggest turning it all upside down.
I therefore voted against the Karas report.
Â Â  Mr President, Police Officers Michaelis and Proske claim that our fellow Member MrÂ PflÃŒger used the word âshitheadâ, or ââ, in connection with a demonstration in Munich.
MrÂ PflÃŒger says that this word is simply not in his vocabulary.
Accordingly, I would like to say that MrÂ Michaelis and MrÂ Proske are real shitheads â in claiming that our fellow Member said this.
For that reason, I voted against this report.
Â Â  . The decision taken by the majority in Parliament to lift the parliamentary immunity of MrÂ PflÃŒger, an MEP from the German Party of Democratic Socialism and a Member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, is highly significant.
This is an unprecedented, blatantly political decision, which sets an alarming precedent, as it came in response to MrÂ PflÃŒgerâs participation in a demonstration about the so-called âMunich Security Conferenceâ, which takes place every year in that German city.
This is the fourth time that MrÂ PflÃŒger has had accusations levelled at him in relation to his participation in this demonstration.
In 1999, the Munich Court withdrew its allegations.
In 2003, the proceedings were cancelled.
In 2004, the police went as far as to offer a formal apology.
This case refers to 2005, when MrÂ PflÃŒger took part in the demonstration for the first time as an MEP.
The application to lift parliamentary immunity was submitted by the Ministry of Justice of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Subsequently, Parliament adopted this application via the proposal tabled by MrÂ Speroni of the Italian .
Reading the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs reveals how incomprehensible and alarming this decision was.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  â Mr President, while I, in principle, welcome the compromise on which we have voted today, it must not be forgotten that primary responsibility for addressing the problem of obesity, especially among children, rests with the state.
Consumers do, of course, need to be mature and well-informed if they are to take the right decisions, but even so, we should not seek refuge in unrestrained regulation at European level and end up imposing things on business and industry that they cannot actually afford.
So, let us say âyesâ to information, but, please, can the state now take some action to address the obesity problem in a rational way?
Â Â  â Mr President, it is surely also the task of the European something-or-other Union to do something to counteract the spread of illnesses closely connected with the way we eat, but I do believe that what the European Union needs to do in the face of Europeansâ pronounced scepticism about genetic engineering and the ruling recently handed down by the WTO is to push for studies of the medium and long-term damage to health done by genetically modified food, in order that the public may be, at last, rather less in the dark about it.
While we are on this subject, we cannot of course overlook the contamination of some foods by radioactivity, which persists even twenty years on from Chernobyl, and the effects of which have as yet not been sufficiently researched.
Â Â  We Swedish Social Democrats should ideally have liked to have seen Parliament support the stronger proposals in both the Commissionâs original proposal and the Councilâs common position.
It has not, however, been possible to reach an agreement containing these proposals.
We believe that the compromise reached is the best outcome we can achieve right now.
The compromise considerably strengthens consumer protection and makes it simpler for consumers to make healthy choices, if that is what they wish to do.
We therefore supported the compromise and voted in favour of all aspects of it.
Â Â  Today, following a real battle, we have been able to reach an agreement between Parliament and the Council for regulating the claims made on food products and, contrary to all expectations, to have done so no later than at second reading.
I am delighted about the fact.
The wording we have voted in favour of has â at least â a dual objective: that of preventing certain improper claims or forms of advertising and that of preventing obesity.
It is a practical achievement to have adopted the wording concerned. It demonstrates to Europeans, who appear increasingly to doubt the value of our project of European construction, that our continent is making daily progress and producing practical rules to improve their daily lives â in the event, by enabling them to make conscious choices about what they eat.
In short, it shows people that Europe is actually of some use.
The fact is, appropriate labelling is indispensable to consumers and, personally, I am delighted that, from now on, the packaging of a product that may be âlow in fatâ but that also has a âhigh sugar contentâ will have to have both facts stated on the same side, equally visible.
Â Â  . The report adopted today represents an improvement on the text adopted at first reading, in that it tightens the conditions for using nutrition and health claims.
A varied and balanced diet is a prerequisite for good health, and products taken separately are of less importance than diet as a whole.
Nutrition and health claims, however, must be scientifically substantiated, in light of all the available scientific data and the testing that has taken place, which formed part of the adopted proposals, and to which our group lent its backing.
We regret, however, the adoption of an exceptional amendment on nutrient profiles.
Although the adopted compromise fell short of expectations on certain points, it does offer some protection and information to consumers, and seeks to safeguard the rights of SMEs.
Â Â  Explanation of vote in relation to the report by MrsÂ PoliÂ Bortone on a draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods.
The Commissionâs draft regulation on nutrition and health claims is based on a number of assumptions about which we have our doubts: the assumptions not only that what is healthy is a matter of absolute truth and that sales pitches and advertisements are harmful and should be regulated but also that peopleâs eating habits can be controlled through political decisions.
Finally, there is an assumption that the EU has a political task to perform in this area.
None of these assumptions is valid.
There is no absolute truth about what is harmful or beneficial.
New discoveries are made, and old truths are re-examined, which is why it is quite inappropriate to use political decisions to force people into behaving in a particular way.
Political decisions can neither guarantee that people have a balanced diet nor determine how beneficial or otherwise individual products are in their contexts.
Each person must accept responsibility for his or her own diet on the basis of his or her own assumptions.
Products based on new discoveries must be given a chance to establish themselves in the market so that they might compete successfully with existing products.
At present there is no opportunity for voting against the Commissionâs proposal.
That is why we choose to vote in favour of the European Parliamentâs proposal, which contains fewer regulations than both the Commissionâs proposal and the Councilâs position.
Â Â  . The purpose of this proposal by the Commission is to plug gaps and to propose a European strategy for the coming years as regards information to consumers on the food products that they consume.
Clearer, more accurate and more concise information could help consumers to alleviate problems such as cardiovascular conditions and obesity.
The compromise amendments adopted have substantially improved an initial proposal that I felt was inadequate and insubstantial.
The inclusion of imported products, the special attention to products for children, the facilitated access for SMEs, the exclusion of fresh foods sold unpacked and the ban on health claims for alcoholic beverages (more than 1.2% by volume) will make this a tougher and more complete directive.
I endorse the Commissionâs proposal and the Poli Bortone report.
Â Â  Despite long debates and a great deal of effort at persuasion, we have not managed to regain our grip on reality.
What is crucial is not the composition of a particular food, but the whole picture involving the interplay of healthy and balanced diet suitable for people when considered in terms of their specific situation as regards activity, age and gender.
Any profile ought to take all these things into account, but, as these factors are constantly changing, we have to realise that there are no such things as nutrient profiles and that, instead, the only way open to us is that of education and upbringing, what rural German women call âlearning to handle everyday lifeâ, and which is best communicated through the family and school and general education.
I also hope that the âtraffic lightâ-style labelling to which consideration is still being given is no more than a witless joke.
Who knows, though, what can occur to âsuch clever peopleâ?
One example of this approachâs divorce from reality is that no such information may appear on drinks, such as wine, with an alcohol content in excess of 1.2% by volume.
On the one hand, then, scientific profiles are demanded, while on the other, the dissemination of scientific knowledge is prohibited.
Wine is also governed by existing EU regulations, and that must also apply in this case.
Our debates may well have been lengthy, but it is evident from the compromise that they did not go on long enough.
I supported the amendments in the hope that they might make this squalid compromise tolerable.
Â Â  Although I approve of the compromise wording in relation to the directive on nutrition and health claims, which contains a number of improvements â in particular, ArticleÂ 4 which requires a scientific analysis to be carried out before any health claim is made â I have nonetheless been anxious to vote against all the Amendments (90, 66, and 17) presenting genuine risks to public health.
It would be dangerous for food products still to bear claims that, by not presenting the complete picture, could mislead consumers.
Thus, it is unacceptable to highlight on a product the words âsugar-freeâ when this same product might prove to have a high fat content.
There is an ever-increasing incidence of obesity in Europe, affecting more and more children.
It is vital to fight this scourge by not encouraging people to overeat and by no longer pulling the wool over the eyes of consumers.
On the contrary, consumers should be directed towards balanced products.
Â Â  . I welcome this report, which should lead to more honest and understandable food labelling.
It should also make it difficult for companies to brand their products in a misleading way.
Â Â  . It is a good thing to want to monitor nutrition claims in order to prevent the purveyors of cholesterol and diabetes from selling their highly sweetened drinks and high-fat food under cover of excessive claims concerning the energy they provide.
It is, however, unacceptable to do as the Commissioner did yesterday and also to target wine in oneâs efforts to promote health and to combat obesity and alcoholism.
Wine is emphatically not a form of alcohol manufactured through industrial processes but a drink produced through the natural fermentation of fresh grapes.
In Europe, wine is not water plus chemicals plus flavourings, as it is in the self-styled wineries of California or Australia, but a food produced from fermented grapes.
It must, then, be possible to say so.
It must be possible to make claims about the nutritional and health benefits of wine, with its antioxidants.
Otherwise, what is the explanation for the fact that the geographical area covered by vineyards is also the area in which civilisation has taken root, while the geographical area covered by the health-obsessed, eugenically inclined Nordic countries is also the home of drunkenness, skinheads and cyclical depression, a place where not a single cultural miracle of any significance has taken place?
Â Â  . Labour MEPs welcome today's agreement on nutrition and health labelling of foods.
We accept that this is a compromise package and there are some elements, particularly on Amendment 66, where we have reservations.
We would have preferred the common position text, which allowed no derogations.
However, the new law represents a major step forward in food labelling for consumers and improves the overall regulatory framework.
It is on this basis that we supported the compromise package.
Â Â  I reject the regulation on nutritional and health information in the version adopted by the Member States.
The regulation provides that, in future, nutrient profiles must be compiled for all foodstuffs.
Food must then be advertised with claims relating to health and nutritional value only if those claims have previously been verified in a procedure standardised across Europe.
It has to be said, though, that the rules that are intended to combat wrong dietary habits represent a major technical and bureaucratic imposition for the food manufacturers, without going to the roots of the problem.
Obesity cannot be combated effectively by means of regulatory intervention, but only by changes in eating habits and lifestyle; what is called for is less time spent in front of the television or the computer, and more movement.
Taken as a whole, the regulation also treats consumers as if they were helpless and concedes them no capacity to take decisions for themselves.
The European Food Authorityâs standardised procedure for approving health-related claims is objectionable, being a superfluous bureaucratic monster and, above all, a burden on our small and medium-sized businesses.
Large companies find it much easier to cope with the extra outlay involved in applying for approval, but the additional costs jeopardise small and medium-sized businessesâ very existence.
This law frustrates all efforts at reducing bureaucracy and the proposals for âbetter lawmakingâ.
Â Â  I had the opportunity to express my point of view yesterday evening during the debate on MrsÂ Poli Bortoneâs report.
I wish, however, to explain why I voted as I did on AmendmentÂ 66, the notorious disclosure clause.
I am opposed to calling ArticleÂ 4 and the nutrient profile into question in any way.
In my view, this compromise is therefore the worst sort of hypocrisy whereby it is permitted to make nutrition claims for food with high sugar, salt or fat content as long as the high content of these substances is indicated on the label.
To put it bluntly, it makes it legal to give false descriptions.
For example, ânon-fatâ lollipops can happily be described as such, even if they are also âpure sugarâ.
And who cares if they give children tooth decay?
If, in spite of that, I have abstained from voting, it is because of what is contained in the remainder of the report.
Firstly, we have come a very long way indeed from our vote at first reading which purely and simply killed off the nutrient profile.
Moreover, many uncertainties have been removed, especially for SMEs.
What is more, there is still a ban on health claims for alcoholic products.
Finally, I am convinced that we should not obtain anything better by the end of a long and expensive conciliation procedure.
Politics is partly about accepting compromises.
Â Â  This has been a highly contentious issue ever since the Commission submitted its proposal, and the majorities for it in this House have been very narrow, going right back to first reading.
I am among the minority that regards the Commissionâs proposal as a very good one and has supported it from the very beginning of the debate.
The Common Position is very good too, and the compromise on nutritional values now achieved at second reading is the lowest common denominator still capable of being supported.
Â Â  . The Parliament has voted to eliminate unsubstantiated claims on foods and drinks, especially products marketed to children.
The EU was concerned that a food would, for example, be advertised as 'low fat' which might have lots of sugar or salt in it or conversely as 'low salt' which was high in something else.
The aim is truth in advertising.
In an ideal world it would be achievable but the problem is that producers must give evidence of health claims made for their product.
Scientific evidence as understood by the legislation involves expensive trialling which will cost more than small producers can afford.
Another problem is that though the nutritional profiles that will be required by law on all products will be a step in the right direction they will fail to distinguish the quality of the fat, sugar and salt in the food or drink.
The nutritional profile will not distinguish between the bad fats that damage us and good fats necessary for health and growth, and similarly with salts and sugars.
For myself, I want a complete list of ingredients and a mention of any nutrient-damaging process like irradiation, bleaching, saturation etc. to which the ingredients were exposed.
Â Â  The Spanish Socialist Delegation welcomes the adoption of this report, which will reconcile various requirements for health protection and correct information for consumers with the aim that the industry should not bear excessive costs.
We do, however, wish to declare that our intention was to vote in favour of Amendment 49, which ultimately failed, as we think that it is an amendment of crucial importance to the Spanish Socialist Delegation, because of what it means for fermented drinks of agricultural origin (beer and wine) and for food use in a country such as Spain.
Â Â  This report, on which we have voted at second reading, entails improvements where health considerations are concerned, but a number of the amendments amount to a real retrograde step.
This is clearly the case with Amendments 17, 66 and 90, which are aimed not only at legalising products high in fat, sugar or salt but also authorise claims that mislead consumers.
I am very sorry that the aforesaid amendments, which significantly undermine the relevance of the document, have been adopted, and I regret their having been the subject of a compromise that I have no hesitation in referring to as dubious.
Â Â  . As a fledgling MEP, my very first phone call to the Commission was about a proposal in preparation of a European law on health and food claims.
This was 14 years ago now.
Even then, it was realised that legislative action was needed at Community level, and so an agreement about a specific legal text so many years down the line is not a day too soon.
The result is one to be proud of, for it strikes the right balance between, on the one hand, the consumerâs interest and right to health protection and information and, on the other, the requirement not to place an excessive burden on industry.
Both the solution with regard to food profiles and the notification procedure prove that we achieved this in an adult manner.
Consequently, this result receives my unqualified support.
Â Â  .
We voted in favour of the compromise proposals at this second reading, because we feel it is important that there should be a high level of protection for consumers regarding the addition of vitamins, minerals and other substances to foods, which we must ensure do not pose a danger to public health.
In December 2005, the Council did not incorporate into the common position that it adopted some important amendments adopted by Parliament last May.
We therefore deem it important to enshrine once again the bio-availability â meaning available to be used by the body â of vitamins and minerals.
Otherwise, consumers will be misled and may even put their health at risk.
Furthermore, safe maximum quantities for vitamins and minerals must be set and information for consumers must be made easy to understand and useful.
We regret the fact that other positive amendments were not adopted, but we hope that they will at least be taken on board by the Council.
Â Â  . I endorse the directive on the addition of vitamins, minerals and certain other substances to foods.
I believe it to be vitally important that the various national regulations on the addition of vitamins and minerals, and of certain other substances, to foodstuffs, should be harmonised.
What has become evident from these long drawn-out debates is that the Member States differ very strongly among themselves not only as to the necessity of the addition of such nutrients for a balanced diet, but also on the basis of their own differing traditions.
Although this report deals only with the voluntary addition of vitamins and supplements, it is important to remember that the manufacturersâ sole intention in adding vitamins and minerals must be to do so with nutritional and health considerations in mind.
The âother substancesâ must be defined specifically and, with the protection of the consumer in mind, it follows that a negative list must also be drawn up.
What is required â and will continue to be required â most of all is that the consumers be protected and kept informed, since it is they who, in cases of doubt, will be harmed, whilst the manufacturers will make a profit.
Â Â  . I welcome this report on the measures needed to protect the elver industry in Europe.
Changing tastes and a collapse in stock have transformed what was a local, cheap seasonal delicacy into a luxury product, almost exclusively for export to the Far East.
The life-cycle of elvers is still not properly understood with gluts and shortages alternating in a not fully understood pattern.
Yet the drop of stock levels over past decades seems to be outside the normal range of variation.
If action is not taken, this small but locally important industry may die.
I support the restriction on fishing, while agreeing with the Commission the need to identify when bans will fall needs investigation, as yields vary with the phases of the moon and not days of the month.
I also support limits on exports to protect stocks, which I am sure the WTO will support, and financial help from the EU to ensure rivers remain open for the passage of elvers.
We may have to revisit this issue in future, but at least we are finally taking some action.
Â Â  . I welcome this report, although I feel that it could have set itself more ambitious objectives.
First and foremost, I should like to highlight the fact that there is great variation between the river basins in the different Member States where this species exists.
Consequently, different strategies and measures are needed to ensure the effective recovery of these stocks.
Accordingly, I welcome the fact that it has been left to the Member States to propose their own recovery plans.
I also believe that the EU must support the measures that each Member State deems appropriate for repopulating the various river basins.
This includes, for example, the construction and/or adaptation of barrier-crossing mechanisms along rivers.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs main objective in tabling this proposal for a regulation to recover eel stocks is to set up national Eel Management Plans.
The proposal is intended to guarantee a 40% escape rate of adult silver eels from each river basin, an objective that will be difficult to meet.
The proposal also treats all Member States in the same way, without taking account of their particular characteristics.
It is also proposed that there be a ban on fishing eel during the first 15 days of the month, which is excessive and would have a major socio-economic impact.
These measures would have to be met by July 2007, a relatively short space of time.
In this regard, Parliamentâs proposals strike a better balance and rectify some of the worst aspects of the Commissionâs proposal, thereby helping to contribute towards the recovery of eel stocks.
The report replaces the ban on fishing in the first half of every month with a season in which the fishing effort is reduced by half.
It also raises the 40% escape rate objective.
It gives Member States the opportunity to operate solely in relevant river basins.
Furthermore, the deadline for implementation has been extended to 2008.
All of which gives greater powers to the Member States.
Â Â  . I voted today against the EC-Morocco Partnership Agreement on fisheries because I am not satisfied that all steps were taken in respect of this agreement, which could and should have been taken to protect the sovereignty and rights of Western Sahara.
Instead, intended ambiguity prevails so as to facilitate Morocco's abuse of Western Saharan waters and to avoid facing up to its illegal claim to the territory.
Â Â  Today, the European Parliament voted in favour of the EU entering into a fisheries agreement with Morocco.
We Social Democrats voted against the agreement.
We believe that the fisheries agreement should not extend to include Western Saharan territory because Morocco has been occupying Western Sahara since 1975.
We believe that the agreement contravenes international law because there are no guarantees that it will benefit the Western Saharan population, which has not helped design the agreement.
Â Â  . The Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Morocco sets out the principles, the rules and the procedures governing economic, financial, technical and scientific cooperation in âMoroccan fishing zonesâ (Article 1).
Article 2(a) defines the term âMoroccan fishing zoneâ as âthe waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Moroccoâ.
The vote in favour by the Members who have signed the report before is naturally based on the definition in Article 2.
Â Â  . Broadly speaking, I am in favour of the adoption of this document.
The new agreement provides for a significant reduction in the number of fishing licenses awarded to the Member States.
The number is to fall from 500 to approximately 100, with the loss of some important categories of fish, namely crustaceans and cephalopods.
In any event, I still believe it important for the Community fleet, and the Portuguese fleet in particular, to continue to be able to fish in Morocco under a Partnership Agreement.
In this regard, the broader interests of the common fisheries policy in the area of international fisheries have been safeguarded, and some important commitments have been made in the area of managing fisheries resources and the fight against illegal fishing.
Â Â  . I should like to vote in favour of a Fisheries Agreement between the European Community and Morocco, but I must vote against it.
This is because amendments were not adopted that were aimed at excluding from the scope of the Agreement the waters and fisheries resources of Western Sahara, a non-autonomous territory under United Nations Resolutions 1514 and 1541, which has been occupied illegally by Morocco since 1974.
Consequently, to my mind, the Agreement â and the corresponding legislative proposal by the Commission â violates international law.
Â Â  The EU is again to enter into a fisheries agreement with an African state.
We have on several occasions pointed out how damaging these agreements are.
Those countries with which the EU enters into such agreements are deprived of the opportunity to develop their own efficient fishing industries.
What is more, the EUâs fishing fleet is partly responsible for depleting fish stocks, something pointed out by both Swedish authorities and environmental organisations.
Moreover, these agreements are expensive for taxpayers in the EU Member States.
They amount, in actual fact, to direct subsidies to the fishing industry.
This agreement in particular is especially objectionable because Morocco has been occupying Western Sahara illegally for many years.
The International Court of Justice in The Hague has pointed this out.
What it means is that Morocco has no ultimate control over its natural resources, including its fisheries resources.
By entering into a fisheries agreement with Morocco, the EU is indirectly recognising this occupation and the human rights violations constantly committed by Morocco in Western Sahara.
We have voted against the report in todayâs vote.
Â Â  . We regret the rejection of two amendments, which, in compliance with international law, specifically excluded the waters off Western Sahara from the fisheries agreement before us, restricting the Agreement to the waters north of the 27Â°40'Â N'' parallel.
An even more worrying aspect of its rejection is the fact that the Commissioners involved and some MEPs consider Morocco to be the administrator of Western Sahara, a view that runs counter to international law.
Furthermore, experience of previous Agreements has shown that ports in Western Sahara have been captured and used without the rights and interests of the Sahrawi people being safeguarded.
I wish to emphasise, as the Polisario Front has done, that the United Nations reiterated condemnation of the exploitation and looting of natural resources and of all economic activity taking place to the detriment of communities in colonised or non-autonomous territories where such people are denied their legitimate rights to their natural resources, in its legal opinion on Western Sahara and its natural resources of 29Â JanuaryÂ 2002.
As far as the UN is concerned, this exploitation and looting is illegal and a threat to the integrity and prosperity of these territories.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  . The European Parliamentary Labour PartyÂ is concerned over the impact of the proposed fisheries agreement on the position of Western Sahara and the prospects for resolving that long-running conflict.
For this reason Labour MEPs supported the amendments that would exclude Western Sahara from the scope of the agreement and voted against the agreementÂ when the exclusion amendments fell.
Â Â  . Following the report on the Partnership Agreement between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco on fisheries resources, I should like to vote for the most appropriate regulation for the areaâs environmental sustainability.
In this respect, the Agreement is crucial.
Both for the EU and for me personally, however, the issue of human rights is also crucial.
That being the case, United Nations resolutions must always take precedence in this regard.
It is clear to me that the purpose of this Agreement is to cover sea areas and territories that are not under dispute and concerning which there are no sovereignty issues, and no others, because no state should be allowed to make use of resources that are not under its sovereignty or jurisdiction, to the detriment of the self-determination of other groups.
Â Â  . I voted against the EC-Morocco fishing deal because the people of Western Sahara are still under Moroccan occupation and have had no say over the agreement which allows fishing in their territorial waters.
I believe that the Saharawi people should have rights over their territorial waters.
It is for this reason that the EC-Morocco fish agreement should not include the waters of Western Sahara, as the people have no power to opt in or out of the agreement.
I do not support an agreement on trade that violates the rights of other communities to determine the use of their own resources.
Â Â  . In voting on this report I am extremely concerned about the impact of the proposed fisheries agreement on the position of Western Sahara and the prospects of resolving that long-running conflict.
This is a campaign which some of my London constituents have been working with me on, under the guidance of the UK-based War on Want charity.
For this reason I supported amendments that would exclude Western Sahara from the scope of the agreement and voted against the agreement when the exclusion amendments fell.
Â Â  . I wish to make two brief explanations as regards this vote.
I should first like to speak about Western Sahara.
Mindful of the fact that this agreement addresses the issue in the usual manner, that is to say, following the tradition of not tabling any amendments to the European position, and the fact that the Commissionâs legal services have decided that it does comply with international rules, I feel that it is inappropriate to raise objections regarding the Western Sahara situation here.
As for the actual question that we are addressing, the fact that it has finally been possible to reach agreement on this issue is to be welcomed, although I must express my disappointment that the final outcome is not very favourable to Portuguese interests.
All in all, however, everything points to this being the best solution, because it is a workable solution.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  . In omitting from the fisheries agreement any reference to the territories of the Western Sahara occupied by Morocco, the European Parliament is sending out an important political message.
I tabled amendments to that end, but, as these amendments have not been adopted, I have voted against the report.
Â Â  . Because of the rejection of all amendments which would have prevented European illegal fishing in the waters of Western Sahara I have voted against this resolution.
I am concerned that this agreement in its current unamended form will allow European boats (including Irish boats) to fish in the waters of Western Sahara, a territory illegally occupied by Morocco.
If the agreement is implemented, the EU will be violating international law and helping to prolong a conflict which has already lasted for 30 years.
The International Court of Justice and successive UN resolutions have made it clear that Western Sahara is Africaâs last colony, with a right to self-determination for its people.
Morocco is not recognised as the administrative power.
It has been clearly stated that no other country has a right to exploit the Saharawi resources without the permission of the Saharawi people.
Â Â  . Mr President, the plight of the people of the Western Sahara will not be improved by the exporting of our own disastrous fisheries policies to their territory, under illegal occupation by Morocco.
It is a poor show that the EU, usually a guardian of the rule of law, is in this case using technicalities and weasel words to justify making ourselves in effect complicit in an illegal occupation.
I voted against this poor report and am saddened that the House approved it.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, MrsÂ Frassoni, on the recent reports by the European Commission on monitoring the application of Community law.
This report was keenly awaited in the wake of the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2003. Known as Better Lawmaking, the agreement was aimed at reducing the volume of Community law at the same time as simplifying it and was designed to ensure that the legislation was properly applied everywhere, this being a necessary condition of creating an area of justice.
Unfortunately, it has to be said that the Member States are bad at transposing Community law. Worse, they apply it badly and do so with an impunity in which the European Commission is complicit.
It should be remembered that it is the Member States that are responsible for monitoring the application of Community law.
Everyone can see the degree to which the present system does not work and how it helps create a gulf between, on the one hand, European integration and, on the other, Europeans, who are aware of the injustice of this situation every day.
I wonder if the time may not have come to consider creating a European body of independent inspectors with the task of monitoring the application of Community law in the Member States.
Â Â  What the reports voted on today reveal are the growing number of difficulties in applying Community law and the proliferation of cases submitted to the European Court of Justice.
On 31 December 2003, it emerged from the 21st report of the Commission that 3Â 927 offences were being examined, compared with 2Â 270 in 1999 and only 124 in 1978.
This is partly because of the large amount of Community law but also because of the large quantity of sanctions that the European Commission can impose on any Member States reluctant to apply Community legislation.
The issue of applying Community law is, above all, a political issue and not a legal or technocratic one as a number of people think and state that it is.
In fact, what mainly happens is that the problem of existing conflicts between European power and forms of national sovereignty is concealed.
In this connection, the recent decision - of 13Â September 2005 - by the Court of Justice of the European Communities which, for the first time and independently of any legal basis, has made criminal law a Community matter is symptomatic of the way in which this institution has developed.
It is, then, understandable why Member States are reluctant to apply Community legislation that they have not chosen.
Â Â  . The monitoring of the application of Community law falls to the Commission, as âguardian of the Treatiesâ.
The Commission is informed of any case of non-compliance with the Community Treaties, and cautions and sanctions the Member States responsible.
The Commissionâs annual reports on the application of Community law indicate the progress made by the Member States in transposing directives, with the purpose of ensuring efficient monitoring of the application of the law.
This monitoring does not consist solely of an assessment of the transposition in quantitative terms, but also an assessment of the quality of the transposition.
As regards the objectives of improving European policy by making it more transparent, the Commission has stated that its objective is to reduce the volume of legislation and to get rid of ineffective legislative acts, which is not the same thing as deregulation.
I agree with the rapporteur that the Commissionâs services need greater human and financial resources if it is to enhance its ability to deal with violations.
I also welcome the creation of coordination points in each Member State for issues relating to transposition, the application of Community law and coordination with national ministries and regional and local authorities.
Â Â  . Although there is an extraordinary amount of Community law, both in force and at the preparatory stage, sometimes of doubtful need, it is possible to monitor both the transposition stage and the entry into force stage of new law.
As the report says, it takes the Community institutions, and in particular the Commission, an extraordinary amount of time to monitor the application of European law.
This is especially regrettable given that it reduces the effectiveness of the mechanism, and deprives it of virtues as important as enabling Member States to honour their obligations within the time allowed.
Another important aspect of this process is that close monitoring of the difficulties of transposing/applying the law should represent an opportunity to improve the quality of Community law, especially as the process of so doing is already under way, as the report underlines.
Â Â  . In view of the number of cases in which the transposition of Community law into national law has been delayed or has not taken place at all, the legislator needs to ensure that its application is monitored appropriately, and, more importantly, to simplify it and to ensure that the subsidiarity principle is upheld.
I feel that the application of Community law will remain inadequate until Community law is made clear and comprehensible, and until the Community as a whole is made easier to understand.
Without good Community legislation, it will be very difficult to apply Community law properly.
I warmly welcome the Commission Presidentâs proposal to promote a major drive to cut down the amount of legislation and to make law-making more efficient on the part of the Communityâs institutions.
Sometimes less is more.
Â Â  . Mr President, I congratulate my group colleague Mrs Frassoni on this excellent report, which while perhaps not the talk of the town nonetheless deals with a crucial area of the Union's competence.
It contains a number of sensible proposals to make our law making more effective in terms of how it actually affects our citizens, which at this time of increasing scepticism over the workings of the EU is often not paid sufficient attention, and I was pleased to support her today.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report, albeit while expressing my doubts about the amendment that refers to the Treaty establishing a European Constitution.
That Treaty was not actually approved, but rather rejected by means of popular referendums in France and the Netherlands, with the leave of MrÂ Napolitano, the newly elected President of the Italian Republic, who, in his inaugural speech, championed the cause of that Treaty, having forgotten that he was above the parties.
That Treaty, in fact, was indeed approved by the Italian Parliament, but not unanimously.
He who declares himself above the parties should not support something that has divided the Italian Parliament.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, MrÂ Doorn, on a motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on the application of the principle of subsidiarity.
The way in which European legislation is applied continually creates a gulf between European integration and the nations.
It is therefore a matter of urgency to bring about the vitally needed consistency between Community law, its transposition by the Member States and its practical application.
Any pointless legislation should be repealed, and necessary legislation properly applied.
I am in favour of the idea of the European Parliament being closely involved in monitoring the application of European law by the Member States.
Â Â  . Of all the issues raised in this report, the one that deserves the greatest attention is the impact assessment of Community law.
As I have previously stated, in spite of constant and perhaps excessive amounts of legislative output, it is possible to monitor closely the Community institutionsâ legislative output and more importantly the impact thereof.
This is an area that should always be high on the agenda.
In this regard, subsidiarity is very much a relevant factor, which, in its broadest form, should be one of the cornerstones of lawmaking in the EU.
This is perfect for subsidiarity, whereby the needs of each country are catered for, and close links between the authorities and the citizens are maintained.
That being said, this principle is obviously inappropriate for a great many situations that should be approached at Community level.
Yet this is also a key feature of this principle.
I should lastly like to mention the importance of recognising the role of the national parliaments, which is vital to a good legal outcome.
Without prejudice to the other elements, these are the key elements for better lawmaking.
Â Â  . As I have said on previous occasions, in addition to having long been a vital requirement and one that ought to be given greater prominence, the subsidiarity principle is a cornerstone that sorts out the true pro-Europeans, those who are loyal, both in word and in deed, to the theme and the motto of the draft Constitutional Treaty â âUnited in Diversityâ.
The EU must give the highest prominence to decision-making at the level closest to the citizens, must assess the new laws it adopts and must ensure that existing laws are simplified on the basis of intelligibility, appropriateness and proportionality.
I feel that the EU will benefit if it opts to make laws based on quality rather than quantity, and properly involves the national parliaments, and any other directly interested parties, in the process, in such a way that they can make their opinions heard at the appropriate time and can table alternative proposals.
Â Â  . Mr President, I congratulate Mr Doorn on this report as I believe subsidiarity, properly applied, could make the workings of the EU so much more transparent to the citizen.
Coming from Scotland, it saddens me that the Scottish Parliament is responsible for so many areas of life yet is effectively shut out of the EU deliberations as the definition of subsidiarity too often effectively stops at the member state capital.
I believe this report represents a step forward, but we in the EU still have our work to do.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, MrsÂ McCarthy, on a motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on the implementation, consequences and impact of the internal market legislation in force.
The way in which European law is applied continuously creates a gulf between European integration and the nations.
It is therefore a matter of urgency to bring about the vitally needed consistency between Community law, its transposition by the Member States and its practical application.
Any pointless legislation should be repealed, and necessary legislation properly applied.
I am in favour of the idea of the European Parliament being closely involved in monitoring the application of European law by the Member States.
Given the problems there are in applying Community law, I also wonder if the time may not have come to consider creating a European body of independent inspectors. Directly attached to the European Union, it would have the task of monitoring the application of Community law in the Member States, and this with a view to ensuring that the internal market operates as it should.
Â Â  One of the reasons why European directives and other documents are not applied by EU Member States â a reason that, curiously enough, has not been referred to in any of the reports â has to do, in particular, with the way in which they are adopted.
Indeed, such non-application is the unfortunate effect of extending qualified majority voting to the Council, as states that have been in a minority in refusing, for reasons of their own, to adopt a text will, quite naturally, have difficulty in applying it within their own territories.
All this obviously creates genuine legal insecurity for all the institutions, countries and peoples.
Priority needs to be given, then, not only to rapidly codifying the Community legislation in force but also to defining and limiting the powers of various EU bodies, the European Court of Justice included, which have created such large quantities of law. In that way, the Member States would no longer have to suffer the consequences of too large a number of unduly constricting legal or jurisprudential standards.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs âbetter lawmakingâ initiative is a vital factor in obtaining the trust of EU citizens, consumers and businesses.
This trust is based on their experience or on their understanding of European law and the impact thereof on their day-to-day lives.
Accordingly, in the context of the internal market this must be translated into effective, high-quality lawmaking that does not hamper innovation or give rise to unnecessary distortions and costs, in particular for SMEs, the public authorities or voluntary groups.
Our lawmaking should therefore help to open up trade opportunities for businesses, to broaden the options for consumers and the citizens, and to protect environmental, social and consumer rights.
If we do not do this, we shall be swimming against the tide, against the Lisbon Strategy, against growth and jobs and against the internal market.
I therefore voted in favour of the McCarthy report.
Â Â  . We endorse the repeal of irrelevant and obsolete acts in Community law, the purpose of which is to simplify the regulatory framework, so that decisions are appropriate, clear and effective and do not undermine the subsidiarity principle.
I feel that the subsidiarity principle ought to be brought more to the fore in this report so that there are no doubts that it is being upheld throughout the process.
We trust, however, that this objective will not be used to undermine certain principles that protect the citizensâ fundamental rights, including social rights and workersâ rights.
We also advocate an amendment of the current interinstitutional agreements governing the quality of EU law.
We therefore voted in favour of the report, although we have some reservations on some points, and actually oppose others, on account of their ambiguous wording, as has already been mentioned.
Â Â  . Broadly speaking, I warmly welcome the report we are discussing and voting on, and the Commission communication on which it is based.
The endeavour to analyse and review the Communityâs legislative framework is a proposal that should be promoted with the aim of simplifying the regulatory environment, a vital prerequisite for greater legal certainty for both the citizens and lawyers.
It also represents an opportunity to simplify the regulatory environment, a crucial factor in the development of economic activity.
There is one point in the report and the Commission communication with which I do not entirely agree.
The notion, put forward in both texts, that legislation via regulation is increasingly more virtuous than via directives is not one that I accept.
On the contrary, despite the difficulties involved in transposing directives, I take the view that they are a means of lawmaking that uphold an idea of Community that I hold dear.
This view does not mean that I reject regulations or fail to recognise their obvious usefulness.
Â Â  I am abstaining from voting.
There are certainly positive aspects to the report, for example its call for the Council to become more open, but it otherwise focuses too much on growth and reduced costs when it should instead highlight sustainable development and greater cost effectiveness.
Reducing costs is not an end in itself because it may lead to a constant undermining of public budgets.
Cost-effectiveness is a better objective.
Â Â  It is excellent that useless and harmful legislative texts that contradict other Community provisions or that, above all, are incompatible with the much touted principles of subsidiarity and proportionality can be withdrawn from the legislative world.
Any satisfaction that might be felt evaporates quickly, however, faced with a description of the exorbitant legislative powers wielded by the Commission.
This institution â which, I would take this opportunity to point out, has absolutely no democratic or electoral legitimacy â can, as and when it sees fit, withdraw or modify a legislative proposal, inform or not inform Parliament of the reasons for its decision and take account, or not take account, of Parliamentâs opinion. In short, it can do what it wishes.
Worst of all, Parliament is happy with this state of affairs, which it acknowledges.
Admittedly, it vaguely threatens to censure the Commission in cases where the latter might genuinely go too far.
We know, however, that, even at the worst moments of the scandals that tarnished the Santer Commission, it has never had the political courage to disown the institution symbolic of the European superstate.
The fact that a technocracy is exercised with the tacit agreement of a parliamentary assembly does not change the nature of that technocracy.
Â Â  We have chosen to abstain in the final vote on this resolution designed to display an opinion.
Our basic view is that the Council of Ministers should be a stronger political force than the other EU institutions, since the Council of Ministers represents the Member States in an EU that we see as a form of intergovernmental cooperation.
This means that, in our view too, the Council of Ministers should have the right to put forward legislative proposals, just as the Commission has.
Nor do we share the view expressed in paragraphÂ B of the draft report, which calls on the Commission to think twice before withdrawing 68 legislative proposals thought not to be in keeping with the objectives of, for example, the principles designed to produce better legislation.
We believe, as a matter of straightforward principle, that it is good for the Commission to try to slim down its huge catalogue of legislative proposals at EU level.
Â Â  . The issue raised by the communication before us deserves a broader scope and should not be confined to the issue of legal basis and the Commissionâs limits on the withdrawal of legislative proposals.
I feel that the main issue before us is that the previous situation led to a range of legislative processes in a state of limbo that no longer had any reason to exist, but that had also not been repealed.
In addition to a debate on the powers of the different institutions, what is needed is an investigation into what is routine and bureaucratic in the Communityâs legislative procedures.
What is more, the fact that between them Parliament and the Council have more than 500 documents awaiting the attention of the legislators is an issue that is worthy of our attention and concern.
The EU does not need to legislate a great deal in order to be relevant.
What it needs to do is to legislate well in order to be useful.
Â Â  The next item on the agenda is the Commissionâs statement on the report on progress made by Bulgaria and Romania in the enlargement process.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to present to you today the results of our assessment of Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs preparations for accession and I look forward to discussing this with you.
I would like to thank Parliament, in particular its Committee on Foreign Affairs, the chairman Mr Brok and the rapporteurs Mr Van Orden and Mr Moscovici for their contribution to this important exercise.
I very much appreciate the concerted spirit of our frequent discussions on this subject.
As you know, the decision that the Commission has taken today is the result of an extensive process of review and dialogue with all the major stakeholders.
The starting point of our approach is that the European Union must honour existing commitments.
At the same time, we need to be rigorous as regards the criteria to be met by acceding countries.
I should like to make a few brief remarks before, with your permission, giving the floor to Mr Rehn, who will comment in more detail on the Commissionâs findings in the monitoring report.
Since October, the Governments of Bulgaria and Romania have worked extremely hard to deliver on their outstanding commitments.
They have continued to make progress in their preparation for membership.
Let us give credit where it is due.
However, there are still some important issues which need to be addressed.
I would highlight, in particular, the need for further progress in the area of justice and home affairs.
The Commission considers that Romania and Bulgaria should be ready for membership by 1Â January 2007, provided that they address a number of outstanding issues in the course of the next month.
Let me first turn to the situation in judicial reforms and the fight against corruption.
We expect any acceding country to have in place a fully functioning judicial system equipped to fight corruption and organised crime.
This is of paramount importance, since it underpins the functioning of the whole society and the economy.
Both countries have shown determination to undertake the necessary remaining reforms and our reports give them full credit for the results already achieved.
Bulgaria still needs to demonstrate clear evidence of results in the fight against corruption, in particular high-level corruption, notably in terms of investigations and subsequent judicial proceedings.
It also needs to further reform the judiciary and remove any ambiguity regarding its independence.
We also expect Bulgaria to step up efforts on the investigation of organised crime networks.
Romania needs to continue its efforts and demonstrate further results in the fight against corruption, notably in terms of further investigations and subsequent judicial proceedings.
It needs to consolidate the implementation of the ongoing judicial reforms.
Turning to the level of alignment of Bulgaria and Romania with the , we have registered further progress.
However, we still have serious concerns about a few sectors: agriculture and food safety, justice and home affairs and public finance.
Any acceding country needs to be in a position to implement the European Union policies properly upon accession.
The rules of the club must be respected.
We expect Bulgaria and Romania to take immediate corrective action in those problematic sectors.
No later than early October, we will review the situation with those outstanding issues.
On that basis, the Commission will consider whether it is still possible to adhere to the accession date of 1Â January 2007.
It is practicable for the two countries to be ready in 2007, but they must take decisive action.
At the same time, the European Union needs to give a clear signal that it stands ready to honour its commitments. That is crucial, in order to keep up the momentum.
Practical preparations for accession need to continue.
I count on the support of all governments and parliaments that still need to complete their procedures to ratify the accession treaty.
Our approach is based on strict conditionality and adherence to undertakings. That approach has allowed us to gain strength and confidence from each enlargement.
Like the previous enlargements, especially that in 2004, the forthcoming enlargement will be a success.
Enlargement has always been Europeâs response to strategic challenges and history has shown that this response has been the proper one.
Time and again, it has been accompanied by a dynamism that has given the enlarged Europe a greater capacity to make its mark in the world.
In the situation in which we find ourselves today, it is more important than ever to preserve the spirit of openness and ambition that has always inspired us to press ahead with the construction of Europe.
That is precisely why Commissioner Rehn and I have decided to go to Bucharest today and Sofia tomorrow to explain these issues and give the two countries a clear message of encouragement.
Â Â  . Mr President, on 1 May we celebrated the second anniversary of the latest enlargement.
Looking at the past two years, we have every reason to be satisfied and proud, even though at the time there was no lack of doomsday scenarios.
Yet the Cassandras have been proven wrong.
We can succeed equally well in the cases of Bulgaria and Romania. Both countries are working hard to tackle the remaining shortcomings to fully meet the criteria of accession.
The Commissionâs duty is to assess the progress made by the two countries to see if they are truly ready for accession.
It is our goal to welcome Bulgaria and Romania as members in 2007 and it is our duty, as the guardian of the Treaties, to ensure that once they join they really meet the conditions.
Hence, when we last met in late April, I promised you a carefully calibrated decision that maintains the momentum of reforms up to and beyond accession.
Now you have such a decision: Bulgaria and Romania may join in January 2007 on condition that they show the necessary resolve, mentality and results in tackling the outstanding shortcomings.
By early October, we will report on their progress and consider whether the date can be maintained.
Bulgaria and Romania have indeed undergone a monitoring process that is unprecedented in its scope and intensity.
Concerning the political criteria, while much has been achieved, there is still room for further progress.
It is necessary effectively to implement the reform of the judiciary and to reinforce the fight against corruption, particularly at high level.
Bulgaria needs seriously to intensify its efforts to crack down on organised crime and corruption.
It also needs to demonstrate clear evidence of results in the fight against corruption, in terms of investigations and judicial proceedings.
Building on the progress made so far, Romania needs to continue its efforts and show further results in the fight against corruption.
In the area of human rights and the rights of minorities, further efforts are needed by both Bulgaria and Romania.
On the economic criteria, the transformation of the two countries is a remarkable success that is a win-win situation for everybody in Europe.
Both countries have registered robust growth in the last years, creating a zone of much-needed economic dynamism at our south-eastern corner.
As to the , our legal order, significant progress has been achieved and most of the areas are unproblematic, provided that the current pace of preparations is maintained.
However, in some areas the preparations require increased efforts, and we also have certain issues of serious concern.
Unless the countries take immediate and decisive corrective action, they will not be ready in these areas of serious concern at the envisaged date of accession.
Since October last year, the areas of serious concern have been brought down from 16 to 6 in Bulgaria and from 14 to 4 in Romania.
They still include certain agricultural, food safety and veterinary issues, as well as the control and management of EU funds.
Should these serious concerns persist, we would not hesitate to use all our remedial tools.
Our report specifies the safeguards and other protective measures under the existing legislation that we have at our disposal.
These safeguards could be invoked if certain limited problems persist at accession in the areas, for instance, of the internal market and justice and home affairs, where we can also establish a monitoring mechanism based on the Accession Treaty.
On the use of EU money, the will require a suspension of payments in case of serious problems.
In agriculture, we even propose novel, stricter measures, based on the Accession Treaty That sends a strong signal that we are careful with our money.
I trust that todayâs carefully calibrated decision and its rigour will convince the national parliaments that have not yet ratified the Accession Treaty to do so.
The Treaty itself includes the conditions, safeguards and monitoring mechanisms that ensure the countries can join only once they are ready, and that once they have joined, they must respect their obligations as members.
Let me express our appreciation for the support of the European Parliament for the accession process of Bulgaria and Romania.
As agreed between President Barroso and President Borrell last year, we have listened carefully to your views before presenting our position on whether or not to postpone the accessions.
I am sure this constructive, transparent and rigorous approach will bring the best results for Bulgaria and Romania, and for Europe.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by assuring the Commission of how much I appreciate the presence of its President and, of course, of the responsible Commissioner, when such an important issue is being debated.
The chairmen of the Groups are here, as are the Members of this House â there could be more of them, but todayâs turnout is more or less acceptable.
I cannot fail to observe, though, that there is nobody here to represent the Council of Ministers, any more than there was when the President of the Palestinian Authority was speaking, and I do not think it is acceptable that the Council should fail to be represented at such an important debate.
I would encourage you, Mr President â and this has to do not only with the presidency, and it is not only they whom I am addressing, for this is also a matter for the General Secretariat of the Council â to use your influence on the Council to get them to actually be present for such important debates.
You, Mr President, will have our support if you press this point home as clearly as possible to the Council, to its General Secretariat, and also to the presidency.
Moving on to the matter in hand, Bulgaria and Romania are on their way into the European Union.
We look forward to their arrival, and I would just like to say something by way of appreciation.
The impression has been given in many quarters that we â the existing European Union of 25 States â are the ones from whom they have to learn.
What a colossal effort it must have involved for Romania and Bulgaria to undo the damage done by 45 years of mismanagement under Communist dictatorship in order to become democratic states under the rule of law; we should, for once, acknowledge what a long road these countries have had to travel.
Whilst we often â and often quite rightly â criticise the administration we have at every level in the European Union and in our own Member States, I would like say what a great benefit it is that the systems of administration we have in the European Union and in our Member States are founded upon law, so that it is possible, through the justice system, to contest any administrative measure or any action by an official.
Nothing of the sort exists in the former Communist countries, and that is something they will have to develop.
It is for that reason that it is so important that we should develop a legal system with the character of a state under the rule of law, and that will demand an enormous effort.
To the governments, the parliaments and the people â not least in Bulgaria and Romania â I have to say that they should not take our debate and our concerns about the lack of progress as an indication of our desire to teach them a lesson; on the contrary, we want to work together to make the accession of Romania and Bulgaria a success for us all â for the two countries themselves and for the European Union as a whole.
While we are not questioning the data, I do think that you, MrÂ Barroso and MrÂ Rehn, are well advised to say that we want to encourage both countries to address the remaining deficits by way of legislation and practical implementation in such a way â although they will be unable to get everything out of the way in the next few months â that we can hope, in the autumn, to be able to tell them, with a good conscience, that they will be welcome on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
That is why your decision â which we endorse â is an astute one and one that gives these two countries the encouragement to continue down the road on which they have set foot.
Today, everything fits together.
It also has to be pointed out that the people of the present European Union have their worries about this too; they have not yet quite got used to our now being a community of twenty-five members.
Ten countries joined us on 1 May 2004.
We have to take a positive line on this with our citizens and say that having Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and of course Malta and Cyprus too, joining us was a massive success, for the rule of law, democracy and the social market economy have prevailed in these countries, and that helps to keep the whole European continent stable.
That is what we need to tell our people, rather than always focusing only on the criticisms and challenges, and it is on this basis that we still have a lot of work to do in order to enhance approval of the European Union.
Over the past few months, this House â and I think, even though we must always be capable of criticising ourselves, we can take a bit of pride in this â has achieved a great deal, in the shape of the great compromise on the services directive, followed by the adoption of the Financial Perspective, to which we had managed to make significant improvements, but there is still more to be done, in that, where the REACH chemicals legislation is concerned, we must succeed in achieving a balance between economic and environmental considerations.
Today, we discussed with Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m â who spoke on behalf of the whole Commission and indeed of its President â the most important matter for concern, second only to the improvement of the European Unionâs political and psychological environment, which is that we should not allow there to be any doubt about the fact that the majority in the European Parliament wants the constitutional treaty to become a reality, and it wants that because we need the constitution if the European Union is to have ground rules for decisions and common values to bind us together.
I hope that the Commission will take all that into consideration.
MrÂ Barroso, I think it a good thing that you should have come to your decision today and then, immediately, justified it to the European Parliament.
Tomorrow, you travel to Romania and Bulgaria.
I hope that you have a good journey and that we can all share in a good European future.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, am glad that the President of the Commission has joined us today, for his presence here underlines the importance of the debate, and the reason why it underlines the importance of the debate is that what we are debating is important.
The dramatic nature of the decision that we will have to take, that the Council will have to take, and that you have yet to take, not only in terms of its internal effect, but also of its effect on the two countries we are discussing is not to be underestimated.
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the social democrats in this House, stand by the wish that we have expressed, namely that, if there are no major obstacles, then 1Â January 2007 should be the accession date for Bulgaria and Romania.
That was, and still remains, our position, and I note that the President was very precise in the way he expressed it in his speech, saying that the Commission was working on the basis that the two countries should be ready for accession to the EU on 1Â January 2007.
Now you, MrÂ Rehn, and you, MrÂ Barroso, have chosen to express yourselves in forms of words that indicate the presence of deficits â deficits that you have described superficially rather than naming them one by one.
If you are now, after seven years, going to travel to Sofia and Bucharest, then I have some good advice to give you: it is that, when you get there, you should use more precise language when talking to the governments there about what you have told this House, describing exactly where the deficits are to be found, and saying precisely what you expect by way of improvements, for that is the only way in which the governments there will have a chance of doing what they have already been doing, namely working hard to ensure that all the criteria expected and demanded of them are actually met.
To do so is only fair, for, as you yourself â both the President and the Commissioner â have said, these governments are doing a great deal.
The process of transformation that these countries have undergone â and this is where I agree with MrÂ Poettering â has been going on for all of one and a half decades and has made great demands on people.
Now, in the final stage, when we need to take account of the hopes of the people of Bulgaria and Romania, of their hope that they will be able to join the European Union, this is a time when great precision is of the essence.
We can accept what you â MrÂ Barroso and CommissionerÂ Rehn â have said, but by saying it, you are shouldering a great responsibility, and so I want to spell out in no uncertain terms what that responsibility is.
You will be telling the governments in Sofia and Bucharest which criteria have yet to be met.
You will be describing what is to be demanded of them, and you have talked to us in terms of an October date.
What that means, then, is that you, in October, will have to tell the Council and the European Parliament in very precise terms whether or not you think these things are as they should be, and, if they are not, then by the logic of your own argument the decision ought to be different from what you, today, expect.
You are thereby taking upon yourself a great responsibility, and I want, today, to again impress upon you what that responsibility is.
It is for that reason that todayâs debate is a very weighty one and one to be taken seriously.
Bulgaria and Romania are indeed to become Member States of the European Union, and we social democrats would like them to accede on 1Â January 2007.
We are well aware of the improvements that have yet to be made.
We are confident that these countries can make them, so that the deadline can be met.
We take it as read that you will keep a watchful eye on them as they do so.
There is, though, one thing I would like to add: it is that this is not just about accession, any more than it is just about the treaties on the basis of which they will accede.
We also need to consider why this accession is so important in the historical context.
These two countries, constituting the Black Sea Region, have made enormous advances.
Quite apart from the things you so rightly criticise, both Romania and Bulgaria have stabilised to an enormous degree, and this stability on the borders of the European Union is of great significance, for this region is also bordered by others that are also our neighbours and which are far from being as stable as we would wish them to be.
It follows that we have a vested interest in these countries achieving stability â economic, social, political and cultural stability â as Member States of the European Union, and so, the sooner they meet the criteria, the sooner they will be ready for accession, and the better it will be for all concerned â not only for the countries in question, but also for the European Union.
The social democrats in the European Parliament have taken note of what the Commission has proposed; although we regard its approach as acceptable, we would advise you to be more precise in Bucharest and Sofia than you have been today.
What we would like to see is both countries fulfilling the criteria in such a way that they will be able, on 1Â January 2007, to become Members of our Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to pay tribute to Commissioner Rehn for his balanced and thorough assessment and his competent handling of this dossier.
I also commend Anca Boagiu and Meglena Kuneva and their predecessors as Ministers for EU Integration for their unstinting hard work.
The author Mark Twain observed, âWe can change the world or ourselves, but the latter is more difficultâ.
Tearing down the Berlin Wall was the easy part.
Building a new democratic culture takes much longer.
But the bricks of effort and the mortar of persistence are working.
The decision to proceed in 2007, with appropriate provisos, is the right one.
The Commission should not, in my groupâs view, revisit its decision in the autumn, except in the gravest of circumstances.
We are concerned that Romania and Bulgaria should be judged no more or less harshly than previous newcomers.
Our monitoring must be in line with current treaty provisions and legislation in force.
We therefore take very seriously the Commissionâs expression of serious concern about continuing corruption and failure of the rule of law â areas which need urgent further action.
Ill treatment of Romany people, too, continues to offend, which is why the Decade of Roma Inclusion launched by six heads of state and government is so important.
In many other areas the Commission identifies failings. These must be put right without delay.
But accession cannot be an examination in which candidates fail. For failure would be at least as much a failure of the Union as of the candidate states.
What is most important to the health of a society is the direction in which its face is set.
Bulgaria and Romania are looking and moving in the right direction.
Can that be said of all current Member States?
Imagine, colleagues, that last autumn Romaniaâs Interior Minister had proposed detention of suspects for three months without charge or that the Bulgarian Prime Minister had used the secret services to spy on his colleagues. There would have been outrage.
My group has always been wary of those who would pander to the fashionable anxiety about enlargement, making strangers of peoples who will soon be fellow citizens.
I was delighted, therefore, to hear that MrÂ Poettering has defied some in his own party and thrown his weight firmly behind future enlargement.
It gives added salience to his groupâs decision to meet last week in a city called Split.
I appeal to the faint hearts on the right to look at what has been achieved.
Has not enlargement been the European Unionâs greatest success story, its crown jewels?
Commissioner Spidlaâs report on transitional arrangements shows that enlargement has brought more jobs and higher economic growth, particularly in those countries that gave open access to their labour markets.
But far beyond economic considerations, welcoming new Members has enriched the culture of our Union.
Bulgaria and Romania will be treasured assets, if only we give them half a chance.
It seems that many of their people believe it is all a matter for government.
On the contrary, winning the war against crime and corruption is a matter for each and every citizen.
So I urge all Bulgarians and Romanians to work together with government to ensure the best possible outcome and avoid any delay to entry, not least because reform demanded to join the Union is the means to raise standards of living, quality of life, and security at home.
I urge all colleagues in this House to show solidarity and demonstrate to the Bulgarians and the Romanians that they do not walk alone.
Â Â  . â I would advise my fellow Member to look at the integration of the Roma in Italy, and the integration of minorities in other Member States, in the old Member States and then to talk further, without interruption â perhaps.
Ladies and gentlemen, when the then French and German leaders, President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl, decided in 1990 to address the countries of Central, Southern and Eastern Europe, they said: âWelcome to a European Union free of borders.
We are inviting you to participate in a common project that is open to all the countries of Europe.
We want to assist you in catching up rapidly with our technical standards and with bringing your legal norms into line with those of the other states.â
Several years later in Copenhagen three conditions were passed, which the states interested in joining the EU would have to fulfil.
The economic component of the Copenhagen criteria is obscure and is usually interpreted as including acceptance into the WTO (World Trade Organisation), as well as an EU Association Agreement.
The political component talks of the peaceful settling of relations with neighbouring states and of the politics of nationalities.
That is something the old EU Member States have yet to master.
In 1993 there was still no talk of selling off national assets, of liquidation quotas for agricultural products, or of the dismantling of nuclear power stations.
The one fundamental requirement at that time was not to undermine conditions for the exchange of goods between the candidate countries and the EU.
At the time, the Commission opened negotiations with 12 states.
The negotiating agenda was technically broken up into 29 chapters, a section headed âVariousâ and a section headed âInstitutionsâ.
After the end of negotiations, two years ago, 10 states were accepted as members.
Up to this day there are some conditions â for example, those for drawing on funds â that have yet to be finalised for them.
Their terms of accession include a whole series of discriminatory measures, and the fact is that these have been very poorly evaluated, especially in the areas of agriculture and the food industry.
The inequality between the inhabitants of the old and the new Member States is all too apparent.
We find ourselves today in a curious situation.
An entire agenda has been negotiated with Bulgaria and Romania, there has been agreement on all of the chapters, and now a new set of strange and discriminatory measures are appearing. These involve restitution demands, the dismantling of modern generator plants at the Kozloduj power station and unequal terms for agriculture and the food industry.
People talk of corruption, of reforming the judiciary, of the situation of children, human trafficking and so on. Everything that applies to the old states applies to the new states.
I understand the fanatical opponents of nuclear power.
It is clear to me that their views will not change and that they could not care less about the energy situation in the Balkans.
What surprises me is the position of Italy and Greece.
They rely on Kozloduj for some of their power supplies.
This means that after the plant has been shut down, Italy will be more dependent on imports from France and other countries.
How will Greece make up for the missing power?
Probably by burning more coal, regardless of agreements made under the Kyoto Protocol.
They can always purchase emission permits.
As for the Bulgarians, they will just have to burn candles, as the power station at Belene is still in the early stages of planning, unless the European Commission perhaps has another environmentally-friendly but workable solution.
Just think for a moment, please, and try to explain how the EU is really contributing to the development of these two countries.
Perhaps it is simply a matter of ensuring that they are not accepted into the Union on reasonable terms?
My group is wholly in favour of their being accepted within the deadline of 1 July 2007.
Â Â  . Mr President, the two Dutch Protestant parties for which I can speak in this House have been consistently in favour of healing Europeâs post-war division.
At the same time, we have always advocated a solid enlargement of the European Union, and hence an emphatic enforcement of the recognised accession criteria, the well-known Copenhagen criteria.
We were saddened by the fact that Romania and Bulgaria were unable to join in 2004 during the Unionâs biggest enlargement round in history.
After all, following the revolution of Europeâs magic year of 1989, church and civil-society contacts were strengthened between our grassroots support and both candidate countries.
