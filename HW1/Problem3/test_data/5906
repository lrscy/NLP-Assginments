That is my personal experience, for what it is worth.
Subject: Cybercrime 24/7 emergency contact network
It is reported to me - from the USA - that 10 EU Member States are not taking part in the 24/7 emergency contact network for cybercrime.
These are Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, and also Portugal, the current Council President.
How great an importance does the Council attach to the fight against international cybercrime?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Newton Dunn, the Council has not been informed about the participation of Member States in this network which is primarily an initiative of the G8 and Council of Europe Member States.
As a result, the Council cannot confirm or refute this.
However, the Council does regard the fight against cybercrime as extremely important, as demonstrated by the adoption of Framework Decision 2005/222/JAI of 24 February 2005 on attacks against information systems and the fact that the Council supported the rapid ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime of 23 November 2001.
In addition, the Council's conclusions on a general policy on the fight against cybercrime will be presented and discussed at the next Justice and Home Affairs Council which is planned for November.
Furthermore, Portugal has a national central reference point which is available 24/7 and which is responsible for fighting this type of crime through Interpol and a global operational network.
Thank you, President-in-Office, for that quite open, honest and factual reply.
Will you, at the next JHA Council meeting, to which you referred, raise the interesting point that the Council does not appear to know about this, and that 10 of the Member States are not involved, which seems completely extraordinary to me?
Would you please raise this issue in the Council?
(PT) I note your question and your concern.
Whether or not this issue will be on the agenda and discussed will naturally be decided at a later date, but I will voice your concern on this matter.
Subject: Ban on visiting Cuban nationals imprisoned in the United States
Earlier this year I requested authorisation from the US Government to visit the Cuban nationals, RenÃ© GonzÃ¡lez, Gerardo HernÃ¡ndez, Antonio Guerrero, RamÃ³n LabaÃ±ino and Fernando GonzÃ¡lez, who are being unlawfully detained in US prisons.
However, I was refused authorisation on the grounds that I did not know them before they were imprisoned.
It appears that in September this year two prisoners' wives were once again refused permits to visit their husbands, whom they have not been able to visit for nine years because of successive refusals.
What does the Council think of this situation which does not constitute respect for these citizens' human rights?
Is it willing to convey its concerns to the US authorities?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mrs Figueiredo, as the honourable Member must surely know, a country's decision as to whether or not to grant entry to its territory is a matter of national competence.
In the specific case of the treatment dispensed to Cuban prisoners and their family members, this is a bilateral issue between the United States and Cuba as, under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the protection abroad of the rights and interests of a country's citizens is the responsibility of that country.
The Council is not therefore competent to give an opinion on this issue.
(PT) That is true but the Presidency must consider this issue: there are five Cuban citizens who have been detained for nine years in US prisons and who have been denied visits by family members and even, in the case of two of them, by their wives.
The latter have previously been to this Parliament and are in fact here today.
It is also true that I am a Member of this Parliament and that I asked for permission to visit these citizens, but that this was denied.
Now I am a Member of this House; I did not make this request solely as a citizen, but also as a representative of this Parliament.
I believe that the European Parliament and its President and of course the Portuguese Presidency should take a stand on this issue, bearing in mind that refusing to allow a visit by one of the Members of this House, in this case myself, is a violation of human rights and also demonstrates a lack of respect for this House.
However, there are also other Members of this House involved in this case and I therefore ask you, Mr President, to convey our concern.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(PT) Mr President, I have of course noted the observations and comments made by Mrs Figueiredo but I have nothing further to add to my previous answer.
You must also understand that I cannot give a personal opinion on this issue.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.

Production of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Cappato, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on production of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan.
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in this report we propose that Parliament should take the initiative and make a proposal to the Council, primarily in the context of the common foreign and security policy, on the issue of opium production in Afghanistan.
Our starting point is the realisation that the results achieved to date are inadequate.
There has been a 50% increase in the production of opium used to produce heroin over the past two years.
It seems that we are unable to find an effective means of reducing this enormous production mountain, all of which then goes to enrich not the growers, the farmers, of course, but the large international drug mafias, the terrorists and the Taliban.
The report also starts from another premise: that at the same time there is in fact a very severe lack of access to painkillers.
Some 80% of the world's population has no access at all to painkillers.
Of course, the two issues could be regarded as completely separate, but I believe it is the job of political institutions to be pragmatic and hence to understand that, faced with this enormous volume of production used for heroin - whilst a product from the same agricultural origin is in very short supply - it ought to be possible, as it were, to combine the two points of departure.
The amendments put forward in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and by Mrs Gomes on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, as well as those tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in plenary, have helped to ensure that the proposal on the table today is not an alternative one, that is, a negative proposal calling for the policy pursued hitherto to be replaced overnight.
What we are asking of you, of the Council and of the Commission, is to conduct an experiment, to run some pilot projects converting part of the crop currently used to produce heroin to produce painkillers instead.
On the demand side too, policies could be launched to try and take painkillers to continents such as Africa and Asia which are practically bereft of any such medicines.
That is why the report, as it emerged from the Committee on Foreign Affairs and taking into account the proposed amendments, seems to me fundamentally well-balanced.
It proceeds from a very simple assumption, namely that it is probably - I believe definitely - easier to cooperate with farmers if we propose converting part of their output to legal ends, rather than simply coming along with a policy of eradicating, fumigating and destroying plantations.
That response in fact creates yet another reason for conflict with local populations and has proved counterproductive and unhelpful, at least until now.
I therefore hope that, beyond the understandable official line taken by Europe's governments and the Afghan Government, asserting the need to fight opium production, beyond that official line we might send out another message, and the European Parliament is perhaps freer than others to make such a proposal.
We have already assumed this responsibility and I hope we will reassert it tomorrow at the vote.
We are freer than others to propose that alternative experiments be carried out and assessed pragmatically, not ideologically.
Every one of us here has his or her own ideas about international politics and drugs, and about international policies in Afghanistan.
This report is not intended as an ideological proposal, but as a practical attempt to help find a solution for what really is a global tragedy.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I too would like to say thank you very much to Mr Cappato - tante grazie!
I welcome this very timely debate on the drug problem - and particularly on Afghanistan's drug problem - which, as we know, is a major complex issue in the political and security context.
We recently had a lot of discussions in New York.
There were a number of very important discussions during the UN General Assembly with President Karzai, with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and with a host of countries.
These focused exactly on this whole complex question.
Tonight's discussion contributes to the wider debate on Afghanistan's reconstruction, but also on the role of drugs.
Let me also commend you for setting up the EP Delegation for relations with Afghanistan.
We are taking a keen interest in your work and consider it very important that you have done this.
Afghanistan's drug industry does indeed pose an enormous challenge to progress in state building.
The latest United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report makes for troubling reading.
Both poppy cultivation and processing capacity have, unfortunately, increased significantly.
Afghanistan's southern provinces are most affected, with 70% of all the production.
The strong link between the insurgency and the drug economy hardly comes as a surprise.
However, we must not overlook the positive developments, especially in the more stable parts of the country, where there have been real improvements in health and education, as well as economic growth.
Thirteen provinces in northern and central Afghanistan are indeed poppy free.
That, at least, is very promising, and something on which we can build.
The Cappato report gives a complete picture of this situation - and I should thank you for your encouraging remarks on what the Commission is doing - and it also points, quite rightly, to Afghanistan's responsibility for tackling the opium industry.
On that we are in absolute agreement.
Yet I must say that I cannot share - at least not yet - the conclusions reached in the report, which proposes to legalise the opium poppy for medical purposes, albeit on a trial basis.
At first sight that may be an appealing proposition, but unfortunately there are no simple answers to Afghanistan's complex drug problem.
Let me share with you some of my concerns.
Countries like Australia, Turkey and India, which are already producing raw opium for medical purposes, usually have effective law enforcement and also an absence of widespread conflict.
Even then, implementation is very difficult.
Where such conditions are not being met, opium cultivated legally is promptly diverted, as we have seen in Peru and Bolivia.
Obviously, in the case of Afghanistan, licit cultivation would, we fear, simply add to illicit cultivation instead of replacing it.
Also, the legal production of opium remains unappealing to local farmers as their revenues would only be around 25-30% of what they can now obtain on the black market.
The implementation of such a scheme is complex, and only feasible with subsidies for quality monitoring and the distribution of medical products.
Should we support this with taxpayers' money?
The Afghan Government, which is notoriously weak and has weak institutions, unfortunately does not at the moment have - and that is why I said 'not yet' - the capacity to oversee such a scheme.
In some parts of the country, there is simply no governance, let alone good governance, at the moment.
This applies notably to the unstable southern provinces, where the bulk of opium is produced.
Finally, the Afghan Government itself has firmly ruled out - and this is an important argument - any licit production of opium.
Against this backdrop, the political message in this report does not really send the right signal to our Afghan partners. It might even backfire.
The hard and undeniable truth is that reconstruction in Afghanistan will need much more time and resources.
It will also require stamina, if we want to bring lasting development to this war-torn country.
Progress in state building is only possible with more resolve, including from Afghanistan's political leadership, notably at the local level.
That was, by the way, the message we gave in New York.
I agree it is high time to visibly tackle corruption.
We have not only said this, but are also trying to help in this by building up a good judicial system and having a police force that really works, in order to convince ordinary Afghans who often remain sceptical.
There is a clear way ahead.
It is through Afghanistan's national drug control strategy, which has been endorsed by the international community and contains all the elements needed.
This really deserves our unequivocal support, being a comprehensive strategy that includes interdiction, public information, prosecution of known drug dealers and the promotion of local development.
Where such a careful policy mix has been used, farmers have already abandoned poppy cultivation, sustainably.
In that context, the Commission considers that a proposal to legalise the opium poppy might simply undermine the work it is currently doing in other sectors, notably concerning the rule of law and policing.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Cappato, with whom I have been friendly for a long time, is trying desperately to contribute to the fight against drugs in the world and to help the unfortunate young or older people who are suffering close to death and who can be assisted with drugs.
Regrettably, however, I cannot go along with him.
Regrettably, I repeat, I am not of the rapporteur's opinion.
I believe the problem stems from the fact that his proposal concerns Afghanistan, a state where insecurity could not be any greater.
Yes, Iraq is perhaps less safe, but Afghanistan is hardly the place to begin trying to convince farmers to abandon what for them is the very lucrative cultivation of poppies and switch to crops that are fairer, more Old Testament-like and more in tune with the civilised farming practices we are all familiar with.
The report itself makes perfectly plain that the largest quantity of drugs in the world, about half, comes from Afghanistan and that opium growing is illegal in Afghanistan.
Even though it is illegal, however, that country is the source of half of the raw materials needed to kill our young people or make them fall prey to drug traffickers who, as we know, draw them into the use of drugs, which harms them and society as a whole.
I believe that there is only one effective weapon to combat all drug traffickers, beginning with the Afghan farmers who in my opinion are the first drug traffickers.
Our inability to control and monitor them means that the only way to fight drugs is through prevention, and hence by helping to reduce opium-growing as much as possible.
For this reason the PPE-DE Group opposes this part of Mr Cappato's report, and I think that what I am saying now must be clear to everyone, whatever tomorrow's outcome may be.
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) I must congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Cappato, not only on this very useful report but also on his readiness to accept contributions in order to get as wide-ranging an agreement as possible.
His original intentions were laudable as he was trying to kill two birds with one stone: legalising poppy cultivation and opium production for medical purposes would not only have ended heroin production in Afghanistan but also the lack of painkillers worldwide.
Unfortunately, we came up against several practical problems, such as the fragility of the Afghan institutions and their inability to regulate opium production, the uncertainty as to the economic viability of such a scheme and the danger in allowing the reintroduction of opium in some of the thirteen Afghan provinces which have stopped production.
My Group's amendments tried to refocus the report on the essential element: the fight against opium production in Afghanistan which is affecting not only Afghanistan but also neighbouring countries.
The drugs illegally produced from this opium constitute what some call the true weapons of mass destruction, particularly in Europe.
In the fight against opium production, we must be sensitive to the individual characteristics of the various Afghan regions.
Only a combination of measures will be successful.
Firstly, the corruption permeating the Afghan central administration, particularly the Interior Ministry and police, must be eradicated as this has paralysed all policies to combat opium production.
Secondly, the 30 or so main drug traffickers identified in a 2006 UN and World Bank report must be sought, captured and put on trial so that this murderous trafficking can be stopped.
Thirdly, NATO must support the Afghan operations to fight this trafficking, by destroying laboratories and stores and preventing drug transports.
Fourthly, the poppy eradication actions must be carefully and selectively applied and concentrated in areas where farmers have real alternatives.
This brings us to the points of agreement with the rapporteur.
We all oppose indiscriminate fumigation of poppy plantations, as has been advocated by the US, which will simply swell the ranks of the Taliban without substantially altering the production of heroin.
Finally, in the context of a package of measures to deal with the Afghan drug problem, the rapporteur's proposal for a pilot project for the legal production of opium-based analgesics should be studied.
More than anything, this report tries to encourage the European Council to be creative and daring in the fight against heroin production in Afghanistan.
There are no easy solutions to this problem, but we know that the terrorism and violent obscurantism advocated by the Taliban and Al-Qaeda will only be defeated when Afghanistan is freed from the clutches of drugs.
I am about to end, Mr President.
This report must be viewed as an urgent appeal to the Member States not to spare any efforts in the economic and political reconstruction of a country which has been so badly affected by bloody conflicts and which is so important for regional and global security.
Madam President, I speak on this matter in a personal capacity, and not on behalf of my Group.
The production of illicit opium in Afghanistan has flourished since US and allied forces have been in that country.
This despite the setting-up of various anti-drug-production authorities and anti-narcotic programmes, sometimes using large amounts of EU taxpayers' money.
So it is obvious, even to the blind, that the Afghan people will go on producing opium come what may.
The reason for this is quite simple.
The world's anti-narcotic agencies are growing in size, number and expertise, and they are doing their job more effectively.
They are therefore managing to confiscate larger amounts of drugs.
However, since the demand from drug-addiction sufferers remains unaltered and since criminal drug traffickers continue to make huge profits from the illegal supply of opium to these sick people, the price of opiates goes up and the profits from dealing in opium increase.
Therefore, the Afghan people are just following basic liberal market principles.
They are increasing their production in order to meet illicit trade demand and in order to increase their profits.
So it is a pure fallacy to expect that sponsoring more opium control programmes in Afghanistan is going to have any significant effect.
The only way to deal effectively with opium production in Afghanistan, and elsewhere for that matter, is to deal with the drug problem globally.
The only common-sense way to do that is to legalise drugs and recognise that drug addicts are not criminals, but sick people who need help.
If those addicts were offered therapeutic drugs in a controlled medical setting, then the chance of avoiding serious side-effects, as well as the chance of achieving detoxification, would be much improved.
At the same time, the enormous criminality involved in drug trafficking would vanish, and all anti-drug police agencies would be scrapped, leading to phenomenal budgetary savings.
The logic of this is so basic, but politicians worldwide are having difficulty seeing it.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue addressed by Mr Cappato's report is extremely delicate and requires careful appraisal by the European Parliament to avoid putting forward misguided and disastrous solutions, albeit motivated by good intentions.
I wish to highlight two points.
Firstly, to increase the production of opium and its derivatives in Afghanistan could compromise the country's reconstruction and the already difficult stabilisation of the rule of law in that unfortunate region.
Secondly, the increasing production of opium - up by 30% this year - has not been matched by an adequate anti-drugs strategy.
For these reasons I think the proposal put forward in the report is absolutely unacceptable, and I would stress that:
1. the necessary quantities of morphine are already being produced in Afghanistan under special licences and subject to supervision by the United Nations drugs agency and the Afghan Government's Ministry of Counter Narcotics;
2. the International Narcotics Control Board maintains that there is already a worldwide surplus of opiates for medical use;
3. large-scale legal production of morphine would lead to more drugs being produced; these would ultimately meet the demand for drugs on the world market.
Once they were placed on the market cheaply they would be available to all.
We should instead oppose drugs - always and in every case and by all means - from production, to trafficking, to illegal distribution.
Demand should be curbed through a value-based policy and through ongoing, widespread prevention work and information campaigns, especially among young people.
In a country like Afghanistan, given the conditions in which it currently finds itself, the solution proposed by this report could be regarded as an indication of surrender and defeat; it could also thwart the efforts being made by the international community, the European Union, the United Nations and the reconstruction agencies in Afghanistan through programmes to diversify away from opium plantations and into other crops, supported by financial incentives.
Finally I would just mention that the International Narcotics Control Board has approved the Afghan Government's decision rejecting the proposal to legalise illicit opium poppy cultivation and reiterating its commitment to comply with its international treaty obligations.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I want to begin by emphasising that this report is extremely important, timely and courageous.
The two emergencies to which it refers both merit political attention and a political response that they clearly have not yet received.
While the security situation and the situation regarding opium production in Afghanistan are increasingly worrying, the need to supply analgesics on a global scale is one of the greatest humanitarian emergencies of our time, although unfortunately it is also one of the most ignored.
The rapporteur, Mr Cappato, did not have an easy task with this report and it is thus all the more remarkable, and I again reiterate both my support and that of my Group.
As he himself said, although the link between the two issues is not simple, nor necessarily immediate, it is our responsibility as politicians to analyse the complex realities in order to find complex solutions to the complex problems.
That is exactly what this report does.
As regards security in Afghanistan, there is no doubt that it must be a priority if we want to implement reconstruction and development programmes with future guarantees.
The problem, however, is that certain armed groups are funded precisely as a result of the lack of regulation of opium production.
We also know that there is illegal cultivation and trafficking of opium, which accounts for 40% of Afghanistan's gross domestic product.
In the light of this situation, I think it is appropriate at least to study and take account of initiatives such as those of the Senlis Council, which is proposing a system to authorise the cultivation of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan.
This would focus mainly on the production of painkillers such as morphine and codeine, which could also be sold to other countries that currently have little or no access to these types of vital medicines as a result of preferential trade agreements.
It is unfortunate that this proposal, at present and in real terms, does not have stronger support from the Commission or the Afghan Government itself.
Even more worrying is the fact that the measures being touted as alternatives often consist of chemical eradication, as stressed over and over again by the US authorities.
If this measure were to be carried out, it would give the Taliban a new argument to defend its positions and eventually would most likely result in the farming communities ending up as rebel camps.
It would also have very serious health and environmental repercussions.
It is clear right from the start that aerial spraying, which is presumably what is proposed for Afghanistan, guarantees that the contamination will extend to the humans who live in the treated areas and surrounding areas.
This was demonstrated at the start of year when this practice was used by Colombia to fumigate cocaine production along the border with Ecuador, with the latter consequently taking a complaint and case to The Hague.
I am not an expert and obviously this chemical issue is much more complex, but I believe that at this stage we should be well aware of some of the disasters caused by napalm and depleted uranium.
We should not repeat this a third time and I hope that we do not.
(SK) Production of opium must be controlled.
The entire international community must concern itself far more with control of opium production everywhere in the world.
Efforts undertaken so far by the UN and its Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), as well as by the World Health Organization, to regulate the use of opiates for the treatment of pain are necessary but still insufficient.
At the same time the international community must not allow an unrestrained use of opiates and their misuse by drug addicts.
In my opinion it is our duty not to give up the fight against the misuse of hard drugs that quite clearly destroy their users' lives.
Neither do I support the notion that society should supply addicts with drugs instead of trying to re-educate them and return them to reality.
What exactly is the Cappato report about?
According to one point of view, the international community suffers from a lack of availability of opiates, or might suffer from such a shortage in the near future, and it is therefore necessary, under certain conditions, to buy this drug from Afghanistan.
It is true that opiates are needed for the treatment of various illnesses, for post-operative pain relief and, last but not least, for the treatment of people with malignant diseases.
However, this theory suffers from several fundamental defects that cannot be ignored in the present situation.
Firstly, the current political situation in Afghanistan is unstable.
In Afghanistan it is necessary to fight the Taliban on the one hand and to side with the opium black market on the other hand.
This black market has a decisive impact not only on the Afghan economy but also on Afghan politics and foreign relations.
I have serious doubts and worries over this and I will explain now why in my opinion such an approach cannot work.
Projects involving legal poppy cultivation for the purpose of opium production will not work because the International Narcotics Control Board can only impose sanctions on a country afterwards but the country will be losing a part of the crops to the black market.
International demand is constant.
The Afghan Government is not capable of acting as the sole manager of opium crops.
It is clear that under these circumstances the Government will lose the fight against traffickers.
Competition will increase the price of opium and farmers who grow poppies legally will turn to the black market.
In addition to that (and this is very important) Afghan prices are not competitive compared with Australia where one kilo of morphine costs USD 56, India where it is USD 159 or Turkey where it is USD 250.
In Afghanistan the price can go up to USD 450 per kilo.
Regarding the use for medical purposes, if Afghan opium were to be used in medical products, this would only add to further over-saturation of the market in this area.
I am about to finish, Madam President.
I will oppose any support by the EU and its Member States for poppy cultivation in Afghanistan for at least four reasons: insufficient infrastructure, absence of economic competitiveness, huge expansion in the wrong direction and, finally, there is no lack of opiates on the world markets at present.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Cappato for his work on this report.
The report posed a great challenge as it attempts to respond to one of the most difficult problems in the contemporary world.
Opium production in Afghanistan is increasing year on year.
According to the latest annual report, opium production is now double what it was two years ago.
In practice, Afghanistan currently has a monopoly of the supply of the deadliest drug in the world.
It accounts for 93% of world production of opiates.
Our President is numbered amongst those who believe that Afghanistan's fate is our common cause.
The heroic struggle of the Afghan people during the Cold War period contributed to the spread of freedom across the contemporary world and to the fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe.
The European Union is now honour bound to provide Afghanistan with military, administrative and economic assistance.
This also involves assistance in combating the production of drugs in Afghanistan.
It should be remembered that the main incentive for Afghan growers to produce opiates is financial profit.
This should be borne in mind when devising the European aid programme aimed at resolving the problem.
That is why I particularly wished to commend Mr Cappato on the courageous proposals he makes in this report.
They may well help to resolve the situation in question.
One of these proposals involves offering aid through the introduction of a pilot scientific project for the production of poppies for medical purposes which will allow for further research into the extent to which awarding licences can contribute to poverty reduction, diversification of the rural economy, general development and improved security.
In a nutshell, this is not about moralising but about the European Union making an effective contribution to resolving this problem in Afghanistan.
(RO) According to the 2007 Afghanistan opium survey, conducted by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, opium production reached a record of 8,200 tons, representing 93% of the world production of opiates.
Thus, 40% of the gross domestic product in Afghanistan resulted from production of and illegal trade in opium, involving 2.9 million people in this process.
Despite this fact, only 10 countries consume 80% of the opium derivatives legally available in the world, while in over 150 countries serious treatment insufficiencies generated by the illegal trade in opium have been found.
We should emphasize that the main source of finance of the Taliban and terrorist groups is illegal drug trafficking.
Moreover, the actions to eradicate or destroy drugs, which are sponsored by the international community, are used by the tribal political and military leaders for their own benefit and for eliminating competition.
Based on the things stated so far, I am convinced that a strategic and balanced approach of the process of reducing and controlling opium production should involve social and economic alternatives to favour the establishment of a rule of law and democratic institutions in Afghanistan.
This is why such an action could represent one of the basic solutions for preventing and eradicating terrorism.
Madam President, I consider that an anti-drug plan in Afghanistan, consisting in the control of opium quantities by using them to obtain analgesics and other derivatives, might represent one and not the only alternative economic solution and a means of reducing poppy cultivation.
(PL) Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner on the outstanding performance by the Altenburg Boys' Choir that we have just heard.
I am truly impressed.
I must now turn to less pleasant subjects, however, namely the Cappato report.
Members who took the floor earlier persisted in quoting the figure of 40% of GDP because that is the proportion of Afghanistan's GDP that is allegedly generated by the production of narcotics.
That figure has been accepted but I should like to emphasise that a year ago our representatives in Afghanistan clearly stated otherwise before Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs.
They maintained that the proportion of GDP is above 50% which is even higher.
I am reluctant to provide explanations, but at least 10% of the population of Afghanistan lives off drug production and trade.
We should also recognise that soldiers from the international forces are involved in this trade, along with Americans based in the country.
I consider this to be a risky proposal, although I do of course accept it has certain underlying advantages.
I am firmly convinced, however, that the proposal will actually result in legalisation of the trade in drugs rather than of medical aid.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a matter simply of observing that 92% of opium in the world is produced in Afghanistan but of noting the upward trend: in 2001, according to data from the UN drugs agency, 8 000 hectares were given over to opium growing while in 2006 it was 165 000; 185 tons were harvested in 2001, 6 100 in 2006.
This obviously means that the current strategy of destroying crops by fumigation solves nothing.
Rather, it has social consequences that will subsequently cause opium production to spiral.
Crops other than opium poppies are destroyed, so farmers become ever poorer and end up in the hands of drug traffickers, namely the Taliban and the warlords sitting comfortably in government.
The goal is therefore to provide farmers with support which at least initially must be at the same financial level as now, freeing them from dependence on drug traffickers.
This plan will not solve the problem, of course, but no one is claiming that it will.
We are talking about an experiment in a limited area, and it could not be otherwise in a war-torn country where land is controlled by rival gangs.
It nevertheless constitutes a step forward, in that at least part of that opium will not end up as heroin, but as morphine.
That, I believe, is beneficial for the West and the entire world.
Besides, I think we must clarify the fact that there is already provision for morphine production.
I am not aware, Commissioner, that all these problems exist in India and Turkey; if so, regulation is needed.
The resolution before us, however, envisages a regulatory role for international bodies: not over Afghanistan as a whole, which is unmanageable at present, but over an extremely limited area.
Furthermore, international medical associations are making plain that there is still a need for morphine today, not only in the South of the world, but paradoxically in the North too.
It must of course be sold at official prices, but it is a painkiller and in my opinion everyone is entitled to it, including African people and poor people.
If we are talking about expense, it undoubtedly costs less to take action of this kind and to place price controls on morphine, rather than deciding to destroy crops using the existing methods which get us nowhere.
One last comment: I welcome the fact that this has been a pragmatic debate, not an argument between those wishing to liberalise or legalise drugs and prohibitionism.
We are trying to take practical, pragmatic action to assist part of the Afghan population.
Madam President, it is important that substances derived from opium, like diamorphine (also known as heroin), are available for medical purposes, especially pain relief, but poppy cultivation provides the Taliban terrorists with 20-40% of their funds, which enables them to kill NATO soldiers.
Regrettably, Afghan opium production increased 34% this year and constitutes over 90% of global supply.
Troops from my country, the UK, are leading the fight against the Taliban as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
They do not have the mandate or the manpower to police a large-scale poppy-growing medical project - or, for that matter, to eradicate the crop.
They have got quite enough to think about dodging bullets, without becoming part-time market-gardeners.
However, I do have some sympathy, as a doctor, with the arguments put forward by the British Medical Association, which does support cultivating poppies - under strict supervised conditions - to ensure the ready supply of analgesics.
My UK parliamentary colleague, Tobias Ellwood MP, has done much to develop a plan of a six-year period of tapered replacement of poppy crops in Afghanistan by cash crops diverting the opium production for medical use.
Therefore, we should at least explore the idea of a very limited pilot licensing scheme, mindful of the danger of it being hijacked by the Taliban for illegal purposes.
Any trial will, inevitably, have to be confined to a very small area.
It will need support from a range of partner organisations if it is going to work.
We certainly cannot divert our brave troops from their vital task of fighting terrorism, but it might just have some beneficial effects all round.
On the issue of EU-Afghan aid, we need a far more coordinated approach by the EU to developing Afghan infrastructure and fighting corruption; otherwise, the Taliban will indeed prevail, as we are barely containing the Taliban in the south of the country.
The West must wake up to the realities of Afghanistan.
International bodies are not coordinating their activities properly.
The rampant corruption of the Afghan Government means that provinces are losing patience with President Karzai's Government in Kabul.
The current centralised model of government does not suit the diversity of interests and ethnicities across the country, which has never had a tradition of strong central government in the past.
The provinces are currently given no operational funding to pursue objectives separate from Kabul.
No long-term economic plan is being followed to harness the plentiful water supply, 92% of which - shamefully and ludicrously - runs out of the country.
Construction of dams and irrigation systems would allow industrial-scale growth of fruit and vegetables.
Afghanistan was once upon a time famous for its pomegranates, now very much 'in' with the health food lobby.
Building a much needed railway system would help ship such goods onto the international market.
If the country is to be rescued from political and economic disaster, much still urgently needs to be done, Madam Commissioner.
Madam President, as someone who has long opposed fumigation to eradicate drugs as inefficient, often counterproductive and always with damaging side effects to human health, I am sorry that this resolution combines this position with what I believe to be a misguided attempt to encourage licit opium production in Afghanistan.
This resolution quotes the Senlis Council report suggesting a global poppy shortage; but that is not poppy, it is poppycock.
The International Narcotics Control Board shows world stockpiles of licit opiates equivalent to two years' demand, whilst London-based Johnson Matthey, the largest producer of morphine in the world, attest to a world surplus of more than 250 tonnes.
The Commissioner is right to argue that conditions in Afghanistan would not allow Afghan farmers to benefit.
This is just one of many forced assumptions in the draft resolution.
Opium poppy is grown on less than 4% of agricultural land.
Licit cultivation would add to illicit cultivation, not replace it.
According to the independent Asia Foundation survey, 80% of Afghan people oppose this drugs trade.
The Afghan Government opposes it, President Karzai calling opium 'the enemy of humanity'.
Just weeks before the time for sowing poppy, it would send precisely the wrong political signal.
I have every respect for the rapporteur, but on this issue, I regret, the House will divide.
Poppy for medicine is a beguiling phrase; but the truth, instead, is that opium funds the violence and insecurity in Afghanistan.
Poppy for corruption and terrorism would be the more apt phrase.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to express my support for the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on production of opium for medical purposes in Afghanistan.
I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his courage.
Combating the illegal trade in drugs is one of the major global challenges of the contemporary world.
The European Union should organise its activities in such a way as to try and effectively control drugs and reduce the supply of drugs in the world on the one hand and, on the other, to increase the availability of analgesics and bring down their prices.
The proposal to legalise opium production to meet the needs of the international pharmaceutical industry may well be a useful way of attaining the aforementioned aims.
Following the example of Turkey and Australia, licences could also be granted in Afghanistan for the cultivation of poppies used to produce useful analgesics such as morphine or codeine.
The specific conditions prevailing in Afghanistan must be taken into account, however, if licensing is to go ahead.
Afghanistan is the main supplier of the raw material for the production of opiates in the world.
Opium production and trade in Afghanistan have become an important factor in the growth of GDP, the basis of cross-border trade, the main source of income for growers and the only way for most of society to access land, work, and credit.
Legalising poppy growing in Afghanistan will make sense only if the right conditions are created.
The security situation must improve and the country become politically stable if the national authorities are to ensure effective control of the opium production process.
Effective democracy has to come about and state credits be made available to farmers.
In addition, the conduct of economic activity should be regulated.
(SV) Madam President, I want to begin by thanking Marco Cappato for an interesting report.
I am responsible on the LIBE committee for the long-term budget for the drugs programme.
On that committee we are trying to be practical in our work on how we in the EU can reduce harmful use and supply.
I therefore think that the debate on Afghanistan is crucial, because it is the origin of the majority of the heroin (93%) that kills our young people on the streets.
If it is possible through production of opium for medical purposes to reorganise control and production for some farmers under EU and UN supervision, then let us say yes to the project.
This is coming from me, someone from Sweden, which has a very strong anti-drugs programme and drugs policy.
Unfortunately I do not think that it is enough, but we must of course also look at other possibilities, such as energy production.
However, the farmers need jobs and livelihoods, and we in the European Parliament must therefore take responsibility and demand more action.
We will be replacing 40% of the GNP, and we need to take responsibility for that!
As regards paragraph 1(a) calling on the Council to oppose the use of fumigation as a means of eradicating the poppy, I take a different view.
I think that we must also look at it in order to break the deadlock we now find ourselves in, with nothing happening.
Lastly, a few words on overproduction.
It does not mean that there is a greater need for analgesics among the world's poorest, among women and children.
They use very few analgesics compared with us in the EU.
So let us take a global view and find constructive solutions in the EU and the UN together with Afghanistan, to support peace and democracy and to combat terrorism and drugs.
Thank you.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say something about the demand side and something about the supply side.
On the demand side, Mr Tatarella, who is no longer with us, and Mr Howitt raised the problem of overproduction: the fact that the opium currently available actually exceeds demand for processing into opiates for drugs.
That is true, but it is true only of current demand levels.
What the report attempts to address is potential demand.
Some 80% of the world's population has no access whatsoever to painkillers, even for the commonest operations, for amputations or for the care of cancer sufferers.
That is what we are talking about, and the International Narcotics Control Board bears partial responsibility for the absence of a global policy to promote painkilling drugs.
On the supply side, I would take the liberty of saying to the Commissioner that this proposed pilot project would indeed cost money, resources from the taxpayer.
That is true, but the existing policy costs huge amounts of taxpayers' money.
The problem is simple, therefore.
What we are asking you to check is whether it is more difficult and more costly to go in and forcibly uproot crops from one area which will then very probably be moved to the adjoining area, or else to buy up that harvest and process it on the spot, under supervision by the international community, so that it cannot be used to produce heroin but is used there and then to produce medicines.
The second alternative is less costly, in my opinion, including for European citizens and taxpayers.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I think it was a very interesting discussion.
Again, I appreciate Mr Cappato's courageous idea.
But, again, let me also argue and say: yes, it is true that our strategy has not yet been successful.
But, as I said before, it is not only a strategy with regard to drugs; it is a hugely complex situation.
We are in a post-conflict situation and, of course, all the different elements are there: NATO, the European Union and the UN.
We had these meetings in New York exactly on this matter.
Now let me come back to the drugs question.
There are indeed problems on the demand and on the supply side.
On the demand side, there is, at this moment, no demand for additional licit opium for medical purposes according to the International Narcotics Control Board.
And I hear that world demand is indeed fully met now, and Turkey and India had to cut their production in 2005 and 2006.
The stockpiles were so high that they would last worldwide for two years.
That is one point.
I understand your saying that maybe people in other parts of the world do not even have the possibility of having medical treatment without pain relief. I understand that.
But this is something that you are taking out of context.
These are the realities today.
On the supply side, let us also look a little at the proportions.
Afghanistan is, as some colleagues have said, the country that produces the highest share of opium and drugs: 8 200 tonnes.
If it were even allowed to produce legally, there would only be a possibility for a small amount and that would only be very small.
So, even if there were a possibility, I think that would represent only five tonnes of opium production.
Now, comparing 8 200 tonnes to five tonnes: this is nothing!
So you see, neither on the supply side nor on the demand side is there a real balance.
Therefore, apart from this very complex situation, I think your idea is courageous; I agree.
But I think that, for Afghanistan, it is maybe not useful at this stage.
On the contrary, I think what we have to do as a strategy is to have a combination of sustaining Afghanistan's long-term development and offering farmers alternatives to poppy cultivation, combined with improved governance.
So the focus will be on justice and police, as we will try to do and as we have started doing.
We have also been at the forefront on the rural livelihood agenda and helping to support legitimate employment.
To this end, the European Commission is also supporting the Afghan Government's National Drug Control Strategy through supply-control and demand-reduction initiatives and the improvement of governance.
For instance, we have been supporting the Law and Order Trust Fund, up to now with some EUR 135 million, while a sum of EUR 70 million is planned for the next two years.
But I must also say, since we have been concentrating on rural development, on health care and on justice, and also helping on the police and justice reform, plus alternative production, as the European Union and European Commission, we cannot do everything alone in Afghanistan.
This I would like to say to the honourable Member Mr Tannock, because I think he is addressing only us, the European Commission and European Union, but there are many other important actors there.
I think we all have to get our act together.
This is what we are trying to do more and more through a very coordinated strategy, which, on the one hand, is going to combat drugs.
But, again, I think that, maybe, it is too early.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Improving the efficiency of the enforcement of judgments in the EU: attachment of bank accounts (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Green Paper on improving the efficiency of the enforcement of judgments in the European Union: the attachment of bank accounts.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, that was an interesting debate.
We now move on to a very different subject area.
We will see if we can achieve an outcome sooner or later.
There is a saying which, I presume, is understood throughout Europe, namely that money does not bring happiness, but it does bring peace of mind.
In that spirit, let me start by wishing all our citizens in Europe peace of mind.
However, if you are owed money by another person, if someone owes you money from a sale, damages or similar, this often gives cause for concern rather than peace of mind.
Will the debtor evade his commitments?
Will he conceal his money or his assets, perhaps at an even later hour than our debate this evening?
All Member States have procedures which aim to prevent this from occurring.
They include attachments, injunctions, arrest and seizure: there are many different terms.
Procedures vary very widely and the situation is extremely complicated, and there is of course the language issue as well.
Anyone wishing to make use of Member States' various cross-border procedures may well find that the horse has bolted, or as we say in Germany, the hare is already on the other side of the hill.
In other words, the debtor has had time to hide his assets.
This is now a widespread problem across Europe's borders, and it is becoming increasingly pressing given that we are all aiming for a single payment area with cash-free transactions.
That means that the opportunities to hide assets on the other side of the hill are steadily growing.
That is why the Commission has taken the initiative and, I would emphasise, is quite right to do so.
It has presented a very good Green Paper which is comprehensive and detailed, albeit with some points which will undoubtedly require further clarification.
That is still ahead of us and is the purpose of the hearing.
At this stage, the European Parliament cannot deal with all aspects in detail, and neither can I, so I shall simply mention some of the key points.
First of all, although this can really be taken for granted, the report is only about the attachment of bank accounts and temporarily freezing bank deposits.
It is not about final settlement.
Secondly, it is only about financial assets held in bank accounts.
It does not deal with injunctions or the attachment of other assets.
That raises the question of whether our purposes would really be served through the harmonisation of 27 different systems.
In my view, that would be an extremely unwieldy approach and would take forever to achieve.
It encroaches on so many other areas that it would not be helpful.
The right approach is what the Commission has in mind: an independent and additional European procedure, preferably in the form of a regulation, to exist in parallel to the national provisions, which would remain in force.
I should also mention the 'Brussels I' Regulation at this juncture.
The Regulation which already exists is not adequate.
The creditor must not only demonstrate credibly and summarily that he has a claim but must also demonstrate the risk.
Our particular concern, which I share, is to protect the creditor.
What I do not want, under any circumstances, is a situation in which creditors or third parties suffer harm precisely because we have a European regulation.
That would reverberate on Europe itself.
In some cases, attachment without just cause can destroy a person's livelihood.
I would simply like to mention the main points: that a creditor may be liable for damages arising for the debtor, that the creditor should be obliged to institute the main proceedings within a fixed time limit, that the creditor may be required to provide security, that the debtor should be entitled to appeal, that a procedure should not be selected which takes an eternity but which is broadly in line with the previous proceedings, that there should be provisions preventing too much money being frozen for the benefit of the creditor, and that the debtor must be guaranteed the wherewithal to live on.
There is the problem of trust accounts.
If there is to be any possibility of attachment here - and I will leave that open - they certainly need to be specially protected.
The same applies to joint accounts, although this is not the same thing; in fact, the two are not directly related.
The point is that it is also important to protect third parties, and special protection measures are required for any third parties involved.
I would just mention that standardised formal notices would be useful for banking communications and, in this connection, would like to conclude by saying that studies comparing the laws in force as well as detailed analyses are undoubtedly required.
I would also, and specifically, like to thank the Commission for these comprehensive analyses and studies, and also thank all my colleagues.
We worked together very well.
I assume that there will be a broad consensus in favour of the report.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I think the report is an interesting contribution to dealing with a very complex issue: the difficulty of cross-border debt recovery.
I think the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, is to be congratulated for paving the way for a general European solution to the current fragmentation of national rules on enforcement, which severely hampers cross-border debt collection.
This situation is of particular concern to a creditor who has the misfortune of seeing his debtor swiftly moving his money out of a known account into another account in the same or another Member State.
Therefore, the Commission welcomes Parliament's report.
I will carefully consider the main concerns expressed by the rapporteur and by Parliament in relation to the Green Paper.
In particular, the form and the scope of the possible Community instrument, the effects of future procedure, the legal condition for granting an attachment order, the compensation of costs and the protection of debtors are important issues that have been highlighted by the rapporteur.
I can confirm to you that any proposal or communication in this area will be preceded by an in-depth evaluation and impact assessment, in close cooperation with this Parliament.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Madam President, I welcome the Green Paper and look forward to an early follow-up on more concrete proposals.
It is clearly in the interests of fostering cross-border trade for businesses to have the confidence to be able to recover debt.
Citizens also need that confidence at an individual and private level.
My opinion received unanimous support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, not because we reached hard-fought compromises, but because there was a common view from the outset.
I am pleased that almost everything that we adopted has fitted into, or been covered by, the final report by the Committee on Legal Affairs, for which I thank the rapporteur.
Two points that did not make it into the report were the possibility of applying attachment to joint accounts and the investigation of optional domestic use of the cross-border provision.
In a less prescriptive form, there is an amendment concerning joint accounts that has gained support elsewhere.
It is clearly a loophole if a nominal joint account enables evasion of attachment orders, but genuine third party funds must be protected.
Concerning the optional domestic use of the cross-border provision, I note what colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs said about the measure only being possible cross-border, be that for legal reasons or for practical reasons of achieving something in a reasonable timescale.
However, unless alternative remedies exist in those Member States where attachment is not possible, or is extremely difficult, there could be a competitive mismatch, at least from the business aspect, with the rather unusual situation of a cross-border business being better off than a domestic one.
Perhaps Member States will take note of this and competition will deliver what we do not or cannot legislate for.
Madam President, I welcome the Commission's initiative on the cross-border regulation of the attachment and temporary freezing of bank accounts.
I congratulate you in particular, Mr Frattini, as the competent Commissioner for this initiative.
The Commission's Green Paper on this issue has laid down procedures for dealing with the problem, which arises when the enforcement of court judgments is avoided because of the operation or transfer of bank accounts outside national borders.
The measure under discussion is contained in the strategy for developing judicial cooperation between EU Member States.
The measure is a move in the right direction; it must be completed soon with the submission of a relevant proposal.
The cause of justice is not served if civil or criminal court judgments cannot be enforced.
For this reason, the proposal relating to the attachment and freezing of cross-border bank accounts that is under consideration really contributes to the evolution and consolidation of justice.
The European Parliament rightly takes a positive view of the Commission's initiative and of the judicial procedure under preparation.
The Lechner report and the opinions of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Finance set out the basic parameters for preparing a balanced proposal for a Council decision on the issue.
I congratulate Mr Lechner on his succinct but very informative and comprehensive report.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, I hold positions that essentially coincide with nearly all of his.
The report is expected to be approved by an overwhelming majority.
It emphasises the need to meet the requirements for issuing a cross-border attachment order for bank accounts.
It also stresses the concurrent need to protect the procedure against abuse and to provide guarantees of compensation to the alleged debtor if his order turns out to be to be null and void.
I believe that a freezing order can serve, at the end of court proceedings, as an enforcement measure for a final exequatur judgment.
This is not Mr Lechner's view, but it must seriously be considered when the relevant Commission proposal is submitted, in the interests of preventing unnecessary duplication of proceedings.
I call on the Commission to proceed at once with preparation of the proposal on this issue.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, an unquestionable weakness of the current provisions of enforcement legislation is the situation in which, having verified enforceability of a court order in another Member State, enforcement remains the exclusive competence of national legislation.
Pursuant to Community legal acts currently in force there is no way of obtaining an order to attach a bank account that could be enforced across the territory of the entire European Union.
That is why a European system for an order allowing the attachment of bank accounts seems to be such an appropriate and necessary solution.
It would allow creditors to secure the sums due or the value of their claim by making it impossible to withdraw or transfer funds deposited in one or many bank accounts across the territory of the European Union.
Such a system should be created following the development of an additional independent procedure that would stand alongside national provisions with the proviso that it would only apply to cross-border issues.
It is worth emphasising that such an order would only have a preventive effect.
In other words, it would block the debtor's funds in the latter's bank account, without transferring them to the creditor's account.
The court must of course refrain from hearing or informing the debtor of the proceedings before attaching his or her bank account, otherwise the effect might be the opposite of what was intended.
The sum to be attached should be calculated on the basis of the creditor's claim.
It should be emphasised, however, that the debtor must have the right to appeal the order issued, and the competent institution to hear that appeal should be the court where the order was issued.
Provision should also be made for derogations from enforcement to allow the basic needs of the debtor and his or her family to be met.
Clearly, at that stage, additional comparative legal analysis would be required, as many aspects call for further investigation.
Nonetheless, the fact remains that the introduction of a Community legal procedure such as a European order for the attachment of bank accounts aimed at streamlining the implementation of monetary claims and improving effectiveness would be a milestone along the road to the creation of a European economic and judicial area.
In conclusion, I should like to congratulate Mr Lechner on an outstanding and well-prepared report.
The House must be well aware, of course, of how difficult it is to change Union provisions, particularly in this field.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I want to begin by congratulating my colleague, Mr Lechner, on the excellent report he has produced: it is both balanced and moderate.
Here at this time of the night, I cannot help but think about what attachment means.
In practice, in day-to-day life, normally the creditors are large institutions with a great deal of economic power while the debtors are usually people in a much weaker economic situation.
Indeed, one of the nicest poems in the Spanish language is dedicated to the attachment of a poor unfortunate worker.
It is true that if there are no attachments - if creditors do not have the possibility of recovering their claim - those who need credit will not be able to get it.
Since I think we are all a bit bored, I am going to tell you a story about one of the dictatorships we had in Spain, that of General Primo de Rivera.
He believed that attachment of the assets of military personnel was an insult to the military profession.
He therefore banned the attachments of accounts of military personnel.
As a consequence, the banks refused to lend money to the military, and the military then had to ask the General to allow them to be subject to attachments again.
That is only a story, however.
I believe that Mr Lechner has managed to achieve a balance in terms of the protection of debtors' rights, but I still have one question, and Mr Frattini will probably be aware of what I want to say in this respect.
When it comes down to it, the large debtors, the people who are involved in major financial operations and who end up owing billions to thousands of defenceless people, those large debtors do not usually have their accounts in a bank in Belgium, Brussels or Strasbourg, or even in London.
They usually have them in tax havens.
This, of course, is not covered by the provisions of the Commission's Green Paper.
However, since I know that Commissioner Frattini has an interest in this matter, I will put the question to him: would it not be advisable to come up with a way of ensuring that these large international criminals who ruin the lives of thousands of families could also have their assets attached?
As I said, this is a scenario that is outside the scope of the Green Paper, outside the scope of what we are discussing tonight.
However, since the main topics already appear to have been discussed very clearly by the previous speakers and by Commissioner Frattini himself, I think that it is something that we must examine.
I am sure that Commissioner Frattini will have something to add in this respect.
In conclusion, I just want to reiterate once again my congratulations to Mr Lechner: I think that he has produced a balanced report and that the position of debtors, of poor debtors, which means most citizens, is guaranteed.
I hope that the Commission will soon present us with a legislative text that enables the cross-border credit market to continue to function.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Lechner on his report.
I want to start with, as it were, a confession. Before I arrived in this House I was a lawyer.
In fact I was not only a lawyer, but a lawyer dealing in debt collecting, often cross-border.
My experience in this area is that the most damage is caused to small enterprises that have plucked up courage to trade cross-border, and are then ruined by a bad debt and a professional debtor hiding in another country.
I therefore consider this initiative to be a way, if we can get it right, of boosting Europe's economy and encouraging cross-border trade.
We have to get tough.
The payment order was a step in the right direction.
This is the next piece in the jigsaw.
However, I have two points to make.
First of all, we are dealing with cross-border cases only.
We accept the reality of that constraint, but what I do not want to see is creditors having to make two applications to courts: one in respect of debtors in the home country, followed by another in a different country, cross-border.
That may give the debtor warning and it may cause all sorts of complications.
We therefore need to ensure that there are concurrent procedures available.
Secondly, this is, of course, a balance of interests between the creditors and the debtors.
We have a good system in England, under which when you are given such an interim measure, you have to provide an undertaking to the court, in damages, to respect the interests of third parties.
This may be the bank that has to organise the attachment, or a third party that might hold a joint account.
I would recommend a system along those lines.
I commend the report and the ideas in it.
I believe it could do much to boost Europe's economy if we get things right.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the Green Paper on improving the efficiency of the enforcement of judgments in the European Union represents a further stage in the development of a European area of justice.
I endorse the view put forward by the rapporteur in this report and support the introduction of a swift and effective procedure for obtaining an order for attachment of bank accounts in the European Union.
In the context of ongoing integration in the Single Euro Payments Area, a legal provision of this nature seems to be both appropriate and desirable.
In view of the many difficulties involved in investigating claims, it is my belief that the European Union should introduce an independent additional procedure that would stand alongside national provisions.
Such a procedure ought to apply only in cross-border cases and relate solely to funds in bank accounts and not to other assets.
It is simply a case of provisionally securing a creditor's claim, not of finally settling it.
Unjustified attachment may have serious consequences for the debtor and impact negatively on confidence in the European legal system.
I therefore believe that particular care should be taken to protect the debtor.
This could involve, for instance, submission of security by the creditor, the right to object, limiting the amount liable or even a requirement for the creditor to submit an application for court proceedings to be brought regarding the main action.
(PL) Madam President, the provisions relating to enforcement legislation are often described as the Achilles' heel of the European system of justice concerning civil cases.
To date, no legislative motion has been submitted regarding the actual means of enforcing judgments.
Enforcing a court order after establishing its enforceability in another country is still the exclusive competence of national law.
The current variations between the principles for debt recovery in individual Member States of the European Union seriously hinder the recovery of cross-border debts.
Creditors seeking enforcement of an order in another country are confronted with unfamiliar legal systems and legal requirements.
They also have to cope with the language barrier, which entails additional costs and delays the enforcement procedure.
Difficulties relating to the recovery of cross-border debts hinder the free movement of payment orders within the Union and impact negatively on the proper operation of the internal market.
Payments that are delayed or never made endanger the interests of companies and consumers alike.
The Commission's proposal to introduce a single European legal instrument that would be independent of national legislation and stand alongside it therefore seems to be entirely appropriate, if not essential.
Article 65(c) of the Treaty establishing the European Community could serve as the legal basis for such a document.
In this connection, pursuant to the provisions of the Green Paper, the creditor should have the right to submit an application for an order to be issued for the attachment of bank accounts before the start of the main proceedings.
In view of the provisional nature of the procedure, the creditor should, however, be required to justify his or her claim and also the urgent need for an attachment order to be issued.
Unjustified attachment can of course have very serious implications for a debtor, and can even deprive the latter of the means with which to satisfy his or her basic needs.
Other important issues are a debtor's right to contest the order and setting the amount to be paid.
Setting a single limit for the sum to be exempted from enforcement at European Union level does not seem to be a good idea.
Such decisions should remain within the competence of the legal system of the debtor's home country.
As regards serving orders for the seizure of assets from bank accounts, it is important to ensure that uniform standards concerning communication between courts and banks are established within the European Union.
It seems essential to regulate the matter of recovery of cross-border debts by way of adoption of the relevant legal act.
It is, however, important not to overlook the need to first undertake an in-depth study of the provisions already in force in individual Community countries and to assess the effectiveness of alternative solutions in relation to European provisions.
I should like to conclude by thanking Mr Lechner for a well-considered and well-prepared report.
(PL) Madam President, the problem of effective enforcement of monetary claims across the territory of the European Union is very important in terms of ensuring proper functioning of the internal market.
It is worth considering Community action in this regard.
There is a very important saying that was impressed on me when I was a trainee lawyer, according to which when we do someone a favour we become indebted to them.
This is sometimes true.
Delaying payments or failing to make them altogether endangers the interests of companies and consumers alike.
The differences in the efficiency of debt recovery that currently exist within the European Union can threaten the competitiveness of companies whose activities extend beyond the borders of a particular Member State.
The systems for enforcing orders differ between individual Member States.
In some states they are more effective than in others.
As things stand at present, a debtor may almost instantly transfer funds from accounts known to the creditor to other accounts located in the same country or in another Member State.
This makes it practically impossible for creditors to block those funds.
Furthermore, creditors seeking enforcement of an order in another Member State are confronted with a different legal system and procedural requirements.
The language barrier and cost of the proceedings represent additional obstacles.
I therefore believe that we should respond positively to the proposal to create a European system to attach bank accounts.
Bearing in mind the increasing integration in the Single Euro Payments Area, legal regulation of this type is both appropriate and essential.
I would like to thank Mr Lechner for this report.
I am sure it will represent a turning point in the Union's legal system.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, just a brief remark about the comments made by Mr Medina Ortega and also to thank everyone who has spoken.
This European instrument, this European attachment order that is under discussion, really could complement national legislation and hence deal with the serious infringements of creditors' rights that occur on a transnational basis.
I very much agree with Mr Medina Ortega about the fact that we must give thought to attachment, or protection, as it were, in respect of people who take refuge in tax havens.
Clearly, as you are all aware, Europe has no unilateral power to act.
What we must work towards, in my opinion, is closer cooperation between the judiciary, the financial investigation authorities and the major banking groups which operate in these so-called tax havens.
We need to convince those countries' governments that it is ultimately in their interest to cooperate with the European Union.
Therefore, even if we do not have an active instrument in the near future, a unilateral tool to counter the system of tax havens, we ought to be able to use the instrument of democracy, on the one hand, and that of judicial and financial cooperation, on the other, to tackle what is a very real problem.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences - Mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on criminal matters and sentences:
by Mrs Esteves, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Council framework decision on the recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences [06480/2007 - C6-0129/2007 - 2007/0807 (CNS)];
by Mr Varvitsiotis, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council framework decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgements in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union [09688/2007 - C6-0209/2007 -.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I support both initiatives, which are, in my view, complementary and which would both enable the greater social reintegration of persons sentenced either to a non-custodial sentence or to a custodial sentence in a Member State other than the one in which they habitually reside.
We also support initiatives such as these, which implement the principle of mutual recognition.
The draft texts of both initiatives have evolved very much in the course of discussions in the Working Party on Cooperation in Criminal Matters.
Many of Ms Esteves's and Mr Varvitsiotis' suggested amendments during the first parliamentary consultation have already been taken up during the course of the following discussions.
I thank both rapporteurs for their interesting reports, and, in particular on the first initiative, Ms Esteves has carried out a very rigorous legal analysis of the German/French text.
She has identified the main problems as being the different sanctions available in the Member States and the problem of how to operate mutual recognition when one's own system has no precise equivalent.
The other problem she, as rapporteur, has highlighted is that of how to deal with a breach of non-custodial conditions, and of which Member State - the issuing Member State or the executing Member State - should be responsible for imposing the sanction for that breach.
Some comments on some main amendments. I have a comment on Amendment 1 on the first report.
The title will have to change on adoption, since conditional sentences have been removed from the scope.
This is also relevant to a number of different amendments which refer to conditional sentences.
Amendment 12 relates to the definition of 'lawful place of residence'.
This is currently under discussion in Council, as is the possibility of going to another Member State for work or study.
I refer, in particular, also to Amendment 16.
I can inform you that discussions of the text in Council are going very well, and the Portuguese Presidency hopes - with the full support of the Commission - for political agreement by the end of December 2007, before the end of the Portuguese Presidency.
On the second initiative, the initiative on the European Enforcement Order and transfer of sentenced persons, I welcome the second report by Mr Varvitsiotis, which states that issues raised by the European Parliament in the first report have largely been taken into consideration.
This is correct: we took into consideration amendments and proposals by Parliament.
Concerning the sole amendment suggested by the rapporteur concerning the new Recital 2a, I fully share the substance of the statement that procedural rights in criminal proceedings are a very crucial element for ensuring mutual confidence among Member States, and I also agree that it is highly regrettable that this instrument on procedural rights was not adopted, despite the support from Parliament and despite our efforts to make possible an agreement on procedural rights.
This, unfortunately, was not possible.
rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, I must firstly thank the Members who worked very closely with me on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and who helped me with their critical contributions, in particular Mr Guardans, Mr Demetriou and, last but definitely not least, Mr Correia.
We all greatly miss Mr Correia who was a Member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and a fellow Portuguese Member.
He died after having helped me with this report.
I think that the best tribute I can pay him is a kind of public promise that I will try, through my presence in the European Parliament, to help realise his ideas on Europe as a project of ambition and vision and as a giant capable of bringing its culture of rights to the world.
It is this tribute that I want to pay, here today, to our friend and colleague, Mr Fausto Correia.
I should like to briefly summarise the issues raised by this report.
I must firstly stress that this report, like all other reports, is an open report: open to seeking and finding the best solutions.
There are two fundamental benefits to this initiative by France and Germany, as underlined by the Commissioner.
The first is that, by encouraging the recognition and supervision of alternative measures to prison sentences, we are promoting a political culture which will make the courts more likely to apply these measures.
We are promoting the humanisation of criminal law in the Member States and the quality of European criminal law.
The second benefit concerns the fact that this initiative will help to make criminal law increasingly European in terms of being more harmonised and less feudalised within the European space.
In reality, European integration, which took a fundamental step forward in the recent Treaty on which agreement was reached in Lisbon last weekend, is at a level which criminal law in the European space has not yet been able to match.
It is essential that we increasingly promote a culture not just of mutual recognition, but also of harmonisation in criminal law in terms of the design of sentences, their method of enforcement, the relationship between offenders and society and even greater equivalence between the substantive and procedural criminal laws of Member States.
Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, by referring to a set of fundamental principles forming the common principles of the European Union, clearly shows that this only makes sense if we increasingly have European criminal laws.
Most of these principles are protected by criminal legislation.
Specifically on this report, I should like to make just two or three comments which I regard as fundamental.
Firstly, Parliament's contribution has particularly underlined the need for the distribution of powers between the issuing State and the executing State.
There is a clear logic to the State which exercises a given power applying its own laws thereto.
Secondly, there is the principle that refusal is the exception, so that the future framework decision can be as effective as possible.
Thirdly, there is the logic according to which it is impossible to adapt the nature of measures, otherwise the principle of strict penal legality will be called into question.
Finally, there is also a need to safeguard the principle of hearing defendants in cases involving the revocation of a suspended sentence or the imposition of a conditional sentence.
I will end, Madam President, by saying that all this progress in European criminal law will, despite everything, soon seem very limited to us.
Europe will only be achieved as a project when we can establish anthropocentric and cosmopolitan laws, which must include criminal laws that are more harmonised and less divided by borders.
rapporteur. - (EL) Madam President, I should like to begin by turning my thoughts respectfully to our late fellow Member, Mr Correia, who contributed substantially to the compilation of the correct and comprehensive report cited by the Vice-President of the Commission.
I should like to point out that the topic we are discussing today has a very long history.
It began in 1983with a Council of Europe convention, which was accepted by all the Member States.
However, the convention stipulated that a prisoner could be transferred from one country to another only with the prisoner's consent.
The convention was therefore ineffective.
A second convention was drawn up stipulating that the consent of the prisoner was not required, but this convention was not signed by all the Member States of the Council of Europe, and thus the attempt foundered.
On the new initiative of three EU Member States - Austria, Finland and Sweden - a draft was submitted, which was properly prepared by the Council and issued as a framework convention.
What does this framework decision provide?
It provides that a sentenced citizen of an EU Member State must be transferred to the Member State of which he is a national or in which he has his permanent residence or all his interests.
This is very reasonable because we can see that rehabilitating him will become much easier when he comes out of prison: someone transferred to the Member State of their nationality will have much easier access to the language, and their friends and relatives, and will be in a familiar environment.
This report, as you will recall, Madam President, was approved in June 2006 by a large majority in Parliament.
Unfortunately, it met with a bureaucratic response from Poland, which, by various procedural ploys, delayed the implementation of this framework decision.
We thus find ourselves in the midst of renewed deliberation.
Fortunately, with a concession to Poland's demands, the problem has finally been solved satisfactorily.
However, let me point out, Madam President, that if we think like this, talk of a united Europe is impossible.
We cannot speak of a European consensus when each Member State, for its own petty reasons, undermines such a sound measure.
In such cases, what sort of united Europe are we talking about?
I should like to underline that the Constitutional Treaty presented two days ago by the Prime Minister of Portugal fortunately provides for an augmented majority in this area, too, so the veto will finally be lifted.
To conclude, let me thank the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, for his contribution, and express the wish that, after 25 years, this well-conceived initiative will finally become a reality as soon as possible.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Madam President, freedom, security and justice are three words we keep hearing in the EU.
They are the three components of the Hague Programme that, in combination and individually, were invoked to serve all the Member States of the Union.
The principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments, which eight years ago, in 1999, was described by the European Council in Tampere as the cornerstone of judicial cooperation, is making no progress.
The few steps needed to implement this principle are being taken very slowly.
Mr Varvitsiotis has correctly identified and dealt with the root cause of the problem: the individual, nationalist positions held by various states.
The Council Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in criminal matters involving deprivation of liberty issued in other EU Member States is the subject of Mr Varvitsiotis' report.
The decision proves how slow and sporadic the action has been in creating an area of freedom, security and justice because this decision is only one of many measures that should have already been taken, and because it took such a long time to prepare.
In any case, we welcome the completion of the deliberation procedure and the adoption of a common position on the issue of recognising court judgments in criminal matters.
Mr Varvitsiotis deserves praise for his contribution to the favourable outcome of the proposal, which we have adopted and shall be voting in favour of.
The recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences, the subject of Mrs Esteves' report, is certainly another step among the many that must be taken to implement the principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments.
The Franco-German proposal seeks to reintegrate sentenced persons into society.
It proposes to allow them to serve, in their Member State of residence, suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences imposed by the courts of other Member States.
The rapporteur has done excellent work and I congratulate her.
However, I believe the definition given for 'lawful and ordinary residence' is incorrect.
Furthermore, the use of the word 'unacceptable' for violation of human rights is unnecessary, because there are no acceptable violations.
I understand, however, that there is a problem in the translation of these two terms, and I therefore call on Mrs Esteves to make the necessary verbal amendments so that the text can be rendered correctly in all languages.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the European Union is not simply a common economic area.
The European dimension must also be understood now in terms of intensive political and legal integration within the Union.
The Union is an example of a political organisation bringing together the interests of individual Member States within the framework of a developing cosmopolitan legal system.
A number of the criminal law provisions of Member States are still at an initial stage of harmonisation.
Nonetheless, we should rejoice at the fact that relations between Member States are characterised by trust in each other's legal systems.
This facilitates cooperation and makes it possible for the executing State to recognise a decision taken by authorities in the issuing State.
It should be noted that the humanisation of criminal law permeates through to the European legal system.
The latter is of course based on the value of the fundamental entity, namely the human being.
European policy should be consistent in every respect as regards handing down and enforcing sentences and the general links between convicted persons and society.
Making it easier to impose alternative punishments will help to promote a humanitarian approach to criminal law and sentencing, and consequently to European law.
Particular attention must be paid to the convicted person's right and opportunity to be reintegrated into society.
A wider range of alternative sentences replacing custodial sentences should be considered.
It is important to bear in mind that according to international standards the status of a convicted person is the basis for assessing the extent to which the judicial system of every political community may be deemed to be civilised.
Consequently, the framework decisions on enhanced cooperation in the area of criminal law presented today are worthy of support.
After all, the ongoing harmonisation of criminal law provisions across the Member States is a fundamental condition for the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice.
Madam President, I would like to focus on one aspect of what is being proposed.
It is evident that the raison d'Ãªtre for this particular legislation is a humanitarian basis.
If one looks at why a judgment given in one particular country can be enforced in another with regard to the criminal and penal sentences, one appreciates that, basically, what we are doing is making life for the person who has been convicted a better one: being closer, perhaps, to his family, being closer, perhaps, to his place of origin.
In fact I am surprised that, whilst we are taking this legislation from a humanitarian point of view, one of the criteria that is absent when it comes to transferring a person from serving a sentence in one particular state to another is, in my view, the humanitarian aspect.
We are basing the criteria, basically, on nationality, citizenship or legal permanent residence.
On the other hand, we do talk about, as a proposal and counterproposal, 'close links', but the humanitarian aspect as a criterion in itself is absent.
Let us take a particular case, for instance: it would not be possible for a person who is not a citizen of an EU country serving imprisonment in an EU country to serve closer to his homeland, because this aspect - the humanitarian criterion - has been left out.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Business registers for statistical purposes (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Mr Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common framework for business registers for statistical purposes and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2186/93 [07656/5/2007 - C6-0218/2007 -.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, fellow Members, it is now so late that I can count just four of us here, including myself.
However, one of the next speakers is a Quaestor who, I am sure, will use this opportunity to ensure that these forms of so-called debate, which in reality only take place for the purpose of the records, become more efficient and rational.
Nevertheless, I am grateful, Commissioner, for your willingness to come here and subject yourself to this.
To my mind, better governance, efficient and transparent governance, would be rather different from these debates at such an ungodly hour.
As to the matter in hand, we have come here to resume work on an issue which goes back some time.
It is a key area, namely statistics.
On the one hand, we have an entirely justified and necessary interest on the part of most persons involved in the political process, which is to inform themselves and to find out more quickly and in detail about linkages which may exist, especially in the corporate sector, and how they work, especially across borders: borders which, happily, we have already dismantled successfully between many countries throughout Europe.
We have thus taken up the Commission's proposal and taken it forward in response to this need, always being careful - through my numerous discussions at the time with my excellent colleague from the secretariat of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, from first reading onwards - not to create even more red tape, not to erect even more bureaucratic obstacles, and not to inflict even more form-filling on businesses in the Member States through the amendments and simplifications and, in some cases, more precise controls that this entails.
This goal has been achieved.
What has not been achieved is a situation in which the data available on the basis of the new directive is genuinely accessible to a wider interested public.
We could have done more to facilitate transparency.
Nonetheless, it was important for the House to achieve swift and clear results from first reading onwards.
Unfortunately, having achieved an appropriate consensus, and soon after its adoption here - I am not aware that there was even one vote against in the House - amendments were made in other areas of the legislature, with the result that the report, which we believed to have been dealt with conclusively, suddenly could no longer continue in its present form.
This has meant that at second reading, we have now had to make some minor changes consisting of just two words in three places.
Taking account of all that has happened, the question which arises, as I have said, is this: was that really necessary?
Would it not have been possible to inform us, through better coordination of the exchange of information on and during decision-making, so that we could have spared ourselves this whole evening debate, which is a debate in name only?
We could have dealt with it at first reading, if we had adopted the report a few weeks later.
The fact that we are sitting here at all is a classic example of how, in the European Union, it is often the minor detail which causes the hitches.
There is an urgent need to push through all the initiatives which aim to achieve better coordination of the minor details of the legislative processes which are then played out on a large scale in Europe.
This would then remove any future need for the type of debate which we are enduring now and would also save money, if we consider what it costs - from the first to the second reading, with all the preparations, all the interpreters and translations, and all these meetings at such a late hour - which would certainly be in the European Union's interests and improve its work on behalf of citizens.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I am very grateful to Parliament for this report, which should allow an agreement with the Council at second reading on the issue of statistical business registers, which is extremely relevant for the production of harmonised, complete and reliable statistics on business and other economic activities.
This new regulation will extend the business registers framework to cover the whole economy by including, on a mandatory basis, two sectors that are currently optional: agriculture and public administration.
But the most important innovation of this proposal is the extension to data on multinational enterprise groups active in the EU.
This is a key input in the context of economic globalisation.
Indeed, the informal European Council last week in Lisbon supported the approach proposed by the Commission to ensure that European policies are aimed at defending European citizens in a globalised economy.
To this end, it is crucial for policymakers and socioeconomic agents to have at their disposal accurate information on the activity of any kind of transnational companies operating here in Europe.
Concerning the alleviation of the burden of respondents to the surveys needed to produce statistics, the Commission, in the context of the overall drive towards better regulation, has paid particular attention to the simplification of the collection of statistics.
Business registers form an important building block in a number of projects aimed at reducing the statistical burden of businesses.
They are necessary for the efficient use of business-related data from different sources, such as a combined use of administrative data and targeted statistical surveys.
Of course, no new surveys are needed to fulfil the new requirements of the regulation, which can be implemented using nationally available additional administrative sources and feedback from existing surveys.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, let me say to the rapporteur - who has just complained that we are sitting here debating at an ungodly hour - that I was a Member of a national parliament for 20 years.
I do not know whether he has ever sat in a national parliament, but there, one becomes accustomed to holding night-time sessions, and for me, this is not an ungodly hour.
The rapporteur may well claim that the matter should have been dealt with more swiftly, but may I remind him that he himself took his time before declaring himself willing to produce this report.
(FR) Madam President, I would just like to say all the same that the current Regulation on business registers, which relates to the harmonisation of business registers used by Member States for statistical purposes, dates back to 1993 and is now partly obsolete.
The proposal for a regulation contains two major amendments in respect of the new data requirements that have been identified in this context.
All businesses engaging in economic activity contribute to GDP and their local units, as well as the corresponding legal units, will henceforth have to be registered on a compulsory basis.
Some business sectors are registered on an optional basis under the current version of the Regulation.
My second point is that financial links and enterprise groups should also be covered and data on multinational groups and their advisory units should be exchanged between the Member States and Eurostat.
As regards the recommendation for second reading of the report, we have been presented with two technical amendments that have been proposed by the legal service of the European Parliament.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has proposed, as I do myself, to follow the recommendations of the legal service, which quite rightly points out that the inclusion of the terms 'purpose' and 'scope' among the powers given to the Commission would allow the latter to modify the obligations of the Member States, the authorities and the central banks, as well as its own obligations.
These obligations are elements of the basic act; any modification of them in one direction or another could affect political choices made in the basic act and these modifications of the common position do not constitute an obstacle to an agreement at second reading, given that they reflect the results of agreements reached between the three main institutions, thereby allowing us to conclude this item of business at second reading.
I believe that is the important thing.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the extensive effort he has made in preparing this very complex technical document, as statistical matters are usually of little interest to the general public and hold little attraction for them.
That is why the discussion on this issue is taking place rather late.
I am very pleased that Mr Frattini is present, although statistical matters usually fall within Mr Almunia's sphere of competence.
However, we are talking about large databases, the use, security and management of which must be clearly defined.
I believe that Mr Almunia is well aware of all the problems we are experiencing with different databases, their use, security and the possibility of their being used for the wrong purpose.
The document recognises a number of points that would help to avoid similar problems.
There is one more thing that delights me: the document will bring about increased transparency in government administrative functions.
To my mind, this is very important; this sort of information should be accessible to the general public.
On the other hand, as a representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I cannot help worrying that we have recently been discussing a large number of documents relating to obtaining statistical data and including various activities in different registers.
Less and less thought is given to profit, the ratio between the profit and the cost of data collection.
As an economist, I do understand the importance of this data for defining economic policy, decision making - even in view of security it is important to be aware of the different aspects of multinational companies' activities within the EU, within the Member States.
As a representative of Lithuania, a border country, an EU border country, I understand it only too well.
Nevertheless, at the beginning of my tenure much has been said regarding the necessity of analysing how much it costs the trade and of making the relevant calculations.
Some Member States were prepared to do this.
For example, the Netherlands have actually done so.
Regretfully, this initiative has fizzled out.
I can only regret the fact that in this case the possibility of ascertaining the burden on business and the alleviation of this burden was not considered.
Various small European selection groups could have been developed and considered to be examples, while analysing the statistical basis for the whole of Europe.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, now that Mrs Lulling has addressed me directly, may I say that just because others are doing things badly, that should not be a role model for us.
The fact that debates are still being conducted at this hour or even later in the national parliaments does not improve the situation here.
It is a bitter experience, when one makes reform proposals, to find that others are constantly blocking them with reference to something else.
My second point is this: there was no delay, Mrs Lulling.
At most, there were misunderstandings.
The delay to which I have referred was the unfortunate coincidence of several matters having to be dealt with simultaneously.
As to my third point, I stand by my opinion.
I believe that, from a political and, indeed, a democratic perspective, it is not sensible to hold so-called debates at such a late hour, and I look forward to seeing the Commissioner again with our mutual friend Mr Staffler in the Hotel Laurin in Bolzano and conducting a dialogue there.
I think it is very likely that political progress will be made on that occasion rather than here, given that there are now just three of us plus the Commissioner - yes, let me repeat that, just three of us - engaging in pseudo-debates with each other at this ungodly hour.
(DE) Madam President, the rapporteur claims that he was not responsible for the delay.
He most certainly was!
He was also behind the to-do in committee, and I really do not need to say any more about that.
(FR) Madam President, I would like to say one more thing by pointing out that the explanatory statement drawn up by the rapporteur contains remarks that are completely off the subject and out of context with the theme being dealt with in this report.
The rapporteur's own personal views on ...
(The President asked the speaker to stand down)
You are the chairman of a working group.
I have to say that the rapporteur's personal views on the pensions paid to EU staff members have no place in an official document put out by this institution.
I would like to have this put on record.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

European Ombudsman's activities in 2006 (debate)
The next item is the report by Luciana Sbarbati, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2006.
We are pleased to welcome the Ombudsman this morning, and Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
Ombudsman. - Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for this opportunity to address Parliament on my Annual Report for 2006.
I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Sbarbati, and the Committee on Petitions, for their excellent report.
My report records progress in handling complaints, promoting good administration and providing knowledge about the Ombudsman's role.
I received 3 830 complaints in 2006. That means that the total number of complaints has stabilised at around the level reached following the 53% increase in 2004.
I am delighted to inform you that the proportion of complaints falling within the mandate has gone up.
This suggests that citizens are beginning to have a better knowledge both of my mandate and of that of my national and regional colleagues in the European Network of Ombudsmen, which is thus commensurately strengthened to the benefit of all concerned.
The total number of inquiries dealt with in 2006 was 586. Of these, 66% concerned the Commission.
Given that the Commission is the EU institution with which citizens have most reason to have material contact, it is normal that it should be the principal target of inquiries.
During 2006, 250 decisions closing inquiries were made.
In 95 cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration.
Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of a full explanation from the institution concerned.
Even when maladministration is not found, I may identify opportunities to improve the quality of administration provided by the institutions.
If so, I point them out in a further remark.
Many of my inquiries result in a win-win outcome that satisfies both the complainant and the institution complained against.
During 2006, 64 cases were settled by the institution concerned to the satisfaction of the complainant.
Whenever I find maladministration, I try to achieve a friendly solution, if possible.
Three friendly solutions were achieved in 2006 and a further 27 proposals for such a solution were under consideration by the institution concerned at the end of the year.
When a friendly solution is not possible, I close the case with a critical remark, or make a draft recommendation.
A critical remark is appropriate if it is no longer possible for the institution concerned to eliminate the instance of maladministration.
I wish to emphasise that the criticism is intended to be constructive, so as to help avoid similar maladministration in the future.
In 2006, I closed 41 inquiries in this way.
To better monitor the impact of my criticism and advice, I have this year launched a study of the follow-up to all critical remarks made in 2006, as well as to the 38 cases involving a further remark made during the same year.
The results of these studies should provide further encouragement to the institutions concerned to improve their practices and develop a culture of service to citizens.
In cases where it is still possible to eliminate the instance of maladministration, I normally make a draft recommendation to the institution, which must respond with a detailed opinion.
During 2006, 13 draft recommendations were made.
If an institution fails to respond satisfactorily to a draft recommendation, I may send a special report to the European Parliament.
Two special reports were made in 2006.
The first concerned the Council's responsibility for the choice of languages used in its Presidency websites.
The second called on the Commission to deal properly with an infringement complaint concerning sports betting services.
I am pleased to report that the Commission reacted promptly and positively to that report.
A new feature of the Annual Report which I wish to highlight, with an eye to supporting and encouraging good administration, concerns what I call 'star cases' of good practice by institutions, revealed through my inquiries.
I would now like to mention some other activities that I have undertaken during 2006 with a view to ensuring the best possible service to citizens.
Firstly, I signed a memorandum of understanding with the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).
Our agreement aims to ensure the consistent treatment of complaints that raise issues of data protection and to avoid unnecessary duplication.
The agreement allows me to benefit from the expertise of the EDPS by consulting him in cases where the text of the Data Protection Regulation and existing case-law leave room for divergent views.
This has already proved to be a useful mechanism for me when dealing with cases in which it is necessary to reconcile the legal right of access to documents with the right to privacy.
I also signed an agreement with the Spanish Government to enable citizens to complain to the European Ombudsman in any of the co-official languages in Spain.
I thus aligned my practice with the conclusions reached in June 2005 by the Council, which provide for the use of those languages to facilitate Spanish citizens' communication with the EU institutions.
Honourable Members, I am grateful for the support for the work of the European Ombudsman expressed in Ms Sbarbati's report, and I would like to inform Parliament that, as requested in her report, I am already engaged in preparing the ground for a memorandum of understanding with the European Investment Bank.
Given that the implementation of EU law is largely the responsibility of Member States' administrations, I will continue to develop cooperation through the European network of ombudsmen.
I am happy to inform you that the sixth meeting of the network took place last week in this very building.
At the conclusion of that successful meeting, we adopted by consensus a statement that aims to make the EU dimension of the work of national and regional ombudsmen better known, and to clarify the service they provide to people who complain about matters that fall within the scope of EU law.
The voluntary cooperation among ombudsmen that is now crystallised in the statement can, I believe, make an important and growing contribution to the European Union's ability to deliver concrete results, by ensuring that citizens can enjoy their rights as an everyday reality and that problems are solved in ways that are close to the citizen.
The European Ombudsman was established to help bring the Union closer to citizens and to give the EU administration a 'human face'.
A fundamental aspect of our institution is that the Ombudsman is an individual who communicates personally with citizens, who reviews their cases, and who seeks to resolve their problems and complaints.
Each one of these 'microcommunications' constitutes an opportunity to build trust between citizens and the institutions.
In pursuit of this goal, I will continue to promote a constructive dialogue with the institutions and to draw their attention to problems so that they can improve their performance.
The way in which a public administration reacts to complaints is a key measure of how citizen-focused it is.
While progress has been made in many areas, the year 2006 regrettably saw a rise in the proportion of cases which I had to close with a critical remark.
That should be cause for concern for anyone who wants better relations between the EU and its citizens.
Complaints offer an opportunity to put things right and to demonstrate that the institution concerned is serious about respecting the citizens' fundamental right to good administration.
I am not sure that citizens can easily reconcile the statements often made by institutions concerning their desire to get 'closer to the citizen', and for 'more openness', with the fact that the very same institutions frequently fail to take up the opportunities offered by the Ombudsman to improve relations and increase transparency.
I am positively encouraged, however, by a number of indications that, during the present year, 2007, there is a much greater willingness to take up the opportunities offered by my inquiries to resolve complaints.
Such cooperation is essential, because the Ombudsman cannot succeed alone.
Ensuring a top-class administration is a task that must be tackled in tandem with the EU institutions.
Delivering on promises, providing proper redress mechanisms, learning from mistakes, working openly and allowing for public scrutiny - these are the all-important 'means' towards building trust.
Equally, the European Ombudsman must work concertedly and systematically with national and regional colleagues to ensure that citizens' rights are fully respected throughout the Union.
Finally, the Ombudsman must continue to reach out to citizens so that they can become aware of his services.
With Parliament's support and guidance, I will continue to endeavour to build on existing achievements with a view to truly fulfilling my institutional mandate of bringing the Union closer to citizens and giving the EU administration a 'human face'.
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to thank the Ombudsman for his excellent work as is borne out by this particular report.
I should also like to thank the Legal Services of the Commission and all my parliamentary colleagues on the committee, especially the shadow rapporteur and Mr Mavrommatis, for their cooperation.
The culture of service to the citizen, which is primarily designed to ensure high-quality, transparent, approachable, swift and cooperative public administration, has been encouraged and strengthened at Community level by the combined efforts of the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman, and its first emergence can be traced back to the resolution of 6 September 2001, the date on which the European Parliament adopted the code of good administrative conduct proposed by the European Ombudsman.
Moreover, the Treaty of Maastricht produced a qualitative leap in European citizenship by offering all citizens the possibility of submitting petitions to a parliamentary body, which remains the sole arbitrator, or applying to a more specialised body which, while operating on an extrajudicial basis, follows a procedure which does not rule out parliamentary intervention in the event of the Community institution responsible for the instance of maladministration proving reluctant to cooperate.
I shall not talk about the statistics, as the Ombudsman has already talked about them and they are set out in the report.
Cases of maladministration currently relate to lack of transparency, refusal of information, abuse of power, legal error and failure to ensure fulfilment of Treaty obligations, in particular by the Commission.
The Ombudsman's decisions are not legally binding, but the safeguards that his work offers help to strengthen his powers of persuasion.
He enjoys the active support of the Committee on Petitions, whose meetings he attended on four occasions in 2006, and cooperates with the network of European Ombudsmen, which should be improved and extended.
Italy, for instance, does not as yet have a national Ombudsman.
It should be nevertheless be stressed that decisions with final effect should be reciprocally notified in real time in order to avoid conflicts of competence between the activities of the Ombudsman and those of the Committee on Petitions.
The report divides the decisions taken on completed inquiries in 2006 into various categories: lack of openness on the part of Community institutions and bodies (25% of inquiries), the role of the Commission as the guarantor of the Treaty in relation to procedures under Article 226, the management of contracts, remuneration and grants, and the recruitment and management of the staff of the Community institutions.
Procedures often end at the stage of critical remarks, which are a means of attempting to prevent the recurrence of cases of maladministration in future, in cases where it would be pointless to issue a recommendation.
Various examples have been given by the Ombudsman, and can be read at leisure in the report.
In that respect, the Committee on Petitions invites the Ombudsman to carry out a detailed study of the practical impact of critical remarks made during inquiries in 2006.
The fact that institutions have a code of good administrative conduct is often not enough to guarantee the creation of a genuine culture of service.
The report also shows that there are still some grey areas in relation to the Commission making wrong use of its discretionary powers by failing to take prompt action before legal proceedings were begun, using political considerations as a pretext.
With regard to contracts and staff management, some of the investigations launched by the Ombudsman on his own initiative show how his powers provide an effective means of goading the administrative authorities into self-regulation, a sound principle that needs to be put to increasing use.
In the view of the Committee on Petitions, however, the lack of synchronicity in timing and views with regard to the handling of the same case by the Ombudsman and Parliament needs to be avoided through ongoing and constructive dialogue.
The Committee on Petitions has also issued a special invitation to the Ombudsman to investigate the systems used by EPSO, again with a view to protecting the rights of candidates, especially young candidates, in the European Parliament's competition procedures, and to investigate alleged discrimination reported at the European School in Brussels.
In this year's report, Madam President, the focus is on the Ombudsman's role as a key actor in the Union's democratic life.
He is a vital intermediary for citizens in their dealings with public authorities.
His effective activities highlight the distinction between good and bad administration, offering guidance on recognising mistakes, and seeking satisfactory solutions for complainants, likely to transform bad conduct into good.
To this end, it would be valuable if the Ombudsman were to draw up a list of best administrative practices, including not just exemplary cases, but less creditable ones as well.
One of the cardinal principles that always has to be stressed is the democratic equality of all Europe's citizens, without any distinction or discrimination on the grounds of nationality or language; something on which the Ombudsman can rely in his continuing efforts to scrutinise and protect linguistic equality.
The Committee on Petitions is in favour of speeding up procedures to ensure that the Ombudsman's annual report is considered more quickly, and it is also in favour of amending the Statute, provided that the amendments simply involve a qualitative expansion of the Ombudsman's powers, without affecting the nature of his competences or the non-binding effect of all his decisions.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission should 'take a leading role in promoting a service culture'.
When the Ombudsman said this in the introduction to his Annual Report, I could not agree more.
The European Union needs to be closer to its citizens, to explain better, to listen better and to deliver good policies.
To have a top-quality public administration is a necessary condition for that.
To have a well-equipped watchdog to monitor our progress is equally important to our common success.
The Ombudsman acts as an external control mechanism for sound and accountable administration on the part of the European Union institutions and bodies.
I therefore very much welcome the Ombudsman's Annual Report for 2006, and I want to stress that the relations between the Commission and the Ombudsman are very positive.
For example, the number of open enquiries addressed to the Commission decreased by 20% in 2006 in relation to 2005 and 2004, and we more frequently acknowledge our mistakes and apologise.
We seek satisfactory solutions for complainants, just as we follow up the critical remarks and the draft recommendations of the Ombudsman.
I also welcome Ms Sbarbati's very important report and the constructive proposals in it.
Just as I agree with the Ombudsman's call for a service culture, I agree with Ms Sbarbati's call for the necessary budgetary and human resources.
We are judged by our deeds and not by our words, so we need to really ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses, as Ms Sbarbati says in her report.
Let me briefly comment on a few particular points in the report.
First, the Commission welcomes the Ombudsman's initiative to draw up a list of 'star' cases exemplifying best practices.
We also welcome this initiative to prepare a study on the follow-up given by the Commission and other institutions and bodies to the critical comments and further remarks of the Ombudsman.
I hope this can contribute to improving practices to the benefit of citizens.
Secondly, regarding the alleged overlaps between the activities and powers of the Committee on Petitions and those of the Ombudsman, the Commission reiterates its willingness to work with those two bodies within the framework of their respective remit, and the definition of that remit does not fall within the Commission's competence.
Thirdly, Parliament has requested the Commission make proper use of its discretionary powers under Article 226 relating to infringement procedures.
Of course, we should avoid delays or failure to take action, and that is why the Commission recently adopted a communication on the implementation of Community law, and we laid down more targeted preventive measures, improved information provision and problem solving.
In short, this was the Commission's new commitment: to seek a more efficient management of infringement cases and increased transparency.
Concerning Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to documents, as you know, the review of this Regulation is under way, and the Ombudsman's contribution to the consultation has been very much welcomed.
Only a few weeks ago we had a meeting with the Interinstitutional Committee on public access to documents which was chaired by Vice-President Wallis, and I want to thank her for taking this matter about public access to documents forward in a very constructive way.
My penultimate point concerns the Ombudsman's Statute.
It is being dealt with in a separate context but, as it is mentioned in the report, I just want to assure you that the Commission closely monitors the developments, and that contacts are under way between the Commission and the Ombudsman at different hierarchical levels.
I want this issue to progress in a spirit of close cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
Lastly, concerning the Ombudsman's communication strategy and the European network of Ombudsmen, we need to share experiences and administrative practices.
We need to raise public awareness and to bring citizens closer to the EU.
The Ombudsman has a very important stake in this, and so does the European Parliament and the Committee on Petitions.
This is important to me and the whole Commission, and you can be sure that we will do our absolute best to cooperate and find good, forward-looking solutions.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all thank and congratulate Mrs Sbarbati, the rapporteur on the annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2006.
I would also like to thank the secretariat of our committee for its assistance in drawing up Mrs Sbarbati's report, and also the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, for promptly submitting his annual report for 2006 and for his subsequent cooperation with the Committee on Petitions.
The Ombudsman is an independent institution and a control mechanism for the administration of the EU.
However, despite all the action taken by Mr Diamandouros to inform the public, confusion still reigns over the European Ombudsman's areas of jurisdiction.
We must therefore continue to try and inform the public, with appropriate financial support from the EU.
For this reason we, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, have again tabled a relevant amendment, which calls for ever greater participation by the media in publicising the work of the European Ombudsman.
As shadow rapporteur, I have tried to contribute to the report on the European Ombudsman's activities, with amendments that I have tabled and supported.
It was essentially through the adoption of these amendments that we saw progress in the following areas of the European Ombudsman's activity:
Firstly, the European Ombudsman was called upon to continue with his investigation of third-pillar issues.
Secondly, reports concerning the European Ombudsman must be translated promptly into all official EU languages, particularly in the case of the European Ombudsman's annual report.
Thirdly, the European Ombudsman must maintain good relations with the members of the Committee on Petitions and cooperate with them in order to achieve the desired results.
Lastly, the European Network of Ombudsmen is called upon to expand and include within its membership specialised ombudsmen such as those dealing with minors' rights, family problems, the protection of personal data and prisoners' or patients' rights.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Diamandouros and Ms WallstrÃ¶m for their presentations and Ms Sbarbati for her excellent report.
The Lisbon Treaty just agreed opens the door to the European Union's exit from a long-standing phase whereby its ability to function effectively on behalf of its citizens has been held back.
We have a long-needed institutional system that works more effectively, but it also opens the door to so much more.
I welcome the solemn proclamation of the Charter of the Presidents of the Institutions that will be made on 12 December.
The inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as part of the legal order in the European Union will allow for the Union to begin to work on more effective, transparent and democratic foundations.
European citizens expect, and will continue to expect, that the Union's institutions will act in accordance with its basic principles: with the Charter, and with efficiency, effectiveness and openness.
The European Ombudsman is one vital part of the democratic structure and functioning of the Union.
The largest proportion of the Ombudsman's enquiries concern lack of transparency. This is an area of our activities that we must improve if we are to become more credible in the eyes of the citizens.
I am delighted with the work of the Ombudsman, as explained in his annual report and in his speech.
He took a number of important decisions during 2006, including, not least, on the choice of the languages used in the websites of the European Presidencies of the Council, on inaccurate and misleading information contained in leaflets, posters and video presentations on air passenger rights produced by the Commission, and on access to the audit report of the European Investment Bank.
It is important that we support the work of the Ombudsman, as well as the work of the Committee on Petitions, as it is through handling complaints and petitions on EU matters from citizens that we can find out what is not working well at European level and take corrective measures.
Cases being brought to the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are of increasing complexity and therefore require a greater investment of resources by the institutions, in order that the citizens' concerns are properly addressed.
In this context I would like to remind Members of Paragraph 2 of Ms Sbarbati's report: 'Calls for all European institutions and bodies to be given the necessary budgetary and human resources to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and petitions'.
There will be no better way of putting the Charter of Fundamental Rights into practice than taking this on board, and I call on all the institutions and bodies to give priority to the interests of the citizens in this respect.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission Margot WallstrÃ¶m, Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, to start with I wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work.
Over the years the role of the European Ombudsman has become ever more important for the citizens of the European Union.
Once the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union enters into force, that role will become even more important.
This means that in the future we have to be even more careful to ensure that the Ombudsman has sufficient resources and that the code of practice under which he operates is relevant to the current climate.
Commissioner Margot WallstrÃ¶m stressed the need for transparency.
I would hope that now that the code of practice under which the European Ombudsman operates is changing, the Commissioner's words, increased transparency and promoting the idea that the necessary information is available from the Commission, will come true, because only deeds matter, not words.
The Ombudsman's annual report and its summarised version are a splendid example of how our work should be presented to the public.
The report is clear, succinct and to the point.
Transparency is the key to European democracy and its principal construction material.
Under Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union.
That is saying a lot, and it places an obligation on all the European Union institutions and obviously on the Ombudsman's office too.
Consequently, I would like to stress the importance of ensuring there are adequate resources of the relevant kind in place, so that people do not have to wait years and years for decisions on matters that affect them, because waiting for decisions is a tiresome business.
Finally, I would like to thank the Ombudsman for the work he does, and I wish him every success in this very challenging role.
It is not always appreciated sufficiently, as fundamental rights are implemented more successfully among the elite than among ordinary people.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Sbarbati for her work and to express my appreciation for the achievements of the European Ombudsman, Professor Nikiforos Diamandouros.
I am expressing the views of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group as well as those of Mr Marcin Libicki, the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, who was unable to attend today's sitting and asked me to speak on his behalf.
Hominum causa omne ius constitutum sit - every law should be applied from the point of view of human beings.
This Roman principle can be seen in the work of the Ombudsman, who, working within his area of competence, tries to comply with the fundamental principle that everyone has the right to have their case heard in an impartial and just manner by EU bodies and institutions.
It can be seen from an analysis of the report that only about 25% of the complaints submitted fall within the scope of competence of the Ombudsman.
Is it that our citizens do not know the law?
Perhaps, to some extent, this is the case.
However, I think that it is something different, that they treat the institution of the ombudsman as a last resort, when they are unable to find appropriate help in their own countries.
The scope and quantity of applications submitted to the Committee on Petitions would indicate something similar.
If the feeling that one is being treated in an unjust, sluggish, incompetent or bureaucratic way continues to grow, the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour will just become a collection of aspirations, and not everyday practice.
Professor, may you, as the Ombudsman, be an effective guardian of the interests of the Community's citizens, and may Parliament, the Council and the Commission, as well as national parliaments and national ombudsmen, assist you in this work.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Madam President, I am not going to repeat all of the good things that have been said, apart from to thank both our Ombudsman and Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
In addition, I would like to say something that must be underlined.
I am a relatively new member of the Committee on Citizens' Complaints, as it would be better to call it.
I have, to my consternation, discovered through being out in society that it is virtually only active citizens who are monitoring whether EU legislation is being respected in many places.
The institutions are not doing this, and neither are the Member States.
Therefore, if citizens do not do it, the whole thing will fall apart.
Therefore, citizens are not only the victims of individual cases; they are indeed also active fellow players who are working to ensure that the EU's extremely transparent system is both understandable and close to citizens.
We should also be clear that it is a perpetual battle even if we equip our instruments, i.e. the Ombudsman and the Committee on Citizens' Complaints, with the correct tools.
An attack is currently taking place on the Swedish system of openness and access to documents.
We must not believe that this is a battle that we can win once and for all.
We must persist and continue to persist and we will not win the battle at any point.
We will win it only if we continue to have very strong tools.
Let me stress that I am very pleased with Mrs Sbarbati's report.
However, I would like to highlight the amendments that we have fortunately been able to incorporate into the report thanks to considerable support.
Firstly, it is now possible for Parliament to take the Ombudsman's cases to court if the institutions do not respect the Ombudsman.
It is absolutely crucial that this can be done in reality and is not simply something that we can boast about around the world.
We have the institution of the Ombudsman, we have a Committee on Citizens' Complaints, and yet this does not mean anything other than words and yet more words.
This matter is therefore of enormous significance.
The second aspect concerns the European Investment Bank.
On many occasions the bank has not been as 'nice' as it should be.
On many occasions it has acted as if it were assisting the major industries, and it is absolutely crucial that the citizens who should benefit from the bank's activities in countries outside Europe have the opportunity to bring matters before the Ombudsman.
It is really quite shocking that they are refused on the grounds that they are not EU citizens and are not able to have their say.
They have been treated in a patronising and arrogant way, and I am therefore also very glad that it has now been highlighted in this report that these citizens will naturally have access to appeal to the Ombudsman.
Finally, let me say that it is important to emphasise that the Ombudsman also has competence within intergovernmental areas under the third pillar.
Overall, we are taking a big step forward with this report, and I very much hope that the bodies of both the Commission and Parliament will take it seriously.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, today's discussion and the excellent work carried out by the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, over the past four and a half years, as well as Mrs Sbarbati's excellent report, all provide an opportunity for the European Parliament and the Commission to take stock of how the public views the institutions of the EU.
A large section of the public is calling for greater transparency and exemplary administration, which are too little in evidence.
I note some worrying signs in Mr Diamandouros's report.
Fewer cases have been resolved by friendly settlement.
There has been a decline in the number of cases where the Commission (I see that the Vice-President is not listening) has complied with the recommendations of the European Ombusdman.
Congratulating the European Ombudsman, Madam President, is not enough; we must listen to his recommendations.
Mr Diamandouros is quite rightly requesting an extension of his powers to cover third-pillar issues, thus providing for greater transparency and control.
He is asking for a change to the European Ombudsman's Statute so that his work can become more effective.
I believe he has the support of the European Parliament, but he must also have that of the Commission, and not just in word, but also in deed.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we read in Mrs Sbarbati's report that, according to the 2006 statistics, over 90% of the 3 800 or so complaints come from individual citizens, which is a very interesting fact.
Mrs Sbarbati also tells us that the majority of complaints come from the larger Member States, with larger populations, but goes on to say that the figure changes if the ratio between population and number of complaints is considered, when Luxembourg and the new accession countries Malta, Cyprus and Slovenia take the lead with the largest number of complaints.
This reflects, in my view, the fact that issues of a European nature and of European competence and legislation are the main concerns of the Ombudsman's day-to-day work.
In my opinion, it is interesting to note, however, that it would be more useful to have functioning Ombudsmen in those countries and in particular in Italy than to have a European Ombudsman.
I think I remember reading that in the 95% of cases examined, the majority do not fall within the mandate of the European Ombudsman, as the complaints are not made against a Community institution or body.
Cases of maladministration relate to lack of transparency, unfairness, abuse of power, legal error and so on. There are no data on administrative inefficiency and injustice in my country, and I am sure that if such data existed and were brought to the attention of the European Ombudsman, Italy would be well in the lead, especially the left-wing administrations of my country.
It is not surprising that the wrong use of the discretionary powers of the Commission is well in the lead in the ranking, and I would therefore exhort the European Ombudsman to scrutinise relations between citizens, the Council, the Commission and Parliament more thoroughly.
I also agree that the Ombudsman's scope of investigation should be extended to cover the protection of minors, family problems, the protection of personal data and prisoners' rights, and for that reason I support the Mavrommatis amendment.
However, I do not support, Mrs Sbarbati and Mr Mavrommatis, the exhortation to conduct inquiries under the so-called third pillar.
That is wrong, and I do not agree.
I would, however, congratulate Mrs Sbarbati on her productive work with the European Ombudsman.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and, through her, my colleague, Mr Mavrommatis, but, of course, especially the Ombudsman himself on another successful year.
Three hundred or so complaints a month is a huge workload and equates both to rising interest in the system but also to rising concern at aspects of EU maladministration.
Whilst many cases are dealt with by cooperation, the Ombudsman refers to the increase in critical comment that he is forced to make.
This must improve, or Parliament will have to find ways of compelling the Commission to be helpful and responsive and, equally, to act upon the conclusions produced by the Ombudsman.
He makes telling comments. I want to pick out one: 'I am not sure that the citizen can easily reconcile the statements often made by the institutions that they want to get "closer to the citizenâ with the fact that the very same institutions frequently fail to take up the opportunities offered by the Ombudsman to improve relations.'
The services of the Ombudsman should, and do, work hand in hand with the Committee on Petitions, but the Commission must develop a culture of service rather than the avoidance of problems, and Ministers and permanent representatives must understand the vital importance of responding positively to grievances from constituents and citizens, voiced either through the Ombudsman or the Petitions Committee.
Finally, may I make a brief reference to an outstanding special report by the Ombudsman, namely that relating to a complaint against OLAF.
As the Petitions Committee rapporteur for this issue, I give notice now that, the judicial process having been completed on this case, I will not allow the issue of the special report to be swept under the carpet.
It will be reconsidered as soon as is practically possible.
May I conclude with thanks, again, not only to you, Madam President, for delighting us with your presence, but also to the Ombudsman and the Commissioner for being here as well.
(EL) Madam President, it seems we have really begun to understand how important it is that European citizens should feel close to the Union through democratic and especially transparent institutions.
The European Ombudsman is the institution par excellence for receiving citizens' complaints.
It is also the one most obviously able to make citizens feel that the Union is dealing with and responding to their problems.
It shows that progress is being made in acknowledging and correcting administrative errors.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the thinking behind her report.
She correctly brings out the Ombudsman's key role in the EU's democratic character.
However, I am worried that although there have been fewer instances of maladministration, the Ombudsman's critical remarks, in those cases where a friendly settlement was reached, did not meet with a satisfactory rate of acceptance by the institutional bodies.
The rapporteur is right, then, to remind us of Parliament's right of recourse to the Court, although, of course, one would prefer not to use this right.
However, all of us here today should understand that we ourselves are the institutions - and the corollary of this is that the reliability of the institutions depends on our own attitude.
I also agree entirely with the rapporteur's view of a balanced but at the same time energetic way of performing one's duties.
The Ombudsman is not, cannot and should not simply be a display of democracy for the EU.
We must acknowledge this, make it our joint decision, and above all, we must assume our responsibilities.
In other words, we must be bold in our decisions, but above all more transparent in what is essentially our concern.
Madam President, the most important aspect of the existence of the EU and its institutions is to uphold the fundamental principles of justice, democracy and respect for human rights, especially with reference to the citizens of Europe.
Our Union would have no raison d'Ãªtre or functional purpose if it did not have as its main objective to offer a fair, comprehensive and efficient service to the people of Europe.
The European citizen was, is, and always will be, the centre of our efforts as a functioning Union.
It is mainly for this reason that the activities of the Ombudsman are of such paramount importance.
This is because the Ombudsman is the friend and guardian of the European citizen and is the facility through which Community institutions and bodies can be held to account over whether they have served the citizen properly and whether they are guilty of maladministration or bad practice.
We welcome the 2006 Annual Report from Mr Diamandouros and congratulate and thank him for the very good work he and his staff have performed in upholding the rights of European citizens.
At the same time, we congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Sbarbati, on her excellent report, which contains many important points and suggestions.
I find most interesting, for example, the suggestion made in paragraph 12, which in effect encourages the Ombudsman to draw up and publish annually a list of shame and a roll of honour for the EU's administrative services.
May I point out that the proper functioning of the Ombudsman may inevitably, in rare instances, lead him to be disliked by certain services.
In such cases, the Ombudsman deserves - and must be reassured of - our full support.
Lastly, may I commend the active support and cooperation the Committee on Petitions has shown the Ombudsman in the performance of his duties.
The work of both those entities is very often interlinked, and their smooth cooperation is to be much appreciated and praised.
(PL) Madam President, I represent Poland, a country that is in fifth position, statistically, as regards the number of complaints submitted to the European Ombudsman.
Every 16th complaint submitted to the Ombudsman comes from my country.
Every 20th complaint, almost, is written in Polish.
Obviously I am speaking of absolute numbers, because, per inhabitant, the citizens of Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus are much more active in submitting complaints than my own countrymen.
It is worth emphasising that last year the European Ombudsman received fewer complaints than in 2005.
Just over 200 complaints came from companies and associations, and 18 times more than that came from individuals.
It could be said that the functioning of the European Ombudsman provides the best indicator of computer use in the European Union.
Twelve out of 20 complaints are submitted electronically.
On the minus side, an indicator of the lack of knowledge of EU citizens is the fact that almost four out of five complaints do not fall within the scope of responsibilities of the European Ombudsman.
This shows that this institution is treated as a receptacle for all maladies, even those that do not relate to EU institutions, which, by definition, is what the European Ombudsman is supposed to monitor.
