Mr President, Commissioner, Madam Minister, nothing has been said in this debate which I cannot support.
Nonetheless, I would like to raise three points which, in my view, should be emphasised to a far greater extent.
Firstly, in the long term, we cannot expect other states to adopt security policies which are different from those we practise ourselves.
If we do not want proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in this area, for example, a clearer signal must be sent out by the European Union and its partners.
Secondly, there has obviously been a paradigm shift and a change in strategy in the USA on the verification issue compared with the 1980s.
In view of the urgency of these issues in the wake of 11 September, the European Union's diplomatic restraint, which I have often understood, is inappropriate, and I hope that the USA's unilateralism, which has just been mentioned, will be overcome on the basis of their own experience.
The third problem is the most crucial.
It is wrong to point to the USA alone.
This paradigm shift has obviously taken place here in Western Europe as well.
If I look at the model under discussion for the Biological Weapons Convention as well, namely the monitoring organisation for chemical weapons, there is currently a financial crisis in which EU Member States also play a role.
We have witnessed deterioration in the monitoring provisions since the Convention was first adopted.
Perhaps this is symptomatic, Madam Minister: in May this year, I asked the Council for its comments on these issues.
I have still not received a response, and I suspect that we, too, are approaching this issue with insufficient vigour.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wish to answer the questions asked by Mr Morillon, Mr Swoboda and Mr Dunn on the issue of whether an Agency should or should not exist.
In the context of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, there was clearly never any question of discussing an Agency.
The Union' s position was to propose a mechanism for pursuing dialogue beyond the Review Conference in the form of either annual meetings of the signatories as is done for the Convention on Chemical Weapons, or of meetings of experts, in other words, continuing the former ad hoc group as was explained in the current state of discussions on this Convention.
Nevertheless, I should like to tell you that, at the Ghent Summit and, of course, at the request of the presidency of the European Union, the Commission has undertaken work on examining this issue in all its aspects and, therefore, on listing laboratories, in an attempt to see what type of response we can provide. At the Commission meeting yesterday, a joint briefing sheet was issued by Mr Byrne, the Commissioner responsible for Health and Consumer protection, to Mr Liikanen and myself, to see how we can implement, at European Union level, in agreement, of course with the Member States, closer coordination in order to achieve our objectives, without necessarily creating an Agency.
This is, broadly speaking, the way things are heading.
In this regard, I would say that in the field of research itself, and, therefore, of the potential for knowledge in this area, we are planning a meeting dedicated to this issue, on 13 December, in Brussels, of all experts from the Member States.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Shipbuilding (continuation)
The next item is the follow-up to the debate on the report (A5-0373/2001) by Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning a temporary defensive mechanism for shipbuilding [COM(2001)401 - C5-0393/2001 - 2001/0153(CNS)].
Mr President, after congratulating the rapporteur, I would like to begin by stressing that the ship-building industry throughout Europe is facing a serious crisis which could affect the very credibility of the European Union and perhaps endanger the continued existence of this sector in the Union, given the unfair competition on the part of South Korea.
Furthermore, it could represent an invitation or a stimulus to the Koreans to extend their unfair practices to other sectors of economic activity such as automobiles, electronics and steel.
Of course, this invitation may not only extend to Korea itself but also to other countries, principally in that region.
Transparency suggests a challenge: free competition in a free market.
But a free market means the same laws for all, and given that this does not exist at the moment, our transparency in a world and at a time when we do not have the other elements necessary for the existence of that free market, as well as naivety, may result in a clear risk of disaster and also a lack of solidarity from the European Union towards the Member States and the cities of those States.
This is the case with a city such as mine, Vigo, in the North East of Spain, where companies and families have made an enormous effort and a difficult sacrifice in order to be competitive.
Solidarity therefore demands measures in defence of a sector which is also strategic for Europe; measures which impose the extension of the scope of the defensive support mechanism to all categories of ship built by the Korean shipyards and which also impose an extension of the period the defensive mechanism is in force until 31 December 2003, which is also the period in force of Regulation (EC) 1540/98 or, alternatively, until the WTO procedure against Korea is concluded.
Mr President, our future, the future of our States and the citizens of Europe are at stake.
Twenty years on will be too late.
I believe that solidarity demands, and leads us to hope, that the Commission and the Council will act in the way I have mentioned.
These are the reasons given by the companies and workers in the sector in the parts of Europe where shipbuilding is important.
Mr President, those of you who know me will be aware that I do not usually speak in favour of public aid which distorts competition.
That does not mean that I do not recognise that some of this public aid makes sense and must continue if it contributes to the objectives laid down in the Treaty.
Despite this, and precisely because this is one of those cases, I would like to express my total support for the Commission' s proposal and the amendments presented by the competent committees, which propose a defensive and temporary mechanism in the ship-building sector in order to confront the unfair practices of South Korea.
In this section, there is no room for solutions such as that proposed by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which, by taking an extremely orthodox position in opposition to public aid, would have disastrous consequences for the European shipbuilding sector.
There is absolutely no doubt that the Republic of Korea is practising dumping in the sector, and for this reason the European industry cannot compete.
It is true that the Commission has begun proceedings before the World Trade Organisation to combat this unfair competition, but it is also the case that, while this procedure is under way, the European ship-building industry could disappear, with significant repercussions for employment.
We must bear in mind that there are two elements to this aid which make it worthy of support: firstly, it is transitional, it will only be granted until the WTO resolves the dispute in question, and secondly, it is defensive, it is a response to aggressive unfair competition by the Republic of Korea, and for these reasons it is perfectly acceptable.
Furthermore, the amendments approved by the competent committee are acceptable, since they include certain types of ship which are also affected by these unfair practices on the part of Korea.
The rapporteur has been informed of the existence of a possible legal report by the services of the Council which opposes these measures proposed by the Commission.
While we do not know what these legal arguments are, we must be content with the legal reports of both the European Parliament and the Commission, which speak of the suitability of the aid as proposed by the Commission, which is neither substantially distorted nor modified by the proposals which have been approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would protest about the fact that the Council is not represented here today in order to provide us with the legal evaluation we requested.
It is unacceptable that we, as a Parliament, do not have access to the same information as the Council.
It is unacceptable discrimination between the two institutions.
I should like to have seen us in Parliament postponing the debate on the proposal until we had received the Council' s legal evaluation.
Unfortunately, that is not what the big two political groups wanted.
The usual demand for transparency is transparently not so important when money is at stake and national interests to be looked after.
I have, however, received an answer from the Commission regarding the regulation' s compliance with the WTO rules.
The Commission sees no problems.
There, I disagree.
The Commission says that the regulation will not have any negative effect on third countries.
That is incorrect.
In future, a Japanese shipyard, for example, will compete with European shipyards that receive State aid.
In that way, the regulation will have a negative effect on third countries, for example Japan.
The Commission also says that the proposed regulation cannot be regarded as biased action by the EU against South Korea, something that would be contrary to the WTO regulations.
The regulation states quite specifically that European shipyards can only receive State aid if they are in direct competition with Korean shipyards.
Korea is mentioned specifically, then.
A more biased course of action cannot be imagined.
With this proposal, we, in the EU, are doing something that is downright illegal.
I urge that what was adopted in Parliament' s committee be rejected, just as I should ideally like to see the Commission withdraw its proposal and instead concentrate on taking WTO proceedings against the Koreans.
What is the Commission trying to do with all these amendments to extend the period of the regulation and to increase the number of types of ship that are eligible for aid?
Will the Commission confirm that it will on no account comply with Parliament' s requests today?
Will the Commission confirm or deny that it has plans to table an altered proposal that includes LNG tankers?
I very much hope that the Commission will answer these questions.
Mr President, for years European shipyards have been condemning the dumping practised by South Korea in relation to the sales prices of the ships built there.
Finally, and after so many complaints about it, the Commission has presented an initiative, with the acquiescence of the Council, and has proposed certain provisional measures to us, which consist of a temporary defence mechanism, specifically designed to counteract Korea' s unfair practices, putting a complaint procedure before the World Trade Organisation.
Nevertheless, the Commission, in its proposed aid to ship building, only includes container ships and oil tankers.
We believe that it should also include special ships for the transportation of gases derived from oil and liquefied natural gas, as well as ferries, bulk carriers and roll-on roll-off car ferries, all of which are included in the complaints presented to the WTO.
It is time that Korea realised that the Union is determined to defend its shipbuilding industry in the face of unfair practices by any other country.
Mr President, this Commission proposal has arisen following the problems resulting from the liberalisation agreements it agreed to negotiate within the OECD while at the same time it limited State aid to the shipbuilding industry, promoted the concentration of shipyards and later removed operating aid.
Now that there are serious problems in the industry, which is of strategic importance to the European Union, particularly to ensure the security of supply on appropriate terms and to prevent excessive dependence on external sources, it has become necessary to support the European shipbuilding industry against unfair practices by Korea.
Although the Commission proposal is important for the moment, it is only temporary and partial, and in the end, is on the same level as Korean unfair practices.
In any event, it is important that the proposals that the rapporteur has made should at least be taken into account, including the extension of the expiry date of this 6% operating aid, in special cases up to a limit of 14%, and also the enlargement of its scope to other vessels. We therefore back this report in order to prevent the short-term aggravation of the economic and social problems that already exist in this area.
Mr President, tomorrow never comes now that the European Commission has proposed to subsidise shipbuilding again.
It was made clear in the past that the subsidies for the shipbuilding industry would be discontinued in mid-2001.
The re-introduction of a temporary subsidy scheme goes against the agreements made and is unacceptable.
The granting of subsidies to the shipbuilding industry is both unnecessary and undesirable.
It is unnecessary because shipbuilding in Europe focuses on the construction of technologically advanced ships and not on the simple conveyer-belt production as is the case in low-wage countries.
It therefore offers not a single solution to the problems in the industry.
The granting of aid is undesirable because financially unhealthy companies remain in production thanks to subsidies, and efficient production is impossible as a result.
The industry does not benefit from non-generic support.
Structural solutions to the problems European shipbuilding is facing lie in healthy competition and structural reforms.
The Commission proposal, however, will undermine these prospects for a long time.
The internal market will be disrupted since the Member States will step in to implement the Regulation, and non-generic support will lead to unfair competition.
With this proposal, Europe places itself in an untenable position.
Lodging a complaint at the WTO is absurd if the Commission adheres to temporary support measures as suggested.
We therefore share the overwhelming concern expressed by the original rapporteur, Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, with regard to this proposal.
In fact, I cannot imagine that the duty Commissioner Bolkestein would think any differently about this.
Mr President, colleagues, honourable Member of the Commission, the European Union and South Korea have been conducting so far fruitless negotiations in order to bring about sound competition into the world shipbuilding market.
The Commission has now approved a strategy, according to which the matter will be taken to the WTO dispute settlement procedure.
I support this decision and would like to thank all those Members of the Commission who actively contributed to this decision.
At the same time, however, the Commission issued a proposal to the effect that operating aid could be allowed to individual shipyards temporarily during the WTO procedure.
According to the Commission proposal for a regulation, any arrangements for subsidies would be exceptional and temporary measures and would concern a limited number of ship types only.
At first glance the Commission proposal may seem justified, but in reality it distorts competition both in the world market and even within the EU and lacks any valid legitimate reason.
The link between the subsidy mechanism and the WTO procedure is totally artificial.
These matters have no natural connection and therefore these questions should be dealt with separately.
All of us who are involved in politics understand this: this is politics, not a legal process.
If we want to lean on the WTO, we ourselves must act according to the rules set by the WTO.
By allocating subsidies, the EU itself is guilty of distorting actions of which it is now accusing Korea.
This will bring discredit on us and will weaken our negotiation position within the WTO.
I said that the Commission proposal distorts competition also inside the EU.
Even if only certain ship types would receive subsidies, the subsidised shipyards would always benefit from subsidy monies and would therefore have an advantage over other shipyards.
In particular this will impede the position of the high technology shipbuilding industry, which for very good reasons has responded to fiercening competition by concentrating especially on products representing more demanding technology.
Among others my home country Finland has from the very beginning, as agreed, reduced shipyard subsidies, and we have invested strongly in the building of cruise ships and other high technology vessels.
Consequently, through these actions Finnish shipyards have achieved world-wide competitiveness, which the Commission is now trying to take away from us.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to express my satisfaction at the way in which Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen' s report has been very fruitfully amended in committee, which will enable us to establish a defensive mechanism for our shipbuilding industry.
We are all already aware of the difficulties that this sector has faced for years as a result of unfair competition from Korea.
We are also aware that Korea continues to set prices below cost, that the Korean authorities provide their shipyards with subsidies, both direct and indirect, that bankrupt shipyards are kept operational, that South Korea' s production capacity increased by 170% between 1988 and 1997, whereas, during the same period, European production fell by 30%.
And yet, during this time, European subsidies were ended.
All attempts to resolve the matter amicably have been in vain and a case therefore had to be lodged with the WTO.
I am pleased that this case has now been supplemented with a proposal for a defensive mechanism.
The WTO procedure will probably last three years.
It would be absurd to leave European shipbuilding unprotected for this time and the Commission has proposed a defence mechanism in the form of subsidies.
I support this measure but I would add that Korean competition also affects oil tankers.
One Korean company, with USD five billion' s worth of losses that have been absorbed by state banks, nevertheless won half of all industrial tonnage in 2000 - by dropping prices.
At a time when the consequences of the 11 September attacks have led to a pause in orders for cruise ships, a sector which does not need subsidies, orders for oil tankers are much needed, which is why we must include this sector in the defensive mechanism.
This is my contribution, ladies and gentlemen, to this very important debate on shipbuilding.
I too wish to see Parliament give massive support to the Commission' s proposal.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, for her tenacious and courageous fight for a free market economy.
The rapporteur knows something of which other colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Commission ought to be aware: State subsidies of any kind damage the economy, impair the operation of the market and harm consumers.
Subsidies make for inefficiency and increase costs.
What is depressing is that fellow MEPs now want to make a bad proposal still worse.
I come from Sweden.
In the seventies, Sweden was the world' s second largest shipbuilding nation after Japan.
I had my first job in what was at that time one of Sweden' s largest shipyards.
We built the largest oil tanker in history.
When competition increased from countries such as Portugal, Japan and South Korea, the Swedish state invested a total of EUR 2 billion in an attempt to rescue the shipbuilding industry.
No industrial investment in Sweden has been so ill-starred, cost so much and resulted in so little.
The necessary restructuring of industry came to a halt, and no new jobs were created.
If we in the EU now want to show real solidarity with the shipyard workers and their families, the Commission' s and the committees' proposals must naturally be rejected.
That would be an investment for the future.
Mr President, Commissioner, I will get straight to the point.
Our group supports the Commission proposal with amendments.
Of course, we question the way in which we put up defensive mechanisms when there is talk of opaque, unclear and unfair competition.
The rapporteur has suggested that we should not take any generic measures, as is now the case, namely according to types of ships and possibly a broader concept thereof, but has favoured measures according to regions and shipbuilding yards instead.
Separate support must be granted within the agreements we have concluded in this connection.
The question then actually arises as to the way in which people who, let us say, want to uphold the liberal principles, need to act the moment damage is being done.
I will quote one example.
At present, the Commission has instituted proceedings against the Schelde-Damen construction, that is to say, Damen, has taken over the company Schelde for 1 Guilder.
Questions have been raised as to whether that is acceptable.
My question is whether, in the spirit of the directive which is now being proposed, it could be possible that the Commission, let us say in an oblique way, is now also turning a blind eye to constructions which are being used in this context and in the above example.
Mr President, the ban on State aid for what are mostly publicly-owned shipyards, the refusal to write off the debts run up by their previous private owners and the practice of handing them back to the private sector more or less free of charge are the mainstays of the policy exercised by the European Union which, in collusion with our national governments, has caused this strategically important sector to waste away.
This sorry state of affairs has been exacerbated by a dumping policy, especially in South Korea.
The blow which started with the seventh directive has been fatal for Greece's highly-developed shipbuilding industry.
Thousands of jobs have been lost, working and health and safety conditions in the sector have deteriorated and we recently mourned the death of another five workers, sacrificed to capitalist speculation in the shipbuilding sector.
Now we have a hypocritical proposal to give aid, the aid which was previously banned, to what are now privately-owned shipyards as their only means of salvation.
Yet again we see the European Union's devotion to the interests of big business.
The Communist Party of Greece takes the view that the only viable solution is to create a single publicly-owned agency which can withstand international competition and benefit employment and the economy.
Mr President, during this debate, certain things have become clear and have enjoyed general consensus.
There is a general consensus that the crisis is affecting the European Union' s shipbuilding industry. There is a general consensus that this crisis is due, amongst other things, to unfair competition on the part of the Republic of South Korea, which, according to Mr Caudron, consists of three elements: prices which are lower than costs, aid to shipyards and the maintenance of bankrupt shipyards.
I have also stressed that the crisis is serious.
Over the last 10 years, Korea has increased its capacity by 180%, while we have reduced ours by 30%.
What have we done so far?
So far, we have signed an agreement with South Korea which that country has not respected.
We have lodged a complaint which is yet to be dealt with.
And recently, a twin course of action has been decided upon: firstly, to take the case to the WTO and, secondly, to establish the defensive, selective and temporary mechanism which we are discussing.
It is as if Commissioner Bolkestein, faced with the non-compliances of Korea, had used the words of Cicero to Catiline: "Quousque tandem abutere Catilina patientia nostra [How long now, Catiline, will you abuse our patience]".
I would remind those Members, almost all from the North, who have spoken against this decision, of a military aphorism which says that 'the mission of the artillery is to bomb the infantry, preferably that of the enemy' .
In this case, the weapons of the North are aiming at European positions, bringing to mind in many cases the situation of Japan or that of other industries.
What does the European Parliament want to do?
Support Mr Bolkestein whole-heartedly and ask him to be more generous.
To be more generous in relation to the field of protection: that is to say, as Mr Ortuondo has stressed, that it also be extended to those vessels which suffer from unfair competition, those which transport gases, car ferries, etc. and that he be less stingy in terms of the date of application.
That he extend this temporary and defensive measure until 2003.
May God bless you if you do this, Mr Bolkestein.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commission for proposing a regulation for the shipbuilding industry which may be temporary and segmented but which somehow, once again, helps minimise the effects of protectionism, which exists in various trading blocs around the world and not just in Korea.
In Korea it is not even a question of protectionism: it is a massive violation of WTO rules.
We should like to believe that the complaint that has been made will have some effect and bring some discipline to this sector.
The Commission has revealed, however, that it knows the proposed mechanism is not enough, and that it is only one step, and a step with all the negative baggage that stopgap measures entail, once we get beyond the deficit and crises of the shipbuilding industry, some of which have already been mentioned here, so I shall not repeat them.
But while it is true that the Nordic countries support investment and alternative technology, and thus achieve added value and still manage to keep active in the market without great social upheaval, this is not equally true for other European Union regions, such as southern Europe, regions where this sector is the largest employer and supports employment in a number of services and subsidiary industries.
It is often the only activity that generates development in these regions, and so the disappearance of this activity would be a social tragedy for certain regions, particularly in my country, in Spain and in Greece.
But while we hope that the Commission will implement this regulation at least by 2003, we hope for a lot more for the future and a different attitude towards the sector.
Mr President, on 5 December 2000, the Council decided that the granting of State aid of up to 9 per cent to the shipbuilding industry should cease for all Member States at the end of the year 2000.
This was for two reasons: State aid had not proved to have had any major effect on the industry' s ability to survive, and there was a conviction on grounds of principle that State aid should be reduced as much as possible and preferably cease.
Parliament shared this view as recently as last year.
State aid to shipyards is, moreover, contrary to international trade agreements, a fact crystallised by the Commission' s attempt in the autumn of 1999 and the spring of 2000 to reach a negotiated solution with South Korea to the problem of their having violated current trade agreements by providing extensive State aid.
Now that that attempt has failed, the Commission is instead tabling a proposal for a so-called temporary defensive mechanism for the shipbuilding industry, involving aid of between 6 and 14 per cent.
According to the committee' s proposal, this is to continue right up until the end of 2003, at the same time as dispute settlement proceedings have been instituted before the WTO against South Korea as a result of the latter' s having violated current trade agreements.
The reintroduction of extensive State aid within the EU would scarcely increase the prospects of solving the dispute with South Korea.
It would make more sense to reject the Commission' s proposal and put every effort into the WTO proceedings against South Korea.
In conclusion, I should like to put the following question to Commissioner Bolkestein: how does he think this proposal stands in relation to the EU' s competition policy through which we are trying to minimise, and preferably remove, State aid to industries in order to create fair and healthy competition between companies?
Mr President, my colleague, Mr Monti, has asked me to pass on his regrets to Parliament for his absence and to respond on his behalf.
I should like, on Mr Monti's behalf, to thank Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen for her hard work and considerable input into this report.
We are extremely grateful for the rapid handling of this file by Parliament.
I also wish to take this opportunity to explain to Parliament the Commission's position on this report.
Ideally, there would be no need for the Commission to present this proposal.
I stress that operating aid is a particularly distorting form of aid, because it provides no incentive to improve efficiency and delivers no benefit in terms of competitiveness of the yards by, for example, encouraging training or research development.
Nor, indeed, does it help the environment.
For those reasons and after many years of operating aid being granted to the shipbuilding industry, the Commission finally decided to prohibit it as from the end of last year.
However, to quote a well-known philosopher, we do not live in the best of all possible worlds.
That being so, it is only right that the Community should take action against any unfair competitive practices, and it is within that context that the proposal for the temporary defensive mechanism should be seen.
This proposal is one part of a two-pronged strategy against Korean practices and is designed to support the Community's action against Korea in the WTO.
It is an exceptional measure, and is only taken in the light of a situation which led one representative rightly to quote Cicero saying: 'Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra?'
It is, as I say, an exceptional measure, whose purpose is to put pressure on Korea to bring it to the negotiating table with the Community and to force it to bring an end to its unfair commercial practices.
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is not in any way the beginning of a new, possibly open ended regime of operating aid.
That emphatically is not the Commission's intention.
I note that the proposed amendments to the Commission's proposal relate to three main issues.
Firstly, there is the scope of the mechanism.
Secondly, there is the information to be made available to the Member States and also to third parties through Member States.
Thirdly and finally, there is the matter of its duration.
I should like to respond to these points in that order.
So, firstly, on the extension of the scope: the amendments proposed in the report would considerably widen the scope of the mechanism, which covers only those market segments that the Commission has identified, in its report on the trade barriers regulation, as having already been considerably injured by unfair Korean practices.
The proposal strikes a balance between a high maximum aid ceiling of 14% on the one hand and limited eligibility on the other hand.
It is therefore specifically designed to counter unfair Korean practices.
Any enlargement of the scope would risk changing the nature of the proposal.
I would like to draw Members' attention to Article 2(6) of the proposal, which provides that the Commission will keep under review the market segments eligible for aid in the light of evidence clearly proving that a specific market segment within the Community has been directly injured by unfair and opaque competitive conditions.
The Commission will, accordingly, monitor the situation and keep Parliament informed of any potential review under that provision.
The second point relates to information provided to Member States and third parties through Member States, that is, the removal of the name and address of the applicant shipyard and prospective purchaser.
That is the intention of the amendments put forward.
The information that has been specified in Article (2)(a) of the Commission's proposal is the minimum necessary to allow third parties to submit useful comments to the Commission and to ensure the effectiveness of the transparency procedure.
The purpose of that provision is to speed up the procedure.
The alternative option would be to open the formal investigation procedure in all cases where the Commission has doubts about the compatibility of aid.
That would entail the full publication of detailed information relating to the notification.
Thirdly, there is the extension of the expiry date until 31 December 2003.
It has been argued by some Members of Parliament that the expiry date of the mechanism is too early.
But by the end of 2002 we will have a good idea of how the WTO action is proceeding.
It would be a timely opportunity to take stock of the situation and to reassess whether special measures for shipbuilding are still considered necessary.
The Commission can, at that stage, propose an extension of the defensive mechanisms to the Council.
In addition to what I have just said on behalf of my colleague Mr Monti, I should like to reply more specifically to two or three questions that were put to the Commission just now.
Firstly, Mr Blokland claims that there is a need for structural changes and not for more aid to ailing industries.
I would agree with him that ideally subsidies should support structural change.
Let us hope that in this case that is true.
Various Members have raised the issue of compatibility with the WTO.
In the Commission's view the proposal on a temporary defensive mechanism is fully compatible with WTO law subsidies, provided they are not prohibitive, are not drawn to cause so-called adverse effects and are legitimate national policy instruments as far as the WTO is concerned.
Therefore the European Community has the right to grant aid to its shipbuilders.
In fact the EC has been granting such aid to its shipbuilding industry for many years, up to 31 December 2000.
Insofar as subsidies are not sanctions in the sense of the dispute settlement procedure, they are permitted policy measures.
Therefore the recourse to dispute settlement can in no way be seen as limiting the normal rights and obligations of Members under the WTO agreements.
Lastly, in reply to Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen's question, as to whether the Commission would submit a new proposal for the reasons explained, the Commission does not see any reason to modify the proposal.
Therefore the Commission has no plans to put forward a new proposal.
The Commission is grateful for the support Parliament has so far shown for this proposal.
For the reasons that I have outlined, the proposed amendments are not acceptable to the Commission.
Nevertheless I very much hope that we can count on Parliament's continued support in this matter.
Mr President, I am glad Mr Bolkestein confirmed that he will not submit a new proposal.
But he also referred to the review clause in the proposal.
Can you assure me today, Mr Bolkestein, that you are not going to give in to France by permitting it to subsidise its shipyards in order to get agreement in the Council in December?
Can you confirm that you will make no agreement with France before that meeting?
In reply to Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen's question, I repeat that the Commission stands by the position I have outlined just now.
Any further negotiations are, as far as the Commission is concerned, not in order.
We will see what happens in the Industry Council at the beginning of December.
As far as the position of one Member State is concerned, the Commission has nothing further to add.
) Mr President, my speech concerns a matter of procedure.
My view is that from the point of view of the working of the Members of Parliament it is very unsatisfactory that reports are continuously moved to entirely different time slots on the agenda.
Mrs Peijs' s report was originally due to be considered at the afternoon session, then we were informed that it has been moved to the session starting at 9 p.m., after that a notification suddenly appeared here at 5.15 p.m. that in actual fact its processing is starting now.
This kind of tossing the ball back and forth is not acceptable with regard to getting the Members' time schedules organised.
Another matter I would like to draw attention to is the absence of the Council.
The Council question time is starting now.
Surely they would have been able to arrive half an hour earlier to discuss, for example, this matter which is very important to the shipbuilding industry.
The Council, however, is again conspicuous by being absent.
I deeply regret that this is happening.
I do understand your concern, Mrs Kauppi, but I must tell you that Council Question Time is also set on our agenda for a very precise time, which is 5.30 p.m.
Members who have tabled questions will, therefore, be joining us in a few minutes.
We must give them the floor.
Having said that, although our debates are programmed into the agenda, it is impossible to predict exactly how long they will last, give or take a few minutes or a quarter of an hour, not least because the Commissioners and the ministers sometimes take up much more speaking time than the sitting staff plan for.
This is why I would ask you to show some understanding and flexibility.
We have two or three minutes left before 5.30 p.m. and I therefore suspend the sitting until Council Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.27 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Questions to the Council (B5-0338/2001).
On behalf of the Council, Mrs Durant is with us as President-in-Office of the Council and we thank her for being here.
She is Vice Prime Minister and Minister for Mobility and Transport.
As the author, Mr Staes, is not present, Question No 1 lapses.
The fact that we have started on time today has probably surprised some Members who always bank on a delay, but not today.
The second question has been withdrawn.
Question No 3 by (H-0778/01):
Subject: Guidelines for the Cardiff Integration Process How does the Council intend to develop a common set of guidelines for the proper evaluation, follow-up and monitoring of the nine Council strategies, as well as the overall Cardiff Process, for environmental integration?
Will these guidelines include recommendations for a more transparent process and wider stakeholder participation in the development and implementation of the strategies?
How will the Council ensure full involvement of the European Parliament in the Cardiff Process?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Council would like to reiterate that the Cardiff process has led six Council formations to present strategies to the European Council that seek to integrate the environment into their policies.
These strategies concerned the transport, energy, agriculture, industry, internal market and development cooperation sectors.
The General Affairs, ECOFIN and Fisheries Councils plan to present the three latest relevant strategies to the Barcelona European Council in the spring of 2002.
The nine integration strategies must be implemented in the form of sectoral measures, adopted by the majority, through co-decision with the European Parliament.
In addition to the Cardiff process, we must highlight the Lisbon process, which integrates the 1997 Luxembourg social process on employment with the 1999 Cologne macro-economic process, which was given a third dimension in Gothenburg, an environmental dimension, made up of the strategy for sustainable development, which also seeks to achieve integration of the environment into sectoral policies.
The European Union will present all this to the Global Summit on Sustainable Development which, as you know, will be held in Johannesburg in September 2002.
By creating this strategy on sustainable development, the European Council has given priority, in terms of the environment, to climate change, to ecologically viable methods of transport, to the responsible management of natural resources and, lastly, to the management of risks to public health.
Whilst continuing to function independently, the Cardiff process has been assessed and monitored since its launch in 1998, with results which are now integrated into the enlarged framework of the Lisbon process.
The implementation of the strategy on sustainable development must, as decided at Gothenburg, be based on four points.
The first point is an annual synthesis report by the Commission, which will now concern the three dimensions of the Lisbon process, including the strategy on sustainable development.
A report of the same kind will also have to be presented to the Barcelona European Council.
The second point is an evaluation and a political direction at the spring European Councils.
The third point concerns structural indicators on sustainable development which will be, on the basis of a Commission communication, endorsed by the Council before being submitted to the Laeken European Council.
The fourth and final point is a Commission communication on better regulation, which will mean that all the major proposals from this institution will be assessed beforehand for their effects on the strategy on sustainable development, including integration of the environmental dimension.
The Council is currently working to implement the conclusions of the European Council on the structures of work.
These will be designed with particular consideration given to the principles of governance in terms of transparency, stakeholder participation, better methods for regulation and the re-focusing of Community policies.
Trying to put the principles of environmental sustainability into practice is no easy task.
The Council is actually inventing the wheel.
The impression that many of us have is that the discussions are taking place behind closed doors.
I wonder whether the presidency is trying to open the discussion up, increase the transparency of the process and perhaps involve other organisations such as NGOs in the development of strategies.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council in particular what is being done to press for the working groups to identify specific medium-term objectives, clear targets and programmes of action, so that we have something to get our teeth into and have a demonstrable means of measuring progress and achievement?
I share your concern regarding transparency and openness, so that we can have specific indicators and results.
I also share your concern to take into account the views, advice or specific results from other organisations, particularly NGOs.
I have taken careful note of your suggestion, of your request to increase transparency and the involvement of all those who are helping to draw up strategies on sustainable development in the field.
I do hope that in showing transparency, the Council will also be able to integrate the results that you mention in order to ensure that these indicators on sustainable development, which are being prepared and are due to be submitted to the Laeken European Council, can, as part of the process and in the run-up to Barcelona, be improved from the point of view of both transparency and their repercussions or in terms of taking into account the views of all those who are working specifically in the field in the area of sustainable development.
Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cardiff process is essential for sustainable development.
The European Parliament, and especially its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has already carried out very good preliminary work here, and I think that in this House, transparency and, of course, dialogue can really be taken for granted.
We very often hold hearings here and make every effort to maximise dialogue with non-government organisations.
My question relates to this issue.
We have just concluded the WTO negotiations.
What opportunities do you see to coordinate the Cardiff process in consultation with the WTO organisations?
Mr President, your concern regarding both transparency and correspondence or coherence between, firstly, the outcome of the Doha Summit, the final details of which we are awaiting, and, secondly, the strategies on sustainable development, is extremely interesting.
Admittedly, as we saw at Doha, it is difficult, but interesting nonetheless, to integrate environmental policies into a much more multi-lateral context.
This is an important step forward, considering our starting point.
I think that this is a positive aspect and that, in the wake of the Doha Summit, we will now have to make the most of the achievements of Doha and use them within the framework of the measures that are to be implemented at European Union level, so as to ensure that sustainable development not only continues to be an honourable and bold ambition for everyone, but more importantly, translates itself, whilst observing the principle of transparency and following constructive dialogue, into specific measures in the field.
I therefore feel that the correspondence between the two parts, what was achieved within a wider forum and what was achieved or is in the process of being achieved at European Union level and, in particular, what must be achieved at the Laeken and Barcelona Councils, should be coherent and should be the milestones of a structural position, that is specific and conducive to the integration of sustainable development in all the policies implemented at Council and European Union level in general.
Question No 4 by (H-0781/01):
Subject: Landing of large numbers of illegal immigrants in the Canary Islands What measures does the Council intend to put forward to guarantee the integrity of Community waters around the Canary Islands, given the recent reports that motherships are being used to land large numbers of illegal immigrants from Africa on the Canaries?
Mr President, the Council has already responded, on several occasions, to the questions from Members of the European Parliament on illegal immigration by sea from the African continent.
In particular, I refer to the answers to oral questions H-2701, H-0330/01 and H-0699/01 on illegal immigration in the European Union, and to the answers to written questions E-0085/01 and E-1045/01, which also tackled these problems.
The Council has already taken several measures to combat illegal immigration.
The action plans that have been drawn up for the countries and regions producing illegal immigrants and/or asylum seekers, within the framework of the High Level Asylum and Immigration Group, is a good example of one such measure.
Another example is that of the rapid alert system that was developed within the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration (Cirefi).
Measures to improve the effectiveness of checks by Member States at maritime borders were launched as part of cooperation under the Schengen Agreement.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, these measures are now part of the Community acquis.
Of course, Member States are responsible for performing these checks, and the surveillance of and checks on territorial waters are therefore a matter of their competence.
The Council also stresses that the preparatory bodies are currently looking into introducing a good practice guide, the aim of which is to assist Member States in carrying out these checks.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the Presidency of the Council will realise that I am not satisfied by references to mere written declarations.
The current situation in the Canary Islands amounts to a genuine invasion.
Approximately one hundred people are arriving every week and, furthermore, we are sending them to the rest of the Community.
A week ago, the Mayor of the city of Las Palmas in Gran Canaria sent two hundred immigrants to Madrid with one-way tickets.
If the European Union does not look after this border, I can assure you that we will have a real invasion, which is going to change all the parameters.
Perhaps my supplementary question should be, in relation to certain replies I received yesterday from Commissioner Vitorino on the Commission' s new proposals, whether the Council is considering those Commission proposals on the control of external borders, on immigration agreements with neighbouring countries and on the return of illegal immigrants in the EU to the countries of origin.
Mr President, I can understand that you feel the answer that I have given on behalf of the Council may be insufficient in terms of a situation that gives you cause for concern and which you feel is extremely important. As I have just said, I can only refer to the competence of Member States regarding decisions taken at Community level.
It is up to Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, to implement the necessary measures that were drawn up within the context of the Community.
Question No 5 by , which has been taken over by Mr Ortuondo Larrea (H-0783/01):
Subject: Reference to nationalism in the conclusions of the European Council meeting of 21 September 2001 Following the horrific terrorist attacks which took place on 11 September and their tragic consequences, people in the United States reacted strongly, with clear expressions of nationalism or patriotism based on the democratic and moral values which underpin North American society.
It was out of a similar form of democratic nationalism that most of the current Member States of the European Union were born in the face of despotic power.
The fact that certain European states acted in a violent and imperialistic manner and were thus the cause of the tragic wars which have marked Europe's history should in no way detract from the peaceful aspirations which characterise the democratic nationalism to be found in most European countries.
It is therefore surprising to note that, in the conclusions of the European Council meeting of 21 September 2001, which was held in response to the terrorist attacks against US citizens, the term 'nationalism' is once more used indiscriminately as being equivalent to racism and xenophobia. This is quite clearly offensive to all those Europeans who see themselves as peaceful, democratic and caring members of a nation and part of a national culture, as well as members of the European and world community.
Does the Council not agree that it is manifestly unfair to link nationalism with racism and xenophobia in such an indiscriminate manner?
The Council would reiterate that it is not up to the Council to comment on the conclusions of the European Council.
In this case, it is also beneficial to highlight that, in its conclusions of 21 September 2001, the European Council emphasises the need to combat any nationalist, racist or xenophobic drift.
I shall stress this - any nationalist drift, which is not the same thing as nationalism.
The term 'nationalism' does not actually appear in the text.
The only terms that appear are 'drifts, abuses, in nationalist, racist or xenophobic terms' .
And in this respect, I do not believe that the position taken by the Council does contradict the position that you expressed in your question.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the European Council has been able to differentiate between Arab and Muslim religion and society, on the one hand, and fanatical Islamic terrorist groups on the other.
However, in its conclusions of 21 September, the European Council expresses the need, as you have said, to combat any nationalist tendency, as if to be nationalist were a crime in itself or an attack on human rights.
Does the Council not agree that to stress the need to combat peaceful nationalism, which defends the universal right to free self-determination, something which the United Nations approved, by exclusively democratic means, could be seen as a display of intolerance and fascism on the part of the governments of the European Union?
While it is true that there are radical nationalist groups, which support terrorism, there are also violent groups with unionist or environmentalist ideologies which also commit violent acts.
Does the Council therefore believe that we should combat British unionism or environmentalism, for example, in all its forms?
Would it not be better to show prudence and democratic respect whenever we refer to nationalism, unionism, environmentalism or any other ideology?
I confirm what I just said. There is no reference to nationalism being a non-democratic movement in itself.
There are references here to abuses and drifts, be they racist, xenophobic, exclusionist, but nationalism in itself is not referred to as something that generates these drifts.
On the other hand, nationalism can sometimes be used for much more extremist purposes which should be condemned outright.
This is also the case in the area of political action, where democratic political actions benefit democracy as a whole and the freedom of expression.
Each time there are drifts, however, they are dangerous and they must be stamped out.
I am grateful for the President-in-Office of the Council's last remarks.
I belong to a national movement in my own country, Scotland, which over the last 100 years has produced great constitutional change without a single drop of human blood being shed or a single act of violence occurring.
There are other places, as she knows, where similar constitutional changes have taken place and are continuing.
The Council and the President-in-Office of the Council are perhaps wilfully missing the point in Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n's question.
It is a great mistake to say that there are some ends that tend to attract terrorism and therefore to attack those ends in themselves.
The truth is that a terrorist is someone who thinks that an end justifies any means.
It is absurd to believe that if the end is noble any means can be justified.
Those who believe that, make whatever end they seek ignoble.
I wish the Council would be less selective in its attitude to such questions.
I share your point of view and I would also like to reiterate that, given the debate we have just had on the international situation, in regard to nationalism, as I said, or in other areas, and I shall use the example of religion, which is particularly topical in terms of current events in Afghanistan, the Council clearly believes that religion forms part of one' s private life, is a matter of individual choice. I shall take Islam as an example.
Islam has nothing to do with the scandalous and abusive way that it has been treated by terrorists who use it in a way that borders on the disgraceful and to achieve vastly different goals. I can only repeat, in answer to your question, the Council' s belief is that, in Europe and throughout the world, we must also respect a democratic Islam, which, in fact, belongs to the sphere of one' s private life, or which is expressed in a legitimate way, but also to combat any form of religious expression which pursues any other scandalously repressive goal.
Just to clarify the comments by my honourable colleague, Mr MacCormick, it was, in fact, the 1997 election of a Labour government which delivered the historic Scottish parliament that was democratically elected in 1999.
If it had not been for that Labour government we would not have a Scottish parliament.
I would remind Members that this is exclusively a Question Time.
These clarifications can be made later outside the chamber.
Question No 6 by (H-0784/01):
Subject: Illegal immigration into Greece from Turkey - breach of accession partnership There has been an enormous upsurge in illegal immigration into Greece from Turkey, with thousands of clandestine immigrants reaching Greek shores aboard Turkish smugglers' boats.
The Turkish authorities make no attempt to prevent such immigration, which is in breach of the accession partnership, while the measures taken by the Greek authorities are inadequate to stem the constant flood of illegal immigrants on to Greek territory and, by extension, into the EU.
Bearing in mind the climate of insecurity created by uncontrolled immigration into the EU, which was intensified by the terrorist attacks in the USA, what is the Council's position on the flow of illegal immigrants from Turkey?
What measures will the Council take in regard to Turkey as an applicant for EU accession, pursuant to the conditions laid down in the accession partnership concerning the prevention of illegal immigration and the strengthening of border management with a view to the adoption of the Schengen acquis, in order to prevent illegal immigrants entering Greece and to guarantee the security of the EU's borders?
In response to Mr Trakatellis' question, the Council has often expressed its concern regarding illegal immigration and also refers in this connection to the conclusions of the Tampere, Santa Maria de Feira and Nice European Councils, for example.
Regarding the measures that it has taken and is continuing to take in this area, the Council kindly asks you to refer to the answers that have already been given to numerous questions submitted by Members of the European Parliament on illegal immigration.
The Council reiterates that the Helsinki European Council decided to consider Turkey as a candidate country which aims to join the European Union on the basis of the same criteria as those that are applied to the other candidate countries.
The Helsinki European Council stated that, and I quote, 'with a view to intensifying the harmonisation of Turkey' s legislation and practice with the acquis, the Commission is invited to prepare a process of analytical examination of the acquis' .
In accordance with the conclusions of the Feira European Council, the Commission will report back to the Council on the progress made in preparing the analytical examination of the acquis with Turkey.
The Council formally adopted the accession partnership with Turkey on 8 March 2000.
Under this accession partnership, Turkey adopted a national programme for adopting the acquis, which sets out the framework for the policy to be pursued and the timetable of legislative work, as well as the budgetary and administrative requirements that are necessary in order for Turkey to adopt the Community acquis.
In line with the practice established for all candidate countries, the Commission will assess Turkey' s national programme for adopting the acquis in the 2001 regular report on the basis of the accession partnership.
The European Union will closely monitor the implementation of the various measures announced as part of this framework.
The national programme on the acquis contains various measures in the area of justice and home affairs.
The main objectives on which progress was made during 2001 include the strengthening of border checks, the harmonisation of legislation and practices concerning visas with the European Union acquis, and, lastly, the adoption of the acquis in the area of immigration in order to prevent illegal immigration.
The Council again stated its concern given the enormous influx of illegal immigrants from Turkey into Greece or transiting through Greece.
The European Union asked Turkey to implement appropriate measures as laid out in the European Union report of November 2000.
The EU is also keen to help Turkey financially in pursuing the implementation of the recommended approach, in line with the accession partnership.
In this respect, the Council noted with interest Turkey' s intention to waive, in the medium term, the geographical proviso formulated with regard to the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees.
The Council also engaged in active dialogue with countries that produce asylum seekers and/or illegal immigrants within the framework of the High Level Asylum and Immigration group.
As I said earlier in my reply to the question by another Member regarding the Canary Islands, this group, set up by the Council in December 1998, has the task of drawing up action plans for specific countries.
In order to draw up these action plans, the group adopted a global, trans-pillar approach, taking into account aspects relating to foreign policy, economic development and also the management of migratory flows.
One of the countries chosen for this action plan is Iraq, since it is a country that produces immigrants and which immigrants transit through.
Because of its geographical situation, Turkey is obviously an important country of transit.
As part of the action plan for Iraq, the Council has already launched a dialogue with Turkey in order to implement the European Union action plan concerning Iraq of 26 January 1998.
One of the measures under the action plan is to negotiate a transit agreement with Turkey.
I welcome the Council's lengthy reply but I still have two questions. As the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr Simitis, has said, we are working on an assumption of 260 000 illegal immigrants this year.
Tell me, if you can, how two hundred and sixty thousand illegal immigrants can possibly pass through Turkey unnoticed?
This being so, exactly what action has the Council taken with respect to Turkey, with its candidate status and partnership agreement, to make it improve its border patrols and prevent these huge numbers of illegal immigrants?
Secondly, and more importantly, what exactly does the Council have in mind?
Is it in a position to design a joined-up policy to ensure that this matter is resolved satisfactorily and that borders and illegal immigration are safely controlled?
Of course, political asylum seekers are seeking political asylum, but there still has to be some form of control.
Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to confirm what I just said regarding the Council' s action to effectively implement the things that were decided on as part of the Turkish action plan. Furthermore, with regard to the more general question of migration, I acknowledge and the Council also freely acknowledges that, due to its geographical situation, Turkey is a country in a peculiar situation.
And now, we are all acquainted with the consequences of this situation that you have highlighted. I would like to point out that, under the Belgian Presidency, we have in fact organised, for the first time, a conference, held in Brussels some weeks ago, on the issue of migration.
This was a European Conference which was held as part of a necessary investigation into the issue of migratory movements. I think that this debate must run its course, and the Belgian Presidency wanted to launch this, independently of any decisions taken with regard to Turkey or Iraq, as part of the discussions that Europe is holding with both Turkey under the statute that was conferred upon it, and with non-European and non-candidate countries, to attempt to better manage the problems related to these migratory fluctuations.
The point I should like to make to the Minister is that there is a huge contradiction where Turkey is concerned.
On the one hand, it allows huge numbers of migrants to pass through it and, on the other, a stream of political refugees from Turkey itself or from other countries but who are open to prosecution in Turkey, such as Iraqi Kurds who might be prosecuted for their activities in Turkey, is turning up in Greece.
How can these two things be reconciled?
By which I mean making Turkey stop, with the possible refoulement of immigrants entering the Community illegally via Greece, while at the same time protecting all those seeking political asylum, given that Turkey is a country which practises the death penalty and, as we saw in the Commission's progress report yesterday, a country in which democracy is sorely lacking?
Question No 7 by (H-0788/01):
Subject: Statements by Mr Berlusconi Recently, the Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Berlusconi, made statements which essentially put the mass demonstrations calling for a different kind of globalisation on a par with terrorism. He also proceeded to make a number of comparisons and judgments about Western and Islamic civilisation which betrayed an ignorance of history and which the President-in-Office of the Council, the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr Michel, described as barbaric, absurd and untrue.
In view of the fact that Mr Berlusconi's statements are totally contrary to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, as signed and proclaimed by the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the European Council meeting in Nice on 7 December 2000, can the Council state its official and collective position on this matter?
Mr President, it is, of course, not up to the Council to comment on the statements made by Mr Berlusconi.
The Council would like to reiterate the terms used by the European Council in its conclusions, at the outcome of the extraordinary meeting held in Brussels on 21 September.
The European Council, issuing an appeal to the international community to pursue, in all multilateral fora, dialogue and negotiation with a view to building, in Europe and elsewhere, a world of peace, law and tolerance, also emphasised the need to combat any racist and xenophobic drift and to reject any equation of terrorism with the Arab or Muslim world.
From this perspective, there is no doubt that the official and concerted position, which you have been hoping and praying for, was already taken by the Council at its sitting of 21 September.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, my question touched on two issues.
First, Mr Berlusconi's views, if I may call them such, on Arabs and Islam.
It seems to me from what you have read out that the Council begs to differ from, not to say condemns these views.
And that is good news.
But I asked you a second question, Madam President-in-Office of the Council.
In his statements, Mr Berlusconi equated the huge demonstrations being held all over the world, in both Europe and America, by people who believe that globalisation could take a different form and a different direction, with terrorism.
In other words, he equated these demonstrations with terrorism.
What is the Council's view on this issue, which is an extremely important issue and one which will no doubt crop up again in the future?
Mr President, I would like to reiterate that it is not for the Council to comment on the statements made by Mr Berlusconi and others, not only on the aspects related to Islam or any other equation of terrorism with the Arab world, but also on issues related to globalisation.
I stand by the actions and the positions of the Council, which were adopted on 21 September and which I believe give a clear indication of the European Council' s point of view, regarding its determination to reject any equation of this sort.
It is not for the Council to comment or issue an opinion on the statements made by Mr Berlusconi either.
Question No 8 by (H-0791/01):
Subject: Inclusion of additional data on new EU identity cards The recent terrorist attacks in the USA have given rise to intense debate over whether more detailed information about an individual's characteristics and origin should be included on identity cards in the Member States of the Union.
The Greek press reports that this issue will be discussed early next December in Brussels at the meeting of the Ministers of Justice, Internal Affairs and Public Order of the 15 Member States of the EU.
Will the Council therefore say whether the deliberations which take place between those Ministers will also cover the following additional data to define more clearly the identity of European citizens and, in more general terms, EU residents: fingerprints, colour of eyes and hair, height, weight, blood group and subgroup, visible scars and other physical distinguishing features, hair growth, disabilities, nationality, place of birth, religion, family status, occupation, and academic qualifications.
I would request a specific answer for each of the above mentioned points. Will the deliberations also cover the possibility of adding further characteristics to existing passports in all the UN Member States and, if so, which characteristics?
I would like to thank you for asking this question, as it gives the Council the opportunity to clear up what is obviously a huge misunderstanding on the part of the Greek press.
At an extraordinary session on 20 September 2001, organised in response to the events of 11 September, the Justice, Home Affairs and Civil Protection Council held a wide debate on measures to be taken as part of the fight against international terrorism.
It is true that the Council discussed including bio data, but only on visas to be issued to third country nationals.
As a follow-up to this debate, the Commission recently asked the Council to submit a proposal for a regulation to enhance the security of this category of visas, by including a digital photograph on these, so that we can ensure that the passport holder really is the person to whom the document was issued.
The Council would very much appreciate Parliament' s issuing an opinion on this new proposal as soon as possible.
Lastly, you are almost certainly aware that identity cards of Member States' nationals are an area that falls within the exclusive remit of each of the Member States.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her extremely clear reply to my question.
She has confirmed that the Council is discussing the inclusion of other information on passports or visas, such as a digital photograph, an extremely important element, and additional biometric data.
Could you perhaps be more specific, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as regards what additional information you are discussing. Will it include biometric information other than a fingerprint and will it also include the person's religion?
This issue is of particular interest to Greece.
I should also like to ask why you only plan to request information on the identity of third country nationals and not European Union nationals.
As far as I know, the European Union has its share of terrorists, for example in Spain and Greece.
Should we not be making it easier for European police forces to locate European terrorists?
I obviously wanted to be sure that the answer I gave was accurate.
In fact, this does not only concern visas and, with respect to the data provided, this only regards digital fingerprinting.
I can today reassure you on the issue of religion, for example.
I think that it is important for Parliament, as I suggested, to issue an opinion on this proposal as soon as possible so that we can then forge ahead.
But I can reassure you that we do not mean digital fingerprinting.
Question No 9 by (H-0795/01):
Subject: Age discrimination Does the Council propose to change its current policy of discriminating against job applicants aged 45 and over in the light of the European Ombudsman's current investigation into whether such age discrimination amounts to maladministration?
The Council does not consider that setting an age limit of 45 years for the recruitment of civil servants at the starting grade constitutes discrimination in itself, because the difference in treatment established by this limit, on the one hand, is in line with the Treaty on establishing the European Community as well as the civil servants' statute and, on the other, is based on objective reasons, particularly relating to the concept of a career, which is at the heart of Community work.
This consideration was twice brought to the attention of the European Ombudsman.
We must also emphasise that the age limit is raised systematically, and up to a maximum of six years, in order to take into account family commitments, such as bringing up children, military service or physical handicap.
The age limit is also raised in some other cases, in order to meet specific recruitment requirements due to the staff needs or the new requirements of an institution.
This was the case, for example, for the recruitment of Nordic language translators and this also happened more recently for posts advertised for political and military staff.
The Council' s General Secretariat would not deprive itself of the experience of an older candidate if this experience was indispensable, but it must also ensure that younger staff are recruited to fulfil the permanent tasks of the institution, such as translation or administration.
Lastly, you drew attention to the fact that the process to undertake administrative reform and strengthen inter-institutional cooperation that is underway intends to establish an inter-institutional recruitment office.
The question regarding age limit has not been touched upon during the preparatory work carried out to establish this office.
The issue is also likely to be raised when reviewing the proposals on the reform of the statute, on which the Council, in its role of legislator, will be asked to comment.
Whilst we await the results of this work, which should enable common rules for all the institutions to be drawn up, it does not seem appropriate to change the current practice used by the Council' s General Secretariat in the recruitment of civil servants at the starting grade of a career.
The practice appears to be in line with the rules of law and is also in the interests of the institution.
I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply.
I was alerted to this issue of age discrimination in the Council at our previous part-session when I was asked what I thought.
My immediate reaction was that, while on the one hand we are trying to encourage fairer treatment of older workers, yet, on the other hand, in one of our own EU institutions - and from what the minister said in more than one - we are discriminating against those aged 45 and over.
It is a sad state of affairs when those aged 45 are not considered for employment.
What talent, knowledge and experience is lost because of this!
I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council what measures are being taken to treat all job applications equally?
It was interesting to hear about the inter-institutional recruitment office.
What is the time-scale for its creation and what common rules will all institutions have?
I just wish to clarify something you said.
The base age has been raised by six years.
Does that mean it has been raised to 51 or has 39 been raised to 45?
Mr President, I just wanted to answer one of the specific supplementary questions that were asked.
The limit is effectively set at 45 years, and it is not possible to recruit anyone over 51 years of age.
Therefore this is a specific answer to one of the specific questions that I was asked as a result.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 10 and 11 will be taken together.
Question No 10 by (H-0796/01):
Subject: Specific measures to provide refuge and support for the Afghan population Given the current situation and the risk of a full blown humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan, what effective action and measures is the Council going to take to prevent hundreds of thousands of women and innocent people being made the victims of indiscriminate violence or of cold and hunger?
Will the Council be opening humanitarian corridors and seeking political solutions?
Question No 11 by (H-0825/01):
Subject: Wave of Afghan refugees at the gates of Europe For a number of years, Turkey has been one of the main points of entry into Europe for economic migrants and political refugees.
Following the terrorist attack in the USA, Afghans seeking shelter from the brutal Taliban regime and, above all, from the war, now make up the bulk of refugees on the move.
Reliable sources report that tens of thousands of Afghan refugees are preparing to make the crossing from Turkey to Greece and Italy.
In the Council's view, what is the status of the Afghan refugees?
Are they entitled to political asylum?
Is a quota system being considered to accommodate them in European countries?
Is there any form of cooperation with the Turkish authorities?
What view does the Council take of the conditions in which they are 'housed' in Italy and Greece (immigrant reception centres, etc.)?
What measures can the Council take in cooperation with the Greek and Italian authorities?
Mr President, as it has indicated in previous answers on the same subject, the Council fully shares your concerns regarding the humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan.
At its session on 8 and 9 October 2001, the Council reaffirmed that the European Union and its Member States are doing everything possible in order to avoid a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and in the neighbouring countries, which must be organised in close collaboration with the HCR and other specialised agencies, the International Red Cross Committee, the United States, neighbouring countries and other partners from multinational organisations.
On this occasion, the Council reiterated that, faced with the humanitarian crisis, the Community and its Member States have already released EUR 316 million.
The Council warmly welcomed the first steps taken by the Commission to assist refugees and has invited the Commission to present further measures as soon as possible.
In this respect, I would like to stress that the reserve for urgent aid, which amounts to EUR 25 million, to be used for humanitarian aid to help the Afghan people, was already approved at a budgetary tripartite meeting on 15 October.
Furthermore, the Council restated the European Union' s determination to support, when required, a political process launched in Afghanistan, with the support of the United Nations, and to contribute to the reconstruction, modernisation, development and opening up of the country.
Current events confirm the need for us to work towards this.
The Council is in favour of opening humanitarian corridors but it stresses that this requires the cooperation of the forces in control of the situation on the ground.
In this context, the Council deeply regrets that the Taliban regime has, on several occasions, obstructed the delivery of humanitarian aid, harassed NGOs, destroyed humanitarian buildings, refused to cooperate with international institutions and, very recently, demanded that convoys, trying to deliver humanitarian aid to the needy Afghan people, pay road tolls.
Given the current situation in Afghanistan, it is obviously difficult to ensure that any measure can be totally efficient.
However, you will no doubt be aware that the European Union, whilst fully supportive of the efforts undertaken to eradicate terrorism in the wake of the attacks of 11 September, is taking an active part in the humanitarian operation designed to assist the displaced people in the region.
The position of the Council, when faced with such situations, has always been to work to keep displaced populations within the neighbouring regions, in order to facilitate their return, as soon as circumstances allow.
I would reiterate that, on 20 July 2001, the Council adopted a directive on the temporary protection, on the territory of Member States, of displaced persons in the event of a massive influx.
Since this directive will not be applied until December 2002, the Commission stated, at the Council meeting of 27 and 28 September, that it was willing to investigate how the rules specified under this directive could be applied, if necessary, before this date.
From this perspective, the Commission has recently requested Member States to provide, on a fortnightly basis to Eurostat, statistical data on asylum requests and illegal entries of Afghan citizens.
The Council does not have any information on the conditions in reception centres.
And, in relation to this, I would like to say that the Council bodies are currently examining a proposal for a directive to set minimum standards for conditions in reception centres for asylum seekers in the Member States.
Lastly, with regard to relations with Turkey, I reiterate that regular meetings take place between the Council bodies and Turkey, as part of the implementation of the action plan for Iraq drawn up by the High Level Asylum and Immigration Group, as I also explained in answer to a previous question.
The next meeting is most likely to take place towards the end of November.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your reply.
The serious problem we have is that all that European Union aid, those many millions of euros, is being channelled by means of Pakistan.
Pakistan is the only country - together with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - which has been supporting the Taliban regime.
It is a mistake to give the key to, and the administration of, the humanitarian aid to Pakistan. However, that is what is happening, and this political error is the reason why the aid is not reaching all the Afghan beneficiaries who should be receiving it.
Madam President, now that Kabul has been taken, could you please change this so that European Union humanitarian aid is not channelled via Pakistan, as has been the case up to now. Let us not give the key and the administration to Pakistan, but let us do it directly so that it reaches the people of Afghanistan.
I shall start by thanking the President-in-Office of the Council and the Belgian Presidency's entire team which, perhaps because it includes so many women, has given us some excellent replies.
What you said about the provisions of the directive on a mass influx of displaced persons being applied before it is applied in the Member States was most interesting.
Having said which, I should like to ask if, in cases such as that in Greece, where 700 people, mostly from Afghanistan and Iraqi Kurdistan, turned up in Zakynthos, Greece could apply the provisions of the directive, including making use of funds from the European Refugee Fund?
I would like to reiterate what I said in my first answer to the joint question regarding the early application of the directive.
This obviously applies to all Member States.
It is also from this perspective that we requested the statistical data to be provided to Eurostat on a regular basis, in order to be able to consider the early application of the directive due to the situation, which, at the time, could not be predicted.
As for the other points, as far as the delivery of humanitarian aid is concerned, this is basically a matter for the Commission and, since this is the case, it is difficult for the Council to take a position on this subject.
I shall take careful note of the comments regarding the aid deliveries.
Question No 12 by (H-0797/01):
Subject: Death sentence for 16 Afghans for converting to another religion In Afghanistan, a prosecutor has brought 16 Afghans before a court in Kabul demanding that they be sentenced to death.
They are being charged with conversion from Islam to Christianity, and the prosecutor is demanding the death penalty for all of them in accordance with the Taliban regime's Islamic laws.
In a trial taking place at the same time in Kabul, eight aid workers with Shelter Now International have been charged with carrying out Christian missionary work.
Here, too, the prosecution is calling for all of them to be sentenced to death in accordance with the country's Islamic laws.
Germany, the USA and Australia are making diplomatic efforts to protect the eight aid workers' interests and ensure legal certainty.
In a previous answer I received in the Chamber, the Commission stated that the three countries had said the European Union therefore does not need to become involved in the case.
However, there have been no international diplomatic efforts, on the part either of individual countries or of the European Union, to assist the 16 Afghans who have been charged.
Throughout the world, the European Union actively supports the abolition of the death penalty and religious freedom based on tolerance and respect for different beliefs.
How is this reflected in the Council's actions in the case of the 16 Afghans who have changed religion?
What is the European Union doing, via the Council, to follow and monitor the trial of the 16 Afghans facing the death penalty in Kabul, and to influence its outcome, and what concrete steps have been taken to ensure that they enjoy legal certainty and protection and that their lives are spared?
The Council shares your concerns about the citizens of Afghanistan and foreign aid workers who are accused by the Taliban of religion conversion and preaching, and who are therefore facing the very serious threat of the death penalty.
The position of the Council with regard to the death penalty is well known.
The promotion and the respect of fundamental human rights, including the freedom of religion and belief, are an essential part of European Union policy on third countries and are, thus, included in the common position of the European Union on Afghanistan.
The main international legal instruments ensure that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
This right covers the freedom to change religion or belief and the freedom to express, alone or collectively, in public or in private, one' s religion or belief.
The European Union has expressed its concerns regarding the human rights situation in Afghanistan on an international stage, particularly to the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which all EU Member States supported the draft resolution tabled by Italy on human rights violations in Afghanistan.
Given that the EU Member States do not recognise the Taliban government, it is extremely difficult to communicate with them and to gain access to territories under their control.
This was also the case before 11 September 2001.
The bilateral diplomatic efforts to protect foreign aid workers, which have been made by diplomats from Germany, the United States and Australia from Islamabad, have not yet had any tangible results.
Since military action began in Afghanistan on 7 October, it has become even more difficult, of course, to closely monitor the fate of the 16 Afghan citizens mentioned in the honourable Member' s question and to contribute to a political resolution of this matter.
Believe me, this is something I regret, but you will also understand that the situation is now even more difficult to assess than before.
I would thank the Belgian Presidency most sincerely for that answer.
It was characterised by commitment and a genuine desire to do its best for these people.
Kabul has fallen.
The Taliban regime is fleeing.
Afghanistan faces a new future.
In that scenario, I really want you in the Belgian Presidency to do everything you can to obtain information about these 16 Afghans who are threatened by the death penalty.
Are they still there in Kabul?
Have they been taken to Kandahar?
Can we rescue them?
What has happened to the eight aid workers from Shelter Now International?
I should be extremely glad if the Belgian Presidency were able to report here in Parliament that all 24 of these people had been found and were free and alive.
It is my wish that you in the Belgian Presidency should do everything you can.
There are new opportunities now that Kabul has been opened up. I would ask you if you believe you can obtain some information before the end of the year.
As the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.
Question No 14 by (H-0806/01):
Subject: Priorities in the fisheries sector during the second half of the Belgian Presidency Will the Council, under the Belgian Presidency, outline its priorities for the fisheries sector during the second half of its term of office, taking into account the particular and unique requirements of peripheral countries such as Ireland which has 11% of Community waters in its jurisdiction but only 4% of Community quotas?
The Council refers you to the answer that it has already given to the same question asked at the September session of Question Time. The answer deals with the presidency' s intentions regarding the timetable of the Council debate on the Commission' s Green Paper, the extension of the multiannual guidance programmes and the rebuilding of those stocks at risk, as well as touching upon the issue of the redeployment of the fishing fleet and of fishermen who were dependent upon the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her response, even though it was very short and curt.
Would the President-in-Office of the Council agree that fisheries are important to peripheral maritime areas throughout the Union where there is no alternative source of employment?
Would she also accept that in my country, Ireland, the fishing industry has not benefited to any great extent from its membership of the European Union, because the most prolific fishing grounds within a reasonable limit of our coast are being plundered by greedy maritime states within the Union.
Would she, during her term of office between now and the end of the year, investigate what could be done for areas right around the Irish coast, including my own area in the west of Ireland, which once had prolific fishing grounds that have certainly not been plundered by our small inshore fleet?
Would she also accept that regional development policies and fisheries policies should not be looked at in isolation, but in tandem?
The Council has given an answer to this question on several previous occasions. Of course, I understand the importance and relevance of this issue from Mr Gallagher' s point of view, but other than that, I stand by what I have said, and also reiterate that the Council had already stated its intentions regarding extensions, annual programmes, rebuilding stocks and the redeployment of fishing fleets and fishermen.
I can, therefore, only confirm the previous answers given by the Council to this question, whilst I clearly understand that this issue is a particular concern to Mr Gallagher.
Mr President, you did not give the Belgian Presidency the opportunity to reply to my follow-up question subsequent to my Question No 12.
Normally a follow-up question is answered, and a follow-up question to Question No 14 has just now been answered.
I thought it was rather impolite not to give the Belgian Presidency the opportunity to answer.
Mr SacrÃ©deus, Mrs Durant, the President-in-Office of the Council, has declined to reply to the question in some cases because she considered that she had already answered it, but I will communicate your request to Mrs Durant in any case.
It is up to Mrs Durant to consider whether it is a question or whether it has already been answered.
In any event, Mrs Durant, if you have any message for the Member, or any reply, you have the floor.
I would simply like to confirm, Mr President, that, as I said in my detailed answer to your question regarding these 16 individuals, I obviously hope, as does everyone in the House, that these people can be spared.
That goes without saying.
And that, as far as possible, during our bilateral contacts, given the difficulty of the current situation, even if, perhaps, it gives rise to something positive, since, in the last 24 hours, we have witnessed the liberation of Kabul, and possibly of Kandahar, and the retreat by the Taliban, I sincerely hope that everything can be done to identify these people and to save their lives. However, I cannot commit to taking specific and particular measures here and now.
In any case, bear in mind that everything that can be done will be done, but today, the situation on the ground in Afghanistan is extremely complicated.
In my question on a point of order, what specifically I pointed out was that, in my follow-up question, I had indicated that a whole new situation had arisen in Afghanistan and Kabul now that the Taliban regime had fled the capital.
The situation was different when this question was put to the Belgian Presidency a month ago and when the Belgian Presidency prepared its answer.
A new opening exists. I would therefore thank the Belgian Presidency for the follow-up answer it has given me, to the effect that it will take action on the new situation in Afghanistan.
Question No 15 by (H-0807/01):
Subject: Revision of the common position on Cuba On 11 July 2001 I asked the Council whether it intended to revise the EU's common position on its relations with Cuba.
On 5 September I received a detailed and satisfactory written answer.
I also welcome the Belgian Presidency's initiative aimed at resuming the dialogue with Cuba, a country which has shown a strong interest in cooperating with Europe and counts the EU Member States as its main economic partners.
Now that the President-in-Office of the Council has visited Havana and conveyed his impressions to the Council, I should like to raise the matter once again. Does it not appear anachronistic and out-of-place that Cuba should be the only Latin American country with which the European Union has not signed any kind of cooperation agreement, largely owing to the EU's current 'common position' on Cuba?
Does or does not the Council consider that the time has come to revise and update that common position, which does not reflect the stance taken by each of the Member States towards Cuba, and the text of which appears obsolete, in addition to the fact that it has not had any effect in the direction which its supporters claimed to have expected?
Is it correct that, in the current debate within the Council on the revision of the EU's common position on Cuba, there is one national government which is fundamentally opposed to any such revision, thus effectively blocking an updating which is in our view right, urgent and vital?
Once again, this honourable Assembly is inviting the presidency of the Council to discuss relations between Cuba and the European Union.
I therefore hope to seize this opportunity to reiterate several points, and perhaps to clear up some misunderstandings regarding these relations.
The European Union' s common position on Cuba remains the basis of the European Union' s policy on this country.
As laid down in the Treaty on European Union, common positions are an instrument of the EU' s common, foreign and security policy (see Article 12) and the decisions concerning the common foreign and security policy are taken unanimously (see Article 23).
At the ninth revision of the common position on Cuba on 25 June, the Council noted that the common position was still valid.
The EU' s objectives regarding Cuba are as before: to encourage a process of peaceful transition towards democratic pluralism and the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
In parallel with this, the Council has always shown its willingness to maintain an open and constructive dialogue on all the issues of common interest.
In June, the Council restated its intention to maintain this approach.
It also showed a favourable opinion on establishing an open, political dialogue and on finding a future framework agreement on cooperation based on the respect of democratic principles, the principles of human rights and the rule of law.
It is also in this spirit that an exploratory mission by the European Union' s troika, led by the deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Louis Michel, visited Havana on 23 and 24 August 2001.
Moreover, at the ninth revision of the common position, the Council urged the European Commission to step up its efforts to cooperate, particularly with civil and non-governmental organisations in Cuba, to enable greater numbers of EU players on the ground to contribute more effectively in achieving the objectives of the common position.
Furthermore, and as you yourself point out, the Member States of the European Union are Cuba' s main economic partners.
However, we must remember that it was the Cuban authorities who broke off dialogue between the European Union and Cuba, when they cancelled the EU' s troika mission at Director-General level, virtually the day before it was due to take place, on 27 and 28 April 2000.
It was also the Cuban authorities that, in May 2000, withdrew their request to sign up to the Cotonou agreement.
In addition, and as the Council already noted at the ninth revision of the common position, there has so far been no firm indication that the Cuban government has had a change of policy and is moving towards achieving the objectives of the common position.
The next meeting between the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs and the EU troika has been scheduled, at Cuba' s request, to run in parallel with the 55th UN General Assembly which is currently underway, and, at this moment in time, I am as yet unable to give you any details of this second meeting.
Mr President, the Minister' s reply leads me to ask her whether she is aware that, a few weeks ago, a delegation from the European Parliament visited Cuba.
During that visit, our colleagues spoke to the Cuban authorities, to the church, to NGOs and to the eleven resident Ambassadors of the countries of the Union.
All of them, apart from one Ambassador, agreed that the common position is useless, because it does not contribute to the progress of the Cubans nor to the progress of relations between the European Union and Cuba.
Therefore, the Minister, President-in-Office of the Council, must know that that common position has been surpassed, it is obsolete and an anachronism. It is unjust and scandalous that Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which the European Union does not have any cooperation agreement, which puts it in a difficult position - in the disastrous situation it is in at the moment - in terms of helping with the reconstruction of what was destroyed by Hurricane Michelle.
Mr President, as I said to you in my answer, I do believe that the recent visit by the European Union troika and the meeting, which is currently being held in parallel to the United Nations General Assembly, will certainly be of use to the Council' s work in this area.
Nonetheless, I am committed to our will and our objectives which still aim to encourage a process of peaceful transition and above all to develop a dialogue, which is as frank, open and as constructive as it possibly can be, on all the issues of common interest.
I can only confirm therefore the benefits of these bilateral relations and hope that they are able to be of use to the future positions of the Council.
Thank you very much, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. Your reply was really very interesting.
I was a member of the delegation referred to by Miguel Ãngel MartÃ­nez and I was able to witness the fact that NGOs, Ambassadors and even the so-called dissidents in Cuba consider the common position to be of little use.
I wanted to point out, Madam President, that if there are many Members here who feel the common position relating to Cuba is unjust, it is because, for example, we have a customs agreement with Turkey and we all know that Turkey does not comply with basic human rights.
In fact, the Kurdish Member of Parliament, Leyla Zana, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize, is in prison, and a European delegation has not been able to visit her over recent days.
We also have very special agreements with Morocco, another country which does not comply with human rights.
What we are saying is that the common position relating to Cuba demands that the latter make changes before we reach a cooperation agreement and that is what seems unfair to us, Madam President-in-Office of the Council.
We therefore always insist that this review - which is going to be at the last minute - should take account of the opinions of all these people in Cuba, and we also note that two different yardsticks are being used.
Although it is not a question, Mrs Durant can make a comment if she considers it appropriate.
Question No 16 by (H-0810/01):
Subject: Reversing depopulation in rural areas Has the Council, under the Belgian Presidency of the EU and in consultation with the forthcoming Spanish Presidency, considered the need for an active EU policy aimed at reversing depopulation in rural areas in the Member States, including Ireland, will it make a statement on the issues to be considered, including financial aspects, pilot projects, studies and involvement of relevant NGOs, and will it call on the Commission to publish a Communication on policies aimed at reversing depopulation in rural areas?

First of all, I would like to reiterate that, as part of the European regional policy and particularly in the current 2000-2006 programming period, there is the possibility of supporting economic and social redevelopment in Objective 2 rural areas, which have a population of less than 100 inhabitants per kilometre.
The Council would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, following the Commission' s presentation of the second report on economic and social cohesion, representatives from the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament met last June, at the initiative of the Swedish Presidency of the Council, in Lycksele, in the north of Sweden, in order to share their experiences and discuss the future of depopulated zones, including rural areas, a matter on which the presidency that Belgium assumed this quarter, continues to work.
The Council believes that the first thing we must do, at this stage, is to seek to use the full potential of the current regulations in order to combat depopulation and impoverishment of specific rural areas.
This task is primarily down to the Member States, which should respect the criteria defined at Community level.
Given that the Commission' s proposals for the future programming period are not expected until 2004, the Council believes that it is still too early to launch a new debate on the implementation of European Union policy for rural areas that are depopulated or becoming depopulated, which would extend beyond what is currently in force.
I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her reply.
Does she agree that there is a need for greater coordination between national policies and those designed to achieve rural development objectives and that there should be more concentration on decentralisation and the creation of new employment opportunities in the regions?
What new action can now be taken to encourage and achieve this objective?
Will the President-in-Office of the Council ensure that this matter is placed on the agenda for further consideration by the Spanish Presidency?
I can only confirm what I have just said, in other words, that I believe, and the Council also believes, that the full potential of the current regulations must be exploited.
Given that this concerns a Community framework in which specific actions must be taken by Member States, I am in favour of going further in using the current regulations, rather than prematurely engaging in another debate on the implementation of a policy for these areas.
I think that the existing framework can be better exploited, not only at Community level, but also, and more importantly, at a lower level, in other words at the level of Member States which must strive to implement policies within the context of criteria defined at Community level.
Question No 17 by (H-0814/01):
Subject: European citizenship, students and state benefits Has the Council considered the conclusions of the European Court of Justice handed down in its ruling of 20 September 2001 (following a case brought by a French student studying in Belgium who had been refused a minimum living allowance) which confirm that students living in a Member State other than their own are entitled to the same benefits as nationals of the host state and that the judgment was retroactive, and the immediate implications for all the Member States resulting from that judgment?
Judgment EC 184/99 that you mention, Mr Crowley, was only handed down on 20 September 2001.
The Council has not yet had an opportunity to study the full implications of the issue and, as is standard practice, the Council will respect the judgment of the Court and will, of course, draw conclusions from this.
In any case, it is up to the Member States to draw conclusions from the judgment.
This is a rather short answer, but this is simply because the judgment has only very recently been handed down.
I appreciate and understand the constraints which the President-in-Office of the Council has with this question.
However, on a number of occasions in this House I have raised the issue with regard to, in particular, Erasmus students who have been treated differently in different Member States.
One of the consequences of this judgment is that there will now be an obligation on all Member States to ensure that there is a common system available to give assistance to those students who are in Erasmus programmes or who are studying in full-time programmes in countries other than their own Member States.
Therefore I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to bring up this matter immediately at the next Council meeting, if possible so that there will be no more delays, so that opportunities will no longer be denied to many students who have not benefited up to now, or whose parents have had to pay for them to study abroad; and so that these anomalies and inequalities will be removed in future.
I can only take note of your formal and urgent request to bring up this issue and repeat that the Council will respect the judgment passed by the Court as soon as it has studied all the consequences and implications of this judgment.
I shall, however, take note of the fact that you would like the Council to bring up this matter.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether she can confirm my belief that European citizens are entitled to benefit from this decision, whether or not the Member States have put provisions in place to interpret the decision?
Am I correct in thinking that from the date the decision is made citizens are entitled to benefit from it?
At this stage, and because the Court handed down this judgment so recently, I do wish to stand by what I said, but I certainly understand the way you would like to interpret this judgment.
I do hope that the Council will have time to study the implications of the judgment and to identify how far it is possible to confirm, invalidate or interpret the question you have asked.
I therefore hope that the Council will be given the time it needs to examine the implications, and therefore the consequences of the judgment that the Court handed down in September.
Mr President, on a point of order.
For information, I am referring to a previous Court decision which decided that, irrespective of whether a Member State had put implementing provisions in place arising from its decisions or the decisions of the Council or the Commission, citizens are entitled to benefit from those decisions.
I am simply asking the President-in-Office of the Council if she can confirm that the outcome of this particular court decision means that citizens will benefit, whatever those benefits may be, from the date of the decision and that no Member State is entitled to seek to restrict that.
As President for the sitting, I take note of your interpretation.
It has been communicated to the Council.
I shall take note of the points that you have put forward, but I stand by the answer that I have given.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 18 and 19 will be taken together.
Question No 18 by (H-0816/01):
Subject: Sellafield and the threat of terrorist attacks The European Council, meeting on 21 September 2001 in the wake of the terrible events in the United States, declared that terrorism is a real challenge to the world and to Europe.
It has moved to block the funding of terrorist organisations as a decisive aspect of meeting this challenge.
What contingency plans has the Council considered to respond to the threat of attack by terrorists on nuclear installations in the EU, and, in particular, on the Sellafield plant, taking into account the totally unacceptable decision of the British Environment Secretary to give the go-ahead on 3 October 2001 for the opening of the MOX (mixed oxide) plant at Sellafield, formal approval of which had been delayed because of the falsification of records by BNFL?
Will it now use its good offices to urge the UK government to rescind its latest decision, will it call on the Commission to intervene in this matter, and does it accept that the only solution is the closure of the Sellafield plant?
Question No 19 by (H-0824/01):

Subject: Sellafield MOX Fuel Plant In the light of the UK government' s approval on 3 October 2001 of a new plutonium fuel facility at the Sellafield nuclear complex, will the Council state its position on this proposal, particularly with regard to the security aspects, given that there are worrying reports that such a facility will increase the global trade in plutonium, that such trade will increase the threat to global security, that transportation of 'weapons usable' material makes it vulnerable to terrorists and that the atrocity of 11 September raises the risk that Sellafield could be targeted by terrorists, with catastrophic results for the populations of the UK, Ireland and globally.
The Â£470m MOX Plant, built five years ago by the state-owned British Nuclear Fuels plc but not yet operational, has yet to establish that the economic benefits of such a plant outweigh the health and environmental detriments, as it is required to do under EU law.
At the extraordinary session of 21 September, the Council decided that the fight against terrorism will, now more than ever, be a strategic priority of the European Union.
It is clear from the many meetings that the various Council formations and the European Council have held and will hold on this issue under the Belgian Presidency that the Council attaches a great deal of importance to this fight.
From this point of view, we should also reiterate the European Union, in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council meetings of 8 and 9 October 2001, reaffirms its commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament.
More specifically, regarding the two questions that have been asked, the Council would like to draw attention to the fact that, overall, measures concerning the physical security of nuclear plants are an area of national competence.
Quite aside from the specific circumstances that you mention, the Euratom Treaty specified safeguards of nuclear materials used for civil use in the European Union, in other words, all the measures that enable us to verify that nuclear materials and equipment are not used for anything other than the peaceful purposes for which they are intended.
It is up to the Commission to ensure that these provisions and the ensuing Community regulations are implemented, particularly Regulation No 3227/76 concerning the application of the provisions on Euratom safeguards.
The Euratom Safeguards Office has the specific task of verifying, by deploying inspectors if necessary, that the operators of nuclear power plants respect the security control obligations enshrined in the treaty, as well as those stipulated in Regulation No 3227/76.
There are several legally binding instruments at international level, which the United Kingdom and the other Member States are party, such as the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material of 3 March 1980, several provisions of which cover, for example, the theft or other illicit means of obtaining nuclear materials, and which require other Member States that are contracting parties to cooperate and assist the party that is the victim of the crime.
More generally, the Treaty on European Union contains provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters among Member States, notably in Article 29.
It is on this basis that the Council is currently examining a proposal for a Council framework decision on the fight against terrorism.
This proposal includes provisions drawing up - a list of terrorist offences in Article 3, a list of minimum sentences and penalties in Article 5, as well as provisions on extradition and prosecution in Article 11 and cooperation between Member States in Article 12.
I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her lengthy reply, much of which I have heard before.
Is the President-in-Office of the Council aware that British Nuclear Fuels is technically insolvent?
Is she aware that its liabilities for cleaning up after the closure of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste run to GBP 34 billion, while it has GBP 235 million worth of shareholders' funds on its balance sheets?
Would she also agree, under those circumstances, that there is not the slightest economic justification for the continuation of the Sellafield nuclear plant, let alone for seeking to expand its nuclear operations into the future, and that, indeed, the plant should be closed?
If the Commission would - as we have requested for years - have an independent nuclear inspectorate look into the Sellafield operation, they would have found this out some years ago.
Perhaps they can find it out now.
I would like to draw the President-in-Office of the Council's attention to the fact that she has not addressed the second part of my question relating to the fact that British Nuclear Fuels has not yet established the economic benefits of the MOX fuel plant, which it is obliged to do before it can commission it under existing EU regulations.
I would also draw her attention to the report of Parliament's STOA Committee.
This is a research committee which has commissioned an extensive report on both the Sellafield plant and Cap La Hague plants, and it has raised fairly serious concerns about the emissions to air and water from both the Cap La Hague and the Sellafield plants.
It draws attention to the inadequacy of the Commission's capacity to carry out its functions under the Euratom Treaty, and it has also drawn attention to a German study which has indicated that both the Cap La Hague and Sellafield plants have something like ten times the permitted dispersal-to-air of radioactive pollution.
I would say in response that the work, the responsibilities that you expect in terms of control or arbitration are responsibilities that have been passed on to the Commission and I am not currently in a position to give you, on behalf of the Council, any details on these.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I have asked the President-in-Office of the Council if she would address the second part of my question, and she has not done so either in her first or second replies.
The President-in-Office of the Council may judge whether she has sufficiently replied to the question.
Mr President, the second point was in fact more of an observation that you made as part of your question.
However, with regard to this comment, I can only repeat that these details are more of a matter for the Commission than the Council, as far as, for example, conformity to Community legislation is concerned.
As the author is not present, Question No 20 lapses.
Question No 21 by (H-0820/01):
Subject: Dioxin rules threaten fish in the Baltic A Commission proposal on the limit values for dioxin in fish could be a death blow to the Swedish fishing industry.
According to the Swedish Fisheries Board, the proposal would probably result in a total ban on the sale of salmon and eels from the Baltic.
The sale of Baltic-caught herring and small Baltic herring for human consumption would also be at risk.
In the worst case two or three thousand fishermen could lose their jobs. Sweden will be hardest hit as Finland and Denmark also have fishing grounds in the Atlantic.
It is important not to act in too much haste in this matter.
The Swedish view is that for the time being it would be better to provide dietary advice on how often fish may be eaten, combined with a vigorous campaign against the release of dioxins, than to set limit values.
That was regarded as satisfactory in public health terms as the quantities of toxin are extraordinarily low and fish is an important source of nutrition.
Could the Council adjust the Commission proposal to avoid the destruction of much of Sweden' s fishing industry?
The presidency of the Council is currently focusing all its efforts with a view to reaching a solution that gives a balanced compromise, which will enable us to guarantee the protection of public health, whilst avoiding creating the sort of economic disruption that you described.
The presidency is thus in close contact with the Commission and members of the Council, so that this solution can be approved by the Council by the end of November 2001, during which time the Council is due to issue an opinion given that the Commission' s proposals were submitted at the end of August 2001.
I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer.
I think it is extremely positive that an attempt is being made to reach a compromise. I intended to ask the Council of Ministers whether the compromise is based not upon absolute limit values but upon applying dietary recommendations in connection with the consumption of fish from the Baltic.
Is it a compromise along those lines that is being considered?
I also want to emphasise that the opportunity to eat herring from the Baltic, including the variety indigenous to the Baltic, is not only an economic issue but also an important cultural issue.
Prohibiting fish from the Baltic would be rather like prohibiting mussels and pommes frites in Belgium, something I imagine would be unthinkable.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would say that this is a question of an almost cultural nature.
You may reply to it as you see fit, subject to the relevant consultations with the Council' s team.
At this stage, it is difficult for me to clarify the subject of these recommendations.
I can tell you, however, that if there were no chips in Belgium, this would, in my view, be a considerable national problem.
It would, however, be of secondary importance in relation to the question that is of concern to you, but it is difficult for me to respond to this question at the moment, as it will relate to both the nature of the recommendations which will be made and also to finding the best possible compromise from an economic or any other point of view.
As the author is not present, Question No 22 lapses.
Question No 23 by (H-0838/01):
Subject: Belgian Presidency and the Regulation on models and designs Has the Belgian Presidency succeeded in convincing the Member State whose attitude was preventing the Regulation on models and designs from being adopted?
In response to your question, the Council would like to inform you that it noted, at the 27 September meeting of the Internal Market, Consumer and Tourism Council that there are no longer any barriers in the way of adopting the proposal for a regulation on the Community designs or models.
The proposal is currently being finalised by the legal linguists and is scheduled to be formally adopted by the Council at the end of November, or at the beginning of December.
I would first of all like to congratulate the Belgian Presidency on having managed to convince the Belgian government to withdraw the linguistic objections which, according to what was said earlier, were hindering the approval of the Regulation on models and designs.
Furthermore, we are pleased that, again under the Belgian Presidency, this Regulation, which is so essential to the operation of the internal market, and also to the operation of the Office for the Harmonisation of the Internal Market in Alicante, can be approved immediately.
It is not a question and therefore, unless the President-in-Office of the Council wishes to make any comment, we can end this Question Time by stating, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 24 to 27 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was adjourned at 7.02 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Cross-border payments in euro
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0357/2001) by Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on cross-border payments in euros [COM(2001) 439 - C5-0379/2001 - 2001/0174(COD)]
Mr President, in 1990, the Commission issued a Green Paper on payments, and that marked the beginning of talks with banks about cross-border payments, among other things.
Initially, the banks expressed objections, with good reason, and we have worked for years to accommodate those objections.
We now have an international bank account number, the IBAN, we have a bank identifier code, the BIC, the reporting requirements to the Central Bank have been lifted when amounts up to EUR 12 500 are involved, and that coincides with the permitted maximum of the money-laundering directive.
There is a format to transfer payments fully automatically.
To my disappointment, this resulted only in ever more expensive transfers.
At the end of 2000, Mr Bolkestein and myself were in this plenary when the Commissioner promised on that occasion that he would take measures if nothing had changed in the first six months of this year.
In July, the Commission and Parliament established, each following their own extensive inquiries, that nothing had changed.
Quite the reverse, in fact: the situation had deteriorated.
The Commissioner kept his promise and presented his Regulation, and I realise that the banks have simply missed two opportunities.
In November 2000 and even in July of this year, there would have been enough time to set up a substantial self-regulation scheme, something which all parties would have preferred to this wrap over the knuckles.
The European Banking Association has made a manful attempt to set up a cheap payment structure, step one followed by step two, for which they also received praise by the European Central Bank in its 2000 annual report.
I would endorse this, but would at the same time express my astonishment about the fact that only a very small number of banks have joined the initiative.
Much to the delight of Parliament, the Council in Ghent expressed its approval of the Regulation, and we hope that this will impact positively on the Internal Market Council.
I will now turn my attention to the amendments.
I am unable to support Amendment No 9 on self-regulation.
As I have already stated, although we welcome the idea of self-regulation, the proposal should have been backed by all banks.
It should be accompanied by monitoring, guarantees, sanctions, etc. However, the liberal amendment creates confusion about the date of entry into force and in strict legal terms, something like that cannot be provided for in this Regulation.
The other new amendments are the result of the sound cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for this sound cooperation.
I now have high hopes for the Internal Market Council reaching agreement on 26 November, something which the Ghent Summit called for.
The changes I would propose with regard to the Commission position are as follows.
First of all, I have suggested changing the date of entry into effect from 1 January to 1 March, by which date all countries will have completed their transitional periods.
Moreover, at this rate, we will not make 1 January with the notification in the Official Journal practically speaking.
I would propose a few amendments, namely 10, 13 and 16 with regard to cheques.
I do not want cheques to fall within the principle of equal costs as referred to in Article 3, because an increasing number of banks would actually like to do away with the cross-border cheque.
Guarantees concerning cheques are very different in all countries.
The cheque does remain within the scope of the transparency section of the Regulation, which is stipulated in Article 4.
Another proposal for change concerns the obligation to communicate with the banking country by using the IBAN and BIC codes.
Some banks, such as the Postbank and Internet banks, have their own codes and should not, therefore, be forced to use the IBAN and BIC codes.
Finally, I should like to turn to Mrs Torres Marques' earlier amendment.
Some Member States had difficulty coming to terms with yet another institution, and that was never our intention.
We have solved the matter with a consideration for redress procedures and an article about sanctions, something which we happen to attach great importance to.
I should like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for his courage and for the fact that he kept his promise.
His offices were always available for consultation, and all this could well result in this Regulation ending its march through the institutions on a positive note.
Parliament is expected to provide broad support.
Mr President, we have certainly had a packed agenda today.
We have had research from Mr Caudron, we have voted on Mr Jarzembowski's report on port services and we have had shipbuilding courtesy of Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, but looking up at the people in the galleries I have to say that these may all have been important issues for the economy or for society, but in many cases it will have been nothing but gobbledegook to our listeners.
This issue is different.
Last summer in Austria I, myself, unintentionally parked illegally and felt dreadfully guilty.
However, my bad conscience about this parking offence was very quickly eclipsed by concern about how much it would cost me to transfer the 200 Austrian schillings for this parking ticket from Germany to Austria.
I therefore went straight to the Austrian authorities and paid in cash because I was afraid that the bank charges might be more than the actual fine.
This is an experience familiar to many people.
What is decisive, and this is something which we should also always bear in mind in this House, is how Europe measures up when people encounter it in their everyday lives, and in many of the areas on which we are working it proves to be far from perfect.
On 1 January we will get the euro.
There is a German word, 'begreifen', which means to understand, but which incorporates a notion of grasping or touching.
The public will be able to touch the euro and that is why confidence in the euro will grow from that moment on.
However, we must also make sure that all of the appropriate arrangements are in place so that the public are able to treat payments within Europe in the same way as payments within their own countries.
That is why this regulation is incredibly important, and I very much regret the fact that the idea of it has only just occurred to the Commission.
I drafted an opinion once before, nine months ago.
At that time I was still being told by the Commission that there were steep mountain tracks between the banks, and I said that if money could be made with mountain tracks it would be.
If money can be made with motorways then it will be.
We need motorways in the banking sector too.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank Mrs Peijs for her persistence and consistency, which have certainly paid off here.
In 47 days the euro coins and notes will be available to everyone in the euro zone as a common currency, in my opinion, the greatest European Union project ever in terms of creating identity and fostering integration.
The euro zone will be a domestic market within the internal market.
We are all called upon to do all we can, not only in connection with cross-border payments, to bring down the barriers to the creation of this domestic financial market.
The difference in cost between national and cross-border transfers in the domestic market stands in contradiction to our objectives.
A Commission study has shown that although these charges have been steadily falling since 1993, even today, at some banks, people are still having to fork out up to EUR 24 to transfer EUR 100 to another country in the EU.
That is why this Commission proposal and the report are needed.
Nevertheless, I wish to say on behalf of my group that we would welcome a genuine system of bank self-regulation, a system which is sustainable, comprehensive and credible.
It is true that the proposals currently on the table are moving in the direction of a system of self-regulation of this kind, but we do not think that they go far enough.
That is also why this report is being tabled here.
Should a credible and sustainable system of self-regulation be forthcoming then we would be prepared to vote against the regulation at the next reading, which would allow the Commission not to implement its proposal for a regulation.
However, we are waiting on the banks.
The ball is in their court.
We must adopt this approach because none of the measures taken so far have been sufficient.
Mr President, I speak on behalf of Mrs Torres Marques, who for pressing reasons cannot be here, but I shall keep to her ideas and the meaning of her speech.
The European Parliament and especially its Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has for years been insisting on the need for banks to set up payment systems in the euro zone that would allow citizens to use the euro as if it were a national currency.
Despite the existence of fixed exchange rates between the various currencies in the euro zone, cross-border payments are processed with the same charges as domestic payments.
The citizens do not understand this: why are payments within the euro zone processed as if they were international payments?
Is there or is there not a euro payment zone?
The banks have perfected their credit and debit card and electronic purse payment systems at a national level, they have perfected their international operations, and they have forgotten about the euro area.
Well, the euro zone is for us a region with a single currency which should have monetary rules in common that are easily understood by the citizens.
It is just as well that when a recent Commission study revealed that, far from having fallen, transfer charges in the euro zone had remained high, it showed the need for the draft regulation that we are now examining. The regulation seeks, from January 2002, to equalise the charges for cross-border credit and debit card transfers that each bank performs in its own domestic market.
The Commission proposes that the same should occur with bank transfers and cheques from January 2003 onwards.
The Party of European Socialists agrees with the rapporteur' s proposals, and therefore this draft regulation deserves our approval; we also hope that an agreement can be reached with the Council at first reading.
Implementation of the regulation must not, in any event, cause domestic charges to rise.
In fact, cross-border transfers only represent 1% of the total payments made by the banks, and they are electronic payments which entail an effective reduction in staff costs for the banking system.
Thus any use of this regulation to raise charges on domestic payments must be firmly rejected by the European institutions.
The citizens have, in fact, already condemned and rejected it.
Of the main amendments approved, we highlight the one concerning the penalties to be applied in the event of infringement of the regulation by any banking organisation, as well as an indication of the procedures to follow in other situations, so as to give some assurance to the citizens who use the euro.
I believe that, with the approval of this regulation, Parliament will be contributing to a smooth launch of the new currency for the citizens, giving the euro greater credibility and strength, and easing the indispensable cultural and economic transition.
We hope that, after the decision of the Ghent European Council, this legislation will be approved as quickly as possible.
This political decision will be good for the euro zone, but most of all it will be good for the European Union.
Mr President, sometimes in politics, we have to make a choice between something that is terrible and something that is unpleasant, and now is, in fact, one of those times.
A solution to the problem of cross-border payments is now really in sight, and that is surely something to be welcomed.
Partly thanks to the tenacity of this Parliament, an arrangement will be put in place, and I think that the name of our rapporteur will remain inextricably linked with this.
Her tenacity has largely resulted in the current proposal to do something about this problem.
Consumers and businesses must be able to rely on efficient, safe and cheap services in the field of cross-border payments in the internal market once the new currency has been introduced.
After all, this euro offers the opportunity of bringing Europe truly closer to the citizen, as was stated a moment ago, and of making Europe tangible.
That is why it must be possible to use this currency as European currency without obstructions or excessive costs.
Not one citizen will understand why the remittance of euros from one country to another involves such high costs.
The banks are responsible for this, for that is where the problem lies.
But, needless to say, it is not those banks, but we as politicians, who ultimately get the blame. After all, we have launched the euro, so we are saddled with the problem.
However, it is not just our problem, it is also the problem of the banks.
In the first place, that is why the conversion must be as smooth as possible and it is therefore a good idea to concentrate all our efforts on that event.
Banks must be able to give their full attention to the successful introduction of the euro notes and coins at the beginning of next year and after that, the euro zone can, in terms of payments, develop into one country with one market.
In my view, the new amendments tabled by our rapporteur are particularly fitting in this connection, and we will be supporting them.
What we do not like in the proposal is that it could, of course, lead to a situation in which even the internal payments, which are, or at least seem to be, now mostly free, will become more expensive for the consumer.
That too will do nothing to boost the euro' s popularity.
It is therefore important to avoid this situation.
Finally, why is it a choice between two evils?
We are not bankers and therefore do not know how bank charges should be calculated, nor do we want to know, in all honesty, for that is why we have bankers.
Self-regulation is therefore the big favourite as far as our group is concerned.
We have tabled an amendment in this connection.
Should this not be accepted, and the banks have so far not been sufficiently prepared to do something about this, then these measures will unfortunately be inevitable.
Mr President, the introduction of the euro has created great expectations with the citizens.
One of those expectations is that when they use the euro in the relevant Member States, they will pay the same price for using means of payment other than cash.
It is therefore unsatisfactory that shortly before the introduction of the euro, an adequate solution has still not been found to the problem of charges for cross-border payments.
In this matter, a large proportion of the blame must be apportioned to the banks and financial institutions.
Self-regulation in the sector appears not to be working.
That is why I have great admiration for the efforts by Commissioner Bolkestein and rapporteur Peijs, who tenaciously worked to find a solution.
There are sound arguments why banks should not charge anything at all for electronic cross-border payments.
Current technology enables these payment transactions to be carried out at low cost and the same technology can also be used for cross-border payments.
The use of different charges is not desirable and contravenes the concept of an internal payment market and a common currency.
For banks, electronic payment means a saving since less labour-intensive PIN payments are encouraged.
I therefore support the view of the European Commission and rapporteur Peijs, and hope that a prompt introduction of this measure will strengthen consumer confidence.
Mr President, on 26 October 2000, I explained to Parliament why the current level of bank charges on cross-border payments in Europe are due to technical obstacles which will disappear in time, or so we hope, but which are currently unavoidable.
Under these circumstances, the reason why some Members are portraying them as evil is because they are inexorably seeking to achieve a uniform internal market and because there has been a backlash from the pro-euro propaganda, which promised the impossible.
Having made these points, I shall leave it there.
The proposal for a regulation that is before us today belongs to the next stage.
Since the market is putting up some resistance, it is proposed that we use force to make it submit, by decreeing compulsory equality of bank charges on internal transactions, as on cross-border transactions.
We believe this text is untimely, not only because it denies the realities of the market, which will exact their revenge in one way or another in the future, but for four other reasons.
The first is that it undermines subsidiarity, because this issue should be a matter for Member States.
The second is that it undermines the freedom of pricing, which we actually believed was carefully safeguarded by the Commission. For the euro, however, which of our grand principles would we not allow to be sacrificed?
The third is that it undermines the commitments repeatedly made to use regulation as sparingly as possible because, in being directly applied to the Member States, such regulation undermines the national parliaments' power of transposition, which is, in fact, perfectly legitimate.
The fourth and final reason is that this will lead to many rather veiled forms of unequal treatment of citizens, since the actual, but banned, costs of cross-border payments will have to be passed on to other banking products.
There, then, are many more reasons than are needed for rejecting this regulation.
Mr President, Parliament has for years demanded that the Commission take action so that consumers' bank charges in the euro area can be reduced.
The current situation, in which for a payment of EUR 100 you may have to pay as much as EUR 23 bank handling charges, cannot be tolerated.
Other colleagues, too, have referred to this matter.
Besides, at the beginning of next year the problem will only get bigger, when twelve euro area Member States move over to euro cash.
Developing the payment system and reducing the costs incurred both by banks and subsequently by consumers is therefore one of the top-priority items on the 'urgent' list of our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I am sure that the Commission will agree with this target we have, but the means to achieve it differ in part from Parliament' s original wishes.
Structural problems must not be solved by force.
Cross-border bank charges can permanently be reduced only, and indeed only, if we are able to create technical standards for automated handling of payments in the euro area.
The current high costs are caused by the fact that payments have to be processed manually.
This paper chase, as old as Adam, is costing both time and money.
However, since there is not sufficient consensus in the banking sector so that this kind of technical standard could have been produced, Parliament has in several reports on the matter emphasised the role of the European Central Bank in the development of a payment system.
In fact, Parliament did, towards the end of last year, demand that the ECP should assemble a working group of qualified experts in the field, who would be given the task to create a suitable standard.
The idea of Parliament was that the group would have carried out the work during this year and a proposal would have been made public before Christmas.
In this way, a new standard, binding upon all banks, would factually have existed before the euro zero hour at the turn of the year, after which the commercial banks could have implemented it at their required time schedules.
This kind of arrangement would naturally have also given a competitive edge to those financial institutions, which are able to make a transfer to the new system faster than others.
It is regrettable that this was not achieved.
Therefore, this time it is unavoidable that we have to read the Commission report, which in all respects truly is not in accordance with Parliament' s original wishes.
Mr President, I think that the Commission proposal has, in fact, come just at the right time, better late than never, and makes it clear that the currency union is not only being completed in the interests of the markets and business, but also in the interests of consumers.
I should like to recall that we have been working on this issue for over 10 years, as the rapporteur rightly said, and that we have always supported self-regulation and voluntary agreements, but that in this sector it has, in the end, always been necessary to adopt legislation, in order for example to bring about quicker, more reliable and above all cheaper transfers.
Here I am, of course, also thinking of the double charges which both those who made transfers and those who received them had to pay.
Happily, this is now in the past, but this experience in the European Parliament taught us precisely that it is necessary to enact legislation.
That is why I welcome both the tone and form of the regulation.
It does not dictate prices, but it does state quite clearly that domestic and cross-border credit transfers must be treated on the same footing because we are in an internal market.
This internal market requires a European payment system, and not just for large payments, like TARGET, but also for retail payments, for the transfer of small amounts.
Everyone is affected by this: mothers or fathers who have children studying or undergoing training abroad; those of us who order books or wish to pay for a journey or a hotel in another European country.
Those who have a holiday flat or even a holiday home are affected by this.
All of them suffer as a result of this situation, including migrant workers who receive their wages in one country and want to send them home to their families.
We need to think of them.
An average of EUR 24 to transfer EUR 100 is quite simply too much and unacceptable.
I strongly reject Mr Maaten's proposal.
We have tried everything; now we need to make decisions.
I must also say that I do not understand Mr Karas's plea.
Why should a proposal be forthcoming now, in the next two or three weeks, when it has been overdue for over 15 years?
I have to say also that the proposals to postpone all of this to 2005 are really unacceptable in my view.
The rapporteur's argument is as far as I am prepared to go, and I therefore think that we need to secure a broad majority in favour of this long-awaited project here in Parliament, because a European payment system would have been a reality long ago if the banks and building societies had wanted it.
Mr President, it is clear that the banks have been toying with this issue for years and have, at long last, thrown away this opportunity, making it necessary to introduce binding rules in a regulation.
It is not on for EUR 18 of bank charges to be debited for transfers of, say, EUR 100, and often this is done twice, once from the sender's account and once from the recipient's.
It is not on quite simply because the financial institutions have, for some considerable time, had the technical means to carry out transfers, honour cheques and make card payments quickly and at a reasonable cost.
We must be careful to ensure, however, and this has already been mentioned several times - that, as cross-border charges go down, domestic charges are not increased correspondingly.
Should this be the case then, in the future, domestic charges will also have to be laid down in a regulation.
We should clarify this too.
One snag is the fact that there are moves to postpone the deadline by two months.
On this point, I am afraid that I cannot go along with the rapporteur.
The banks have always been able to raise interest rates and bank charges overnight.
In the space of a month and a half it will now also be possible for them to lower their charges to a standard level.
I hope that there is not a majority in favour of the amendments concerned.
Mr President, I thank the Commission for the brave proposal for a Regulation and congratulate Mrs Peijs for her long-term commitment to this matter, without which we probably would have been unable to convince the Commission and the Council of the need for this legislative initiative.
In fact, I also support all amendments which Mrs Peijs has tabled on behalf of our group.
Despite this, it is regrettable that some three years following the launch of the electronic euro and on the eve of 1 January 2002, we are still having to work on a piece of legislation of this kind.
It is beyond me why the banks, which otherwise find each other so promptly and efficiently in a cross-border context and are united in effective professional organisations, should be forced by law to organise themselves properly and to automate in order to be able to work more cost-effectively in the internal market, and no longer to discriminate.
The binding nature of the non-discrimination rule will raise a few eyebrows, but there is no alternative: leaving things as they are would be worse, for we would then accept what some small businesses and consumers fear, namely that the benefits of the euro will pass them by and that cross-border payments will continue to cost some EUR 20 each.
As we cannot afford to lose the confidence of the consumers or of small businesses, we have no choice.
There is one concern I have, and I should like to ask the Commissioner a question in that connection.
How can we prevent this Regulation from being seized by the banks as an excuse to increase the charges for domestic payments, and how does the Commission itself view this proposal?
Is it being regarded as a big stick in order to get a last-minute gentlemen' s agreement out of the banks or, Commissioner, do you intend to continue to move towards a Regulation?
I hope that you as Commissioner remain resolute.
Mr President, as Mrs Peijs stated a moment ago, I was standing on the same spot in this House in October last year, talking about the same issue, namely the establishment of a common payment area.
The Commission had just published its fourth or fifth communication on that subject and in it, it was stipulated that the internal market and the single currency had to be accompanied by a common payment area.
This Parliament then levelled criticism at the Commission for being too passive.
I remember this well.
Mrs Peijs wondered when the Commission would spring into action.
Well, the Commission has listened carefully to Mrs Peijs and has acted accordingly, no one will be able to deny this now.
The Commission has submitted a draft Regulation which is based on a simple principle, namely that each payment in euro is to cost the same, irrespective of whether the payment is national or cross-border.
This is of the utmost importance to the citizens, as has been noted by many Members of this Parliament.
Today, the euro is a virtual currency, especially for the citizens, but on 1 January 2002, the currency will become tangible, for from that date onwards, 300 million Europeans will be using the same bank notes and coins.
Today, European citizens still accept that a cross-border payment costs more than a national one. The reason is that different currencies are involved, but after 1 January, that will no longer be the case.
The citizens will then question the usefulness of the euro if cross-border payments are still as expensive as they are now.
In this connection, I should like to remind you that our latest study into the cost of cross-border payments has yielded baffling results.
It transpired that in the year 2001, a cross-border payment of EUR 100 costs no less than EUR 24 on average.
We carried out a similar study in 1993 and unfortunately, we had to establish that no progress at all had been made in eight years.
That is why the Commission has decided to introduce a Regulation as a tool.
The market itself has failed to come up with solutions to the posed problem, and with this interventionist measure, the legislator wants to force the economic operators to set up the infrastructure which the market requires.
As Mrs Peijs knows, I am a staunch Liberal, and I regret the fact that I had no choice but to propose such a binding document for the banks.
However, it is the only way to persuade the economic operators to take great pains over the new systems which are vital for the smooth running of the internal market.
It is therefore with satisfaction that I have noted that the first results are rolling in.
In one section of the bank sector, the plan is now being put forward to set up a new system for cross-border payments.
And that proves that the present proposal for a Regulation is also realistic.
After all, the saying 'where there is a will, there is a way' also applies to the bank sector.
What took me rather by surprise is the idea of the bank sector that since they, as banks, have committed to implementing the plan, we, as Commission, can withdraw our proposal for a Regulation.
Firstly, we should not overlook the fact that this plan can only count on a proportion of the bank sector.
Indeed, there are three European pressure groups for banking and only one of those has written to me to propose this plan.
That is an important fact.
After all, a payment system is a network, and a network develops at the rate of the slowest members that belong to it.
All it takes is for a few members of a network to refuse to develop any further, and that will throw a spanner in the works for the other members.
That is, in fact, one of the reasons why in the past ten years, no progress has been made whatsoever.
Secondly, the proposed plan is too late.
It was only announced in a press release two weeks prior to the discussion of the proposal in Parliament.
However, the Commission has been asking for this matter to be looked into for the past eleven years, but in all that time, too little progress has been made, and for those reasons, the Commission is unable to give a positive response to those MEPs who proposed to grant the bank sector a certain level of self-regulating authority.
The bank sector has had sufficient time, and it, at least a section of it, is now coming up with a proposal.
It is too little, too late, and that is why the Commission must resort to the proposals of a Regulation.
It is therefore illogical to demand withdrawal of the proposal just before the first benefits are becoming visible.
Accordingly, the idea to suspend the Regulation, as proposed in Amendment No 9 by Mr Maaten, seems unacceptable to me.
I repeat what I have said a moment ago: the proposals for self-regulation are too late.
Any call from the Commission to the banking world is being, or has been, backed by this Parliament, which is encouraging.
In this connection, I would praise many MEPs and particularly the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, who has worked tenaciously to achieve the goal, namely to reduce the cost of transfers.
In this respect, Mrs Peijs is the mouthpiece of the citizens and illustrates the great significance for industry, not least the small- and medium-size enterprises.
The Commission proposal specifically embodies what is referred to as the Europe of the citizens.
I should like to turn to yet another bone of contention, namely the date on which the present draft Regulation should enter into force.
Some MEPs have in this connection referred to the opinion of the European Central Bank which states that the ECB is in complete agreement with the objectives which we aim to achieve with our proposal, but that we, the Commission, are said to go too fast and are too demanding.
The bottom line in the ECB' s argument is that the banks need more time to set up the necessary infrastructure and logistical provisions.
That is why the European Central Bank proposes 1 January 2005 for the Regulation to come into force.
On the one hand, I do not dispute the fact that time will be needed to set up this infrastructure, but on the other hand, we should not make a mountain out of a molehill.
After all, for years, banks have claimed that cross-border payments only account for 1% of the total transfers.
Consequently, the entry into force of the Regulation in 2003 will not involve insurmountable additional costs, and if our expectations are fulfilled and if it transpires that the price reduction results in a greater use of this means of payment, then there will be even more reason to go full steam ahead with the activities.
The report by Mrs Peijs contains sixteen amendments, seven pertaining to the recitals and nine to the articles.
One single amendment is not acceptable, namely Amendment No 9 on the suspension of the Regulation which I mentioned a moment ago.
One amendment constitutes a legal problem, namely Amendment No 4 on the rise in costs for domestic payments.
It concerns a political statement which although I fully endorse it, does not fit in a legal document.
Moreover, in this connection, I should like to refer to the last speaker, Mrs Thijssen, who asked me whether it is possible for banks to compensate for the losses incurred with regard to international payments by national payments.
As has been rightly noted, this proposed Regulation is not a price measure: indeed, the charges for transfers are not specified, and that means that, in theory, the charges for national payments could increase.
However, an essential component of this Regulation is transparency.
Banks must notify their customers of the price structure for the different types of transfers and they must also inform their customers when those prices change.
That means that total transparency will apply in terms of what this is all going to cost, and the Commission assumes that, based on the normal rules of competition, the different costs for domestic payments will be kept under control and will therefore not increase.
Amendment No 6 stipulates that the Member States must assume their responsibilities with regard to the application of this Regulation.
The Commission can identify with the first part of the amendment.
The second part, however, comes across as somewhat mysterious, and the Commission is finding it difficult to pass judgment on it at this stage.
With Amendment No 10, the person who tabled this amendment hopes that the principle of non-discrimination will not apply to payment cheques.
As it happens, the Commission has never wanted to promote the use of cheques and therefore agrees with the amendment.
In addition, rapporteur Peijs would like the entry into force of the Regulation to be postponed until 1 March 2002.
That does not pose any problems for the Commission.
We can thus accept that amendment.
The other seven amendments are acceptable in principle, although some will need to be edited.
This proposal will be discussed by the Internal Market Council in some ten days' time, on 26 November.
I am convinced that we will reach an agreement, not least because the European Council in Ghent has requested the Council to reach its findings promptly and has endorsed this proposal.
I know that the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, also has numerous contacts with the Council and I think she will share my feelings on this score.
I should like to thank Mrs Peijs for the excellent document she has drafted and for all her efforts since 1989 to reduce the costs of cross-border payments.
I hope that second reading will be nothing but a formality, in which case the text will be ready for publication in January.
Finally, I should like to ask Mrs Thyssen a second question.
She has also asked me whether the Commission is prepared to stand by its decision, and not to succumb to the pressure of the banks, and whether she considers this as a big stick.
No, Mr President, this is intended as a Regulation and the Commission is thus certainly planning to adhere to its original brief and to ensure that this Regulation enters into force in March next year and that cross-border payments will cost no more than national transfers.
Finally, allow me to thank Parliament as a whole for the sound cooperation.
It shows how progress can be made if both institutions, Parliament and the Commission, are on the same wavelength.
This proposal demonstrates the specific benefits of Europe to the citizen and enhances confidence in the European Union.
Mr President, I would not want Mr Bolkestein to return home thinking that there are extremely mysterious goings-on in this Parliament.
The first part of the amendment which the Commissioner mentioned remains unchanged, something which he, in fact, endorsed.
We, too, thought that the second part was set out in a rather peculiar way, all the more so since it was not Parliament' s intention to set up a new institute.
We have converted this part into a recital, which contains more or less the same question for redress procedures as the 1997 directive.
With this, I believe that all mysterious elements have been removed, and we will thus all be able to concentrate on the second reading.
Mr President, the Commission has taken note of what Mrs Peijs said a moment ago and will specify its position in due course.
Many thanks, Mr President.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
