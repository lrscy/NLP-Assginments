Not all developing countries are the same, however.
There is one concern, especially when it comes to agriculture for, among the developing countries, there are some that are extremely competitive in terms of agricultural production, something that may be problematic for the EU.
I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner a question: what strategy does the Commission have for coping with this, but without thereby halting the project of involving the developing countries and, in a short space of time, making them major purchasers specifically of agricultural products?
Mr President, I would also like to talk about the Singapore issues, because there is massive hypocrisy at the heart of the Commission and Council position.
According to your rhetoric, Commissioner, these negotiations were supposed to be heralding a development round which prioritises the concerns of developing countries.
You like to portray the EU as a supporter and advocate of developing countries and yet the EU is now perceived as bullying these countries into a new set of issues on investment and competition, in spite of the fact that the vast majority of them have already categorically said that they do not want negotiations in these areas.
Even the ACP Group - a group with which this Parliament is supposed to have a special relationship - has issued a statement stating it does not want them.
The least-developed countries do not want them.
On behalf of my group, I would like to issue a challenge to you today.
If you are serious about this new round genuinely being a development round and if you genuinely want the EU to be seen as a supporter of developing countries, will you ask the Council to withdraw the demands on these issues?
If not, can you tell us how you square your so-called support for developing countries with your agenda, which is running precisely counter to their interests and wishes?
Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for your presentation.
The President of the WTO has now come up, of course, with a proposal to cancel the peace agreement in the agricultural sphere.
I know that this is not part of the mandate, but I nonetheless think it worth reflecting upon now that we are interested in obtaining equal trading conditions in this area too.
We do in fact use the United States's protectionists in the agricultural sphere to excuse our own protectionism.
Why not instead do away with both forms of protectionism and enter into proper trading arrangements with the developing countries?
The second point is workers' rights.
How do we ensure that countries entering into agreements at the WTO observe, as a minimum, their own laws and rules governing workers' rights, wages etc. I am thinking, for example, of Thailand where refugees from Burma work in prison-like conditions for virtually no money and where the trade goes directly to Europe.
It is on our shelves that products from these prison camps are found.
How are we to get this issue into the WTO negotiations?
Mr President, I shall take these questions one by one and in short order.
Mr RÃŒbig is, I think, right to say that what is at stake in these negotiations is a matter of importance to small and medium-sized enterprises.
To say that is to make in an elegant way the point that it is not just the big multinationals that have an interest in the multilateral trade system making balanced progress.
Geographical descriptions are a complicated subject, and I will briefly reiterate the EU's negotiating objectives in this area.
As regards wines and spirits first of all, we would welcome the WTO's drawing up of a register, which would be binding in character.
We would also welcome the extension of a number of arrangements protecting geographical descriptions for wines and spirits to cover also other agricultural and food products.
Finally, we would welcome, as is only natural, the recovery of a number of geographical descriptions, a list of which we have drawn up under the auspices of Commissioner Fischler, which are of importance to our farmers, but still usurped in other parts of the world.
Mrs McNally reiterated the Group of the Party of European Socialists' position on investment.
I will say something about that in responding to Mrs Lucas.
How do we reconcile our desire for the WTO to focus on a multilateral accord on a number of principles governing investment, and our aspirations in terms of development?
For a start, we see investment as an important factor in development, believing that a number of simple basic rules on such things as transparency and the predictability of investment schemes, would make an important contribution to investment; secondly, we are prepared to take on board in these negotiations certain of the developing countries' concerns, which have been expressed from time to time and which boil down to the view that such rules would diminish their political sovereignty.
We are willing to respond to this by putting forward a draft comprising a number of general rules that developing countries might adopt, should they wish to do so, without those not wishing to do so being obliged to be bound by them.
In this way, a number of objections can be taken on board.
I would, by the way, remind Mrs McNally and Mrs Lucas that the developing countries are divided on this issue, with some being in favour and others not, and that this is true, moreover, of a number of other subjects.
Within the WTO, there is no Northern front on the issues as a whole, nor is there a Southern front on other matters.
On this point, I would simply remind Mrs Lucas that these four subjects - investment, business facilitation, transparency in public purchasing and competition - form part of the negotiating programme drawn up at Doha, it being understood that we have to come to an agreement on how negotiations are to be conducted. This is also true of the other subjects, such as agricultural issues or industrial tariffs.
Mr Olsson is right to say that agriculture is not, either, an issue on which, within the WTO, an uncompetitive and protectionist North is at loggerheads with a competitive and liberalising South.
It is enough to consider the position of Brazil in comparison with that of India, that of Africa alongside that of Indonesia or Thailand, to be made immediately aware that things are not like that.
In response to Mrs Frahm, I would say that our thinking is, in this discussion, pretty clear.
For a start, we cannot treat agricultural production as a unity, as we tend to do with tyres, socks, shirts or cars.
The specific characteristics of agricultural production mean that we Europeans have a number of reasons for not being in favour of the complete deregulation of agricultural markets, and so we seek to retain state intervention in favour of agriculture.
That having been said, the manner in which the state intervenes has to be adapted in such a way as to do away with some of the obstacles they presented to the agricultural policies of the countries in the developing world.
That is what we did in 1992, 1999, and 2003, and it is right to give Commissioner Fischler, who is sitting beside me this evening, the credit for the efforts made on these various occasions, when we adapted our common agricultural policy to international trade, for the particular benefit of developing countries.
We will carry on down this road.
We have committed ourselves to negotiating towards further reductions in our national subsidies in so far as they hamper trade, to improve our access to the market, to reduce our export subsidies.
We will do this primarily for the benefit of the developing countries.
Such is the basis on which the EU will be negotiating.
My final point is in response to Mrs Frahm.
There is in fact a problem with the relationship between respect for fundamental rights and the rules of international trade, just as there is with the rules of international trade and international accords on the environment, or in the case of how the rules of trade and public health concerns relate to one another.
As regards public health, the World Trade Organisation has just decided in favour of access to generic medicines.
Among the negotiations, the programme for which was adopted at Doha, there are talks on the relationship between the rules on the environment and those on trade.
In contrast, there are no negotiations on the relationship between workers' basic rights, in particular the International Labour Organisation's five basic conventions, and the rules of international trade, as we have not managed to get our point of view accepted.
This was among our negotiating objectives in Doha.
On this point, we came up against the stonewalling of the United States and the developing countries.
They did not want it, they still do not, and up to now, the EU's position, valuable though it is - and I have always energetically defended it because I think it the right one - has gained no ground against the position of the developing countries and the United States.
We are dealing here with a balance of power, one which, for the present, we have not managed to turn around in our favour.
Thank you Commissioner Lamy.
I do not think it will be possible for all those who requested the floor to speak, for we are short of time.
Mr President, I have two practical questions: last Saturday's breakthrough in the field of medicines does mean that many are apprehensive about whether or not this will work in practice.
One of the things we could probably do now in the European Union, which possesses the capacity to produce its own generic medicines, is to declare that we are prepared to issue such a declaration of compulsory licensing in cases where developing countries ask for those medicines.
This would, as it were, be a gesture on our part which demonstrates that those medicines will actually be supplied in practice.
The other practical question concerns the blue box.
Many fear that in agriculture, we will be using this blue box in order to again indirectly subsidise exports on a massive scale.
Brazil has asked whether we are able to promise at this stage that we will be supporting this blue box - in other words the switch from product subsidy to blue-box subsidy - but that we will not be making improper use of it for the purpose of export subsidies.
With this, we would really contribute to abolishing this export subsidy.
I am interested to know whether this line of thinking is currently on the agenda or plays a part in our negotiators' thinking.
Mr President, there is concern surrounding the recent agreement reached on the reform of the common agricultural policy: certain agricultural changes could come about as a result of the World Trade Organisation talks.
I refer in particular to the concern about the very sensitive sugar beet issue.
It is known that countries like Australia, Brazil and others want full liberalisation in this sector.
Can the Commission say that it will seek to have sugar declared a sensitive product?
Commissioner, one can understand why French farmers are worried in the aftermath of the reform of the CAP.
The drought has hit stockbreeders and others - poultry farmers in particular - even harder.
The industry fears the uprooting of European agriculture, that is to say, its being sacrificed at the WTO negotiations.
What strategy do you reckon you will adopt to make the European agricultural model permanent?
The fact is that our agriculture is subject to a multiplicity of constraints, whether economic, social or environmental, and so it must continue to be given help in the same way as the agriculture of the USA consistently is.
What pricing policy have you negotiated in order to limit distortions of competition, by which I mean in order to prevent our farmers having to produce at the European rate while selling at global rates?
Commissioner, how do you see the agricultural negotiations develop in the WTO?
The European Union and America have drafted a common framework in this respect, a so-called joint approach on agricultural questions.
Do you anticipate the developing countries, including China and Japan, simply accepting this framework?
Are America and the EU prepared to make concessions in the agricultural field?
Are they in a position to do so?
Secondly, I should like to ask you how you feel about a larger parliamentarian dimension to the WTO?
Do you consider a clause on this subject in the final declaration of CancÃºn possible, or is this premature at this stage?
Mr President, Commissioner, my first question follows on from Mr van den Berg's question in connection with generic medicines.
There has been criticism to the effect that, since patent law has not been changed, many of the further details that we expect from this new agreement will, in fact, remain nothing but words to the developing countries.
Can you reassure us in this respect?
After all, if this is grand but ineffective gesture, then this means precious little in the way of a weapon in the negotiations as a way of offering evidence of good will.
My second question concerns the mandate.
Do you not agree that the mandate you have is insufficient to equip you for outlining future agricultural policy which, de facto, will make better integration of the developing countries possible, given the fact that a huge chunk of agriculture in the developing world is about survival?
I have been listening carefully to all these questions, Mr President. From what I have heard, I fear Members might be strengthening the position of those who maintain that agriculture is the only subject on the table at CancÃºn.
This is not the case: there are in fact about nineteen others.
As far as politics are concerned, I do not think it is really in the interests of the European Union to act as if agriculture were the only subject on the table at CancÃºn.
We certainly do have a number of interests in agriculture. I referred earlier to the geographical factors for example.
Nonetheless, our main interests lie elsewhere. I hope, therefore, that those of you who are concerned about the interests of the European Union in these negotiations will not contribute to this opinion that agriculture will be the only item on the agenda at CancÃºn.
I will, nevertheless, respond to the questions posed. Mr Cunha is right.
Given that the situation of individual developing countries varies greatly, we must adopt a different approach for each of the countries we are concerned with. This process must operate within the multilateral system.
It might not, however, always be easy to persuade Brazil to recognise that India's position is different and vice versa. Even when Brazil maintains that it supports complete liberalisation, we know full well that this is not the Indian position.
Arrangements of this sort will have to be established within the World Trade Organisation.
We must also ensure that there is a role for the rest of our commercial agriculture policy, if I may term it thus. As you know, this policy rests on asymmetrical bilateral accords: we open up our markets more than we require developing countries to do.
I am thinking here of the system of generalised preferences and the 'Everything but arms' system. In a sense, in establishing these systems, we have taken unilateral action to support developing countries.
I have a clear response to the questions of Mr O'Neachtain, Mr BerniÃ© and Mrs Maes on the relationships between the common agricultural policy, its development and the international World Trade Organisation negotiations. My position on this point is also the position of Commissioner Fischler, the position of the Commission and that of the European Union.
It is a simple one.
First, we agree on which reforms of the CAP we consider necessary. Once these decisions have been taken, and taking account of proposals by other parties, we agree to measures in line with those we agreed amongst ourselves being set in stone at the World Trade Organisation.
In short, the chicken is the CAP and the egg is international trade negotiations.
Compared with the United States, we tend to adopt a bottom up approach, if I may put it like that. The United States negotiates at an international level, gives undertakings and then deals with the consequences for their own system of support for agriculture.
By its very nature, our agriculture mandate is limited by the present state of CAP reforms.
This has always been perfectly clear, everyone knows the situation.
Take the example of sugar.
The sugar market has yet to be reformed. The Commission is working on it and we are expecting a proposal in the coming weeks.
The same goes for cotton, tobacco and olive oil.
At this stage, however, the European Union cannot enter into any commitments in the negotiations, as this would entail a change in the common market organisation on which no decision has yet been taken.
In short, on this point, the situation is perfectly clear.
Experience bears out that, when necessary and generally for our own reasons, we know how to decide on reforms that give us a certain margin of manoeuvre in negotiations.
I would now like to turn to the agreement between the United States and the European Union, or, to be more precise, the interim framework agreement we negotiated this summer. I would respond to Mr De Clercq by saying that we have acted at the request of other members of the World Trade Organisation.
The others urged us to reach an agreement.
We are perceived as the two giants, spending around 1% of our national wealth on supporting the agricultural sector. They consider that it would be difficult to move forward with the negotiations as long as the United States and Europe hold different positions.
We have responded to their request.
It amounts to an interim position that would allow us to take the negotiations forward to the halfway stage.
In that case, it would still need to complete the rest of the process.
We are aware that certain countries, Japan on the one hand, and Brazil and Australia on the other, feel that the compromise reached is not exactly what they would like. There is nothing surprising in this.
Finally, I would like to respond to Mr van den Berg and Mrs Maes, who referred to the agreement providing access to generic medicines for the poorest countries.
As to the agreement itself, it is the result of discussions and received the unanimous approval of the World Trade Organisation, including the two-thirds of its members who are developing countries. I am sufficiently familiar with how international negotiations are conducted to know that the countries sitting around the table of the World Trade Organisation do actually take the decisions.
Decisions are not taken for them. At the WTO negotiation table, the interests of developing countries are expressed by government representatives from these countries.
The procedure is the same at the WHO, the FAO and the ILO. As soon as these government representatives state that they are satisfied with a decision that they had been pressing for for years, I consider that the negotiations have been concluded.
I can be fairly sure though that some NGO or other will then maintain that the developing countries should have negotiated more forcefully.
It is equally likely, however, that some pharmaceutical company or other will consider that we are the ones who should have negotiated more forcefully.
This is what compromise is all about. I cannot put myself in the place of developing countries and say what is, or is not, in their interests.
A political decision has been taken, and, consequently, this compromise will underpin our action in the years to come.
This being that case, as I said a few moments ago, only part of the problem of access to generic medicines for the poorest countries has been resolved through this agreement. We have dealt with the problem of international patent law.
This represents 10 % of the problem.
We still need to deal with the difficulties that are not linked to the patent problem, namely the problems of finance, production and availability. To put it another way, 90% of the work remains to be done.
We must work together, and join forces with other international organisations, especially those established to finance the work to combat some of the relevant diseases. This is about supporting development.
It is about national governance. I do not overestimate the 10% of the work we have completed.
It had to be done to show others the way forward.
You must be aware of this, as we have been discussing matters with you on a very regular basis for three years. The way ahead is open.
We can now dare to hope, something we have, unfortunately, not been in a position to do for far too long, as far as this issue is concerned.
Thank you Commissioner Lamy.
I apologise deeply to all the Members who had asked to take the floor, but we have already overrun and we have to stop now in order to move on to Question Time.
I know there were legitimate requests to speak.
I did not use the d'Hondt system because I wanted to give at least one representative of each group the chance to speak.
On this occasion, using the d'Hondt system would have penalised the smaller groups and I wanted to avoid that.

The next item is Question Time (B5-0273/2003), although we are running behind enormously, by 25 minutes, which has been happening every sitting, and I do not hold President Imbeni responsible for that, naturally, but we are going to have to try to conduct this Question Time as rationally as possible so that the greatest possible number of Members may speak.
We will take questions to the Commission.
Part I
Question No 33 by Piia-Noora Kauppi (H-0483/03):
Subject: Commission preparing to abolish visa requirement for Russian citizens?
Russia has long urged the European Union to abolish the visa requirement for citizens of the Russian Federation.
The European Union has responded with caution, particularly on security grounds.
According to newspaper reports which appeared at the beginning of July (STT-AFP), the head of the Commission's Moscow representation, Richard Wright, has said that 'negotiations' on the subject could begin before the next EU-Russia summit, which is scheduled for November.
Is the Commission preparing to abolish the visa requirement for citizens of the Russian Federation without having informed the Member States?
Can the Commission explain what representation head Richard Wright meant by his statement and particularly how we should interpret the term 'negotiations'?
.
In its conclusions, the General Affairs and External Relations Council at its October meeting last year agreed that the Russian proposal to open discussions on the conditions for the eventual establishment of a visa-free regime would be considered as a long-term issue and that further discussions should take place within the structures of the partnership and cooperation agreement.
On the same issue, the European Union-Russia Summit in St Petersburg in May 2003, which I attended, agreed to examine the conditions for visa-free travel between the European Union and Russia.
The Commission, in close consultation with Member States, is considering how best to launch these discussions with Russia in the framework of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
Some media outlets appear to have misinterpreted comments made by the Head of the Commission's Delegation in Moscow on this matter.
I can clarify that he rightly said that the European Union is prepared to discuss with Russia the conditions for visa-free travel as a long-term issue, and that this question is linked to a number of related matters which also need to be addressed, such as the need for more effective border management, cooperation in the fight against organised crime and illegal immigration.
The conclusion of a readmission agreement with Russia will be an important confidence-building measure in this context.
That is a point which I have put to my Russian colleagues and interlocutors on a number of occasions.
Mr President, this answer is certainly gratifying.
The statements made by the Commission's representative, Richard Wright, have certainly been interpreted with some special purpose in mind on both sides.
Now, however, the matter is evidently going to be raised at the next EU - Russia summit in November.
Before then, how will the issue be dealt with by the Council and what sort of procedure will such strategic decisions as these go through within the Council?
In other words, how will the Commission proceed with the Council in this matter before November?
. The European Union is absolutely clear about the position.
Sometimes there is some misinterpretation on the other side, or some attempt to bounce the debate on our side, but we have been absolutely clear and absolutely consistent in our contacts with our Russian colleagues.
I would like to revert to the last point I made.
It is very important that if we are to start serious discussions with the Russians on these matters - and there are some very difficult issues to resolve - they should understand our legitimate concern about the negotiation of the readmission agreement.
It is not reasonable to have discussions on these important issues where the traffic is all in one direction.
I would also add, when we are considering and preparing the agenda for summits, that we have been insistent that we should work through the structures of the partnership and cooperation agreement, and in this particular case that we work through the appropriate subcommittee.
It is very important to use the mechanisms that we have established for discussing these sensitive issues.
We should not try to bypass them, nor should we try to bounce ourselves into decisions which are of considerable concern to all the Member States, and to some Member States in particular.
Question No 34 by Manuel Medina Ortega (H-0440/03):
Subject: Operation Ulysses
Can the Commission provide information on the success of Operation Ulysses in curbing illegal immigration in the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic?
. As you know, last year in Seville the European Council strongly affirmed the need to develop a strategy on the management of external borders.
The Council adopted a comprehensive plan comprising, among other measures, joint operations to be carried out by the Member States.
In June 2003 the European Council of Thessaloniki confirmed this priority and carried out a first assessment of the results achieved so far, while setting new priorities.
These joint operations are unprecedented and represent a first effort of cooperation in tackling the smuggling of illegal migrants.
The Ulysses joint operation, for example, has been organised and led by Spain, but other Member States have also participated.
This is a first attempt to pool the efforts of the Member States in addressing the tragic situation of migration flows by sea and in attempting to put and end to, or at least diminish, the risk of the kinds of tragic accidents that regularly occur on our seas as a result of the criminal actions of smugglers and traffickers.
The Commission did not take part in planning or managing the various off-shore operations, but - via the Argo Programme - we co-financed these external border management operations to the tune of EUR 670 000.
The Commission will receive a final report on the results and the impact of the activities undertaken in accordance with the relevant procedures of the Argo Programme before the end of the year.
In the light of the objectives of the Argo Programme, the Commission will then be able to evaluate the impact of such an operation for the management of common external borders.
At Thessaloniki the Greek presidency presented a report on the implementation of programmes, ad hoc centres, pilot projects and joint operations.
A chapter of this report is devoted to the Ulysses operation.
I suggest that Mr Medina Ortega takes a look at this report, where there is a comprehensive description of the operation's content.
Commissioner, thank you very much for your reply.
In fact, I am in a position to verify what the Greek Presidency has said on the issue, but, given that the Commission will have to evaluate the project, I would like to warn you of the following:
Firstly, that perhaps the way in which the Ulysses Project was implemented - a first phase in the Mediterranean and then another phase in the Atlantic - meant that during the Mediterranean phase immigration was diverted towards the Atlantic and during the Atlantic phase it was diverted towards the Mediterranean, and therefore in practice the effect was minimal.
It would appear, furthermore, that, at least in the first part, there were understanding problems between the different operations.
We are now talking about a second project, the Neptune Project, for the central and eastern Mediterranean - I imagine the Commissioner will be up?to-date with this issue - and the question I would put is whether, as a consequence of this second project, by focussing on one area - the central and eastern Mediterranean - there will be a danger of increasing the pressure on the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic.
In other words, to what extent the second project can produce that result because it appears that the total flow is always the same: if one side is closed off, immigration is diverted towards the other.
. I share the view of the honourable Member that migratory flows are very flexible, and when the pressure increases in one place, there will be lower pressure somewhere else.
That is why the Commission has proposed the creation of a stable operational framework to deal with the control of maritime borders.
We asked for a feasibility study to be carried out.
I shall present this next week to the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council in Rome.
Our proposal is to create three permanent control centres for our southern maritime border.
Meanwhile, we need to learn from both successful and less successful joint operations, in order to incorporate this knowledge in the project that we are going to present to the Council.
Question No 35 by Paulo Casaca (H-0456/03):
Subject: Additional Protocol on safeguarding nuclear material
Since August 2002, following documented reports by the Iranian resistance, the Iranian regime's illegal activities connected with developing Iran's nuclear capability have come to light and been referred to openly not only by the US authorities, but also by the press and specialist bodies.
In June the International Atomic Energy Agency fully confirmed the reports and the European institutions were at last forced to acknowledge the evidence.
In the meantime, in statements and answers to parliamentary questions the Commission has always maintained that the accusations by the Iranian resistance and their confirmation by the US authorities were not credible and even went so far as to claim that in general Iran had complied with the relevant provisions and had even allowed its nuclear installations to be inspected, which any observers in possession of even the minimum of information at the time knew to be absolutely untrue.
Does the Commission not consider that the credibility of its sources of information on Iran must be urgently reviewed?
. The Commission welcomed the June report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) but noted with concern that Iran had failed to fulfil some of its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty safeguards agreement.
In the meantime, on 26th August 2003, as a follow-up to the June report, the IAEA issued a new report with further findings.
The August report highlights that while Iran has demonstrated an increased degree of cooperation, this cooperation was at times slow in coming and some of the information contradicted what had previously been provided.
This report will be analysed by the IAEA board of directors at a meeting in the week commencing 8 September 2003.
It is also likely that European foreign ministers will discuss this matter at the Gymnich meeting in Italy this weekend.
The Commission has called for full transparency from Iran on this issue and has consistently stated that the issue of weapons of mass destruction constitutes one of the major concerns in relations between the European Union and Iran.
Through contacts at ministerial and official level, the Commission has asked Iran to proceed to a prompt signature and ratification of the additional protocol and to cooperate fully and in a transparent manner with the IAEA.
Without such a protocol in force, it would be hard for the IAEA to assure itself that there was no undeclared nuclear activity in Iran.
The Commission makes every effort to base itself on available objective information, in particular IAEA sources.
We will be following developments within the IAEA closely, not least in view of the meeting I had a couple of months ago with Dr El Baradei.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am very pleased to note that, after all these months during which these questions have been asked, during which we have been told countless times of the existence of information that it was impossible to verify, the Commissioner is not telling us, as he did very recently, that Iran appears in general to have complied with the provisions of the Additional Protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
I am also pleased that the Commissioner is not giving us the same answer he gave me less than a month ago, in which he said that he recognises Iran's right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, as if anyone had ever questioned this right.
The Commission has changed its line, but I fear this has come too late.
The question that I raised, therefore, stands: do you not think, Commissioner, that it would be useful to listen to those whom you did not previously consider to be credible?
. If it satisfies, for present purposes, the honourable Member to say that we have changed our line, I will say that we have changed our line - but we have not changed our line.
The honourable Member cannot have been concentrating when I have said, on a number of occasions, that at meeting after meeting with our Iranian interlocutors we have stressed the importance, for example, of their signing the additional protocol.
I have been to Teheran twice to make that point.
In the last few weeks I have spoken twice to Foreign Minister Kharrazi.
I spoke to him in the middle of August and it is a wonderful coincidence that this question is being asked this evening as I spoke to him this morning on exactly the same point.
My colleague Dr Solana, the High Representative, has been in Teheran this week making the point we have been making month after month: we wish to see Iran sign the additional protocol as a necessary, but not perhaps sufficient, condition for convincing the rest of the world that its civil nuclear programme and ambitions are what they are said to be.
I have no doubt at all that we should press Iran on this issue.
Iran wants to have a better relationship with us and the rest of the world.
What the Iranians have to recognise is that it is not just the United States that is concerned about this issue: we are also passionately concerned about it.
I hope that satisfies the honourable Member and that we now find ourselves supping from the same bowl.
. (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, as Mrs Frassoni has accurately observed, the implementation of the Spanish National Hydrological Plan would make a greater range of water resources available in Spain.
The Commission does not at present have any detailed information or studies at its disposal that would indicate what effect such availability of additional water would have on production in the European Union and on agricultural prices.
So we can only estimate it.
The Commission estimates that the increase in water resources will have only a very slight effect on the extent of the agricultural products supported by Community agricultural funding.
The fact is that there is already an upper limit for Community support for most irrigated cultures, and this upper limit relates either to surface area (as in the case of maize or rice) or to guaranteed national maximum authorised quantities (as in the case of cotton, olive oil, or processed products from fruit and vegetables).
Payments are reduced in proportion to the extent to which the cultivated areas exceed the areas dedicated to crops eligible for support.
The increases in yield or the extension of the irrigated areas, which are the possible consequences of the Spanish Hydrological Plan would thus have no effect on the total amounts paid, nor could the implementation of the plan have any effect on the production of milk, to which quota rules apply.
The only sector in which production could increase is the fresh fruit and vegetables sector, which is, however, already very strongly market-oriented, and production would increase only if the necessary market potential were present.
An additional consideration is that irrigation could improve the quality and competitiveness of fresh fruit and vegetables.
So, were the invisible balance of Mediterranean agriculture to be affected by the Spanish plans, such a development would not be supported by the Community, as increases in production do not automatically entail an increase in Community support.
Commissioner, the problem to which we have tried to draw your attention is the fact that, as you, yourself, have said, we do not yet have accurate estimates to tell us what the actual effect of the National Hydrological Plan will be on prices.
Since we do not know what price will be set for water, we clearly do not know what effect the plan will have on prices either.
I can therefore only ask you to pay particular attention to this factor, not least in that, according to the most recent news we have received, in addition to the increase in water supply under the National Hydrological Plan, there are plans for a series of desalination plants which will further increase - according to certain estimates of as much as 400 cubic hectometres per year - the water production capacity in this area of Spain.
It would appear that, from the point of view of farming, the Commission has a particular responsibility to pay special attention to these factors, yet you, yourself, confirm that the Commission is not yet able to do that.
. (DE) Mr President, while the Commission certainly bears some degree of responsibility for this, primary responsibility lies with each and every Member State that is desirous of making this investment.
The fact is that the project as a whole runs under the title of 'Structural fund support as part of support for Objective I areas', and, within this framework, a cost-benefit analysis of this project does indeed have to be carried out in order to establish whether such support measures can be implemented in the first place, and whether the conditions for support have been complied with.
It follows that this is a task for the Member State setting the project in motion.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that it will be the Commission's task - in this case, a structural support task - to examine whether the estimates that have been carried out are realistic and make sense.
Mr President, I feel that the question posed by my fellow Member Monica Frassoni is extremely pertinent. I would like to comment on this subject as I live in a border zone myself.
I live in Perpignan, in North Catalonia. You will recall the problems imports from Spain caused at the border.
The farmers held up the lorries and their contents were dumped on the road.
I fear that this hydrological plan might lead to unfair competition for the farmers of Roussillon in particular, and also for the whole of the Midi region of France. I am afraid there might be further countryside revolts.
In addition, the farmers will not understand it if this hydrological plan entails diverting the waters of the RhÃŽne.
Although it is not a question, but a warning for the future, Commissioner Fischler may comment if he so wishes.
. (DE) Mr President, as you so rightly say, no question has been put.
I would, though, like to make one thing clear.
All the issues of water rights that are involved here, that is, the question of what rights of extraction exist and to what extent, are not matters to be dealt with at the Community level; in so far as they affect two Member States, these issues should be sorted out in bilateral negotiations between the Member States concerned.
The honourable Member wished to return to the previous question.
He should do so within the allotted time.
Mr President, I am sorry, but I only joined yesterday, so I would ask your forgiveness and I hope I will be quicker next time.
Commissioner, I am a new Aragonese Member, and therefore, as you can imagine, we are greatly affected by the NHP, amongst other things because the intention is to take water from our region.
If I have understood you correctly, you have said that there is no data on how it is going to affect prices, but there are estimates.
Is it possible to obtain these estimates?
. (DE) Mr FerrÃ¡ndez Lezaun, the initial estimate that can be made of this can be only a very rough one, as there are no binding provisions relating to irrigation, for example, on which fruits or crops farmers are to cultivate on the irrigated areas.
That is left to the individual farmers as a management decision.
They will probably cultivate those fruits that open up the best economic opportunities to the individual farmer, but what I can make clear from the outset is that such changes will not give rise to the topping-up of this or that milk quota, nor will the Community be willing to accept such things as, for example, higher hectare premiums or additional reference areas for any crops.
The whole project must be handled subject to the existing framework conditions under the laws on support grants.
Question No 37 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0444/03):
Subject: New reform of the CAP and highly disadvantaged (Objective 1) areas of the EU
The Presidency's 26 June 2003 undertaking regarding the new reform of the CAP contains only a timid, rhetorical reference to disadvantaged regions and cohesion within the EU.
An analysis of the proposals put forward by the Commission and agreed by the Council does not enable what is meant by 'desire to support' to be either qualified or quantified.
Within the EU there are highly depressed agricultural areas which by themselves will be unable to achieve the degree of competitiveness required on account of the new decoupling of aid and the additional demands imposed by the reform.
Only some fresh agricultural-training and -promotion and commercial-distribution policies, together with special programmes to boost agricultural and commercial development, will be able to counter the heavy impact of the reform, thereby preventing economic depression and the abandonment of farming.
In view of the above, what action is the Commission planning to take in order to prevent the reform of the CAP from having a harmful effect on the most disadvantaged parts of the EU?
. (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I would just like to start with a clarification.
If, in the field of agriculture, we speak in terms of less-favoured or of especially disadvantaged areas, we have to distinguish between two things; firstly, those less-favoured areas in which hectare premiums are paid as part of the rural development programmes, in order to compensate for their disadvantaged situation, and, secondly, those areas categorised as Objective 1 areas by reason of their generally backward state of development.
As you know, the Community can, in these Objective 1 areas, do such things as grant investment programmes higher cofinancing rates.
There are also, in addition, quite specific conditions for what we term the outermost regions.
Let me start by establishing, in the context of reform, that it will continue to be for the Member States to decide what value and priority they attach to the measures for the less-favoured areas under the rural development programmes.
They will, in any case, subject to modulation, have more funds at their disposal for this purpose.
It is also the Member States who decide how much by way of structural funds they want to spend in the Objective 1 regions under the Guarantee Fund, how much they want to allocate to the Social Fund and how much to the Regional Fund.
Nothing about this is changed by the agricultural reform.
It is also true, though, that there are some less-favoured regions in which the reform could cause agricultural production to fall, and this leads the public in the EU to fear that more and more land in especially disadvantaged areas could be left uncultivated.
The reform of income aid will, however, link direct grants to the role played by the farmer as a manager responsible for his land and for the rural environment.
The new farm payment will in fact be cut if management obligations are not discharged.
We do not pay our farmers for doing nothing, and nor will we do so in the future.
Those who receive premiums must manage their land in line with agricultural and environmental standards; moreover, the premium for less-favoured areas will be paid only if the land is properly managed.
I do not therefore go along with you in the conclusions to which you have come, and which underlie your question on the less-favoured areas.
All the same, I would like to point out that the Commission will continue to closely monitor the effects of the new common agricultural policy on the less-favoured areas, for the reform does indeed provide for the possibility of appropriate adjustments being made, should it prove necessary to do so.
Commissioner, the reform of the CAP should be carried out above all in situ, in the countryside, and not just on paper.
The people who will have to reform and convert their crops and their farming are the farmers, not just the bureaucrats.
In the countryside there is great uncertainty and worry about the consequences of the reform at the moment.
In less-favoured regions, there is much more.
This is because, as you know, new commercial policies will be needed, and in less-favoured regions - objective 1 regions, apart from the terminological issue - new commercial measures, education and training for farmers are going to be needed.
In this reform, however, you have not planned for anything like this for the regions in the worst situations.
In Andalusia this will mean more than EUR 1 000 million.
Throughout this summer there has been talk of a hard blow.
Furthermore, your proposal is bureaucratically much more complex.
In other words, rather than being simplified, the bureaucracy is increasing.
From the point of view of social cohesion, moreover, this represents a retrograde step, especially when Mr Prodi commissions reports from his advisers which may be the final straw for social cohesion.
You are not replying to my question, Commissioner.
To what are you referring when you say that it is true that certain areas - the least-favoured - may be subject to reductions?
What does this mean?
A little more formality, and a lot more with those who are worst ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, you have been talking for more than twice the time allowed, which is one minute.
We will give Commissioner Fischler the floor so that he can reply.
. (DE) Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I can give a succinct answer to that.
You take the specific example of Andalusia and say that it will be necessary to inject more funding in Andalusia in order to give farmers better training in order to enable them to adapt to the new situation - well, that is a matter for the Andalusian Government.
It will have to put forward a proposal for reprogramming its rural development programme.
If it complies with the general conditions, we will certainly approve it.
I do not see a problem in that.
I might add that the time for discussing my proposal has been and gone.
A decision has been taken; the ministers took it unanimously - and that means that Spain voted for it.
This means that discussion of changes to the proposal is now idle talk.
The reform stands.
What is now far more important is the question of how you implement this reform in Spain, for you will be aware that the latest decision made a certain degree of flexibility possible.
What matters now, for example, is whether, in Andalusia, you decouple everything or whether, in animal husbandry perhaps, you retain certain coupled elements, with the stipulation that this task could, under certain circumstances, devolve upon the rural communities.
Such a possibility exists, but it is now for you to make your move. It is you who must decide!
Commissioner, the English translation of the question refers not to 'less-favoured agricultural areas' but to 'highly depressed agricultural areas'.
There are many depressed agricultural areas - and highly depressed farmers - in the West Midlands, my home region in the UK.
I would like to ask the Commissioner one question in two halves.
Does the Commission agree that some Member States, including the UK, have not taken the fullest advantage of the flexibility allowed under existing CAP rules?
Would he encourage all Member States to take the fullest advantage now under the new rules, which offer greater flexibility, and to listen to their farmers and their agricultural community in the process?
A one-word answer will suffice.
. (DE) Mr President, Mr Bushill-Matthews, let me first make it clear that 'Objective 1 areas' is in parentheses, so this is not just about areas that are generally in decline, although the question made specific reference to Objective 1.
Turning, secondly, to your own question, the flexibility that we are creating in the rules is there to be used.
Right now, I can do no other than to encourage the Member States to make use of the flexibility that is there, and to do so in such a way that they meet to the maximum possible extent the needs of the specific situation in an actual region, such as the one to which you refer.
May I take the question on the Fischler proposals for the mid-term review a little further with the Commissioner?
Under your reforms you will break the link between production and subsidy.
This will put the European Union in a strong position in CancÃºn.
Do you feel that the decision the Council of Ministers arrived at, whereby some countries are going to start decoupling long before others, has actually weakened the position of the European Union?
. (DE) I would like to tell you quite frankly, Mr Parish, that I do not believe that we have weakened our position in the negotiations, since even if the Member States use the maximum of the coupled elements that are permitted to be retained, at the latest possible point in time, we have in any case decoupled 70% of payments.
Even now, though, we can see a whole array of Member States declaring that they want to introduce decoupling - 100% decoupling, moreover - at the earliest possible opportunity.
Even states such as Ireland, which take a critical view of decoupling, have in the meantime made clear their decision to proceed with it in full.
I believe that this example will be followed by many others, and so I have no fear that we are now in any worse a negotiating position.
Since the time allotted to questions to Commissioner Fischler has elapsed, and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 38, 39, 40 and 41 will be replied to in writing
Question No 42 by Bart Staes (H-0436/03):
Subject: Development aid for Congolese agriculture
On 12 June 2003 the Flemish weekly Trends reported that the public prosecutor's office in Antwerp, Belgium had instituted an investigation into two exporters of European food surpluses to Africa (Soafrimex and Afroliner) and their alleged involvement in tax fraud, money laundering and suspected diamond trafficking.
The branches of the two companies in Congo place (European) foodstuffs on the market at dumping prices.
The development project CDI-Bwamanda, for its part, states that local agriculture has to contend with far too high general costs.
The European Commission, among others, purchases maize locally for double the price as farming is so inefficient, Trends points out.
However, the FAO considers that Congo has the potential to feed some 2 billion people.
Does the Commission have further information concerning the apparent fraud being conducted from Antwerp involving European food surpluses and is it prepared, in the light of the exceptionally (!) high level of need, to put extra resources into developing local agriculture and consequently to gradually reduce European food exports to the region?
. The article on which this question is based contains a number of inaccuracies that could mislead the reader.
On the one hand, legal proceedings are currently under way against European food surplus exporters in relation to a money laundering and diamond trafficking affair.
The Belgian magistracy has dispatched an investigating committee to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
That investigation is secret and falls within the competence of the Belgian Courts.
The Commission therefore has no information on this matter.
On the other hand, the Commission is currently allocating significant resources to the development of local agriculture in the DRC.
Under the European Development Fund, projects to boost agriculture and rehabilitate rural roads, along with phytosanitary measures are under way to the tune of EUR 13.2 million.
An agricultural support project worth EUR 12 million is awaiting approval.
The food aid supplied by the Commission amounts to nearly EUR 5 million and consists, inter alia, of amounts made available to the NGO, CDI-Bwamanda, to purchase maize from local producers at the Kinshasa market price.
This approach enables Congolese farmers to continue producing in a domestic situation, characterised by a patent lack of purchasing power, and therefore to prepare themselves to compete on the national and regional markets when the post-conflict economic upturn begins.
Furthermore, the Commission's intervention, via this NGO, will help avoid a situation where food aid produced outside the country weakens an agricultural sector already hard-hit by the country's political conditions, which are having huge repercussions on production.
All this has given rise in Kinshasa to a steep increase in the market price for maize.
It should be noted, however, that since the conclusion of the 'global and inclusive' Pretoria agreement in December 2002, and the official reunification of Congolese territory at the end of June 2003, commercial navigation on the river Congo is returning to normal.
This will in all probability bring the market price down.
Mr President, needless to say, I am pleased to hear from the Commissioner that the article contains factual inaccuracies.
I would simply like to ask the Commissioner if he could expand on the detail of those factual inaccuracies in that article, given that this is important.
I think we all share the Commissioner's view that reinforcing local agricultural markets in any developing country is, of course, what matters most.
Does the Commissioner, however, dare to stand up here and confirm that in Congo, in the region mentioned in the article, there is no wholesale import of European agricultural products that are dumped there?
Although the Commissioner confirmed that we support local NGOs and that we purchase maize there, does he have the nerve to state loudly and clearly that there has not been any import on a massive scale, apart from the purchases that the Commissioner himself mentioned?
. No, I cannot do that.
I take it for granted that there is some reason why the Belgian authorities are conducting their investigations in the DRC.
I also gave the Member what information I had available and even explained why an investigation like this is not something for us to comment on.
I have done what I could.
Question No 43 by Francisca Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco (H-0452/03):
Subject: Murder of the Spanish citizen Ana Isabel SÃ¡nchez Torralba in Equatorial Guinea
The Spanish voluntary worker Ana Isabel SÃ¡nchez Torralba has died in Equatorial Guinea as a consequence of gunshots fired by members of the armed forces at the coach in which she was travelling to Aconibe in order to work with Misioneras Escolapias.
This is another tragic example of the brutality of the Equatorial Guinea regime, whose contempt for human life, human rights and the most basic public safeguards has expressed itself once again in the murder of Ana Isabel SÃ¡nchez Torralba.
Has the Commission considered the possibility of imposing sanctions on Equatorial Guinea by suspending all forms of aid to Obiang's dictatorial regime?
Can the Commission provide any information on the human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea?
Has there been any improvement in the system of safeguards since an agreement thereon was concluded between the Commission and the Government of Equatorial Guinea?
. The Commission deeply regrets the death of Ms SÃ¡nchez in Equatorial Guinea.
The young soldier responsible was acting against the orders of his superior and is now in prison, pending trial for murder.
In this case, the authorities acted rapidly and correctly, so the Commission would not consider it a reason to impose sanctions.
I would remind you that cooperation with Equatorial Guinea under the 8th EDF programme is conditional on the promotion of human rights, and the 9th EDF programme has not yet been signed.
As regards the evolution of the human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea, following its visit in July 2003, the Commission reported some small improvements, such as the President's invitation to the opposition parties to join the government, an improvement in prison conditions, a reduction in the number of military barricades found along the main roads and a slightly freer press.
Lately we have seen some positive signs with the release of 18 political prisoners on 18 August 2003.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Today I have found out that a council of war sentenced the person who killed this aid worker to thirty years in prison and has awarded compensation of EUR 40 000 to the family of the victim.
It does represent progress that there has been an emergency council of war; however, Commissioner, you know - and I imagine this has been expressed by the people who have been in Guinea - that human rights are still being violated all the time, despite certain prisoners having been freed, and that this situation is unfortunately constant in this small country which has few citizens.
They continue to live essentially in terror, and although the country is one of the world's richest, thanks to oil, the population, as you know, receives no education or health care and lives in poverty.
Therefore, Commissioner, despite the fact that you have said that there have been improvements, I would ask you to continue to demand a system of guarantees which make it possible for these citizens to live with the minimum degree of human rights.
. Absolutely.
This is one case illustrating the sad fact that oil is not a shortcut to decency or progress for the majority of any country.
We are in this difficult dialogue with this country and I am afraid that I am not able to come up with something magnificent or highly optimistic here.
We have to keep trying.
Question No 44 by Eija-Riitta Anneli Korhola (H-0474/03):
Subject: Linking Kyoto mechanism credits to development cooperation
The EU is drafting a directive on credits obtainable from Joint Implementation (JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects which comply with the Kyoto Agreement, which credits would be convertible into emission rights that would have a monetary value for purposes of emissions trading.
An instrument would thus be created which would enable some development projects to earn money.
At the same time it is likely that this will make one more tool available which could help to attain the UN's target of 0.7% of GNP.
The EU also intends to hold emission rights itself.
Despite the bright prospects, a satisfactory outcome will be attainable only through careful planning and a well-considered strategy.
Is the Directorate-General which is responsible for development cooperation at the Commission aware of the nature of CDM projects and the opportunities they create for additional funding of development cooperation?
Will the Commission guide the Member States towards a common approach?
How will CDM projects be integrated with the EU's own financial planning of development cooperation?
. The Commission's Directorate-General for Development, and I myself, are aware of the Clean Development Mechanism and the opportunities it offers.
For developing countries, the CDM should be a good vehicle for the transfer of clean and modern technologies, which will contribute to their development efforts.
However, the CDM is not a substitute for funding in the framework of development cooperation.
Firstly, the CDM is primarily a private sector or business sector instrument and public funding would be used only for enabling and capacity-building purposes or similar catalytic actions.
Secondly, even though the certified emission reductions that will be generated by a CDM project will have an additional value, that value may not be 'reportable' as official development assistance according to the reporting rules of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD.
The Commission is supportive of the opportunities that CDM may bring in terms of technology transfer, but is aware that not all developing countries will be equally interesting to the business sector in terms of investments.
The Commission has proposed an EU strategy and action plan for climate change in the context of development cooperation, in which support would be given to partner countries for CDM project preparation activities, including capacity-building.
The communication on climate change in the context of development cooperation also explores the possibility of funding CDM projects in the category of least-developed countries.
As regards guiding Member States towards a common approach on CDM, we hope that the discussions in Council on the Commission's communication will lead to agreement on an EU action plan, including actions related to CDM activities.
I invite the European Parliament also to give its opinion on the communication.
Assistance for the CDM activities included in the action plan may be funded from geographical budget lines on request from countries, and from the research budget.
Assistance can also be provided from the budget line 'Environment in developing countries and tropical forests', for which CDM activities will be one of the priorities.
Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for his answer.
I would like to say that it is nevertheless true that certain kinds of markets and opportunities are opening up here for development cooperation organisations.
In my opinion that is a very good thing, as they can use their know-how in this area.
I would therefore like to ask whether the Commission has any intention of marketing this opportunity and this idea to development cooperation organisations, for example, by training them to become CDM project coordinators.
I would also like to ask what sort of possibilities you see here for bringing together companies and organisations to make collaborations constructive and advantageous for both sides.
. As I already indicated, this is mainly an instrument for business to engage in.
We are trying to pull business and the private sector into these activities in many different ways.
The discussion on how to organise this must of course include business.
It also should include the governments in our partner countries.
These are the two essential partners in getting this moving.
Without that there is not much in it at all.
The normal development cooperation organisations are not primarily the target for this: the new front is business.
Mr President, Commissioner, you are quite right to say that business people must sort this out among themselves, but we all know that, in order to do so, they need a marketplace, that is to say, an exchange where it is possible to trade in these rights, these CDM projects.
Do you think it possible that the Commission might take the initiative in providing such an exchange with a base in Europe?
. From a practical point of view, pilot projects and other similar actions are necessary to get started, try this out in practice and demonstrate how such activities can be carried out.
This is where we are at the moment.
I mentioned the bigger problem, which has not yet been clarified, of how any of this can be reported as official development assistance.
We have to be careful about that.
If business can identify something that is interesting for it and if governments in developing countries can see this as being in their interests also, that is when we should urge them to meet.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
Question No 50 by Alexander de Roo (H-0431/03):
Subject: Spain's National Hydrological Plan (NHP) and conservation of the lower JÃºcar river
The plans for the river Ebro in Spain's National Hydrological Plan (NHP) have aroused major controversy. Nothing has been said, however, regarding the fate of the river JÃºcar, the second largest river in the Spanish Mediterranean region, which under the NHP is to be used as a centre for hydraulic redistribution in the Mediterranean area, with three transfers within a 200-kilometre stretch, namely the Tajo-Segura transfer, in operation since 1980, the JÃºcar-VinalopÃ³ transfer, already being slowly introduced, and the Ebro transfer scheme, under which it is planned to transfer 63 hm 3 of water in the vicinity of the Tous dam.
The lower and middle sections of the river JÃºcar are of major environmental interest.
The stretch of river from Tous to the sea has been proposed as a site of Community importance by the Valencia Generalitat (LIC ES 5232007).
Furthermore, the final stretch of the river and the adjacent coastal waters are included on the list of wetlands of the Community of Valencia.
The JÃºcar basin was recently chosen as a pilot river basin (PRB) as part of the procedures for applying the framework directive on water.
Is the Commission aware that neither the JÃºcar basin hydrological plan nor the NHP make provision for environmental flow for the JÃºcar between the Real del JÃºcar irrigation system and the estuary?
Does the Commission think it possible to ensure the conservation of a stretch of water of such major environmental importance without using hydrological planning to provide it with a minimum maintenance flow and prevent biological pollution through mixing with waters from other basins?
. The Commission is aware that the Spanish national hydrological plan and the JÃºcar river basin plan do not contain provisions for ensuring the flow rates in the lower reaches of the river.
The Commission understands that the Spanish authorities intend to define the necessary flow regimes at a later date.
European environmental legislation, especially the habitats directive and the water framework directive, must be respected.
This means that the river JÃºcar must achieve at least 'good' ecological status by December 2015 at the latest, and the dependent terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands must be protected.
Finally, the JÃºcar river basin has been identified by the Spanish authorities as a pilot river basin under the common implementation strategy associated with the water framework directive.
This work will identify the major challenges facing the river basin, including the issue of protecting the middle to lower reaches of the river.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for her reply.
It is true that the DG for the Environment has not given the go-ahead for the EUR 80 million subsidy for which the Spanish Government has applied for the JÃºcar-VinalopÃ³ project.
The DG for the Regions did want to grant the subsidy and subsequently asked the European Investment Bank to draft a socio-economic report about the economic viability of the JÃºcar project.
However, the representatives of the European Investment Bank have only spoken with the Spanish Government in Spain, not with any of the people who are opposed to the JÃºcar project.
The report of the European Investment Bank on this JÃºcar-project is not public.
I should like to ask the Commission whether this report can be made public, particularly the technical information which the Spanish Government has supplied to the European Investment Bank?
.
I can answer Mr de Roo, I just wanted a technical clarification.
I am always interested in making sure that we can make enough environmental information available to NGOs or to the public, as long as we do not reveal businesses' secrets or confidential matters.
As far as I know, we have not yet received this particular report.
I understand that we are still having discussions with other DGs where necessary and with involved stakeholders to be able to get all the information necessary and also to judge on the facts in this case.
When it comes to funding, you know that the Commission has received a proposal for the funding of this transfer through the structural funds, but it has not yet finalised its position regarding this project.
We are still seeking clarification and further information from the Spanish authorities.
One of the questions which has to be addressed is the relationship between the Ebro transfer and the JÃºcar-VinalopÃ³ transfer.
The Spanish authorities have been asked to clarify whether the JÃºcar-VinalopÃ³ transfer is dependent upon the Ebro transfer proceeding, or whether it is an entirely independent project.
That is where we are.
I will look carefully into whether we can make public any information that will help in this debate.
I am absolutely open to looking into the matter, but it is dependent on whether we have received the relevant information.
We are still in discussions with all the stakeholders in order to receive and get access to the necessary information.
Question No 51 by Chris Davies (H-0441/03):
Subject: Ecological flows of the Ebro river and the Water Framework Directive
What is the Commission's current view of the scientific and political debate in Spain over the estimates of the minimum ecological flow of the Ebro river to its delta after the Ebro transfer?
The Water Framework Directive requires that there is no further deterioration of current status and that a 'good' ecological status (including hydromorphology) is achieved in the whole river basin and not just in certain stretches of a river; how does the Commission intend to ensure this is achieved in the whole of the Ebro basin in view of the proposed Ebro transfer to the north, east and south-east of Spain?
Does the Commission agree that the twin objectives of prevention of deterioration of current status, and the characterisation of what should constitute 'good' ecological status in the whole of the Ebro basin need to be fulfilled before further evaluation of whether the Ebro transfer is technically possible and which regions could finally benefit from it?
. The Commission considers the question of the appropriate flow regime for the lower Ebro river and the Ebro delta to be a critical issue in relation to the proposed Ebro transfer.
This is one of the two issues that the Commission has proposed to address in a technical meeting with the Spanish authorities and selected organisations, which is scheduled to take place in mid-October 2003.
The need to ensure a suitable level of protection for the lower Ebro river and the Ebro delta is clearly very closely linked to the requirements of the water framework directive to avoid deterioration as from its entry into force in December 2000, and to ensure the achievement of good ecological and chemical status by December 2015 at the latest.
In practice that answer was very satisfactory.
I thank the Commissioner.
Question No 52 by Camilo Nogueira RomÃ¡n (H-0434/03):
Subject: Global costs of repairing the environmental damage caused by the wreck of the 'Prestige'
In view of the extent of the 'Prestige' disaster and its impact on several Member States, will the Commission carry out a study of the costs of restoring the status quo ante and making good the long-term environmental and associated socio-economic damage caused by the wreck of the vessel off the Galician coast?
. The honourable Member would agree that the Commission addressed in a speedy and efficient way all consequences of the Prestige accident.
On the regulatory side the honourable Member will recall the prompt reaction of the Commission as regards the acceleration of the phasing-out of single-hull vessels, the introduction of penal sanctions and the bringing forward of the Erika I and Erika II legislative packages.
Those were also finalised in record time.
As regards Community assistance to help Spain redress damage and associated economic impact, the Commission offered to co-finance an environmental impact survey to the tune of EUR 300 000.
Contacts were established on the conditions for such a study, which the Spanish authorities are currently considering.
The Commission would remind the honourable Member that EUR 30 000 were made available on 20 December 2002 to the Spanish fisheries, shellfish and aquaculture industries affected by the oil spill, and that EUR 8.6 million were mobilised under the solidarity fund on 16 July 2003.
Additional funds from Community instruments such as the structural funds and the cohesion fund are also available for the purpose mentioned by the honourable Member.
Mr President, Commissioner, the reality of the situation cannot be denied.
We cannot turn our backs on the consequences of the Prestige disaster.
Fuel oil is still washing up on the coasts of Galicia and in the Bay of Biscay; a week ago I saw this situation for myself, in the Rostro sandbanks at Cape Finisterre.
The Prestige is still lying at the bottom of the sea. It is haemorrhaging fuel oil and we do not really know what it contains.
Fishermen, scientists and Galician and Cantabrian society as a whole are all extremely concerned at the damage that has already taken place and crucially, at the uncertainty of what the future holds.
Objective studies state that the final balance of the damage caused by the Prestige will exceed EUR three billion.
Compare these sums, Commissioner, with those you have just mentioned, which are totally inadequate.
I therefore put the question to you once again: is the Commission going to remain passive or is it going to take the bull by the horns once and for all and shoulder its responsibilities in order to solve this very real problem and to impose some order on the unregulated traffic that plies our seas?
. I do not accept that the Commission has been passive.
I was there immediately after the accident.
I offered the Spanish authorities funding or co-funding for an environmental impact study.
We have been in active contact with the Spanish authorities, but we cannot force ourselves upon the Spanish Government or people.
We have to work in collaboration.
We also immediately followed up in political terms, proposing different measures in order to be able to repair damage of this kind and we have also set aside money both from the structural funds and the solidarity fund.
If the Spanish Government wants more money or assistance, we expect it to contact us to determine exactly what should be done.
I also hope it is considering our offer to make the environmental impact study I mentioned, because this is for the longer term and would be very useful in preventing such accidents from happening again.
Again I underline that we took the necessary measures immediately after this accident and will continue to react immediately.
Our civil protection unit was also activated immediately.
We have been doing everything in our power to assist and help the Spanish Government, authorities and people.
We are willing to listen to any further requests that may arise and we will deal with them in an appropriate manner.
Question No 53 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0457/03):
Subject: Health risks for the population of Athens from high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and microparticulates
In its answer to my Oral Question H-0371/03
. The Commission is aware that the ambient air quality situation, particularly in metropolitan cities such as Athens, needs to be improved.
This is a major aim of current Community legislation on air quality and emissions.
In compliance with the reporting obligations of the Air Quality Framework Directive, Greece has reported the 2001 concentration levels for the pollutants regulated in the first daughter directive.
According to this information, the limit values for PM10, as well as for NO2, plus the margin of tolerance, have been exceeded at several stations in Athens.
As Greece has not yet provided the necessary justification to demonstrate that such excesses of PM10 are due to natural events, the Commission expects to receive plans and programmes in accordance with Article 8 of the framework directive by the end of 2003.
These should show how Greece intends to achieve the limit values by 2005.
The same applies to NO2 where, however, no derogation for natural sources or events is allowed.
For NO2 the directives also set an alert threshold which is surpassed when concentrations exceed 400 micrograms per cubic metre over three consecutive hours.
The Commission must be informed of any exceeding of the alert threshold within three months.
No information from the Greek authorities on such an event has been provided up to now.
The Commission has also received findings from a research programme indicating an increase of mortality in cities where high PM10 concentrations are accompanied by high NO2 levels and a warm climate.
We need to study these findings carefully to conclude whether there is sufficient evidence for such a relationship.
However, there is no doubt that unfavourable climatic conditions are always an additional threat to human health.
Member States are obliged to ensure that up-to-date information on ambient concentration of air pollutants, such as NO2 or PM10, is routinely made available to the public.
According to the honourable Member, the ministry has stopped issuing information on this matter.
In the light of the above, the Commission will open an own-initiative case to investigate whether and to what extent the Greek authorities have not complied with the relevant EC regulations.
I thank the Commissioner for her substantiated reply.
I must of course point out that we are talking about statistics for 2001 and living in 2003 and there is the added element of the numerous works for the Olympic Games and the dust floating above Athens against which no suitable measures have been taken.
This being so, I should like to ask the Commissioner if there are any plans to investigate the question of worsening pollution as a result of this photochemical pollution and micro particles and the factor of the works for the Olympic Games, which are being carried out without suitable measures being taken to protect citizens' health.
. It is difficult for me to reply immediately to the question as to whether the problems will be such that some kind of protection for each and every Athens citizen will be required.
I doubt that is the case and I hope they will be able to organise these construction works in such a way that the citizens of Athens will continue to be able to live, work and breathe there.
Our directives and the different limits and levels that are set do not take into account whether there is a special event, but it takes into account and measures those factors that affect human health.
We will continue to ensure that Greece measures, monitors and reports these things to us.
That is why I announced that we are willing to look into the type of monitoring, reporting and measuring that is necessary in Greece in order to fulfil the requirements in our directives.
We will continue to do so.
You have given us reason to ask whether there will be special problems connected to the construction works which would require Athens to take special measures.
I cannot answer your question today.
However, I will be willing to return and give you a more detailed answer later on.
Question No 54 by Ari Vatanen (H-0470/03):
Subject: NATURA 2000 site designation
The rules of Article 4 of the Habitat Directive 92/43/EEC
. The Commission has, on several occasions, looked into the correct transposition of the habitats directive and the birds directive into Finnish legislation.
At present the Commission is of the opinion that the Articles referring to the procedure of establishing the Natura 2000 network have been correctly transposed.
As the Natura 2000 network has caused a considerable amount of controversy in Finland, the Commission has looked into the national procedure for site selection and has in past years notified Finland of some shortcomings, both in the number of sites to be protected and the quality of the data.
Finland has endeavoured to address these shortcomings.
The present quality of the data is acceptable to the Commission.
The complaints from Finland seem to contain some misinterpretations of the evaluation principles.
The Commission bases its evaluations on the latest submitted data, not on the oldest information.
The Commission is aware that some landowners in Finland have been dissatisfied with the Natura 2000 proposals.
The Commission has been informed that all landowners have had the possibility to see the proposals and to lodge complaints against them before Finland officially submitted the proposals to the Commission.
The Finnish courts have examined the complaints on a case-by-case basis, considering each time the validity of the data.
The majority of the complaints have been rejected by the courts.
The directive does not establish any requirements for consultation at the national level and thus, in respect of the principle of subsidiarity, it has been for individual Member States to exercise their responsibilities, taking account of national laws and procedures.
The Commission's concerns are therefore limited to respect the scientific selection criteria as set out in the directive.
Although the Commission can understand that in these cases the dissatisfaction might persist, it cannot conclude that the Finnish authorities have arbitrarily misinterpreted the rules or proceeded in a way that has been contradictory to those rules.
Commissioner, I appreciate your answer and your effort generally regarding the environment in Europe, but what you say is simply not coherent with everyday facts.
When this was implemented in Finland it was mainly based on old protection schemes, which do not meet directive criteria for Natura 2000 sites.
Therefore, you must understand the position of the private landowners.
Their right to use their own land was wrongly prohibited and in fact, contrary to what you say, the appeals in the Finnish courts were handled en bloc.
99 times out of 100 they were rejected outright.
People therefore feel frustrated and powerless.
We believe in Europe, but how do we convince ordinary European citizens or the Finnish farmer if they feel they have been steamrollered by Europe and, in this case, by the Finnish authorities?
They have simply been the victims of injustice.
.
The honourable Member has raised a very valid question.
How do we communicate Natura 2000 and the creation of this important network, when the original motives have been lost in the debate in the years that followed the introduction of this directive?
I hope that we will also be better able to assist Member States in giving good examples of how to communicate the directive, but I am not convinced that we will ever be able to solve this problem of the Finnish Government and authorities having to introduce a consultation process with, for example, Finnish landowners.
We will never be able to solve that from Brussels, but hopefully we can do better in giving good examples of how this consultation process can be implemented and carried out in different countries.
It is important that we also make clear where the responsibility lies with the Commission and where there is a case for subsidiarity and we will thus have to rely on a Member State - in this case the Finnish Government and authorities - to also organise work on this.
From a formal point of view, we have not found any wrongdoings in the Finnish having, for example, arbitrarily carried out this work.
We cannot find any such formal mispractice at all.
As the time allocated to Question Time to the Commission is at an end, Questions Nos 55 to 85 will be answered in writing
The next item is the report (A5-0270/2003) by Elizabeth Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission 'Towards a United Nations legally-binding instrument to promote and protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities' (COM(2003) 16 - 2003/2100(INI)).
I am very pleased to open the sitting this evening in the European Year of People with Disabilities, which we are working our way through.
I underline, along with my colleagues in Parliament and the Commission, the importance we attach to this mission.
. Mr President, I should like to say thank you to the sign language interpreters.
I wish we could have sign language interpretation every plenary session, for every report.
I should also like to thank everyone who has helped me to write this report: all the MEPs that have worked very hard with me to come up with compromise amendments; the Commission; and especially disabled people's organisations.
I have taken a lot of advice on this report. That is why it is a good one.
It is not my report. It is a report that has been brought together with the help of disabled people.
I am delighted that the UN ad hoc Committee, between 16 and 27 June 2003, decided on a specific convention on disabled people's rights.
I believe only a specific, legally-binding convention will do, rather than any other instrument.
But there must be a monitoring mechanism to see how disabled people are treated in practice across the world.
I put in my report a list of rights that should be included in any UN convention.
It is a non-exhaustive list because of space.
However, I called for a mainly rights-based approach to get away, once and for all, from the medical model of disability and to cover all forms of disability, whether it is a person using a wheelchair, or somebody with another mobility problem, a hearing impairment, a visual impairment, a learning disability, a mental health problem or any other hidden disability.
We must be inclusive.
There are 37 million disabled people in the European Union.
There are 600 million disabled people world-wide.
There has already been some progress in the United Nations: the 1981 World Programme of Action and the 1993 Standard Rules on Equalisation of Opportunities for People with Disabilities, to name but two.
At EU level there has also been progress: in 1997, for instance, Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam brought forward the employment directive and the Action Programme.
But as I said in my report, we now need a specific disability directive at EU level.
We need all Member States to implement the current employment directive that is due to be implemented this year.
There are many Member States that have not even started to look at implementation.
Even if we did get it right at European level, 80% of disabled people come from developing countries.
That is why we need a legally-binding convention covering a whole raft of different rights, including the right to quality of life.
That also means protection from degrading and inhumane treatment. That includes institutionalisation.
We need to see access to employment because a vast majority of disabled people do not have employment.
We need access to vocational training, education and the right to inclusion, which is so important.
That means access to buildings, access to live as independent a life as possible, and access to public transport.
If people do not have access to public transport they cannot get to their place of work.
Then we look at civil and political rights.
I believe very strongly in equal citizenship, as do most of us here.
That means no more 'rights for disabled people', but 'equal rights for disabled people'.
Those equal rights mean access to financial support as well; access to health care, access to culture and leisure - including sporting activities, equality before the law and the right to justice.
I understand that a split vote has been asked for so that only organisations of disabled people, rather than organisations representing disabled people, will be consulted over this.
Let us remember that we deal with developing countries here!
Many do not have organisations of disabled people. They only have organisations representing disabled people.
Are we going to exclude them?
We are not just dealing with the European Union. This is a world-wide convention.
Even within the EU there are many organisations that would be left out, including the Royal National Institute for the Deaf in the UK, and, more importantly, people with profound learning disabilities and severe mental problems, who quite often need an advocate to speak on their behalf.
I urge you to vote for this report in its entirety and not be tempted to vote in the split vote.
Mr President, I should like in particular to thank Mrs Lynne and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for drafting this report.
This report confirms that the issue of disability is an issue with political, social and economic aspects.
It is an issue which horizontally touches all European Union policies.
In particular within the framework of the European Year of Disability, this report sends a clear message to the European Union and to the Member States, making Parliament's commitment known in the clearest of terms.
The first point which I should like to raise is the future UN Convention, which is expected to be a very important document of historic significance.
Your report will be useful and will play an important role for the Commission services during the discussions being held with the Member States, on the one hand, and the UN, on the other hand, on this future Convention.
It is well in keeping with the Commission proposals and communication.
We share the same principles and the same objectives.
In particular, I should like to comment on the core political aspect on which we agree, namely an approach based on human, social and political rights.
It is worth noting that the UN Convention is further recognition of the fact that it is not the individual's disability that needs to be corrected, it is the restraining environment that must adapt so as to safeguard full participation and equal opportunities for the individual.
The emphasis has shifted from the medical model to the so-called social standard, to building a policy based on fundamental human rights, on the one hand, and on social rights and guaranteed equal opportunities on the other.
In issuing this communication, the Commission has made clear its intention to promote this rights-based approach at European level and to rely on the European experience obtained to date from combating discrimination.
In addition, the Commission is insisting on an approach based on the social integration of the disabled and has tabled the issue of disability as one of the basic elements in the national action plans drawn up for social integration and combating poverty.
The Commission has requested negotiating instructions due to the fact that part of the Convention concerns the issue of 'non discrimination', which now comes under the jurisdiction of the European Union following the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Discussions with the Council have continued up to today, while at the same time the Commission is working closely with the Presidency on the pre-preparatory work for the Convention.
Mrs Lynne referred to the specific issue of developing countries and to the policy for development cooperation, which so far has been limited to drafting an explanatory memorandum on disability and development.
This memorandum, which is addressed to the representations and services of the European Union, was drafted in close cooperation with non-governmental organisations representing the disabled.
This document, which has been distributed to the representations of the European Union in developing countries, has had positive reactions at both government level and at the level of civil society organisations and it is important that, for the first time, we have an approach to the issue of disability in relation to development policy and development aid.
Although it is difficult in the initial stage to call for disability to be incorporated into the central body of development aid policies, this is a clear declaration that disability must be included and dealt with in the policies of every state in all sectors.
My final comment concerns the possible disability directive.
As Mrs Lynne has already said, the European Union has had a general directive on non-discrimination in the field of employment which also relates to the disabled since 2000.
This directive, which really was a big step for Europe and was accepted by all the Member States, has not progressed as we would have expected.
Most countries have not yet presented even a preliminary bill for transposing this directive, even though the final deadline is December 2003.
Despite repeated efforts during discussions in the Employment Councils, my letter to all the ministers and the mobilisation of European and national organisations, it would appear that the Member States have serious difficulties of a political and economic nature.
I call here on Parliament to also play an important role in exerting pressure on the Member States to get them to adopt this directive in principle.
However, I believe that it is clear from the situation today that it is premature to promote a new directive which would extend the scope of policies beyond the field of employment to all policy sectors overall.
I think that this would create a difficult situation in the Council and it would perhaps make it even more difficult to adopt the first directive, which has come up against the difficulties I referred to earlier.
At the same time, however, the Commission has proposed that the Member States examine and decide themselves if Community legislation should be used to combat discrimination on the grounds of disability in sectors other than employment in a report on the application of the directive on equal opportunities.
This will give us a first official reaction on the part of the Member States to this second, important step which, politically, is clearly a step which the European Union needs to take, but which it needs to take at the right time, with important preconditions to success, both at the decision-making level and at the level of practical implementation.
To conclude, the Commission has undertaken to participate actively with the Member States in the negotiations on the United Nations Convention.
Participation in these negotiations will also continue after the European Year of Disability within the framework of continuing action here, because our objective is to present an action plan at European level at the end of 2003, at the end of the Year of Disability, which will be the result of all the work carried out in all the Member States during this year, so that we have commitments on the part of the Member States at legislative, budgetary, policy and programme level.
Mr President, I will begin by saying that I fully agree with the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs produced by Mrs Lynne and that, furthermore, I agree with what the Commissioner has just said, wishing everybody the best of luck - Parliament and the Commission itself - with the objectives we have set, because they will undoubtedly have an effect on the well-being of thousands and thousands of citizens.
All the Member States agree that it is necessary to integrate disability into the procedures used by the organs monitoring the Treaties, either in the form of a protocol attached to one of the existing Treaties on human rights or as an instrument containing general principles, leaving open the possibility of subsequently adding implementing protocols.
I believe, however, that we will only be able to achieve the desired objectives by means of a legally binding convention which includes civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights suited to the circumstances of disabled people.
An agreement of a binding nature will demonstrate that disabled people face in their daily lives - as we all know - serious generalised problems which relate both to access difficulties and to bureaucracy and the attitudes of their co-citizens.
Its objective is not to create new laws but to clarify and adapt the existing ones.
The creation of a specific convention will be the only way to provide an effective monitoring mechanism for analysing the treatment received by disabled people throughout the world.
The convention will prioritise the rights of disabled people within the agendas of governments.
Its approval must mark the beginning of an effective and specific process aimed at guaranteeing the full and equitable integration of disabled people throughout the world.
This means that the problems of these people will be taken into account in the political decision-making processes at regional, national and international levels.
The European Union should also guarantee that organisations of disabled people are represented and act as advisers throughout the process and not just at the final moment.
I would just like to insist on certain points which are important, although other Members have mentioned them, and which we in Parliament and in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have been advocating: the existence, in many cases, of multiple discrimination - as a disabled woman or a disabled immigrant - eliminating legal barriers in order to eliminate physical barriers, education - which is very important - in values, which includes non-discrimination against disability in schools.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for her excellent report, which was, moreover, adopted unanimously in the Parliamentary committee: a report which is evidence of her particular sensitivity and experience, not least as rapporteur of the document launching the European Year of People with Disabilities 2003.
The unanimous vote in committee also serves to prove that disability is not a left- or right-wing issue, but an issue promoted by those who care about respect for the rights, equal opportunities and dignity of all citizens.
Moreover, the figures are no joking matter: there are 600 million people with disabilities in the world, 38 million of which live in Europe, and there will be 45 million in the enlarged Europe next year.
It should be pointed out that anyone can become disabled at any point in life.
It happens, in particular, as a result of the ageing of society, but that is not the only cause: consider - and I am quoting a figure relating to Italy - the 24 000 young people who become disabled each year as a result of accidents caused by the frenetic approach to life and social activity today.
These are figures which give cause for thought.
Hence the importance of establishing binding international standards seeking to protect the rights of people with disabilities with an appropriate built-in monitoring mechanism.
The binding UN Convention adopted last June, which has just such a monitoring mechanism, like the six human rights conventions, will have to bring to light the considerable, widespread problems encountered by people with disabilities in their everyday lives, whether in terms of access or bureaucracy or social attitudes.
It will therefore form the basis for the rights of all people with disabilities throughout the world.
I therefore trust that the European Presidency too, the Council in its role of negotiator, will make every endeavour to achieve a better-defined, more specific text in early 2004 than that presented in Mexico, in order to define practical standards to guide the approach of governments.
However, I regret the position adopted thus far by the European Commission, which has not yet provided a timetable for a future horizontal directive on the rights of people with disabilities in Europe and has not given specific or genuine undertakings to incorporate the rights of people with disabilities into its policies.
The directive on employment and occupation is important, as is the directive on access to transport, but we need to go further, Commissioner.
In particular, we cannot let the different countries get away with inertia as regards their legislation.
Mr President, 2003 is indeed the European Year of People with Disabilities.
It is also ten years since the UN Year of Disabled People and tonight it is quite right that this Parliament focuses not only on the rights of disabled people within the European Union, but on the disabled victims of human rights abuse world-wide.
On the global stage disabled people are the least recognised and most disempowered of all people.
This UN convention should act to mobilise change across all levels of government: local, national and international, forcing decision-makers to recognise disability rights in a human rights context in a way that has not happened before.
For too long international human rights instruments have failed to recognise disabled people explicitly and UN agencies working in the field of human rights and development cooperation have not recognised the specific factors which exclude and isolate disabled people.
I would like to think that a UN convention would also bring important resources to assist disabled people in their own empowerment and development in decision-making in order that their voice can be heard.
I am pleased tonight that Members on all sides of the House have supported the principle of a legally-binding convention.
Whilst existing human rights treaties apply to persons with disabilities, they do not specifically state that they protect the rights of persons with disabilities, nor is there an international treaty which specifically addresses those rights.
The human rights of disabled people deserve the same level of protection as those of other disadvantaged or vulnerable people such as women, children and ethnic minorities.
People with disabilities are a marginalised group for whom existing, generalised human rights standards have not worked and who therefore require explicit standards to adjust the discrimination they face in society and the range of violations to which they are subjected.
That is true for us in the European Union also, and it must be true further afield - particularly as regards our development cooperation policies - as the ACP-EU parliamentary assembly passed a groundbreaking resolution last year.
However, we still have to ensure the full participation of, and full rights for, disabled people such as the victims of landmines, people who have deliberately had disability inflicted upon them as part of war, or who have developed disability because of chronic diseases unknown to us nowadays within the European Union.
This is a truly worldwide issue.
I congratulate the Commissioner on what she said tonight.
She says that she supports bringing forward in the future a comprehensive disability non-discrimination directive.
She will not be surprised if I say to her again that in November she will have the opportunity to announce her intention to do so, in the communication winding up the European Year of Disabled People.
While she has the requisite power and influence, she should make that commitment.
We need her to do so; indeed, in the vote that will take place tomorrow we call on her to do so.
The rapporteur has made clear that there is a difference between her view and that of the Socialists on the issue of organisations for and of disabled people.
Organisations of disabled people are controlled by disabled people and by the parents of disabled people who are able to speak for themselves.
It is right that they are given priority, as they have been within the European Union since the 1996 Commission communication.
The Commissioner mentioned blind people: the European Blind Union - part of the European Disability Forum, the representative body of disabled people - wants us to give priority to organisations of disabled people.
Mrs Lynne says that people with severe learning difficulties cannot represent themselves.
But what about People First and other self-advocacy organisations?
These prove her wrong.
We stand by the split vote.
But that does not detract from our enormous support for this and for a United Nations convention for disabled people.
Mr President, it is extremely important that we have a legally-binding convention on the issue of people with disabilities.
Legislation is necessary which not only protects the rights of people with disabilities but also ensures that people with disabilities are provided with support and structures that will allow them to participate on an equal footing in all aspects of life.
The best-placed people to do this and present what is needed are people with disabilities themselves.
We have to be very careful about telling people with disabilities what they need and what we can do for them.
Unless you are a person with a disability, you do not know what is necessary to allow you to participate in society on an equal footing.
It is very good to see people here tonight providing sign language.
This should not only be for tonight: it should be looked at on an ongoing basis.
We also need to look at how people are educated.
We need to ensure that education is fully integrated and allows people with disabilities not to be segregated, but to be educated along with everyone else.
There is a tendency when we speak about disability to provide certain services for people with disabilities, but to segregate them.
We should look at sign language, at Braille, at all these things that are necessary and allow them to be part of the educational curriculum in all the Member States.
People should not have to go to special places to be educated or to participate.
This is extremely important.
Mr Howitt mentioned the Commission and its commitment to bringing forward a directive by the end of the year.
In the year of disabilities, it is not enough to say we are going to do a lot and then at the end of this year forget all about it and go along as normal.
We need to have something at the end that we can be proud of, to allow people to participate in society.
We need a broad perspective, not one which focuses only on accessibility in education.
This needs to be done in relation to disabled people themselves.
On that final point, I would like to say that the Centre for Independent Living, which is based in Ireland, is bringing a delegation from all over Europe for the second part-session here in September.
There is going to be a special intergroup which will be meeting with people with disabilities.
They will be telling us exactly what they want and what they would like to see brought forward.
This will be a great opportunity.
Everybody interested in the issue should come along and listen to people outlining what they want.
They are the people who are best-placed to do so.
We have to listen and allow them to make the decisions, we should not make decisions for them.
Mr President, Commissioner, in the European Year of People with Disabilities, the European Union has the chance to provide a great opportunity for making up for a huge amount of lost time.
Politics certainly cannot give back sight to the blind or speech to the dumb or mobility to the sick, but it can and, at all events, must enable people with disabilities to bear the difficulties of everyday life with less physical and mental effort and thus to give them the chance to lead an even more dignified life.
Sometimes - as we know from personal experience - it does not take much to give them this chance: removing structural barriers, building according to certain criteria which take into account the needs of a section of our people who have difficulties.
Thus, politics has the task of giving the issue due consideration: this is not charity or a work of mercy but recognition of the right to the best life possible.
Where, then, a physical disability goes hand in hand with a state of financial need or even extreme poverty - and that is the most common thing in the world - the situation becomes even more tragic.
The figures recorded in the report are alarming: there are 600 million people with disabilities, many of which come from the developing world.
We can therefore imagine their quality of life.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on behalf of which I am speaking, is aware that there is still much which can and must be done to address a major issue which affects millions of families in the world, who are waiting for politics and politicians to respond with practical measures to a topical problem which continues to be urgent.
However, the group acknowledges the Commission's sound proposals and endorses the conclusions drawn by the rapporteur, Mrs Lynn, in her report.
We will therefore vote for the resolution, which has the merit of giving many unfortunate people to whom fate has dealt a bitter blow the right to hope once again.
Mr President, I would like to echo the compliments which Mrs Lynne has received for her report, but the report is not complete in my view.
I welcome attention being given to the rights of the disabled.
However, all the rights that are mentioned relate to people with a disability; none relate to the rights of the unborn child with a disability.
This unborn life is also entitled to our protection.
All too often, antenatal pregnancy diagnostics is only used to determine whether an unborn child has a disability, whereupon, in the case of a disability, an induced termination of pregnancy is proceeded with.
It is a slap in the face of people with a congenital disability to know that we make such a fuss about their rights, while their disability in the unborn child would be a reason for termination.
It appears that there, the disabled do not have any rights, let alone dignity.
Mr President, 40 million European citizens are affected by some type of disability, but these individuals' full participation in society is not yet a reality because they still suffer prejudice and lack fundamental rights in terms of access to education, to gainful employment, to information and communication, as well as difficulties in access to the built environment and to transport.
There are some loopholes which must be closed.
Firstly, the international treaties currently in force in the field of human rights do apply to persons with disabilities but none of them contains specific and binding provisions in this area.
Then we have the European Union, which has been relatively active in protecting persons with disabilities, but which adopts measures that are intended only to establish a general framework for equal treatment in employment.
I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, who calls for the adoption of a United Nations convention.
This convention will be able to highlight the serious problems facing disabled persons in their daily lives.
I wish to take this opportunity to recall that the organisations representing disabled persons must participate fully in the drafting of this convention, and in defining and assessing all the measures intended for them.
Despite the Commissioner's understandable caution about the commitment of the Member States, I would ask the Commission not to delay presenting a wide-ranging Community directive on the rights of the disabled and incorporating these rights into our cooperation and development policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the implementation of international legally-binding instruments, established by the United Nations, to promote and protect the rights of disabled people, in other words to protect their dignity, is surely historic. You have said so yourself, Commissioner.
The European Union must, therefore, encourage the adoption of these instruments and play a full part in them.
Disabled people wish to have a free choice when it comes to their lifestyle.
They wish to be as independent as possible. Like all other citizens, they wish to be involved at every stage of the decision-making process, not only insofar as they themselves are directly affected, but also through the recognition of all their fundamental rights.
I think that a Community policy worthy of that name must be based on the existing measures, as is already the case. Moreover, it must promote legal measures at all levels, as underlined in the Lynne report.
Nonetheless, we are aware that although legal measures are necessary, they are not sufficient in themselves.
We must therefore work hard to raise the awareness of all sections of society, unions, management and teachers included. Everyone must be encouraged to take account of the specific situations related to disabilities.
This heightened awareness is also needed if the directive is to be transposed. Transposition is currently incomplete.
The second point to note is that our political ambitions need to be brought into line, and financial programmes should be meaningful and appropriate to current needs.
I could mention the great needs in the fields of education and schooling for example. I refer both to special and mainstream education.
The two are not contradictory.
We know some disabled people are excluded, dependent and live in poverty. We must respond with action to develop independence, solidarity and integration.
On this subject, the report before us today explores a whole series of approaches to be followed through all aspects of daily life. These areas are detailed in the report.
I believe that the European Union and its Member States must truly stand by people with disabilities. It is not a question of charity.
It is a question of rights.
It is a question of the effective exercise of citizenship. This is the simple demand of disabled people.
In this European Year of People with Disabilities, I think the recommendations of our rapporteur will contribute to the current action being taken to ensure all concerned are truly citizens, just as we in this House are.
Mr President, I congratulate my West Midlands colleague on the excellent work she has done as Parliament's rapporteur on this vitally important topic.
The United Nations agreed in 2001 to consider proposals for an international convention to promote and to protect the rights of people with disabilities.
To date there have been six separate UN treaties on human rights.
The next convention on the disabled should provide the seventh.
This report sets out some key principles that we trust will be taken on board in the process.
Specifically, it calls for the abandonment of the medical model, which regards disabled people as a problem, and instead recognises that disabled people have rights that should be enforced.
I call on colleagues from all political parties and groups to vote this report through unanimously.
This House should speak with one clear voice, pointing out that the needs and the rights of the disabled are above party politics: they matter to us all.
But this is only half the story.
We should not just vote and then move on to other issues, believing that our work is done.
The vote tomorrow should be seen as a commitment to drive for real change at the UN, in the EU and in our Member States.
Today we talk about the rights of disabled people.
Tomorrow our vote should be considered as a pledge to act; a pledge that we shall work together with vigour until these rights are secured.
Mr President, the rapporteur has turned to the problems of the disabled with particular, I would say even excess care, and she deserves congratulations from all our Members.
Usually we all offer to say nice things about the disabled.
What is not mentioned, however, is that the problem of disability does not concern a separate group of unlucky people; it concerns all of us, because we are all potentially disabled.
We just have to remember the thousands of people made disabled every year by accidents at work or on the roads.
This fact alone can incite us to the required degree and reduce our negligence to date.
We all know that the major revolution in the approach to disability over recent years is that the disabled are not treated simply as people with problems but as subjects of human rights.
However, what has not yet been fully realised is that this is not just a question of additional recognition of certain extra rights of a group of people.
The recognition of the disabled as people with rights is part of the realisation of the idea of the functioning of democracy.
It is therefore a question of the effective exercise of all existing fundamental rights.
?he right of free expression of opinion presupposes the right to information.
Neither of these two rights can be exercised by the disabled unless they are given the right language.
Universal access to public services is a dead letter if the obstacles to access to services for the disabled are not removed.
The fundamental rights of the elector and the elected remain inactive for certain groups of disabled as long as no care is taken to ensure there are specialised arrangements which make it possible for them to vote.
This being so, it is not a question of wishing for more advanced safeguarding of rights which are already generally safeguarded for the disabled or even the principle of the recognition of specialised rights; it is a question of how such a fundamental issue to the functioning of democracy has remained unresolved for so many years.
Allow me at this point to ask a simple question: 2003 has been proclaimed the Year of Disability.
This sort of celebratory proclamation has a practical impact not only when it is confined to raising people's awareness or collating material, but also when provision is made for specific timetables.
I know that Commissioner Diamantopoulou has an increased interest in and is particularly sensitive to an advanced policy for the disabled.
However, the Commission and the Member States do not appear to be on the same wavelength.
This explains the fact that the Commission, as the rapporteur has pointed out, is avoiding making any such commitment.
I should like, therefore, to ask the Commissioner to convey to the Commission our position that it is not possible for the European Union to reliably exert pressure on the members of the UN to vote for a special convention which will also be binding on developing and poorer countries when the more developed world refuses to set an example in this endeavour.
In all events, the basic line which needs to be adopted is not the recognition of new rights, but the effective application of rights already safeguarded in the international conventions recognised by the UN.
In this way, safeguarding the rights of the disabled will move away from the idea that it is a question of granting rights and will be established on the perception that it is an obligation based on commitments undertaken internationally.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, certainly, the presence at this moment in the Chamber of 25 Members out of 623, including the President, bears witness to the importance attached to this issue - I am serious, in view of the time - the issue of people with disabilities and the consideration given to them by legislation.
I am convinced that it is we legislators and politicians who are responsible for discrimination against people with disabilities, because of everything we have failed to do thus far.
Mr Mantovani, in 2004, there needs to be a legally binding UN decision to protect people with disabilities - it is necessary because, otherwise, they will not have their rights - and there is also a need for a European directive on disability.
I regret this too.
I know that if Commissioner Diamantopoulou had the powers of a European minister - the powers of a minister of one of the national states - she would have already resolved the issue of people with disabilities, for we have all seen the importance she has attached to this matter over the past four years.
I would like to make one more suggestion - to myself, more than anything - with a view to resolving the issue of disability: given that politicians are deaf, it may be better for us to channel our energies into educating young people - the few who are not - to respect disability.
Lastly, Mr President, I will end, if I may, by mentioning a subject which is very dear to the shadow rapporteur, Mr Mantovani, who has been striving on behalf of the non-self-sufficient for a lifetime, and saying that, in too many parts of the world, the non-self-sufficient, in addition to being disabled, are also elderly and do not receive the financial assistance which would allow them to live dignified lives as elderly, disabled people.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lynne most warmly, not just for the quality of the report she has presented to us, but also because she gave such careful consideration to the different proposals put to her.
Every year, throughout the world and here in Europe, the fundamental rights of disabled people continue to be infringed in many ways.
Even in Europe, the ill-treatment of disabled people is often a taboo subject, as is the very subject of disability itself.
These problems affect real men and women but most importantly victims.
Disabled people are vulnerable both physically and intellectually. This indicates the desirability of a legally-binding instrument and specific legal protection for disabled people the world over.
I am, of course, very happy that this question is on the agenda of the United Nations.
As was the case in respect of women and children, it is certainly now time for all the nations of the world to consider the protection of the fundamental rights of disabled people and the respect of these rights.
Drawing up a convention would establish global reference points for drafting national policies and legislation. It would enable appropriate monitoring and control mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that the fundamental rights and dignity of disabled people are respected.
We are aware that the Charter of Fundamental Rights outlaws discrimination on the grounds of disability and states that the integration of disabled people must be assured.
Above all, however, the first article of the Charter affirms the right to human dignity.
Europe is founded on the rejection of the differentiation, segregation and negation of people on any basis whatsoever.
It is therefore essential that, in addition to the categories of rights we have established in this report, we establish the right to protection against any form of violence and the right to protection against cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
In this regard, I hope the European Commission will be in a position to put to Parliament a proposal for a comprehensive European Union directive on disabled people at some time in the future.
The action we take in relation to disabled people must seek to combat not only violence and ill-treatment, but also the negation and infringement of disabled people's most fundamental rights in their daily lives.
To this end, I believe we must adopt pro-active policies to integrate disabled people into the whole of society on the same terms as any other citizens.
Mr President, I wish sincerely to thank Mrs Lynne for the effort she has put into the work on a legally binding UN Convention to promote and protect the rights and dignity of disabled people.
It is an important issue, and one that we are highlighting here in the European Parliament through campaigning for the Convention to become legally binding and to be accompanied by an efficient supervisory system, in common with the other six UN conventions on human rights.
It is important for this Convention to be seen as a way of strengthening the UN's general work for democracy and human rights around the world.
It is also important to emphasise that, if disabled people are given opportunities to live outside institutions, they must be offered sufficient support for doing so successfully.
In Sweden, people who would once have resided in institutions for mentally handicapped and/or mentally disabled people now, in large measure, live instead in their own homes, with the result that many of these people are no longer part of a social community and have instead been isolated in their flats or become homeless and out on the streets.
That is a tragic lesson for other European countries to take into account.
It is also important for there to be a sensible definition of 'disabled' as a concept so that it does not lose its real meaning.
As a Swedish Christian Democrat, I should like to have seen us in the European Parliament state that the future Convention should include wording concerning the right to life, implying that disabilities should not form a basis for diagnosing foetuses as unviable, for it is absolutely basic to our view of human beings that people with disabilities should not be looked down upon and their human dignity violated.
Foetal diagnosis must not be used for screening out people with disabilities.
In conclusion, I want to express my pleasure at the fact that this debate is being interpreted as a sign.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews.
Tonight he has made his best speech ever in the House.
It would appear that we have had some influence on him.
We all recognise that there are millions upon millions of people in the European Union and around the world who suffer indignities every day of their lives because we have failed, not only to pass legislation, but to change society's attitude to them.
We constantly obstruct their path towards enjoying a full human existence.
There are six hundred million disabled people across the world, 80% of whom are in the developing world.
It is clear, as the Commissioner said, that we need to address this in our development and aid policies.
It is clear that a voluntary approach to guarantee rights for people with disabilities is not working.
We need legally-based rights, as this report points out, at an international level.
We need a convention to do that.
We are here as representatives of states, all of which have failed to implement a directive that they freely entered into not more than two years ago.
They have all failed to implement the framework directive.
Therefore we have to accept our own responsibility for that.
It is a matter of regret for me that in my own country we have a proposed disability bill, intended to implement the framework directive, which refuses to accept a rights-based approach for people with disabilities.
I simply cannot understand how, after all the years of experience, this continues to be the case.
I listened with care to the Commissioner when she gave her reasons as to why she has not brought forward a draft directive under Article 13 of the EC Treaty.
I have no doubts at all that she is committed to providing legally-based rights for people with disabilities, but her argument on not bringing forward a new draft directive is wrong.
By bringing forward a new draft directive greater pressure would be brought to bear on Member States and people in this House to ensure that what is there already will be implemented.
If we sit back and allow Member States to stall on the current directive, by not putting pressure on them through a new directive, we would be making a grave mistake.
What mandate, if any, has the Council given the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the European Union in relation to the United Nations Convention on People with Disabilities?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to join with everyone who has already congratulated Mrs Lynne on her excellent and exhaustive work examining the challenges facing people with disabilities and to congratulate Mrs Cerdeira Morterero on the major contribution made by the opinion she has delivered.
As has already been emphasised in this debate, it is estimated that around 600 million people in the world are affected by one form of disability or another.
This equates to 10% of the world's population, and there is a direct link between disability on the one hand and poverty and social exclusion on the other.
The problem faced by disabled citizens is the way in which principles of equality and non-discrimination are applied, in other words, the problems in accessing the rights of full citizenship also faced by people who are discriminated against on any other grounds.
The most important aspect of overcoming this discrimination, furthermore, is the attitude that we all take in the various decisions we face in our daily lives.
We in the European Parliament's intergroup for disabled persons - and I wish at this juncture to make a special reference to the group's chairman, Mr Richard Howitt, who has been tireless in chairing this intergroup - in close collaboration with the European Disability Forum, we have, despite everything that has been achieved, noted some points on both minor and major issues that concern everyone: with regard to disabled access to city buses, to banning obstacles in the built environment and with regard to telecommunications.
Much, however, remains to be done.
As our rapporteur said, it is curious that the Commission should consider a new United Nations convention to be needed to promote and protect the rights and dignity of disabled persons alongside other conventions devoted to specific areas of human rights and yet is not of the view that this principle should also apply to European legislation.
We hope that the Commission will pay sufficient attention to the Disabled People's Parliament that will be meeting in our own Parliament buildings in Brussels in November.
We also hope that it will then think not only about the legislative initiatives that must be taken at international and Member-State level, but also about those that the Commission itself will be taking.
I assume that the Commission will give a written answer to Mr De Rossa's question.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
I would first like to thank Mrs Lynne for her report. It underlines the need to establish international legally-binding instruments to provide better protection of the rights of disabled people.
This is an appropriate moment to point out that Member States are not making sufficient efforts to ensure that disabled people enjoy the same rights as non-disabled people.
Essentially, what is at issue are the so-called access rights: rights to access a job, buildings, email and the Internet.
These rights may exist on paper, but they are not a reality.
Present European Union legislation on discrimination against disabled people only relates to employment.
Discrimination, however, occurs in all areas of people's daily lives. It follows that we must adopt a horizontal approach and integrate this factor into all political domains.
The European Year of People with Disabilities is in full swing.
It should mark the start of lasting change for our so-called invisible citizens.
Its success will be measured in tangible results. These include increasing the public profile of disabled people and establishing more comprehensive measures to combat discrimination.
We would like the Commission to enter into a firm undertaking in relation to disabled people.
(Written statement abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure).
. (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly thanking you, Mr Ojeda Sanz, for your report on the extension of the Guinea fisheries protocol to 31 December 2003.
I am glad that you give our proposal your full support.
In your report, you ask the Commission to resume negotiations with the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea as soon as this year, in order to reach longer-term arrangements concerning our fishing relations with that country.
I can already tell you that this has been done.
A new fisheries protocol, to run for five years, is to enter into force on 1 January 2004.
Even before negotiations commenced, we commissioned a study on the ex post-evaluation of the current protocol and to analyse the impact of the new one.
This study produced results in good time for the beginning of negotiations, and so these could provide input into the new protocol.
The proposal will be presented to this House and to the Council as soon as the Commission has formally adopted it.
Let me now turn to the amendments.
Although I can agree to the first, I would like to point out to you that the Commission has already, under the Interinstitutional Agreement, forwarded to Parliament the information you demand.
In essence, then, this amendment is no longer necessary.
I regret to say that the Commission cannot endorse the second amendment, as it would contravene the procedure applicable to fisheries protocols.
The protocols are annexed to the framework agreements, and so no new negotiating mandate is required for them to be extended.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner very much for his information.
I would like to say, and this will please the Members waiting to speak on this and other reports, that I am not going to use up the five minutes which the Presidency has granted me.
Firstly, I would like to say that the protocol agreed between Guinea and the European Union is beneficial to both parties.
I believe that this is an important conclusion, above all with a view to the negotiation of the next Agreement.
The previous protocol, which has now been extended, is the eighth in the series since the two parties signed the fisheries agreement in 1983.
This extension includes the same fishing opportunities and the same conditions for 2003.
The truth is that we expected to have an assessment report beforehand on the situation of the populations, which, for technical reasons relating to the vessel which would have to carry out this type of investigation, could not be produced.
However, and now that the Commissioner has confirmed that this information will be available soon, we expected this information to be available during this year; because the results of that investigation are the ones which will allow us to verify whether or not the objectives and conditions for the signature of this agreement have been fulfilled.
And one of these conditions is the reduction in the global fishing effort in the waters under Guinean jurisdiction.
This condition is based on the cautionary principle introduced for the first time in the protocol of 2001 and whose aim is to guarantee the recovery of certain fishing grounds within its jurisdictional waters.
By means of that assessment, the delay of which has led to this extension, the Commission will decide on a subsequent negotiation, but this time, also according to what the Commissioner has said, with a considerably longer period of time.
My two amendments simply expressed, on the one hand, our dissatisfaction at not having been able to carry out the scheduled evaluation of resources, which justifies this one-year extension and, on the other, our criticism of the fact that this consultation has been communicated to Parliament so late, because it is no longer possible to issue an opinion before the payment of the financial compensation of some EUR 3 million which has already been paid at the end of June.
Furthermore, I consider it particularly useful for this House to be able to obtain more information relating to the implementation of the specific measures to which almost 50% of the financial compensation in this agreement has been directed.
This financial compensation and these measures demonstrate the European Union's interest in guaranteeing, beyond legitimate support for the fishing activities of Community ships, the sustainable development of the fisheries sector of the Republic of Guinea and greater control over the implementation of the measures laid down in the protocol.
I would also like to say that I am pleased that the Commissioner has informed us that the next agreement will be negotiated for five years, because I believe this is the best way to offer ship owners, companies and professionals in the sector a framework for safety and reliability, which will allow them to make investments and rationalise their activities in a more consistent way than they were able to do simply through two-year agreements.
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists agrees with the conclusions of the rapporteur, Mr Ojeda, and of the Committee on Fisheries and will therefore vote in favour of the extension of the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea.
Having said this, we should learn certain lessons when it comes to renewing other fisheries agreements.
Firstly, duration.
It is not good either for the Community or for the other contracting party, or for the fisheries sector, for agreements to be of such a short duration - two years - as the existing one between the European Union and Guinea.
In order to make the necessary planning, it would be more appropriate to have an agreement of five years, even if it contains a mid-term review clause.
I must therefore express my satisfaction with the announcement Commissioner Fischler has just made to the effect that the next agreement will last for five years, if I have understood correctly.
Agreements must also serve the Community in terms of establishing strategic alliances within international fora with a view to making effective progress in the fight against illegal fishing, which is the greatest scourge faced by sustainable fishing and the future of fisheries.
We want the Community to help the Guinean authorities responsible for controlling and monitoring fishing activities in order to achieve sustainable exploitation of the fisheries resources of the country, showing respect for the environment and marine resources.
Our group therefore believes that it is justified to support this extension as requested by the rapporteur, Mr Ojeda, who has done wonderful work, since, as in the case of the other commercial fisheries agreements, it is beneficial to both parties, since it contributes to the development of local fishing, increases food safety in the country, allows its port infrastructure to be improved and because the money paid by the European Community means significant income in the form of financial compensation for the public coffers of the Republic of Guinea.
Furthermore, this agreement contributes in turn to European economic and social cohesion, since it benefits fleets from regions highly dependent on fishing, peripheral regions and regions with incomes below the Community average.
I would ask the Commission, when considering a further renewal of this agreement, to take account of the request, already made by Parliament on other occasions, to include the social clause in the next protocol.
Mr President, the Commission has claimed that it is entering a new phase with respect to fisheries agreements and that from now on they are to be called 'partnership agreements'.
It is all very well changing what you call them, but if you do not change the approach there is very little to get excited about.
The one year extension makes it very clear that not much has changed.
I will give you three examples.
By the Commission's own admission a new protocol was not negotiated because a scientific survey had not been conducted.
Basing access rights upon scientific information is fundamental to good management, so I do not believe this is very responsible.
Secondly, vessels are supposed to land fish for the local market, which could be an important factor in food security and yet ship owners can escape this requirement by paying a small fee.
In the Senegal Agreement this requirement is far more constraining so that vessels can lose their licences for failure to comply.
Thirdly, the by-catch allowed to be kept by the EU fleet is far higher than what the Guinean fleet is allowed to keep.
For instance, EU cephalopod vessels are allowed to keep over four times as much fish by-catch as Guinean vessels.
This is clearly discrimination.
What has the Commission done in its approach to agreements, other than to change the name?
This is not an acceptable situation.
Can the Commission tell us if things have improved in the newly-signed protocol, particularly in relation to the fact that ship owners can opt out simply by paying a small fee, which they would be well capable of doing?
In relation to discards, this is also completely unacceptable.
I would like the Commission to give us a few answers on this.
Thank you, Mrs McKenna.
Commissioner, I am now going to claim ten seconds for myself.
From time to time I still dream about a revolutionary Commission negotiating with a revolutionary People's Republic, but that is a long way in the future.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs GrÃ¶ner and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on this extremely positive report, which concerns the DAPHNE II Programme, the second five-year phase of a programme to combat violence against children, young people and women.
This proposal is a response to and a direct consequence of the recommendation made by the European Parliament in its interim report on the first DAPHNE Programme, in which it calls for violence to continue to be combated beyond 2003.
Parliament's report on the mid-term review of the DAPHNE Programme in 2002 had already presented an opportunity for us to debate some of the initial ideas on a programme that could follow on from the DAPHNE Programme.
We could, therefore, say that this proposal for DAPHNE II is in line with the discussions we held at that time: an increase in financial and human resources and more sharing of information and best practice, amongst other aspects.
The Commission has not made any substantial changes to the objectives, mechanisms or beneficiaries of the programme, because the current DAPHNE Programme is acknowledged to be an instrument that has produced excellent results.
In footballing terms, we would say that there is no point in changing a winning team.
We have, however, proposed some improvements to increase the programme's impact.
The main improvement is doubtless the increase to the programme's budget: EUR 41 million as compared to EUR 20 million.
The need for a larger budget is indeed a concern that the Commission and Parliament share.
Since the time that this proposal was presented to Parliament, the needs associated with the European Union's enlargement have been taken into account with regard to all Commission instruments and, as you can see in the proposal for the 2004 budget, the sum currently earmarked for the DAPHNE II Programme stands at EUR 49.2 million for the period 2004-2008.
This sum will provide almost EUR 10 million per year, which represents a 100% increase, a doubling of current resources.
This will put us in a better position from which to address the growing demand from organisations in Europe and the consequences of enlargement too.
A second improvement consists of the list of activities that can be supported and that are referred to in Article 4.
The DAPHNE II proposal is clearer than DAPHNE I where this type of activity is concerned.
Another change has been made to exchange the information and best practice developed under the programme.
The aim of this is to increase the programme's impact on the groups involved.
Specific invitations to submit proposals will be published with a view to identifying and defining the policies to pursue, where possible on the basis of the work already undertaken by the projects that have been funded to date.
The aim is also to disseminate on a European scale the good practices developed in projects that have been funded.
This could be achieved by producing and making available not only traditional written material but also an increasing number of CD-ROMs, films, videos and websites or by promoting or arranging exchanges of experienced staff between civil society organisations in order to support the implementation of new solutions or practices that have proven to be effective in another context.
The last change we have made is to enable non-governmental organisations to use, adapt or transfer the results of the DAPHNE Programme to other parts of the Union or to other categories of beneficiaries.
These are the basic outlines of the presentation I wish to make, and I look forward to the debate and the questions you might want to ask so that we can obtain Parliament's approval for this programme which I believe is a milestone in the fight against violence in the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, the DAPHNE Programme - as we will all well recall - was brought into being in response to the results of the Peking Platform for Action, in the aftermath of the Stockholm world congress on the sexual exploitation of children for commercial purposes and, finally, following the horrors of the Dutroux affair, which gave the European public a rude awakening.
The initiative was aimed at funding measures to combat violence against children, young people, and women in Europe, and its great success led to the DAPHNE I Programme, which will now keep on running right up to 2003.
A four-year programme, it was funded to the tune of EUR 20 million.
My report is concerned with the Commission's proposal for the DAPHNE II Programme, which is to run from 2004 to 2008.
Within the programme's framework, measures can now be promoted to protect the three groups that will benefit - children, young people, and women - as can the relevant preventive measures.
These include the establishment of networks for NGOs across Europe, support for collaboration between NGOs and authorities in the same field, measures to protect the target groups and to prevent violence against those belonging to them, studies, research work aimed at discovering the causes of violence, at preventing it, and at the support of groups at risk and their reintegration into society.
This includes the sharing of good practice and of information, as well as awareness programmes for the general public, for the victims, the groups at risk and for those who work with them.
Participation in the DAPHNE I Programme was open to the central and eastern European countries, as well as to Cyprus, Malta, Turkey and the countries belonging to EFTA and the European Economic Area, and there was the possibility of multiannual programmes.
Amendment No 11 is now aimed at linking DAPHNE with other Community programmes and sharing the experience of them with third states.
The DAPHNE Programme, which supports these projects, is now regarded, both in Europe and far beyond its borders, as exemplary and as an important instrument in combating violence.
What we have achieved is a change to framework conditions through regional initiatives with international concepts.
The German Protection against Violence Act, for example, has taken on distinct characteristics derived from European experience.
Let me also, at this point, mention the Austrian right of exclusion in cases of domestic violence, which keeps perpetrators of violence away from the home.
DAPHNE I's budget made it possible to fund 140 projects.
The thirty-five projects selected in 2001 focussed on the genital mutilation of women, in which third countries were also involved, and the sexual exploitation of children through paedophilia.
It must be made clear, though, that these projects saw the submission of 662 proposals in the last two years, and that these would in fact have necessitated funding to the tune of EUR 65 million.
The glut of applications, and the fact that only 13% of all projects in respect of which applications were submitted could be funded, makes it apparent that significantly greater sums need to be made available.
We cannot fail to come to the conclusion that funding for DAPHNE II must be increased to EUR 65 million, and my group, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, has supported an amendment to this effect.
If the praise heaped on DAPHNE I is not to be forgotten - and it is not a matter of controversy to say that it should not be - then this must be made a political priority.
The response from the Committee on Women's Rights has been somewhat timid.
In contrast to what my group has proposed, we have come up with the figure of EUR 50 million, so I have submitted the new amendment and ask you to support it.
Amendment No 39 is intended to set up a helpdesk providing help to women's organisations in the new Member States, which have as yet little experience of European programmes.
We want the European Year against Violence to be based on our experience with DAPHNE and to make a definite mark.
This European Year against Violence could become a reality as soon as 2006.
I am aware that the idea of a substantial topping-up of funds is meeting with resistance from the Committee on Budgets, but if DAPHNE, which is founded upon the health articles in the Treaties, is not to go unheeded and be dismissed as a game like football - the example given by the Commissioner - for lack of a legal basis specific to it, and if we want to take seriously the problems involved in combating violence, then we must demonstrate political courage and make more funding available.
- (DA) Mr President, the Committee on Budgets' opinion on the DAPHNE II Programme is primarily rather technical in scope, and of course this technical side is very important.
How much in terms of funding should be allocated to the programme for combating violence against children, young people and women?
As Mrs GrÃ¶ner stated, there has been a lot of interest in seeking funds from the previous DAPHNE Programme, and there were far more high-quality projects than there was money for.
The programme has been implemented well and the funds used efficiently and, given the wealth of interest, there are clearly sound reasons for increasing the budget for DAPHNE, and also by an amount larger than the general budget increase we normally give in connection with enlargement.
It is, however, no secret that the multi-annual budgets for this type of policy - an internal policy - has a very low ceiling.
There is not a lot of extra money to give away.
We must prioritise, and the Committee on Budgets has therefore been unable to give its support for a budget for DAPHNE of EUR 65 million.
We have instead proposed that we stick to the budget framework of EUR 49.2 million proposed by the Commission.
I can see that, in its report, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has arrived at a budget of EUR 50 million.
It bears quite a lot of resemblance to the Committee on Budgets' proposal, and it is an amount I would assess as defensible from a budgeting point of view.
I should also like to say how very pleased the Committee on Budgets is that the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has adopted our proposal that, after 2006, the commitment appropriations for DAPHNE II be dependent upon an agreement with the budgetary authorities.
We shall, of course, only in the end be able to say how the budget for DAPHNE II will look after 2006 once the next multi-annual agreements and financial perspectives for the EU's budget have been established, and it is of course a traditional proposal we have.
Overall, then, I wish to say that we in the Committee on Budgets are able to support the report as it stands, but we cannot support the amendment designed to increase the budget to EUR 65 million.
Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. (SV) Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs GrÃ¶ner, as rapporteur, for her committed work.
In Europe, there are still misapprehensions and false stereotypes surrounding the issue of violence against women and children.
The problem is too often treated as an unfortunate and natural part of life.
Moreover, the victims - that is to say women and children - are often blamed.
That applies to violence within the family, but also to, for example, trafficking in women and structural violence against women.
That is something we must combat.
Many run a high risk of being exposed to violence and abuse, something that is the concern of all of us.
We are responsible for working for the effective combating of violence in the EU.
