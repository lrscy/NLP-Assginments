Having travelled as far as that, it would obviously be a tragedy if the opportunity for peace that now exists more than ever before were to be wasted.
We stand ready, as the President-in-office has indicated, to help move things forward in any way we can and we are ready to do what we can to secure a settlement.
It is a great pleasure to see our own representative, who has done so much to ensure that the European Union's presence in the region is felt.
With time moving relentlessly on, there has inevitably been a growing amount of talk about Palestinian statehood.
The Berlin European Council Declaration remains the position of the European Union.
President Arafat has received wise advice to postpone the planned declaration of an independent Palestinian state on 13 September.
I want to repeat what was said in the Berlin European Council Declaration last March, that the European Union is convinced that the creation of a democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of existing agreements and through negotiations would be the best guarantee of Israel's security and Israel's acceptance as an equal partner in the region.
That is our position.
As far as Syria is concerned, everyone recognises that President Bashar al-Assad needs to consolidate his position.
However, here too the differences with Israel are narrow and we think they could be bridged.
We will continue to do all we can to achieve this.
We have a key role to play in Syria in terms of actively encouraging economic reform and modernisation in the interests of Syria and in the interests of regional stability.
I had an extremely good visit to Syria, albeit too brief, earlier in the year, at which we significantly moved forward our dialogue on economic issues and on the assistance we can provide.
We want to respond to further requests from Syria for assistance in the reform process.
We will also be prepared to support strengthening of the rule of law, human rights issues and political pluralism.
As far as South Lebanon is concerned, there remains an enormous amount for Europe to do, not least as part of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
The European Union will assist with the reconstruction of southern Lebanon as soon as the Commission conditions permit.
The Lebanese Government must maintain order in the south and in addition it must translate its generic aid requests into concrete and realistic proposals.
We will outline our strategies as soon as these conditions are met and, as many Members know, we have had an assessment mission in the area to see exactly what we can do on the ground as soon as possible.
It will not surprise the House to know that we intend to work in areas like mine clearance where we have so much experience, areas which are vital to the restoration of normal economic life and decent social conditions in South Lebanon.
At the same time as we are preparing for a possible role in implementing any peace agreement, we are also focusing on the regional scenario after a peace settlement.
When conflict is a thing of the past, it is important to recognise that a peace settlement would transform everybody's prospects.
Sustained economic growth and economic stability are the keys to regional peace and consolidation of that peace in the years ahead.
People are more likely to support peace if they feel that their living conditions are improving.
However, at present, economic growth is stagnant, and unemployment is distressingly high, over 15 to 20% overall.
Disparities are growing both within the region and, as was said in the debate that we had yesterday on MEDA, between the region and the European Union.
In addition, the regional labour market will come under strong pressure because of high population growth resulting from the welcome incorporation of more women into the labour market and the future integration of Palestinian refugees into the economies of the region.
Regional prosperity, therefore, depends on serious efforts to promote economic growth.
Private investment will play a central role in that, but public investment will continue to be important, especially regarding economic transition, including harmonisation, internal liberalisation and regional cooperation, stabilisation and regional infrastructures.
I referred to the interesting debate that we had yesterday evening on MEDA and our attempts to speed up and simplify the regulation so that we can deliver our assistance in the region much more rapidly.
It is important to remember what the scale of that assistance is.
The European Union as a whole, the Commission, Member States, and the EIB, are responsible for about 50% of all the economic assistance in the region.
The Commission and the EIB are responsible for about half of that 50%, so we are responsible for about 25%.
Over the last few years our assistance in the region has been averaging about EUR 800 million, that is from the Commission and the EIB, about EUR 450 million from the Commission and the rest from the EIB.
That is a substantial investment in the future prosperity and well-being of the region, but I am still seeking to ensure that the resources available are spent more effectively and more rapidly.
I said yesterday that the Commission would be holding discussions this week, and I hope it is not presuming on its collective wisdom to say that we will be able to publish our proposals later this week.
We are discussing a Commission communication on the revitalisation of the Barcelona process, which everybody recognises to be extremely important.
In that document we will be stressing the vital significance of greater regional cooperation and more trade and cooperation between the countries to the south and not just between Europe and the countries of the South.
I hope that the document and its implementation will help to consolidate political developments in the region.
I repeat: this is clearly a historic opportunity to secure a peace that would bring prosperity as well as stability to our neighbours to the south.
We stand ready to help them in every way we can, politically and economically.
We stand ready to help them both to achieve peace and to build on the foundations that a peace settlement would lay.
Madam President, since the creation of the State of Israel, we have surely never been so close to a lasting and stable peace agreement in the Middle East.
The differences between the parties, however, have probably never been so profound.
The withdrawal of the Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, the will demonstrated by the new Syrian President and the clear progress made at Camp David - as has been mentioned here this morning - seem to offer us a panorama in which peace is actually within reach.
However, there are still potential pitfalls, which remind us that, we are as close to taking advantage of this historic opportunity as we are to the black storm clouds that will descend upon the region should the negotiations fail.
What we can we in the European Union do?
Of course we offer our services by means of the European Union' s special envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, whom I welcome.
We undoubtedly offer a guarantee in terms of the future economic development of the region, which would no doubt result from the peace agreement, through our cooperation and investment, as Commissioner Patten has correctly reminded us.
We encourage the opposing parties to persist courageously with the negotiations, ignoring the most pessimistic, sometimes threatening, voices, which sometimes emerge from their respective countries.
We are grateful for the summary of the facts, the information communicated to us this morning by the Council and the Commission, and their good will.
However, we should ask ourselves whether this is worthy of the responsibility and aspirations of the European Union on an international level.
To speak with one voice, to aspire to a leading role not only economically but also, surely, politically, demands more of us.
No group is offering greater support than the European People' s Party to the governments promoting the peace process, especially to the United States.
No group is forcing itself to act with greater prudence than we are at this critical moment.
From this point of view we propose that next year, when we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Conference which gave rise to this peace process, the European Union should once again bring together, in a repeat of the Madrid meeting, the leaders who participated in that Conference.
Meanwhile, we should reaffirm the European Union' s full commitment to the peace process and our willingness to honour our historic, economic and also political responsibilities in the region.
Madam President, first of all, I would like, on behalf of my group, to welcome the President of the Knesset, Avraham Burg, and the President of the Palestinian National Council, Mr Abu Ala, who are present in the gallery, and whose interventions we will listen to with great attention.
The presence of these two distinguished persons indicates that the peace process is not purely a process taking place between governments.
It is a process taking place between peoples and between parliaments, which democratically represent those peoples.
I would ask the two Presidents to deliver a message to their people: they have come here and they have seen how the representatives of peoples who have been age-old enemies and who have waged war for centuries, can work together and in peace, and can share values.
I believe that this is the fundamental message we can offer you.
I would also like to point out that, as well as the effort being made in terms of negotiations between the governments, which we must support, my political family, the Socialist International, is also trying to support and promote this process because both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders belong to our family and we feel profoundly committed to them.
We agree with the exhaustive analysis of the situation made by the President of the Council and I would simply like to repeat the message, to our friends from the Middle East, that we are committed to the peace process and to its development since the Sharm-el-Sheikh agreements, which led to the last major debate in the European Parliament.
We are approaching a deadline.
We Europeans understand the importance of deadlines and the need to pull out all the stops when deadlines approach, but we believe that the important thing at the moment is for both parties to persevere.
We welcome the efforts of President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright.
We consider ourselves to be committed to this process, and we welcome the presence here today of that tireless pilgrim of peace, Ambassador Moratinos.
Above all, I believe that we should point out the importance of what is at stake at the moment because, until now, there had been no real negotiation of the situation of the Palestinian refugees since 1948, the continuation of the Israeli settlements and the establishment of definitive borders.
Those are the very important and thorny issues which must be dealt with.
Another very important issue is the status of Jerusalem, which requires a compromise.
It is not only a political problem. It is a cultural, historical and religious problem.
Therefore, there is no room for a solution based on exclusive claims.
As some experts have said, on religious issues there are no half measures, but, if we are talking about the religions of the Book, which preach the love of God and our fellow man, it must be possible to find a solution between people.
Where Holy Places are concerned, there is no room for solutions based solely on sovereign rights and it is very important to take proper account of the various international formulae: I believe that the mediation of certain Arab countries, who are closely involved, may be of help.
Lastly, Madam President, I believe that, from the point of view of European Union action, we must try to strengthen the Euro-Mediterranean process, bring Syria out of its isolation, strengthen the process in the whole of the region and, above all, send a message to the Middle East which indicates that the European Union, as a union of age-old enemies, wishes to participate fully in the creation of a shared peaceful future in the Middle East.
Madam President, for lack of time, I shall merely focus on the relations between Israel and the Palestinians.
We all very much regret that the Camp David negotiations came to nothing.
This was most probably down to the fact that the time was not quite ripe for an agreement, as a result of which the gap between both parties could not be narrowed or could not be narrowed sufficiently at any rate.
We live in the hope, however, that a new foundation will be laid after a period of contemplation and reflection, so that we can pick up the peace process once again and herald a new era.
Indeed, we now have to ensure that the negotiations are resumed as quickly as possible.
Needless to say, the international community needs to lend a helping hand, together with the Arab States and the Muslim community.
As far as the European Union is concerned, we hope that it will speak with one voice and assume a more pro-active role - and I particularly refer to a more pro-active role in the political field - and will thus contribute to the peace process.
The EU owes this much to both parties and to the international community.
It is evident that, meanwhile, unilateral action from either side is to be discouraged, as this could well harm future negotiations.
We cannot tolerate violence in any form.
The negotiations must be resumed by means of an open, direct and genuine dialogue, and Europe has a major part to play in this!
Madam President, I have been present in Jerusalem as a provisional member of Parliament' s delegation for relations with Israel.
We met reasonable representatives of the Israeli Government but also, among the members of the Knesset, a dismaying number of implacable fanatics who maintain that Israel has all the rights and the Palestinians none at all.
It was therefore good that the Council' s representatives made it clear that the EU backs all current UN decisions.
What, then, do these decisions imply?
Well, they say that there should be Jewish and Palestinian States in the area, that the whole of Jerusalem should be an international area, that all Palestinian refugees should be allowed to return home and that Israel should leave those areas which it has occupied.
It may therefore be noted that Israel is right in one respect, namely that there is to be a Jewish State.
That is what no-one now questions but, when it comes to all the important questions in the peace negotiations - that is to say, Jerusalem, the refugees and territorial considerations - the Palestinians in fact have international law on their side.
At the same time, everyone appreciates that the UN decisions cannot directly be implemented by peaceful means.
Israel is opposed to this.
The Palestinians are prepared to compromise.
They are not demanding west Jerusalem.
They appreciate that Israel cannot receive between five and six million Palestinian refugees.
The Palestinians are prepared to make concessions over territory.
They are making concessions, which is splendid and necessary, but the Palestinians and Arafat cannot make large concessions of any kind without a revolt in their own ranks.
It is therefore important that the EU should stick by the Berlin decision to recognise a Palestinian State without conditions as soon as the Palestinians see fit to declare such a State, to which they are entitled.
Israel has the military power and US backing.
The Palestinians do in fact have international law on their side.
Let them also have the European Union' s full support, in the same way and to the same degree that the United States supports Israel.
Let the EU act as a sponsor for the Palestinian State, that is to say the democratic Palestinian State.
This would also raise the EU' s standing in the world.
Madam President, my group asked for a major debate on the situation in the Middle East to be included in this part-session.
It also suggested that high-ranking Israeli and Palestinian leaders be invited jointly to the European Parliament.
We are therefore delighted by the initiatives taken in this direction and warmly welcome the speakers of the two assemblies who have honoured us with their presence.
At a time which everyone senses is decisive, what useful message can we Europeans send out to the peace process today?
I tend to agree with what the President-in-Office said on the subject.
The first message, to my mind, concerns the issue around which the entire process turns, i.e. the Palestinian State.
I think the time is right to clearly reiterate the terms of the unequivocal declaration adopted by the Berlin European Council in March 1999, in which the Fifteen stated that they were ready to recognise a Palestinian State.
Did Europe' s recognition of this inalienable right lead the Palestinians to proclaim statehood without further ado?
On the contrary.
It fostered the sovereign and responsible decision on the part of the Palestinian leadership to postpone the deadline and I am convinced that it is prepared to postpone it by a few more weeks to give negotiation a chance if it feels, between now and 13 September, that we are on the brink of an overall peace agreement.
So let the European Union clearly reaffirm the position which it took in Berlin and encourage the Palestinians to make precisely this gesture.
In the same spirit, Europe' s second message, in my view, should consist of a reminder of the basic principles from which negotiations can and should develop, i.e. the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, especially those relating to the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, or the right of refugees to return or receive compensation.
This sort of reminder would not in any way close the door to the compromises needed.
On the contrary, it would make the sovereign Palestinians responsible for seeking original, mutually acceptable legal formulae, together with the sovereign Israeli negotiators, on the basis of the principles recognised by the entire international community.
I think that Europe' s third message should contain a guarantee that the future global agreement will be implemented to the end, unlike - alas - all the partial agreements which have succeeded each other since Oslo.
The United States alone cannot provide this guarantee.
No one today knows the intentions of the future leaders of the Israelis and the Palestinians.
The European Union is therefore a unique guarantor, alongside the United States and Egypt, as the representative of the Arab world, that the commitments made will be honoured faithfully and to the letter.
These are the three wishes of my group with the hope that, as a result, Yerushalaim, which means in Hebrew: peace will appear.
Madam President, thank you very much indeed for arranging this very important debate at this particular time.
I also wish to warmly welcome to our Parliament the Speaker of the Knesset, Mr Avraham Burg, and the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Mr Ahmed Qurie.
Like many people, I too, Madam President, was disappointed that the recent Middle East peace talks in Camp David did not culminate in a peace settlement between the Palestinians and the Israeli Government.
However, I do not believe that these peace talks were a complete failure either.
We should fully recognise that the Palestinians and the Israeli Government are now negotiating on bottom line issues, including the status of Jerusalem, the borders of the Palestinian State, the fate of Jewish settlements and the right of return of Palestinian refugees.
I very much hope that the Middle East will resume peace talks in the near future.
I appeal to the key parties involved to strive in good faith to lay down a negotiated settlement based on existing agreements.
Permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999.
It was always going to take time to tease through what were very difficult, delicate and sensitive political matters.
EU Heads of State have affirmed on a number of occasions that the security of the Israeli and Palestinian people both collectively and individually must always be protected.
I support the principle of exchanging land for peace and the continuing and unqualified Palestinian right to self-determination.
I believe that the best way to address this latter issue is through negotiation.
I am calling on the Israeli Government and the Palestinian leadership to take the necessary steps to re-establish mutual confidence, accept the need to make concessions and focus on the overriding goal of achieving lasting peace and stability in the region.
The peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians are not the only matter up for discussion within the Middle East.
It is important that negotiations between Israel and Syria should resume quickly and that the Lebanese track of the Middle East peace process should also be addressed.
In this latter regard, I welcome the fact that since the Israeli forces left southern Lebanon, the region has been very peaceful.
There has been peaceful progress on the Lebanese-Israeli border since the Lebanese Government gained authority within the region, and we all must certainly welcome the fact that southern Lebanon is now at peace.
In the overall context, securing peace in the Middle East is always going to take time.
The first step in the current peace process was taken when Israel and Egypt concluded the Camp David peace treaty in 1979.
It took another twelve years before a comprehensive peace process got under way with the Madrid conference, which enshrined the land for peace principle.
We can all take solace from the fact that the key protagonists in this difficult political equation are now addressing the most vexed and thorny bottom line issues that have to be resolved if a permanent peace agreement is to be put in place in the Middle East.
Madam President, I have very mixed feelings about the peace talks that have been broken down at Camp David.
In any case, the extreme time pressure which the participants were under did not serve any immediate purpose.
In fact, I wonder what use this "diplomatic pressure cooker" approach has in terms of the final stage of the peace process in the Middle East?
It is a tough peace process that needs to provide a lasting solution to the lengthy and complex conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians and between the Israelis and Arabs respectively.
Public opinions on the Israeli and Palestinian sides - invisible yet very tangible - were also very much a player within Camp David.
It is exactly because of this key factor on the home front that third parties, whether they are referred to as peace brokers, such as President Clinton, or very committed subsidiary parties to the peace process, such as the European Union, need to guard against exercising excessive pressure in the shape of a punishing time schedule.
Is there not a task here for the EU, namely to urge all parties involved to keep the so-called "windows of opportunity" open for as long as possible?
However, my mixed feelings about the failure of Camp David are mainly generated by the uncompromising attitude adopted by the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Yasser Arafat, and the enthusiastic response he received to this at home. The home front hailed him in the Gaza Strip as the 'Palestinian Saladin' , complete with flags and banners.
In popular speech, Arafat has inherited this dubious Arab title of honour from Saddam Hussein.
It is exactly this Palestinian homage after Camp David 2000 which shocked Amos Oz, a recognised Israeli champion of peace and noted author.
He put his bleak state of mind into words this summer in a probing newspaper article.
"I am sitting in my front room in front of the television and am watching the tremendous reception which Yasser Arafat is being given in Gaza just because he said 'no' to peace with Israel.
I watch in silence and amazement and I am reminded that the real Saladin made a solemn pledge to the Arabs never to make a pact with non-believers.
He would kill them en masse and throw them into the sea.
I can see Arafat in his grey-green military outfit.
An Arafat, dressed as Che Guevara and greeted as a Saladin: it breaks my heart" .
The author moved on to a crucial topic within the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiation: "the right to return" .
Earlier this week, Arafat reiterated this Palestinian political claim in the context of the meeting of the Arab League in Cairo: "We will not accept an agreement without obtaining all the rights we are entitled to pursuant to international resolutions" .
So this includes UN Resolution 194 which stipulates the right to return on the part of Palestinian refugees.
Madam President, I am also keen to give you Amos Oz' view of this increasingly poignant historical burden.
In his opinion, this "right to return" is nothing more than an "Arab euphemism" for the liquidation of Israel.
In the same breath, Oz adds that he is more than happy to grant the Palestinians the "right to their free and independent Palestine" but that this should not be at the expense of the existence of the Jewish State.
This is a view which will hopefully give Western politicians food for thought.
In the foregoing, my aim was certainly not to trivialise the suffering of the Palestinian people.
I wish them a life in peace and freedom with all my heart.
However, this peace and freedom cannot be brought about if it is at the expense of other peoples' safety.
Madam President, as a representative of a Christian political party, I am not an unquestioning defender of Israel' s political interests.
This is a task which Israel' s leaders and citizens are more than capable of handling themselves.
In accordance with the Bible, God' s word, I consider the Jews as His chosen people, upon which lies the divine duty to be a "beacon for all peoples" .
Only in religious compliance with this requirement is a true Israeli-Palestinian settlement possible, on the basis of justice from Above.
Madam President, Europe has a special historical responsibility for the peace process in the Middle East.
This means proceeding with great sensitivity and not taking a schoolmasterly line or apportioning blame to one side alone.
The fact that the Foreign Minister himself responded to the last peace negotiations by stepping down, serves as a reminder to us that above all in Israel, which is the stable democracy in the region, every step taken by the politicians must have the backing of the majority of the Israeli people.
Nevertheless, we would do well not to forget that for all the fine words uttered, the crucial negotiations for peace in the Middle East take place in the USA and not in Europe.
Perhaps those EU politicians whose brief it is, have so far been unable to find the right way to act as genuinely neutral and productive mediators in this conflict.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, this is not the first time that the House has concluded that the situation in the Middle East is critical.
It is critical both for the Middle East itself and for the European Union because, apart from all the important issues which the peace process encompasses, it represents a new challenge for the common European foreign policy.
In other words, the European Union must play a more active, more systematic and more intensive role in projects in the region and, of course, in the peace process.
There are precedents for this.
Let us not forget that the highly important UN Resolution 242 was devised mainly by Europe.
So, to pick up on something very important which Mr Patten said, peace is not enough, we also need to monitor what happens, to see what the scenario is once an agreement has been reached, I think that the European Union should review its presence and involvement in the region.
Thus, as well as the special envoy, I think that the time has come for the European Union to set up a task force consisting of representatives from the Commission, the Council and, yes why not, the European Parliament - after all we have two eminent parliamentary representatives from countries in the region here today - to work out detailed proposals and positions on specific issues being addressed during the current peace process and on any issues which we need to bear in mind in the period following the agreement.
Mr President, I too would like to welcome the Speaker of the Knesset, Mr Burg, and the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Mr Abu Ala.
I feel that this debate, from the Council statement to the speeches made by Mr Moscovici and Commissioner Patten and the majority of the other speeches, has shown that Europe is of one mind regarding this extremely sensitive period following Camp David.
I am sure that we all see that phase, or in any case a change in the situation as very important, and I am sure that the situation has not been compromised, although we realise that, if change does not come about, there is currently a serious risk on both sides that the extremist tendencies present in the two camps may prevail.
My opinion is that if we analyse the situation in the region thoroughly - and we have, indeed, talked about the withdrawal of Israel from the Lebanon, the situation in southern Lebanon and developments in Syria - we find that we are in agreement on this matter as well: I feel that this debate is evidence of the convergence of our views - of the agreement of Parliament, the Commission and the Council on the matter - and that Europe has already made a contribution.
The quality of its performance is debatable, but Ambassador Moratinos' role in the region and the Council resolutions have certainly been effective.
I have to give credit to Commissioner Patten, for his presence in the area and also in Syria - we were able to go to Syria when his mission was finished - had a lasting influence on the development of the situation in Syria.
We can draw encouragement from all this and from the continuing work of the Clinton government on this initiative.
Nevertheless, I do feel that, today, without professing to be telling anybody what to do and in respect for the two interlocutors and their positions, we should be asking ourselves what we can contribute.
I would like to end by suggesting that we could use regional cooperation as a solution to make a European contribution right now before the peace process comes to an end.
Mr President, will the United Nations Millennium Summit which took place this week be the last chance summit?
I see it rather as yet one more chance for peace in the Middle East.
Six weeks after talks broke down at Camp David, Bill Clinton is due to meet Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat in New York tomorrow, after a month of intensive, albeit less media-attracting negotiation.
So hope of saving the peace process is not lost, even if it means setting aside the original timetable and, hence, avoiding at all costs any unilateral provocation which would ruin months of effort.
Everyone has his or her own interpretation of the outcome of Camp David and of the responsibilities incumbent upon either side.
Discussions have certainly never progressed this far before.
The gulf is still wide, although certain historical taboos have been broken.
But that is not enough.
We must now accept in our hearts what our heads have known and been dictating for a long time.
This is the price for peace.
To rely on the strength of symbols, on either side, is to hold on to a myth.
As for Europe, which intends to support the process, not to take sides, it hopes to be more, much more, than the region' s banker.
It is our historical and moral duty as well as our desire to become a full political partner very quickly, tomorrow if possible, and the simultaneous presence here of Avraham Burg, the Speaker of the Knesset, and Ahmed Qurie, the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, both of whom I welcome, cannot but augur well in this respect.
Mr President, I arrived back yesterday from Palestine and Israel, where over a thousand Italians - representatives of district, provincial and regional councils - have been spending a week building peace bridges between Palestinians and Israelis and setting up projects for cooperation with the Palestinian people.
Jerusalem is at the centre of the conflict, and it is one of the key factors in the peace process.
For the Palestinians it is a town to be shared with East Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian State and West Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel.
For the Israelis, before Camp David, no part of Jerusalem could be touched.
Now the taboo has been broken.
Yet the Israeli negotiators are still extremely uncompromising, for the problem is not that the Palestinians do not want to make concessions but that they have the right to the return of the territories occupied in 1967 which is enshrined in the UN resolutions.
Since 1993, Jerusalem has been a closed city for the Palestinians.
As Commissioner Patten said, the Israeli Government has many times failed in its obligations following the Oslo negotiations: they have not adhered to the timetable laid down in the agreements for the withdrawal of troops from the occupied territories.
For the Palestinians, the divided territories are a nightmare.
There is no free movement and over a thousand prisoners arrested before 1993 have been held in prison as if they were hostages.
Their imprisonment is a constant threat to the peace process.
However, a genuine tragedy for the peace process and the future of the Palestinian State is the continued increase in Israeli settlements: under the Barak Government, over 41 000 settlers moved into in the occupied territories.
And I, together with the thousand Italians, saw these settlements expanding all over the place.
This is a genuine crime against peace, but also against the environment and nature: just one example is the mountain of Jellab Edumin, a green hill outside Jerusalem which has been destroyed by bulldozers.
Another key factor are the refugees: they are not merchandise but human beings who want to realise their right or their dream to live in their own land or see it once again.
It is makes no sense for them not to be able to go back: Palestinians, who were born there, are not even allowed to visit it.
Peace is necessary.
It is on everyone's lips, but peace can only be achieved if each person is allowed to exercise his right of citizenship in his own free State.
As Europeans, we must make every possible endeavour - over and above the economic efforts which we are already making, we must increase our political role - to ensure that the law prevails and that the Palestinians are able to live in their democratic State, which we must recognise as we recognise the Israeli State, so that Jerusalem becomes an open city, a city of the world, the capital city of two peoples and two States.
I fully endorse the statements by the President-in-Office and Commissioner Patten.
I cannot understand how they have ignored in their contribution the conditions in which the people of Iraq now find themselves.
The reasons for this are twofold: the continued dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and his oppression of Iraq's citizens and the continued imposition of sanctions of the most Draconian kind.
The war has always been about controlling oil and in my view little or nothing to do with Kuwait.
As for weapons of mass destruction, I agree that somebody like Saddam Hussein should not have control of them, but there are others in the region who should not either.
Look around the Middle East, and indeed the rest of the world, and what confronts us is an array of weapons of mass destruction, mostly supplied by the developed world, including the European Union.
The market in weapons is now so competitive that some of the most horrific despots are getting bargain basement deals for weapons of mass destruction.
It is a lesson to the Middle East that it is unwise to nationalise the oil industry.
It must be asked where did Saddam Hussein get the weapons from before the Gulf War and where is he supposed to be getting them from now?
I suggest that we should consider appointing a political envoy from the European Union to Iraq to see if we can broker some sort of peace, between the United Nations and Iraq, because the sanctions are genocidal in their effect.
Mr Moscovici, Commissioner Patten, I also would like to be associated with the words of welcome to our honoured guests, Mr Ahmed Qurie and Mr Avraham Burg.
It is understandable that Palestinians feel that right would have been on their side in formerly declaring an independent Palestinian state on 13 September.
They believe that the Oslo negotiations and the various Camp David discussions would have conferred legitimacy on such a step.
However, it has to be recognised that even if negotiations had progressed so far that the declaration of statehood was non-controversial, the future of Jerusalem was always going to re-ignite controversy once again.
Jerusalem is the key issue and it needs to be looked at in a new light.
It is a unique problem which requires a unique response.
Jerusalem should not be regarded as an Arab city or a Jewish city, a Christian city or a Muslim city.
Progress will only be made if it is agreed that it is a truly international city to which all traditions have a valid claim.
The governance of this historic city must be removed from any nationalistic or sectarian, in the best sense of that word, spirit and this governance must provide for equal access and rule for all.
Just as we were delighted to remove Berlin walls in Europe, we do not want to see similar walls erected in Jerusalem.
People from the furthest ends of the Earth have an affinity with Jerusalem and this must be recognised and honoured and not overlooked in the current negotiations.
With these few words, I would like to wish the discussions, if they do take place, all success and genuinely hope that they lay the basis for permanent peace in the Middle East.
Mr President, as far as the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is concerned, I have always counted myself among those in the House who say that it is up to the people of the region and their leaders to define the terms of their peaceful coexistence, just as it is up to them to make the efforts and sacrifices needed on both sides in order to do so.
As a European, I set great store by the Euro-Mediterranean balance and if, like many others, I have somewhat regretted the European Union' s lack of political clout in this process, I have likewise always refused to sit here in Parliament and play at being teacher, to coin a phrase.
Today, just a few days away from a peace agreement or a major crisis which could erupt in dramatic scenes of violence, we must give peace every chance to succeed by helping those on both sides who are taking huge collective and individual risks to bring about peace.
That is why I am in total agreement with the position stated by Pierre Moscovici and what I would say today is that we shall not help to bring about peace by taking sides in the debate and in the difficult negotiations under way.
As I see it, therefore, in the short time left to us, our message to the Israelis and Palestinians should be simple and straightforward.
It can be summarised in three points: we want a peace agreement in the Middle East, we shall support and guarantee a peace agreement once it has been signed and we shall use every possible means, including but not only financial means, to help ensure that it is implemented.
To conclude, we know full well that peace is always a difficult process.
Europe, torn apart over the centuries, knows that better than most.
Overcoming divisions and eradicating terrorism is easier to talk about than to achieve as we know only too well from the Balkans, the division of Nicosia and the bombs in the Basque country.
And yet, peace is the only way forward, as the Israeli-Palestinian negotiators are well aware.
So all we can say is, good luck, agree to peace and we shall be at your side, as we are now.
Mr President, I would like to welcome the Speaker of the Knesset - whose acquaintance I made during a visit to Israel a very short while ago - and the representatives of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
We all deeply regret the partial failure of the Camp David discussions, although we would like to thank President Clinton and Mrs Albright as well, who put so much work and brainpower into the talks.
However, we feel - and here we agree with the report - that this peace agreement which is being drawn up has increased the possibilities and that there is a way forward.
We feel that everything that can be possibly be done now and in the future, including in terms of equal opportunities, must be done and followed up: the Palestinian people has the right to self-determination, without prejudice to the rights of the State of Israel.
There is one more point which deserves our attention, Mr President, which concerns the city of Jerusalem, which is one of the most sensitive elements in the issue.
We must endeavour to preserve the religious, cultural and universal character of this holy city, and it must certainly not become the subject of haggling or the property of any one side.
It has been proposed that it become the capital of both States.
That would be ideal.
I would also like to touch on a personal, political consideration. Europe must make an additional effort, it must take further steps to gain and perform a political as well as an economic role.
We cannot limit our concern to economic issues or matters of water, the sovereignty of Lake Tiberias and so on and so forth.
We must not forget our political responsibility to history: the European Union has a responsibility as well as the Heads of the States of Israel and Palestine.
Europe must become a political body and negotiate to achieve peace in this case as well, doing everything in its power to ensure that lasting peace is established in the Mediterranean.
Mr President, I would like to reinforce Mrs Sbarbati's warning: right now we need more boldness. The European institutions need to be more courageous.
Together with the United States, the European Union now has the difficult and vital task of preventing either party from reverting to its past position and of assessing the possibility of finding a solution to the problems of the Palestinians and the Israelis.
With a view to this, I support Mr Galeote's proposal to hold a conference along the same lines as the Madrid Conference.
I will illustrate the importance of this with a historical reference: in the 1980 Venice Declaration, proposed by Ministers Genscher and Colombo, the Community first of all established the need for a solution to be found to the Palestinian question through negotiations.
At that time, Arafat was still regarded as a terrorist, he was barred from obtaining a visa to go to the United Nations headquarters in America and there was no general consensus regarding the diplomatic strategies to be adopted.
Following his visit to Rome in 1982 for the Conference of the Interparliamentary Union, things at last started to move and not only did Arafat obtain his visa but - following the preparatory work carried out in Oslo - the United States started to play an active part in the Palestinian question.
Today, there is no question about the fact that the United States' activity is vital, but I do feel that the European Union also has a part to play and that it must not forget the past, not in order to claim any right to rule, but to regain its essential role which, as Minister Moscovici pointed out, complements the activities of the United States in the search for a solution to the matter, a solution which is still a long way off.
I would like to end with a reference to what is known as the International Statute of Jerusalem.
By an International Statute I do not mean that the city would have an international administration, but merely that, as an international community, we must direct this initiative so that the statutory instrument - irrespective of who has territorial sovereignty over Jerusalem - commits all parties to a system of international control, so that every believer - whether Christian, Jew or Muslim - is, at last, guaranteed access to the holy sites.
Mr President, Arabs and Palestinians have committed terrible historical errors and injustices, but they have also paid the price for them.
For some time now, it is not the Palestinians who have been the most intransigence in the negotiations. Indeed, they have even given ground in the supposedly neutral area of basic concepts.
Given the cultural and religious importance of Jerusalem for the Islamic world, I believe that the Palestinian renunciation of all rights over that city - East Jerusalem - could lead not only to a backlash from broad sections of the Palestinian population against their own leaders, but also an international Muslim mobilisation against them.
Media and political circles are warning that the Palestinians could waste the historic opportunity of being able to negotiate with a Prime Minister such as Ehud Barak, who has dared to put the issue of Jerusalem on the table openly.
Nevertheless, it is also the case, in my opinion, that Barak and the right-thinking political and social sectors in Israel could lose the excellent opportunity to negotiate with a leader such as President Arafat if they do not fulfil the minimum necessary requirements.
In my view it is now necessary to adopt a formula which allows for this right thinking and I believe that the European Union is in a good position to contribute to this.
Mr President, I should like to thank the various speakers for their interventions and I should also like to welcome Avraham Burg and Ahmed Qurie, whom I have already had occasion to meet in Israel and Palestine.
You have all naturally focused in your interventions on the peace process and the negotiations, which are without doubt the key to progress in this region of the Middle East.
Allow me to repeat our point of view: Camp David created new momentum which clearly broke down the barriers.
We are, in fact, facing an historic watershed, an unprecedented opportunity, because the present climate, this combination of circumstances, is exceptional.
Each of the parties - and the American mediator, who is playing his part to the full - has an interest in reaching an agreement and is determined, I have no doubt, to do everything to bring one about.
And so, I repeat, we have an historic opportunity to put an end to this conflict which has lasted so very long.
Having said which, every historic opportunity has its historic risk.
Clearly, nothing is a foregone conclusion and additional efforts, imagination and courage are still vital.
Equally clearly, time is running out.
President Mubarak was in Paris at the end of last week and I think he used an excellent phrase which sums up the situation perfectly: 'peace is now or never' .
What role, therefore, can the European Union play?
What does this role involve?
Several speakers welcomed the role of the European Union; at the same time, I rather had the impression from their interventions that they regretted that it was not a more active role, which is perfectly logical.
We can always wish for a more active Europe.
I too wish for a more active Europe.
The French Presidency has vowed to have a highly active Europe.
It is in keeping with our historical approach and the way in which we intend to conduct the mission incumbent upon us today.
At the same time, however, you cannot rewrite history.
Nor can you act against the wishes of the players themselves.
In this respect, I note that it is the two sides themselves who have come to see us, who are requesting our help, our advice, our intervention and our assistance, and not just and not predominantly financial assistance.
Obviously they feel that we are playing a useful part although I am also aware of the extent to which they are sometimes able to show us the limits of our role.
So find ourselves between these two sides.
What does this role involve?
It is exercised at three levels, as I have said.
The European Union intervenes in support of the negotiations.
It is in contact with both sides, through our intermediary, Mr Moratinos.
It constantly encourages negotiation.
It reiterates the principles of international law, which all of us, especially we Europeans, live by.
Secondly, the European Union makes a contribution to the debate on issues connected with the negotiations.
But here too, and this brings me back to the same point, both sides must want and ask for our contribution and sometimes we witness the sort of role-playing here with which we are all familiar.
And thirdly, we help to implement the agreements that have been concluded, as and when this occurs.
I think that we should already start to think about the Middle East which will emerge once there is peace, peace which we hope for and believe possible for tomorrow.
Whether or not this peace will last will also depend on how we go about strengthening ties between the countries in the region and developing their ties with us.
What can the European Union do in this context?
There is all the action which Commissioner Patten summarised.
There is also the Barcelona process, which offers us a particularly suitable framework, provided that we make full use of its potential.
It is this Barcelona process - and this brings me to the end of what I have to say - which the presidency wishes to leave its mark on and to start on at the forthcoming Barcelona IV meeting.
I heard a call for a summit meeting here.
What we are planning at the moment is a ministerial-level meeting.
We sincerely hope, however, that developments in the peace process will make it possible to hold a meeting not just at ministerial level, but also at Head of State and Government level in order to set the seal, as it were, on the emergence of a new era in the Middle East.
This is where the presidency, with the Commission and, I am sure, with Parliament' s support, will be concentrating its efforts in the weeks and months to come.
That concludes the debate.
EU external action priorities
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the European Union's external action priorities.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union, as our debate has just demonstrated, is perfectly qualified to take on the role of a full, influential and respected actor on the international political stage.
Our democratic values, our common will to foster peace and security in the world and our history guide us towards such a role.
The Community' s economic clout, its primary role in promoting development, and its privileged links with numerous countries or groups of countries also allow us to take on such a role.
Finally, the instability of a fast-changing world, sometimes at the Union' s very door, actively encourages us to take on such a role.
That is why the French Presidency of the Council intends to continue the efforts made over recent years and help to promote the Union' s international profile.
I should like to explain briefly the four main objectives which we have set ourselves.
First, needless to say, to press ahead with the process of enlargement, the main task facing us in coming years; secondly, to promote the development of a European security and defence policy, which should help to put the European Union firmly on the international map.
We also want to promote the development of strategic partnerships with our neighbours and with the main regional blocs. This should allow the European Union to help create a multipolar world, which is one of the fundamental long-term factors to the stability of international relations.
Our fourth and final objective is to improve the efficiency of EU instruments on the basis of the debate held by the ministers of foreign affairs at the informal meeting in Evian on 2 and 3 September, i.e. last Saturday and Sunday, at the Commission' s proposal and in the presence of Mr Patten.
The French Presidency' s first objective is to give new momentum to the accession negotiations.
The prospect of enlargement is the basic question which we Europeans have to answer, the huge challenge which faces us over coming years.
That is why the French Presidency is determined to ensure that the IGC is a success and conclude 'a nice treaty in Nice' , in order to prevent any delays to enlargement and ensure that we can welcome the first candidate countries to a Union with more efficient institutions.
I should like to make a brief aside here to tell you that our attitude today is one of slight concern. We feel that it is time to move from somewhat static declarations of position to real negotiation culminating in compromise; otherwise we shall have trouble both starting and concluding the negotiations.
Again on the question of accession negotiations, allow me to say that we shall push as far ahead as possible with negotiations with the Luxembourg six, of course. These are the countries with which we expect to make progress in negotiations on the most difficult chapters of the Community acquis.
And we shall do likewise with the Helsinki six, maintaining the pace of negotiation and, depending on the level of preparation of each country, opening up a whole series of new chapters, 42 in all, ranging from four to nine, depending on the country.
All in all, our objective, in close consultation with the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen, is to arrive in Nice at an overall vision of the state of negotiations, thereby efficiently guiding the work of the following presidencies and preparing the way for the completion of negotiations.
The various reports currently being examined in our committees and the debate on enlargement planned for October will give us further food for thought.
Hence the main deadlines during our presidency will be as follows:
A ministerial negotiating session will be held with each of the 12 candidates either on 21 November, for some of the candidates, or on 5 December, preceded by two meetings at ambassadorial level in the autumn.
As far as the Fifteen are concerned, we shall be organising a politically-orientated debate at the General Affairs Council on 20 November on the basis of the overall report and the individual progress reports on each candidate country which the Commission is due to submit to the Council at the beginning of November.
The purpose of this debate, in the run up to the Nice European Council, is to identify the main difficulties which need resolving, chapter by chapter, country by country and, on the basis of this, to discuss how the accession process should continue.
Finally, we shall be convening the European Conference twice, once in Sochaux on 23 November for the ministers of European affairs of the Fifteen and ministers from the candidate countries, and once in Nice on 7 December for the Heads of State and Government, at the opening of the Biarritz Summit.
As you will see, we hope to give a strong new impetus to the enlargement process.
The Union indicated in Helsinki that it would be ready to welcome the first new members on 1 January 2003, as soon as the procedure for ratifying what we hope will be the future Nice Treaty has been completed but, as the Heads of State and Government stressed at the Feira Summit, the countries in question must not only transpose the Community acquis, but more important still, they must be able to implement and really apply it.
This is naturally a very complicated and, as we well know, a difficult task for the candidate countries, but the Community is already helping by supporting the efforts of each country.
These efforts are vital in order to complete the enlargement process under way in a serious and controlled manner and thus enable the most advanced countries to accede as quickly as possible.
As far as Turkey is concerned, I would just like to say briefly that recognition of its candidate status in Helsinki marked an important step which my country, France, supported.
The presidency will work in the Council to have the accession partnership for this country adopted and will continue to conduct a detailed analysis of the acquis.
It will also ensure that the Union honours its financial aid commitments with a view to setting up a single framework covering all aid instruments to Turkey.
It will work especially hard to have the regulation on the economic and social development of Turkey adopted.
It goes without saying, however, that accession negotiations will be quite out of the question until such time as Turkey complies with the Copenhagen criteria, especially the democratic criteria, although any progress in this direction will of course encourage us to adopt the measures which I have just mentioned.
We are waiting with interest for the House to adopt Mr Morillon' s reports on these important issues.
The French Presidency' s second objective is to push ahead with the European common security and defence policy by implementing the decisions taken in Helsinki and Feira.
The Union now has the instruments which it needs in order to apply a common foreign policy.
It had been missing one instrument which was vital to the credibility of its commitment, i.e. the capacity to mobilise sufficient military resources to allow it to decide and act autonomously within the context of the so-called Petersberg tasks.
Our objective, which the crises in Bosnia and, more recently, in Kosovo have taught us, is to provide a global response to the manifold and extraordinarily complex dimensions of today' s crises: not just ethnic crises, but also sociological, administrative, judicial, security-related and military crises.
All these dimensions apply.
What is special about the European response, compared with other instruments, is that it can offer a global response to all these dimensions.
In other words, the French Presidency hopes to take part in an extremely ambitious project which will of necessity take several years to complete.
It therefore intends to keep up the pace of work so that the Feira commitments can be kept by the time the European Council meets in Nice - a particularly heavy agenda.
The three main issues are as follows: as regards countries' abilities to meet the objectives, the commitment conference which we shall be holding on 20 November will give each Member State the chance to state how it intends to help achieve the overall objective defined in Helsinki; as regards the permanent political and military institutions, our presidency has to prepare for the transition to the final, operational stage which will allow the Union to manage a crisis in all its dimensions as quickly as possible.
Finally, we need to implement the Feira decisions on relations with NATO and with third counties in connection with military crisis management and the continuing work to strengthen civil crisis management instruments.
The French Presidency' s third priority will be to develop strategic partnerships between the Union and its neighbours and the main regional blocs.
The priority within this priority is to strengthen relations with the Union' s neighbours, especially the Balkans where, as we all know, the situation is still giving cause for concern.
As a sign of the importance which the Union attaches to developing relations with the Balkans region, which we wish to see enjoying peace and democracy, France has proposed that Croatia host a summit on 24 November with the countries of the former Yugoslavia which, although at varying stages, have made the most progress with their democratic development.
The idea is to support recent positive developments in several of these countries and to remind the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that the door will also be opened to it once it joins the movement or, to be more precise, when the conditions are right for it to join the movement.
Developing the strategic partnership with Russia and the Ukraine is another priority of the French Presidency, which is due to host the EU/Ukraine Summit in Paris in 10 days' time and the EU/Russia Summit on 30 October.
The framework for action by the French Presidency of the Union vis-Ã -vis Russia is defined by the conclusions adopted by the Feira European Council, which offered to support the efforts being made by President Putin and the new Russian Government to modernise and reform Russia.
At the same time, the presidency will, of course, continue to monitor the issue of Chechnya closely.
The Council reiterated in July that only a political solution would bring about a lasting settlement of this conflict.
Finally, despite the uncertainty hanging over the future of the peace process in the Middle East, which we have just debated, developing our Euro-Mediterranean relations is one of the French Presidency' s main concerns.
We hope to take general stock of the Barcelona process and assess cooperation under the MEDA programme during the ministerial meeting in Marseilles on 16 November and, if circumstances allow, at the summit which may then be organised for the following day in order to define guidelines to give new impetus to Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
The presidency also intends to complete work on the peace and stability charter.
During this meeting, as far as the peace process is concerned, the European Union should play a major role in supporting the two sides and the agreements which they conclude.
Finally, the presidency is keen to implement the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean adopted in Feira and ensure that the new MEDA regulation is adopted.
As far as the association agreements are concerned, let me repeat that it hopes to sign the agreement with Egypt and achieve substantial progress in negotiations with Lebanon, Syria and Algeria.
Beyond its immediate environment, the French Presidency will ensure that it develops political dialogue with the main regional blocs.
I am thinking here of Asia.
In Asia, priority will be given to resuming political dialogue between Europe and Asia and to strengthening economic and financial cooperation within ASEAN.
A summit will be held in Seoul on 20 and 21 October and we also hope to resume the dialogue between the EU and ASEAN.
History will record two important summits with key countries in the region during the French Presidency.
The summit with Japan on 19 July decided to start revising the 1991 declaration and preparing an action plan for adoption at the summit in 2001.
The other summit, with China, will be held in Beijing on 23 October.
As regards Africa, the presidency will be organising an initial follow-up meeting to the Cairo Summit and working to develop relations with sub-regional organisations in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou Convention.
It will be organising the fourth ministerial meeting between the EU and SADC in Gaborone on 29 and 30 November and a ministerial meeting between the EU and the Community of West African States in Abuja on 16 October.
The trans-Atlantic dialogue will focus on three foreign policy issues: the Balkans, Russia and the peace process in the Middle East.
This framework will also be turned to good account during the summits with the United States and Canada on 18 and 19 December, in order to bring our main partners up to date with recent developments in the European foreign, security and defence policy.
Dialogue with Latin America will be furthered during the course of regular meetings with the regional groups next week on the fringe of the general assembly of the United Nations.
France has also suggested that its partners consider the future of relations with Cuba.
Finally, the French Presidency will ensure that Europe is able to do all it can, in a coherent and responsible manner, to help open a new round of negotiations, which we hope will be global and balanced negotiations, within the World Trade Organisation.
In the longer term - and this is the fourth priority of the French Presidency - the Presidency again opened a debate during the informal meeting in Evian, in the presence of Mr Patten, on improving the efficiency of Union instruments.
The Union - as I have said - has numerous instruments at its disposal which allow it to influence developments in international relations.
Thus, its diplomatic presence in the world, both that of the Fifteen and of the Commission, is unique both in terms of staff numbers and geographical coverage.
Similarly, the Union now constitutes an active and coherent group in the United Nations, where its points of view are represented in every forum.
Finally, its financial resources, our financial resources, are considerable.
However, we all know the weaknesses in the Union' s external action: lack of visibility, inadequate coordination on occasions, flexibility which leaves much to be desired, too little influence in international institutions, especially Bretton Woods.
Efforts have already been made to rectify these shortcomings, mainly by adopting the first common strategies, but this does not alter the fact that the impact and credibility of European action fall well short of the resources implemented.
The ministers of foreign affairs of the Fifteen therefore opened a debate at the instigation of Hubert VÃ©drine during the recent informal meeting at Evian, based on the excellent work presented by Mr Patten on behalf of the Commission and by the Secretary-General of the Council to the High Representative for the CFSP, Javier Solana, who was also present in Evian.
Several items were entered on the agenda.
First, we need to improve coordination between the various actors in the European Union - in situ, in the third countries, through more decentralised management of Community programmes and through improved coordination between Community action and action by Member States.
At central level, this must be done by reaffirming the coordinating role of the General Affairs Council in order to improve the coherence of external action in all its aspects.
I am thinking here about political dialogue, financial cooperation and commercial franchises.
Then we need to turn the overall efforts of the Union to better account and make them more efficient.
That presupposes establishing the measure of this global effort vis-Ã -vis the outside world and, hence, having synthetic tools which integrate all aspects of external aid.
We also need to enhance Community aid management by improving the planning and implementation of Community instruments, taking account of the finding made by the Commission and endorsed by the Member States, that there is an unacceptable divide between commitments and Community appropriations disbursed and the increasing criticism, legitimate criticism, by third countries of slow, unwieldy processes.
Finally, and this is my last point, Mr President, the partners, i.e. the Council and the Commission both agree that we need better monitoring of the implementation and efficiency of Community aid, especially by the General Affairs Council, which needs to play a more important role in steering the Union' s external action.
I can tell you, in this respect, that the ministers will refer to this point at the Council session on 18 September in order to define a monitoring framework and modus operandi, together with the Commission and the Secretary-General or his representative.
Those, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, are the priorities of the French Presidency as regards external action.
We intend to cooperate in this and many other areas with both the Commission, which will be the main driving force in this area, as it is in every other area, and with the European Parliament.
I very much welcome this opportunity to speak to the European Parliament just a couple of days after the informal meeting of foreign ministers in Evian, at which there was a serious discussion on the effectiveness and efficiency of the European Union's external activities and the budgetary consequences, the first time to my knowledge that such a discussion has taken place.
I want to congratulate the French Presidency without reservation on the priority that they have given to this extremely important practical issue.
I want to respond to the motion for a resolution, not least since I suspect that in it are the bones of the discussion that we will be having between the Union's institutions on CFSP over the coming years.
Just before the summer break, as some Members may have read in the newspapers, we discussed in the Commission the demands, the constraints and priorities of the European Union's external relations, our understanding of what should be the Commission's external role and some of the problems we encounter in performing it.
Any such discussion should of course begin with the Treaty.
One of the five objectives of the European Union, as set out in Article 2 of the Treaty, is that it should assert its identity on the international scene.
That objective reflects a number of things.
It reflects first of all the European Union's political interests, including a growing role in the area of security, which the President-in-Office referred to in his interesting remarks.
It reflects our economic interests, trade and the external dimension of the single market, including our agricultural policy.
The Euro would also come under this heading.
It reflects our responsibilities for external assistance which have grown exponentially in recent years.
The European Union and its Member States now provide 55% of total international aid and two thirds of global non-refundable aid.
It reflects our defensive external interests, issues such as drug trafficking, nuclear safety issues, environmental concerns and migration and last but not least relations with our near neighbours, including the whole process of enlargement, which in my view is the most important and challenging issue facing this generation of European politicians.
It is worth remembering that less than 20 years ago relations with Greece, Spain and Portugal were external affairs for the European Community as it then was.
Our prime task in the European Union's external relations is surely the projection of stability, both in our immediate neighbourhood and beyond.
A more stable neighbourhood and a more stable world guarantee a more stable European Union.
The skills that the European Union has brought to its own development are skills which offer an example and a model elsewhere in the world.
We need to be more imaginative in drawing on our experience and using it beyond our shores.
In discussing how the European Commission can concentrate on this task, I want to be clear about the limits of our role.
Foreign policy is and will remain fundamentally a matter for national governments, in other words for Member States.
There are 15 foreign ministers in the European Union today and there will be 15 for the foreseeable future.
But it is equally important that the Member States should acknowledge what you in European Parliament and those working on the CFSP have long understood: that mere intergovernmentalism can be a recipe for weakness and mediocrity, for a European foreign policy of the lowest-common denominator.
That is why the Union chose to move on from political cooperation, why the Treaty of Amsterdam created the new high representative for CFSP and why there is an important role for the Commission and for the European Parliament in trying to make a Common - I stress common not single - Foreign and Security Policy more effective.
The new structures, procedures and instruments of CFSP recognise the need to harness the strengths of the European Community in the service of European foreign policy.
It would be absurd to divorce European foreign policy from the institutions which have been given responsibility for most of the instruments for its accomplishment, for external trade, external assistance, many of the external aspects of justice and home affairs and so on. That is why the Commission participates fully in the decision-making process in the Council, that is why we have a shared right of initiative - not a sole but a shared right of initiative - in these issues.
There needs to be a sensible and sensitive partnership in the external field between the institutions of the Union, including the European Parliament, and its Member States.
We should be engaged in a common effort to make sure that world's largest trading group also makes its presence felt politically.
We have a real contribution to make and we must not be afraid to make it.
Another point I want to emphasise is that the Commission is not seeking new powers or a new role, but we do want to be able to exercise the powers we already have under the Treaty more effectively.
I have every sympathy for European Parliament's desire to do exactly the same.
I am determined that the Commission should make a coherent contribution to the external relations agenda.
It is very easy in the external field, perhaps more than any other, to make grandiloquent statements about Great Issues such as peace in the Middle East, a stable and productive relationship with Russia, international development.
But if these are to be transformed from aspiration into reality, we have to pull our collective European weight.
What does that mean in practice for the Commission?
Firstly it means better coordination between Commissioners and Directorates-General encouraging a habit of working together.
I think we are starting to improve things.
I chair the group of RELEX Commissioners which meets regularly both formally and informally.
We try to frame a single agenda to discuss the impact of what we are doing on other Commissioners' areas of responsibility.
I think it is fair to say that this has so far been successful and that we intend to continue in this spirit.
We have managed to avoid the turf wars which I am told occasionally disfigured the harmony of previous Commissions.
Secondly, we are feeling our way towards a new and more productive working relationship with the Council and I hope with the European Parliament.
It was evident at Evian with ministers this weekend.
Apart from the detailed foreign policy issues on our agenda like the situation in the Middle East, we were looking at how we decide our overall annual priorities in external relations and how we apportion the budget.
As I said before, when I made a presentation to the Council on the budget and on our priorities in May it was the first time this had ever happened.
Earlier this year, as well as that presentation to foreign ministers, I hope that I gave the European Parliament exactly the same candid presentation on our external relations budget.
In the past commitments have simply built up from one budget exercise to the next, with almost no effort to pull things together into a coherent whole.
We are now trying to create a more rational system in which we can all have a proper political discussion early in the process on what our priorities should actually be.
That is important in the Council and it is important in the Parliament because you are the budgetary authority.
We cannot spend more than you allow us to but in that case you should not ask us to do more than is possible and criticise us when we have to make judgments about priorities.
However, I think we are in a much better position to make those judgments with political guidance from the Council and Parliament.
Thirdly, I am working with Javier Solana to create sensible structures and the right division of responsibilities between the Commission and the High Representative for the CFSP.
The institutional relationship between the Commission and the High Representative is evolving, as is the precise role of the European Parliament in the CFSP.
But we have in this last year managed to develop a strong and sensible partnership and I think we can honestly claim that, whatever the difficulties, it is starting to make a difference, for instance, in the Balkans where the challenge to the credibility of Europe's foreign policy remains formidable.
Fourthly I am working to respond to new demands on the Commission arising from the new security agenda.
We have set up a new crisis management unit to help pull together the Commission's contribution in that area, but I also want to adapt our structures so that we can have a greater input into aspects of external relations where traditional bilateral diplomacy has been less effective and where the Commission has particular expertise which it should be able to deploy more effectively.
One example is conflict prevention, which may involve issues that are not part of the normal diplomatic agenda.
Other examples are climate change, control of drug-trafficking, control of the other death industries, the creation of new civil structures including independent media and so on. These are the sort of issues on which I want to see the Commission contributing its experience and resources.
In the discussions we had in the G8 foreign ministers' meetings I was struck by the extent to which the foreign and security policy agenda is changing and bringing together disparate issues in which the Community has almost unique competence, for example in the environmental field.
We discussed yesterday Mr Galeote's excellent report on our external services and the importance of enhancing the effectiveness of what the European Union does around the world.
There was a lot of discussion about better coordination, better coordination between Member States and all the institutions of the European Union, which I know is a serious priority of the French presidency and one which I totally share.
We have perhaps talked more openly about these issues in the last few months than ever before but now we have to put our rhetoric into practice and discharge our responsibilities.
Mr President, a great deal is expected of the European Union, particularly if it is to do justice to the challenges it faces in the sphere of foreign and security policy.
There has been a considerable amount of progress over the last few years, especially considering the Cologne and Helsinki Decisions, and the development of a European defence identity.
We must see - indeed Mr Patten made this very point - that we contribute a large proportion of the world' s international aid.
But are we really well-equipped to do justice to these challenges?
Are the structures genuinely suitable?
Do we really allow excellent individuals such as Mr Patten and Mr Solana to represent us overseas or are we increasingly forcing them to compete against each other owing to inappropriate structures?
The fact is that the Council wants to operate as the executive in the foreign, security and defence policy, but how is this to be accomplished with 27 Foreign Ministers at the same time, when the Council thinks of itself as an executive authority in collective terms?
All this is bound to lead to a situation that will be untenable in the long run.
The European Union may have put the instruments for external assistance and trade policy on a Community footing to a large extent, but unfortunately we do not have the chance to allow the institution to push this Community policy through, the intention being to avoid any competition with the Foreign Ministers, who are not prepared to give up a little bit of their jurisdiction in de facto terms.
If you keep appointing new special representatives then, in the end, this will detract from the competences of the Community bodies, notably the Commission, without really bringing about coordination.
Kosovo is a case in point: it was absolute chaos.
We provide the most money but nothing is actually being resolved out there, despite the best efforts of all concerned, because the structures are inappropriate.
That is the real problem and it is increasingly bringing us into disrepute.
We must ensure - and Mr Patten has the right approach in proposing the reorganisation of external assistance - that we strengthen the power to act of our Community bodies, and that we improve the way in which work is carried out there and make it more effective.
But at the same time, the structures must fit together, or else we will fail to make headway in this area.
Of course that also means, for example, that - as Parliament said before Amsterdam - the two-fold construct of High Representative/Commissioner for Foreign Affairs will not work. We have had our first taste of this only a year on.
We have had our first taste of this only a year on.
It would have been much better to have a Vice-President of the Commission for Foreign Affairs attached by means of a special bond of legitimation to the Council.
If we are to fulfil the expectations people have of the European Union then we must organise the structures accordingly, but not in line with the traditionally held ideas of EU Foreign Ministers, who are not prepared to relinquish responsibilities in de facto terms.
The new troika must be made better use of under the circumstances, and the question of parliamentary control must be resolved too.
According to the Treaty, the European Parliament is responsible for the area of civil crisis management, trade policy and the like, and that is clearly the case.
The national parliaments are responsible for financing and supervising their armed forces and the orders to go into action, and there can be no doubt on that score either.
Only, we must have the good sense to bring about a certain amount of coordination between them.
But here too, control must clearly be in evidence, because we cannot have a situation where European foreign, security and defence policy means less transparency and democracy.
For this reason, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we must work closely together over the next few days in order to guarantee and secure the necessary secrecy of certain documents.
On the other hand though, we must also guarantee the same level of transparency and control that the public expects from national governments and national parliaments.
I believe we will find the right moment to make a start on this.
I see that the French Council Presidency is extremely well disposed in this matter and so we should work on it over the next few days.
We shall now suspend the sitting.
Formal sitting on the occasion of the address by Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset and Mr Ahmed Qurie, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
Mr President, as you know I currently chair Parliament's delegation for the United States of America and I should like to raise a point of order under Parliament's rules concerning parliamentary delegations.
It has come to my attention that a group of parliamentarians from the EPP Group visited the USA in July.
Normally I would regard this as a private matter and not my concern.
However, in the programme connected with this visit the group is described as a delegation and in particular Mr Goodwill, MEP, is described as leader of the delegation.
I can make this programme available to you.
This puts the whole visit in an entirely different context.
There was a formal delegation which I chaired from Parliament to the USA in June and there is an understandable confusion when another group of MEPs some three weeks later arrive in the USA, to all intents and purposes also a European Parliament delegation.
I have reports that the comments of these parliamentarians were from the wilder shores of the EPP Group and were notable for their anti-European content.
I understand what you are saying, Mrs Read, and the presidency takes note of your comment.
We shall correct this mistake and keep you informed of the situation.
Mr Goodwill, I believe that what you wish to say echoes Mrs Read' s comments.
Mr President, on a point of order I can inform the House that in no way did the visit by Members from the UK, Sweden and Germany wish to be described as a delegation.
We were merely visiting the United States as a group organised from within our own national groups.
We did not represent the EPP Group, we certainly did not wish to usurp the role of the official delegation.
I contest the point made about the views expressed during that visit as being particularly extreme.
We represented the views of our national parties over there as well as the views expressed within the European Parliament.
I am very sorry, Mrs Read, but I cannot allow you to speak again, as we are already running late.
We all know what the problem is.
The Bureau and Parliament have already made a commitment to resolving this issue and you really cannot speak again.
Let us proceed to the vote.
Vote
- 1999/2120(COS) (Draftsman: "Hughes Procedure" ) (Parliament approved the resolution)
Report (A5Â­0210/2000) by Mr Galeote Quecedo, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on a common Community Diplomacy (2000/2006(INI)).
(Parliament approved the resolution)
Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE).
(ES) Mr President, perhaps you could give the Commissioner the opportunity to explain to the House what he intends to do with this Parliament initiative, bearing in mind the new code of conduct which governs relations between Parliament and the Commission.
I am extremely grateful for the courteous offer that has been made.
Last night we had the opportunity to discuss this extremely important report at some length.
In my speech I drew attention to the communication that we have already produced on the external services, but said that we will be coming back with a further communication in due course which will bear the imprint of this extremely important report.
In particular I should like to express our enthusiasm for the very sensible ideas put forward about training for our external services and also the arguments about coordination.
It is a very good report on an important subject.
We hope that it will be a beacon for all of us in the dark nights that lie ahead.
(Laughter and applause)
Report (A5Â­0191/2000) by Mr Imbeni, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Assessment and future of Community humanitarian activities (Article 20 of Regulation (EC) 1257/96) (COM(1999) 468 - C5Â­0044/2000 - 2000/2016(COS)).
(Parliament approved the legislative resolution)
Explanations of vote
Dell' Alba report (A5-0202/2000)
Mr President, I voted for Mr Dell'Alba's report, and I would like to explain this decision here since it relates to the financial concerns of pensioners in general.
Since they have very little money, they are, in effect, very careful how they spend it.
Sadly, the Dell'Alba report does not take into consideration the proposals of the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, who levelled severe criticisms at the report, which proposes to honour the outstanding expenditure laid down in a previous regulation on aid for certain European activities in Latin America, Asia, the Mediterranean and South Africa.
In my opinion, much more should have been done, and this should have rung genuine alarm bells for the Commission's activities.
PiÃ©trasanta report (A5-0205/2000)
Mr President, I could not pass over the chance to give an explanation of my vote for the MEDA report, seeing as, this summer, after I had been to Spain, I had a holiday in Tunisia.
While I was there, a Tunisian pensioner came up to me - goodness knows how he had found out that I represent the Italian pensioners in the European Parliament - and he said to me: "I know that there is an aid programme for Tunisia as there is for all the Mediterranean countries, but what good has it done me, a pensioner in Tunisia?
What are you doing to help us?"
I have, in effect, read Mr PiÃ©trasanta's report in its entirety and I regret to say that certain actions are missing.
In addition to the various initiatives laid down in the MEDA programme - which, I hope, will be given much more funding than the EUR 3 475 million which were appropriated to it between 1995 and 1999 - I hope that measures will also be adopted to keep a check on how European Union funding is used and that a large proportion will go to the peoples of the African countries which border on the Mediterranean, including their elderly citizens.
The MEDA programme is the mainstay of financial cooperation under the Euro-Mediterranean partnership set up in 1995.
But the procedures are unwieldy and not transparent enough, the specification for the implementation of projects, which are too long...
Reform is urgently needed because these problems are throwing the entire process into disrepute and are seen as bad signs by the people of the Mediterranean, who did, in fact, originally welcome the Barcelona process with a certain degree of enthusiasm.
The Commission text is a good text because its purpose is to help simplify current regulations.
But we need more if we want to give our Mediterranean policy a new lease of life: we need to involve the people more by supporting decentralised cooperation, we need to improve the way in which the cultural and human dimensions are integrated, open the free trade zone to agricultural produce and monitor and support fundamental freedoms.
I fully support the rapporteur' s proposal that an annual report be drafted on human rights in the Mediterranean countries.
Galeote Quecedo report (A5-0210/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the report on a common Community diplomacy.
I have to say that my daughter, who was extremely happy to see European driving licences introduced and remarked at the time: "So Europe is making progress!" , asked me on this occasion: "But when will European embassies be set up in the countries we visit as tourists?"
Well, I would have liked the Committee's report to have been more decided, more resolute, and to have, at last, established single European embassies to replace the 15 national embassies in the 15 Member States and the other States throughout the world.
Sadly, this did not happen, but I hope that it will come about with the next Commission communication.
The Liberal Party' s five Members of the European Parliament support the efforts in this report to give better diplomatic training to those EC officials who work in the Commission' s delegations.
We have proposed - and had accepted - an amendment which emphasises that it is simply a question of in-service training and that the courses are to be open to diplomats from the national foreign services.
The Liberals do not, however, support the idea of setting up a new institution in the form of an EC College of Diplomacy. Nor do we want the present delegations to develop into EU embassies.
Therefore, the Liberals have today voted in favour of the report as a whole but abstained from voting on the above-mentioned points.
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament welcome, and have voted in favour of, the initiative to improve the Community' s common foreign service.
We also support the initiative to give further training to EC officials engaged in external activities.
We are opposed, however, to setting up a college of diplomacy for training the staff.
It must be possible for such training to take place as, for example, in-service or on the job training.
We also make reservations about the Commission' s delegations developing into proper embassies.
That would create an unclear picture of which problems are to be solved by the national embassies.
We have abstained from voting because the aims of the report are unclear.
On the one hand, it contains a large number of proposals for improving operations in the EU' s present offices abroad.
It is also established (in paragraph O) that the purpose is not to create a single diplomatic service for the EU to replace the foreign services of the Member States.
On the other hand, the whole enterprise smacks of efforts progressively to do precisely that, namely to create veritable EU embassies as a stage in the process of transforming the EU into a superstate.
This impression is powerfully reinforced by paragraphs P, 13 and 15, in which the talk is precisely of EU embassies, of coordinated EU representation in, for example, the UN and of Member States which so desire arranging for their diplomatic missions to be combined with the EU' s delegations.
Because we are in favour of practical improvements to the existing foreign operation, but absolutely opposed to the EU' s beginning to behave like a superstate in the world around, especially by stealth, we have no option but to abstain from voting.
Our countries have a special responsibility, being among the few democracies in the world.
In the same way as the United States, we must be in a position to take independent initiatives and intervene in those parts of the world where there is a need to defend human rights and to propagate democratic values.
Interventions of this kind should primarily take place with the help of economic sanctions but, depending upon the circumstances, military intervention may be necessary.
The prerequisite of the EU' s being able to assemble the required drive to complete these tasks is close cooperation, both economic and political, within the EU, including closer cooperation between the foreign services.
At present, statements from the Commission' s delegations are too dissimilar because of the divergent positions held by the Member States.
If the EU is to assert itself on the political stage, it requires a better coordinated foreign policy in which the EU countries are obliged to combine forces and to speak with one voice.
.
(FR) Mr Galeote' s report has the strange merit of indicating its real objective and logic fairly clearly, i.e. the creation of a single Community diplomatic service, while formally claiming the opposite.
The entire proposed arrangement in fact contradicts recital O, which states that the objective is not to create a single diplomatic service to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States.
I welcome Mr Dupuis' frank and coherent amendments, which at least have the merit of calling a spade a spade.
The subtle internal balances of the PPE probably explain the baroque nature of the structure being proposed to us.
This clearly pathetic ducking and diving is directly inspired by the Monnet-Delors method and all Mr Galeote has done is to propose a new variation on that theme, this time on diplomacy.
With this method, the institution creates the function, the container hides the content, the technique gives rise to the policy.
But now we have the key and know how to decipher.
When Mr Galeote proposes setting up a training college to mould Community super-diplomats and recycle national diplomats, giving the European Union an international legal personality and 'coordinating' representations, especially to the UN, we know full well that the sub-text reads: merge embassies, create a single Community diplomatic corps and communitise France' s and Britain' s permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council.
And of course, as always, the question of purpose, the question of content, the only question worth asking, is omitted.
What are we creating with this new institution?
In this particular case, what foreign policy will this Community diplomatic corps serve?
What common interests is it supposed to defend?
This is a typically Marxist approach.
We are waiting for the 'critical qualitative mass' which, we hope, will change the quantitative into qualitative at a certain threshold.
The common instrument is supposed to produce the common conscience, the common will, the common responsibility.
This cult of the quantitative culminates in a grotesque comparison between the number of American and 'European' diplomats, the number of 'European' diplomats having been obtained by adding up the numbers of professional diplomats attached to the foreign services of our various countries.
Must we reiterate that the United States are one and the same nation and the Member States of the European Union each have privileged links in the world, different and sometimes diverging experiences and affinities, and that it is this which so enriches European diplomacy?
It is the complementarity of this individual expertise which can be used for a clearly-defined common objective which really serves European interests.
It is precisely these advantages which the single diplomacy being proposed to us will devalue.
In fact, we are eroding national will, despite the fact that it is the diplomatic driving force behind Europe and, at the same time, we express surprise when the increasing number of instruments and declarations is reflected merely by an absence of content and a general lack of interest.
The only positive aspect of this report might be its desire to rationalise the organisation and improve the professionalism of the European Commission delegations in third countries.
Experience has shown that these delegations are not always up to their real job, which is to implement Community programmes and agreements and monitor them on the ground.
It would appear that this job has now taken second place to other considerations, with Commission representatives too busy trying to obtain officially the usurped title of ambassador to oversee the proper implementation of the programmes which they are responsible for applying.
This last point apart, you will understand that we obviously did not vote in favour of the other, totally surrealist proposals in this initiative report.
Today we are admitting the absurdity and intrinsic weaknesses of a single currency which is not supported by any sovereignty.
And now we expect single diplomacy, conceived in the same back to front manner, to work or rather, not to work.
I welcome the initiative to improve training for EU officials working on foreign issues, but I cannot support the creation of a single diplomatic corps.
The Member States are responsible for foreign diplomacy, and I think there is a danger that transforming the Commission' s delegations into Community delegations with legal standing might lead to conflicts of interest with the Member States' national diplomatic delegations.
I cannot therefore vote in favour of Mr Galeote Quecedo' s report.
Imbeni report (A5-0191/2000)
Mr President, I voted for Mr Imbeni's report as well, for the European Union is certainly doing something extremely important in organising humanitarian aid for areas which have been struck by natural disasters or the effects of war.
Pensioners, whom I have the honour and the pleasure of representing, are among those who are most willing on these occasions to go and help the less fortunate victims of disasters.
But what benefit has Europe drawn from this initiative which, among other things, cost EUR 813 million in 1999 alone?
Moreover, I would call upon the Commission to increase its expenditure, for it is extremely important for Europe to maintain a presence in the world and to give a high profile to its presence through, among other things, a symbol and greater publicity of this important activity.
Mr President, a single example, taken from the explanatory statement, illustrates just how laughable the report on the humanitarian activities of the European Union is.
The report cites the absence of operational tools, especially helicopters, as the reason for the lack of international aid in general and the lack of aid from the European institutions in particular, in dealing with the floods in Mozambique, whereas - and who could forget? - there was no lack of helicopters, aeroplanes, every type of transportation equipment and even means of destruction when it came to intervening in Yugoslavia or Iraq.
The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the major powers, which are capable of mobilising huge resources in order to impose their hegemony on the rest of the world, are not prepared to make the slightest effort when it comes to saving human lives.
Under these circumstances, the pacifying declarations on humanitarian aid by the European institutions are shamefully hypocritical and we have no intention of backing them, which is why we abstained from the vote.
I wish to start by congratulating Mr Imbeni on the quality of his report.
This report is fully in keeping with the philosophy of our institution, which has always made its voice heard in the least well off countries, through its opinions, its resolutions or specific action to improve and develop humanitarian aid.
Since the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) was created at the beginning of the 1990s, Europe has taken its place as the biggest donor in the world.
However, despite legitimate efforts driven by historical links between certain European countries and developing countries, we are forced to admit that poverty is increasing throughout the world.
Today, half the world lives on less than two dollars a day.
This is unacceptable!
Has the money released been squandered?
I do not think so.
Without the emergency aid provided by ECHO in order to deal with the natural disasters or serious crises which regularly hit the most vulnerable people on our planet, I hardly dare imagine the situation which we would have to deal with today.
Nonetheless, humanitarian aid needs to be rationalised.
In this respect, I welcome the fact that the House is calling for more coherent, more coordinated help and for greater collaboration between the various partners, such as the executive Commission, the Member States, the various associations or even the United Nations.
In addition, apart from humanitarian aid proper, we need to find ways of improving conflict prevention because 25% of the African continent is still being torn apart by war.
Finally, even if the problem of development is a multi-dimensional problem and the European Union does not have all the answers, we still need to continue and step up our action in order to lay the foundations for sustainable world development and help eradicate poverty.
In any event, this was the concept which inspired the work of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, which is why I voted in favour of the report presented today by Mr Imbeni.
Mr President, I would like, on my own account and also on behalf of my colleagues, to protest in the strongest terms, and have it put on record, about the article that Madam President had published in today' s edition of the Strasbourg daily newspaper.
In it, she voices her belief that it would have come to riots in Austria had the 14 EU States not imposed sanctions against Austria.
I utterly repudiate this.
In making this comment, not only has the President done the Austrian people an injustice, she has also abused her office, and thereby caused this House, an EU institution, a great deal of harm.
Mrs Raschhofer, I shall gladly pass your comments on to President Fontaine.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.23 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)
Vice-President, thank you for giving me the floor.
With your permission I would like to re-raise the point of order that I tried to make just before the votes this morning.
I will re-read the point that I wanted to make.
I currently chair the European Parliament's delegation for relations with the United States of America and would like to raise a point of order under Parliament's rules concerning parliamentary delegations.
It has come to my attention that a group of EPP Members visited the USA in July.
Normally I would regard this as a private matter, but in the programme for the visit, which I can supply to you, the group is described as a delegation and in particular Mr Robert Goodwill, MEP, is described as leader of the delegation.
This of course puts the visit in an entirely different context.
An official delegation from Parliament, which I headed, visited the United States of America in June.
I think that you will understand that confusion may well arise when another group of MEPs arrives in the USA some three weeks later as, to all intents and purposes, a second European Parliament delegation.
I know that there was a strong anti-European tone to their reports, and this, of course, is a matter for the EPP, but when damaging and derogatory remarks about the European Union stem from what is purported to be an official visit from the European Parliament, I feel that the matter should be raised here.
I would ask you as a matter of urgency to investigate whether Parliament's rules have been broken.
Could you also ascertain whether the Members concerned had a formal invitation from relevant bodies in the USA and intend to declare their visit in the Members' register of interests?
I will of course pass on the other documentation that I have received.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, in the Minutes, in point 2, you can see at the end, after Parliament observed a minute's silence in memory of those who had died, the Minutes said: "Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso spoke."
Actually there is no mention of what I said.
But if you look at the verbatim report you can see that there is a very important error which could mislead people.
The verbatim report says, at the end of my words: "The action of ETA is a righteous expression of the struggle for recognition" ... etc. My words were: "The action of ETA is the enraged expression of the struggle for recognition of something quite elementary."
The right to exist as Basque.
You can understand that the difference is a very substantial one.
I would like to amend it.
I would ask for responsibility to be taken for that because if you look at the Spanish press today, everybody has taken these words as the real ones.
That is at least based on a reference but then some mass media in Spain, whereas I cited Hegel as a quotation, have put in Nietzsche and this is no coincidence at all.
I am afraid I am faced with a determination to put words into my mouth which I did not say.
That is my protest.
I would like to amend what is in the verbatim report.
To say in the Minutes that I spoke is not sufficient.
You must record the sense of what I said yesterday.
Mr Gorostiaga, if you feel that you have been misquoted, you have hereby been given the opportunity to report this.
This too will be included in the Verbatim Report.
We will of course examine how this has happened. I am taking note of this now.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
As you are aware, Parliament decided this morning to add a communication by Mr Verheugen on enlargement to tomorrow' s agenda at 5.00 p.m.
Mr Prodi, President of the Commission, has also expressed the wish to make a communication on this subject matter.
Since Mr Prodi is to leave Strasbourg by 5.00 p.m. at the very latest, I suggest bringing the Commission communication forward to 4.00 p.m.
The debates will consequently be resumed after the Commission communication until Question Time (Commission) which commences at 5.30 p.m..
Are there any objections to this?
Mr President, I wholeheartedly agree with what you have said, and also welcome with open arms the fact that President Prodi himself is to make a statement.
All I would ask - and the group chairmen in attendance will support me in this - is that the group chairmen are also given the opportunity tomorrow to make a brief statement of their position.
This has not been scheduled yet, but I would ask if it could be attended to, so that we too are able to make our positions clear.
There is no need for it to be a long statement, but the group chairmen must be given this opportunity.
I would urge you to arrange this accordingly.
Mr Poettering, Parliament is sovereign.
If, therefore, you express this wish and I feel that you do so on behalf of many, especially your own colleagues, then I have no objections to granting you this wish, and this means that the group chairmen will also be taking the floor.
Are there any objections?
Then the decision is as stated.
EU external action priorities (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the declarations of the Council and the Commission on EU external action priorities.
Mr President, many thanks for allowing me to continue this morning' s debate.
The Socialist Group has a need to recognise for itself that Europe' s position on the world stage has undergone a dramatic change since the fall of the Berlin Wall, when traditionally, foreign policy was adopted by national states which continue to play a major role, of course.
We also noticed that our own governments often thwarted each other in their efforts to adopt effective external policy.
We are now in a position where we can gradually see these governments taking joint steps and the European Union setting up a growing common foreign policy.
And in our view, and this was also explained very clearly by Mr Patten, with regard to those external actions, "foreign policy" involves more than traditional foreign diplomacy as we knew it but also touches upon concepts such as security - and embraces a much wider concept of security - the environment, conflict prevention, trade and relations in all kinds of areas.
It encompasses development cooperation and naturally the traditional tools of foreign policy.
This has culminated in an enriched foreign policy for the EU and has also resulted in the integration of the Commissioner for External Relations, Mr CFSP, Mr Solana, and the Council who all have a particular role to fulfil.
It is unfortunate that Mr Solana was unable to be here to make a contribution of this kind.
We would actually like to emphasise that there are three priorities for which we need to find a balance simultaneously. Firstly, of direct concern are our neighbours, in other words eastward enlargement.
Our second priority is the strategic aspect within MEDA. This is the second area which touches upon traditional relations within NATO, the G7 and the other contexts within which we cooperate with America and the other traditional partners.
The third priority is easily forgotten but in our eyes essential, namely that of Europe as the bearer of values in the world, or, in other words 'a global player in a global village' . In this respect, it is essential to regard the fight against poverty as a key contribution in our policy, rather than according it a minor position within foreign policy.
Mr Patten, Mr Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, and the Commissioner for External Relations, you could, in fact, extract new value, new quality and effectiveness from this, working in tandem with Parliament.
We very much regret the fact that heading 4, the role of our Parliament and the tasks which we actually have to fulfil in the process are still being sidelined to such a degree.
All too often, we find that the Council follows its own line of thought and this is no longer the way in which we can market modern foreign policy which covers a wide range of issues. We therefore hope that we can once again drive our message home.
We hope that this new policy takes account of the budget and can be accompanied by an involved and powerful European Parliament that can have its say and is taken entirely seriously.
We would welcome a positive response from the Council and Commission with regard to this new policy in these matters too.
Mr President, I welcome the resolve that was shown here today by the French Presidency and the Commission in placing emphasis on enlargement as the key priority for the external action of the Union.
I hope that when we come to deal with the matter in the House tomorrow the Verheugen incident will have simply served as a timely reminder that we must get our signals clear and avoid giving mixed messages with regard to this strategic priority.
With regard to the matter in hand, I should like to pick up on a point made by the Commissioner earlier today when he talked about the attempt to make foreign policy more effective and to warmly welcome and subscribe to his view on the indivisibility of the Union's foreign policy.
If we take the Barcelona process, the Middle East peace process, our relations with the Western Balkans, our relations with Russia, clearly there is a vast area of policy to be covered and a wide variety of instruments.
It is clear that a successful foreign policy cannot stand on one pillar alone.
Even if the conduct of foreign policy - and in particular, the security and defence dimension of foreign policy - is essentially for government, it follows that because of the nature of the policy terrain and the instruments available it cannot be government's exclusive concern.
The Commission is right to demand its right of association under the Treaty and, through that, for this Parliament to demand its right of accountability and scrutiny.
A second general point I should like to refer to is in respect of the efficiency of policy.
Here too the new Commission - and in particular, Commissioner Patten - deserve to be congratulated, first of all for revealing to us the extent of the horror that much of the policy had become.
Let me recall one of the results of these inquiries: in the past five years the average delay in the disbursement of committed funds has increased from three years to four-and-a-half years.
For certain programmes the backlog of outstanding commitments is equivalent to more than eight-and-a-half years of payments.
That clearly is a farce in anyone's analysis.
It has to be said in fairness that the former Commission led by Jacques Santer was as much a victim as an author of this process.
This is an accumulation of an ineffective and inefficient system over years.
We welcome the commitment to an urgent review of that process.
On behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group I should like to lay particular emphasis on our distress at the code of secrecy rather than the code of transparency normally promoted by the Council.
Blanket secrecy is not the way to legitimise an evolving Community policy.
My group deplores the fact that this code of secrecy was slipped in during the Parliamentary summer recess, with no Parliamentary consultation and by written procedure.
It amounts to a form of intergovernmental conspiracy against citizens' right to know.
I want to hear from the Council today what role it feels it is prepared to accord to this House in terms of the scrutiny and accountability of issues which may be intergovernmental but which cannot stand on one pillar alone?
Mr President, as the European Union assumes new powers we might expect that transparency in this matter and parliamentarian monitoring would increase at the same rate.
Now, it would seem that the European security and defence identity is making dramatic progress in the wake of the Helsinki summit.
It appears, however, that the Council has been resorting more and more to the intergovernmental process in this, so much so that it has threatened even to bypass the Commission, something quite unheard of, as far as I am concerned.
The Commission must have a strong role to play in this process.
Just like my colleague, Mr Cox, I too strongly condemn the fact that, during the summer recess, the Council produced very significant restrictions on the public' s right to gain access to documents relating to matters of security and defence.
Obviously, nobody is claiming that confidentiality and even secrecy are not necessary from time to time, when it is a question, for example, of operational matters in defence policy.
But the Council' s decision seems to be leading to a situation now where the whole development of the security and defence policy in the political sphere can no longer be properly monitored, being, as it were, beyond that.
The public can no longer follow the development of security and defence policy, and neither can Parliament monitor it properly.
We here in Parliament have discussed this situation, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in which I am involved in the discussion of the issue, is looking into whether Parliament should possibly take the Council to court on account of this decision, which is a clear violation of Parliament' s rights, and weakens our citizens' already barely attainable rights of access to documents.
I demand a clear explanation from the representative of the Council, and I would be very grateful if the Commission were also to comment on the situation.
I shall be very brief, Mr President, as I only wish to discuss one very specific aspect of the European Union' s external actions.
I feel that, although this is a very specific issue, it nevertheless deserves our utmost consideration and is of great concern to us.
I am referring to the obvious trend towards placing less and less value, in terms of both our attention and resources, on cooperation with developing countries.
I realise, of course, that we have other objectives and that these too must be given the appropriate consideration.
Nevertheless, I think that, because of the expectations that are created, because of the European Union' s responsibilities and even because of the new problems facing developing countries, for all these reasons, taking account of these very important parts of the world must be a major factor in determining our actions.
I would emphasise one aspect in particular: we need, in this context, to have our own independent strategies that confirm the European Union' s position in this field.
This concern has arisen mainly as a result of the successive budgetary cuts in the field of cooperation which, to a certain extent, illustrate and endorse the fears I have just mentioned, which I feel we must lay to rest once and for all.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by addressing a brief remark to Mr Patten.
The document on which we are preparing to vote deplores the slide towards intergovernmentalism which is creeping into our common foreign and security policy and that this somewhat contradicts the Commissioner' s speech this morning, in which he said that foreign policy would remain a matter for national governments.
I therefore feel that the question should perhaps be broached with greater flexibility.
In politics, we never use the word "never" .
I think that the European Parliament is fairly reticent on this question, but Mr Brok' s intervention demonstrated that no one here in this House continued to feel that it was still possible and absolutely vital to communitise foreign policy.
I should like quickly to ask the President-in-Office two questions.
I was interested to read of a recent Franco-German initiative to unite consulates.
Does the Presidency-in-Office entertain the idea of rapidly communitising foreign policy and, more importantly, of giving a Union embassy the task of representing all the Member States of the Union in the fifty countries in which no Member State of the Union is represented?
My second question is this.
I was interested to note, Mr President-in-Office, your obvious lack of enthusiasm for the European Union/China summit, which pleases me greatly.
Does that mean that the so-called policy of critical dialogue with China is dead and buried and would you be prepared, as the President-in-Office, to address the question of the recognition of the Tibetan Government in exile at your next meeting with the Chinese if no agreement on the new status of Tibet is reached within a reasonable period of time?
Mr President, I believe it is important not to lose sight of the objectives pursued in the course of this debate. In my opinion, there are two:
Firstly, to guarantee more effective, coherent and visible external action on the part of the European Union.
What would be the point of having more than 40 000 officials in more than 1 500 diplomatic missions between the Commission and the Member States - twice the number the United States has - if our activity really is not sufficiently efficient, coherent or visible?
I believe that Mr Patten expressed this very well in his intervention when he demonstrated that he had at least read the joint motion for a resolution which we have negotiated in Parliament.
Secondly, to take note of the fact that the days when the European Parliament simply rubber-stamped the priorities established by other Community institutions have finally been assigned to history.
Mr Moscovici, in the coming months we will have to make important decisions in the field of the nascent, embryonic defence policy. During the Balkan crisis the inadequacies of the European Union were made blatantly clear.
In the United States there is currently a great debate taking place concerning defence expenditure.
We will soon have to hold this debate here in Europe. We in Europe will not only have to consider this expenditure but also the structure of this spending.
The incompatibility and heterogeneity of the Member States' investments in this field - the national views - make this such a difficult debate that we will have to consider other added problems such as interinstitutional disputes.
This Parliament would clearly have preferred the figure of the High Representative to be answerable to the Commission.
Instead, it has been answerable to the Council , and this is something we have to accept, as we also have to accept that the Commission must play a role.
Mr Patten is right when he says that we have to clarify and resolve a series of tensions between the intergovernmental realm and the Community realm.
This dispute between the institutions must be resolved, and the European Parliament must not simply be serving at the table, but it also wishes to take its place in the kitchen.
Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, with my French colleagues in the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I naturally follow the external actions of the European Union with great interest.
In general we favour a strong European Union presence on the international scene.
That implies firm and unswerving commitment from the Council itself first of all.
You spoke of high ambition, Minister, and I was pleased to hear it.
But that also presupposes a Commission genuinely capable of action.
That is what the Commissioner wants and I hope he is getting, and will get, the political, administrative and financial resources he needs to put his ideas into practice and make the CFSP really effective and efficient.
But in this short speech, I want to focus on enlargement.
A recent interview with a German newspaper stirred up some turmoil.
For us, however, it is clear: there is no question of slowing down the enlargement process by introducing new requirements or a variety of delaying tactics.
On the contrary, we must do everything we can to move it forward, as you just reaffirmed, Minister, and of course that does not exclude either rigour or vigilance.
A slapdash enlargement would obviously be a great mistake.
Having said that, we are conscious of the problems due to public opinion both within the fifteen Member States and in the candidate countries.
Public opinion is very ill informed and can veer from irrational enthusiasm to a sense of discouragement to outright hostility.
A great deal of work undoubtedly needs to be done if the long and difficult process of enlargement is to have solid, clear-sighted and determined popular support.
Mr President, the foreign policy of the European Union can only be successful if it satisfies three main criteria: clarity, credibility and transparency.
Mr Patten, we will continue to push for this, even though you believe that we should at last put an end to the game of ping pong.
As far as I am concerned, it has started and can only finish if a constructive solution is found. Otherwise this will lead to further competition between the institutions.
I believe the speech you gave in Paris was significant in this respect.
It is true that there should at last be open discussion on how to pursue a truly coherent foreign policy.
The European Parliament will play an important part in this.
You said yourself that it will only be possible to achieve credibility - your second point - if the European Union employs all its capabilities, i.e. all three pillars, and particularly the first with its financial and economic means, in preventive conflict management, and if the EU promotes stability overseas by making proper use of its economic instruments and using its political means to achieve real cooperation.
After all, we know that we must take a considerably broader view of the issue of protection.
Protection of the environment, the individual and human rights cannot be secured through one pillar alone.
In the same way, preventive conflict management is not just about the deployment of a police force; it involves all three pillars.
As far as the last point, that of transparency, is concerned, my group has made it quite clear today that we do not accept, nor will we accept, that access to these documents should be restricted.
Transparency is Parliament' s watchword, and we will continue to demand it from the Council and the Commission alike.
We will revisit this theme at a later stage.
Mr President, I was interested to hear the President-in-Office mention the four priorities which the Presidency-in-Office envisages for the future in the field of foreign affairs and defence. Two of these priorities also concern the resolutions, namely the selection of tools which are needed to achieve this and the development of the common foreign and security and defence policy itself.
Commissioner Patten, the Vice-President of the Commission, reacted to this in his own way and remarked that the European Union is in fact extremely resourceful.
The lion' s share of aid - two-thirds in fact - originates from our European Union.
Enlargement is on the agenda and he also mentioned the promotion of stability, at which point I started to have my doubts.
When he then mentioned the fact that the EU should have its own identity on the world stage, I thought: I would love to share this objective with him but in a way which would take account of European responsibilities.
Needless to say, this identity can only find expression in true European policy.
European responsibilities can certainly not be divided among fifteen to thirty or perhaps more Member States.
This does not mean that there will be no Foreign Affairs Ministers in the Member States. They will certainly be kept on, just like the Ministers for Economic Affairs or certainly those for Education.
Once European responsibilities are identified, they should in any event not be divided up and they should also be truly based on a European vision and European values which we share here in this Parliament.
This is not about a simple bureaucratic division of powers between institutions or a power-crazed Parliament or such like.
This is about a practical solution: how can we solve the problems we have encountered?
This is about the fact that our policy was unable to prevent the suffering in Bosnia, which claimed hundreds of thousands of victims.
That is what this is all about!
We need to ask ourselves how we can prevent this.
This is when we say as a Parliament: we need European policy; otherwise we will not succeed.
Mr President, first of all, I want to say thank you both to the French Presidency and to Commissioner Patten for their excellent contributions this morning.
The priorities established deserve all our support.
Time permits only a couple of remarks on my part.
I choose to concentrate on the deficiencies in the implementation of the Union' s development cooperation.
Commissioner Patten deserves praise for the openness with which he describes and has described the problems.
My own experience when, in a responsible post within the UN' s development programme, I sought cooperation with the Union at national level with a view to assembling and coordinating forces in different areas was that, as a rule, it did not work, either because almost every decision in the EU' s case needed to be taken in Brussels and also because of the lack of qualified staff within the area concerned.
All this made cooperation with the EU difficult and incredibly time-consuming.
The UN has its problems with bureaucracy and dilatoriness - I am the first to admit that - but, where development work and development cooperation are concerned, the EU was lagging far behind, in any case a few years ago.
The conclusion I draw is, first of all, that the Commission must radically decentralise the right of decision-making to national level.
"Brussels" , with all its administrative levels, must relinquish a large degree of control.
Secondly, it is important to ensure that the Commission has an adequate number of qualified staff to carry out the operations about which decisions are being made.
I know, Commissioner Patten, that this is the direction your politics are taking right now.
I would just emphasise that it is a matter of urgency.
If there are no rapid improvements, I fear that the Commission' s support for development cooperation will gradually disappear.
That would be a pity, given that well-developed multilateral cooperation has many advantages and that the Union needs such an instrument in order to be able to play a proactive role on the international stage.
Mr President, the President-in-Office's speech seemed to me to be rather on the biased and general side, but I found that Commissioner Patten's speech was realistic and focused well on the different problem areas.
We therefore now need to discuss the different issues.
Firstly, tomorrow marks the start of a major UN session where 159 Heads of State will be present.
In what form will the European Union be present and at what level?
I feel that it is extremely important for us to establish ourselves at the very highest level and to make our presence felt.
A discussion on priorities should include economic policy, but our economic policies are all inward-looking and only concern the interior of Europe.
It is also just as important not to let go of development policy, for that creates stability and peace and has to target Russia and China as well as developing countries. In my opinion, it is not right to ask us to choose between the Balkans and developing countries.
The Member States need to take these factors on board.
Working towards constitutionalisation of the European Union, one benefit of which would be institutional citizenship in international bodies, the creation of a European diplomacy as per the Galeote report, the cultural concern which we must take on board in order to avoid fresh incidents of colonialism, the support and valuing of democratic processes which have also been established in certain countries such as Iran, and the regulation of relations with NGOs, which could become the operational arm of the European Union - these options could all contribute to an effective political initiative for developing countries, an initiative which would assert the supremacy of European civilisation in terms of a quest for solidarity to improve quality of life and bear witness to respect for human dignity, celebrating it in every corner of the world.
Mr President-in-Office, this morning you mentioned the report Parliament has asked me to present on Turkey' s accession process.
I think I can announce the body of the conclusions today.
Like the Commission, Parliament salutes Turkey' s endeavours in drawing up a programme for developing its legal arsenal to comply more closely with the requirements of the European Union, especially in terms of respect for human rights.
At the same time we understand the stir caused among the various political parties and public opinion as it recognises the magnitude of the reforms that country must agree to introduce before it joins the Union.
We want our partners to know that the European Union has no intention of interfering in their domestic affairs, but is offering them a contract under terms now redefined under the accession partnership and the agreement on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is up to them to accept or refuse that contract.
In that connection, I believe we must have the courage to tell the Turkish people that there are at least two prior conditions governing its accession to Europe. First, respect for the need for identity.
This is being demonstrated across Europe by our fellow citizens all the more clearly because they have the greatest desire to protect their roots in the face of the ineluctable progress of globalisation.
Europe is resolute in recognising that need for identity, aware that its diversity is the source of its wealth.
That is why it insists on the rights, but also the duties, of minorities. That is the spirit in which the Union proposes to help Turkey find a solution to the Kurdish problem.
There must also be a solution to the Cyprus problem as soon as possible, because nobody in Europe would accept a wall continuing to divide it, like those of Berlin, Beirut and Sarajevo (amongst others), which have now, fortunately, come down.
Mr President, our debate today reveals a continuing difficulty at the heart of the European Union's approach on foreign policy.
Is the intention to give an enlarging group of European nations a stronger voice on the world stage and improve the coordination and effectiveness of their policies on a range of issues?
If so, I can support this.
Or is the ambition to move towards a European state, with its own foreign and security policy backed by its own diplomatic service and army?
This concept I wholeheartedly reject.
It is certainly not wanted by the British people, nor, I believe, is it wanted by many of the citizens in the rest of Europe.
They have never been asked in honest terms.
Mr Patten today reiterated his view that for the indefinite future there will be national foreign ministers.
But this is only half the problem.
What will be the content of their jobs in ten years' time if the EU continues on its present course?
After all, once EMU is fully established there will still be finance ministers in the euroland countries.
But how much real responsibility will they have?
Clearly there are many in this House who are quite open in their advocacy of a single foreign ministry for Europe and the Galeote Quecedo report which was voted on today with its proposals for a permanent Community diplomatic service is, I am afraid, a step in this direction.
I am also concerned by the extent to which many want to define European foreign policy in terms of its distinctiveness from the United States policies, sometimes even deliberate hostility to the United States positions.
A priority for the European Union must surely be to break out of this antagonistic mindset and instead seek, as a primary aim, to contribute to western solidarity.
The best forum for dealing with security policy issues is NATO rather than the European Union and the danger is that the common European security and defence policy, with its emphasis on an autonomous capability, will undermine the alliance which served us so well during more threatening times.
Mr President, some of us have asked the President-in-Office and Commissioner Patten specific questions.
I realise the debate has been particularly badly organised, being split into two halves, but could we at least have written responses?
Financial year 2001
The next item is the submission by the Council of the draft budget for the financial year 2001.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Patten for being here.
Ladies and gentlemen, today, on behalf of the Council Presidency, it is my honour to present the draft budget of the European Communities, as drawn up by the Council on 20 July.
As you know, my colleague Florence Parly chaired that Council, but unfortunately she cannot be here today, so please accept her apologies.
First of all, I would like to pay tribute to the excellent work done by the Portuguese Presidency ahead of the Council' s adoption, at first reading, of the draft budget for 2001.
I would also like to highlight the excellent climate in which this budgetary procedure has opened.
This year, the provisions of the new interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999 have taken full effect.
The first session under the trialogue procedure bringing together the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission was held on 6 July, here in Strasbourg, and demonstrated its usefulness in terms of better mutual understanding of our respective positions and priorities.
The conciliation meeting between the European Parliament and the Council, which took place on 20 July, was, I think, very positive.
In particular, it became possible to find a great many points of agreement between institutions and make good progress on potential sources of disagreement.
I hope we can continue to work in the same spirit and produce a budget for the European Communities for the financial year 2001 which gives us the resources to meet the priorities and challenges the European Union is about to face.
Firstly, I want to set out the major guidelines which have determined the way the Council has drawn up this draft budget before going into more detail - though not at length - on the various categories.
In the first place, the Council has ensured proper funding, after identifying clear priorities and real needs, for the European Union' s various actions, especially those in the area of external relations, which we were talking about just now - albeit with a gap.
So the evaluation of the likely implementation of the appropriations has been taken into account for commitment appropriations.
The Council has also paid special attention to the development of payment appropriations, setting their increase compared with 2000 at a maximum rate of 3.5%, which in particular takes account of the capacity for implementation and the probable rate of payments entailed by the balances to be settled.
That growth, which is much higher than the Member States authorise for their national budgets, plus the forecast inflation for 2001, is a mark of the Council' s determination to ensure satisfactory financing of all European Union policies.
Finally, this draft budget remains totally in keeping with the interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure.
In particular the Council felt it was absolutely essential to respect - and I stress this - each of the annual expenditure ceilings set by the financial perspectives which our three institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, signed up to a year ago.
Those are the bases for the draft budget for the financial year 2001, drawn up by the Council on 20 July, to provide for EUR 95.9 billion in commitment appropriations, an increase of 2.7% over the budget for 2000, and EUR 92.5 billion in payment appropriations, an increase of 3.5% over the budget for 2000.
Particular importance has been accorded to the increase in the importance of appropriations for aid to the Western Balkans, a repeatedly affirmed priority and one I reaffirm here, because I do not accept the comment earlier about 'chaos' .
The situation is sensitive, but not chaotic.
There is work to be done, and work is being done.
The Council hopes to convert this priority into figures with a total appropriation 30% higher than in 2000.
The EUR 614 million adopted by the Council will ensure funding of all foreseeable needs.
I would add - and of course this is important in our discussions - that it has been possible to earmark such a significant amount without having to revise the financial perspectives aimed at strengthening category 4, as proposed by the Commission.
The Council has also ensured the funding of all the European Union' s other policy priorities.
Without launching into an exhaustive description of the Council' s draft budget, which is in any case the subject of the detailed explanatory statement circulated to you, I would now like to present the Council' s 2001 draft budget decisions in a rather more specific way, that is, by category of expenditure.
First, as regards category 1 of the financial perspectives relating to agricultural expenditure, the draft budget provides for an increase in commitment appropriations of 6.3% in relation to 2000 in order to fund the CAP reform agreed by the European Council in Berlin in March 1999.
Nevertheless, for sub-category 1a of the financial perspectives, covering CAP market expenditure, the Council decided on figures some EUR 330 million lower in total than those proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft.
In fact, there is under-implementation of these appropriations every year.
The Council therefore felt that it could achieve a reduction by targeting some traditionally underspent budget lines.
By doing so, it is also demonstrating the will to make special efforts to achieve significant savings in the compulsory expenditure and not just in non-compulsory expenditure.
The savings made, in comparison with the Commission' s preliminary draft budget, do not prevent the Council providing for an increase, which also responds to Parliament' s concerns, in two budgetary lines: for the distribution of milk to schoolchildren, which I know has been the subject of massive correspondence for more than a year now, and promotion of product quality.
For expenditure related to rural development, taking account of the delays which have built up in the approval and implementation of national rural development plans, the Council felt that a margin of EUR 225 million, under the ceiling of sub-category 1b of the financial perspectives, could be earmarked.
The development of these appropriations, however, shows an increase of 4.6% compared with 2000, an increase which reflects the priority the Council accords the appropriations allocated to what now constitutes a second pillar of the CAP.
So the draft budget drawn up by the Council includes margins available under the ceilings of sub-categories 1a and 1b of the financial perspectives.
However, I want to specify that the Council is, of course, prepared to re-examine agricultural expenditure this autumn in the light of the content of the letter of amendment the Commission will be presenting and to reconsider, at that time, developments in market and rural development expenditure.
As regards structural actions, covered by category 2 of the financial perspectives, the Council has budgeted this whole category as commitment appropriations in line with the conclusions of the Berlin European Council of March 1999 and, in addition, it has renewed all the payment appropriations entered in 2000.
But it hoped to increase the Cohesion Fund allocations by some EUR 360 million over provision in the Commission' s preliminary draft, to take account of the forecasts for implementation of these credits in the Member States.
On category 3 of the financial perspectives relating to the funding of internal policies, the Council was primarily intent on ensuring the appropriate funding for the multiannual programmes while respecting, where applicable, the programming decided jointly with Parliament.
That is why it has accepted the amounts requested by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget for the framework programme for research and development as well as for the trans-European networks.
It has done the same with regard to the appropriations requested to improve the financial environment of SMEs and the start up of the LIFE 3 programme.
The Council believes the right amount has been identified to get the LIFE 3 programme off to a good start.
As regards the extension of the 'Employment' initiative, agreed by Parliament to strengthen the employment dynamic begun by the Amsterdam European Council, the conciliation meeting between the European Parliament and the Council held on 20 July demonstrated that this subject represents a priority for both our institutions for the 2001 budget, especially in terms of building on the conclusions of the Feira European Council.
However, the Council is waiting for the assessment of the previous initiative soon to be delivered by the Commission with a view to seeking agreement with Parliament about its funding in the context of a global agreement during the second reading.
Furthermore, it has identified a precautionary margin of EUR 208 million more than the one in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget, the objective being to have enough room for manoeuvre over and above a necessary margin under the ceiling of category 3 to deal with the new priorities shared by the Council and by Parliament, such as the 'employment' initiative I mentioned earlier.
I now come to the financing of the European Union external actions covered by category 4 of the financial perspectives.
I do not need to remind you, after the debate we had just now, of the high priority the Council accords to aid to the Western Balkans. Here, as I have already indicated, the draft budget provides for an increase of 30% in comparison with 2000.
The EUR 614 million adopted by the Council will be enough to finance all the foreseeable needs.
This figure is based on the only evaluation of needs currently available, set out in the 1999 World Bank report on rebuilding Kosovo.
Wishing to be pragmatic, the Council is renewing but not increasing the appropriations intended for Serbia, as it is not yet eligible for Community assistance beyond the aid for democracy and civil society included in this envelope.
In general, the Council would like to see the implementation of effective and credible intervention in the region, based on an analysis of needs, adaptation of levels and types of aid to the nature of those needs, and distribution of effort between all the bilateral and multilateral donors.
As regards the other budget titles, although the Council has maintained the major allocations, for a limited number of budgetary lines it has not retained all the appropriations the Commission asked for in its preliminary draft budget. I am thinking in particular of the TACIS programme, the funding of KEDO, the international fisheries agreements, the rapid reaction arrangements and the MEDA programme.
On the other hand, the Council has kept to the Commission' s preliminary draft for the vast majority of the other cooperation programmes.
However I want to emphasise, as regards the MEDA programme, that the draft budget provides for an amount of EUR 701 million which is higher than the annual average allocation over the period 1995-1999.
The reduction of EUR 150 million made by the Council in comparison with what the Commission is asking for, takes account of the stock of still unpaid commitments still on this programme, and that represents several years of implementation.
I take this opportunity to remind you of the Council' s determination to contribute to better management of the programme, an indispensable prior condition, in our view, to enhancing our efforts.
Despite this reduction - motivated by the need to reabsorb the outstanding balance - the MEDA programme naturally remains very important to the Council.
The French Presidency' s objective is to achieve the adoption of the new multiannual regulation for MEDA soon and it will in particular be listening to the European Parliament on this subject.
I would also like to reaffirm the Council' s commitment to the accession process for Cyprus and Malta, and here I want to congratulate Mr Morillon on the conclusions of his report, which he outlined earlier.
We look forward to reading the report with interest, not to say impatience.
Consequently we have followed the Commission by grouping the appropriations asked for together under the heading of 'pre-accession strategy' .
However we have not followed up the Commission' s proposal for a revision of the financial perspectives, transferring these appropriations to category 7, and we have kept them in category 4.
Finally, I want to express my satisfaction that agreement was reached at the conciliation meeting between the European Parliament and the Council on 20 July on the amount of the appropriations to be included for the CFSP, as well as the transfer of the administrative expenses for CFSP special representatives, to the Council' s budget, in accordance with the institutional agreement of 1999.
This agreement has given rise to the drafting of two joint declarations, one of which specifies that the sums included in the Council' s budget under the heading of CFSP administrative expenses should take account of their impact on the general position for category 5, while the other commits the Council to ensuring that the estimates for administrative costs anticipated for each new CFSP decision are transmitted in good time to the other branch of the budgetary authority.
As you can appreciate, the Council has therefore tried to fund the various priorities in the field of European Union external actions appropriately and in doing so it has earmarked a margin of EUR 184 million under the ceiling of category 4 of the financial perspectives.
In drawing up its draft budget for the administrative expenditure covered by category 5 of the financial perspectives, the Council has been concerned to stabilise current expenditure, while taking account of the exceptional needs of the institutions, especially as regards staff for the Anti-fraud Office and the Court of Justice.
As regards the Commission' s budget, the Council did not make any decision in July, as it was awaiting the letter of amendment from the Commission which has just been presented, so the Council will now be examining that proposal and applying the lessons from the reorganisation work headed up by Neil Kinnock.
The Council is ready to do whatever is necessary to examine this letter of amendment so that its incidence can be taken into account as from first reading by the European Parliament.
To that end, there is a margin of EUR 113 million under the ceiling of category 5 of the financial perspectives.
I wish to conclude this overview of the various categories of expenditure with the expenditure on pre-accession aid.
For these the Council has kept the Commission' s figure for commitment appropriations.
For payment appropriations, the Council has adjusted the Commission' s preliminary draft budget figure downward by EUR 300 million.
In line with the logic prevailing for the other categories, the Council has taken maximum account of the substantial underspend of these appropriations in 2000.
Despite this reduction compared with the Commission' s preliminary draft, the pre-accession payment appropriations recorded a strong increase of 10.8% compared with 2000, which again reflects the importance accorded this expenditure as absolutely vital to the proper preparation of our major political aim, the enlargement, a priority shared by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.
Naturally, I wish to take this opportunity to say that I am sure the discussion between Mr Verheugen and the European Parliament, tomorrow, will make it possible to eliminate a number of misunderstandings.
I know GÃŒnther Verheugen well, I know how committed he is to enlargement and how hard he is working for its success.
Before I end, I would like to take this opportunity to say how pleased I am about the agreement reached, at the conciliation meeting between the European Parliament and the Council on 20 July, on a statement on financial programming.
Under the terms of this joint declaration, the Commission will now be obliged to evaluate the financial consequences of each of its new proposals, in particular for categories 3 and 4 of the financial perspectives.
I am sure that will be a fundamental factor in clarifying the decisions of the budgetary authority.
Anyway it will undoubtedly mean better budgetary forecasting and should be extremely useful during future budgetary procedures.
To conclude this overview, which I think has been as brief as it could be, I think, the draft budget being forwarded to you offers a balanced compromise whereby the European Union' s priorities can be funded while absolutely fundamentally respecting the Berlin financial perspectives - and we all know that it was not easy task to define them.
The 1999 interinstitutional agreement established conciliation between the institutions in the course of the budgetary procedure, and we are all bound to benefit this year and in the future.
In this connection, I am pleased with the progress we were already able to make, even before adoption of the draft budget at first reading by the Council, in bringing together the points of view of the institutions.
It seems to me that the draft I have just presented to you draws a number of lessons from that conciliation.
In any case I hope it gives you a good foundation for starting your work on the budget and that it will contribute to the establishment of a budget for 2001 which respects the priorities of each of the institutions, one which is satisfactory in terms of our joint mission, fulfilling our responsibilities towards Europe and its peoples.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, you will shortly be adopting two regulations that are highly significant in budgetary terms, one being the regulation on budgetary discipline in the agricultural sector, and the other being the regulation on own resources, that is to say, the financing of the budget.
On behalf of the Commission, I am able to tell you that we are most satisfied with the outcome of the discussions, and are delighted that these two difficult matters will soon be resolved.
However, the Commission takes a dim view of the outcome of the Council' s discussions on Budget 2001.
Accordingly, I am bound to contradict the assessment of the President-in-Office.
At first reading, the Council concentrated largely on cutting payment appropriations right across the board.
The end result was the lowest draft budget of the past ten years, when considering the budget in relation to the EU' s Gross National Product.
Now I have already made it clear to this august Chamber on numerous occasions that the Commission considers budgetary discipline to be an extremely important guiding principle, but the Council' s approach, i.e. to cut payment appropriations irrespective of the level of commitments entered into in the past which are due for payment, does not constitute sound budgetary policy.
The Council' s draft budget would cause the following to happen: the payment of arrears, i.e. the arrears of commitments entered into which have not yet been paid, would continue to mount up.
The Commission, on the other hand, supported by Parliament, would like to achieve the reverse, that is to reduce the arrears.
I believe that since we are in the happy position in the European Union of having an economy with high growth rates, now is the time to cut the arrears back, not add to them.
The Council has cut payment appropriations in the agricultural policy sphere by more than half a billion euro compared with the Commission' s draft.
This beggars belief considering the fierce criticism that certain of the larger Member States have levelled at the Commission, because we proposed to release EUR 300 million from agricultural policy in order to make the necessary payments in the Balkans available.
Obviously the Council now considers there to be far greater scope for making cuts in agricultural expenditure, but it is not prepared to make the funds available for the new external policy priorities for the Balkans.
As happened last year, there was a very heated discussion on how much aid should be made available for the Balkans, and I would remind you that during the discussions on Budget 2000, the Council took the line that it would not be possible to release the appropriations for Kosovo in any case.
Indeed, all the appropriations for Kosovo have in fact been tied up already.
The Kosovo agency for reconstruction is proving highly successful in its work, and that is surely something we should all support.
I would like briefly to take up the matter of Serbia, which you also mentioned in your speech. The fact that no provision has been made for Serbia in the draft budget, or only to a very limited extent, sends out the wrong message in my view.
We find ourselves in a situation where we are competing in political terms with the dictator Milosevic, and we must convince the people that the European Union is willing to provide assistance.
I am standing firm on this: by the end of 2001 we should have EUR 800 million more at our disposal for the Western Balkans than we do at present.
Part of this could perhaps be made additionally available before the end of this year.
I hope to enlist your support in this matter.
Another word on foreign policy: the Budget Council has cut the funding for the Mediterranean programme - which is also something you mentioned - by EUR 150 million.
Putting these cuts into effect would no longer just be a budgetary policy measure though, it would also constitute a change in the foreign policy in this field, a renunciation of the Barcelona process.
The Commission believes this to be unacceptable.
Turning now to administrative expenditure, i.e. staffing expenditure: I would point out that the Commission did not request any new posts in its draft preliminary budget, apart from those for OLAF, the European anti-fraud agency.
We have now submitted a letter of amendment containing two key points: firstly a request for 400 new posts for the Commission with effect from the year 2001, and secondly, budgetary measures which will enable us to do without the vast majority of Technical Assistance Offices, as per Parliament' s request, and, in particular, that of the Committee on Budgets.
I have just this to say about the requests for more posts: at the beginning of this year, the Commission set up a working group under the leadership of the President of the Commission, at my recommendation, which examined the tasks performed by all departments and completed a critical examination of the staffing situation.
We ascertained where there was scope for reallocation of staff within and between the departments, with a view to improving the availability of resources for the key areas and for the political priorities, and in order to ascertain where we need to create new posts.
Our findings are now available to you.
The Commission has estimated that we need 1254 new posts for key activities and political priorities.
We can create a vast number of these 1254 new posts through reallocation, which will mean requesting a total of 717 new posts - 400 in the year 2001 and 317 in the year 2002 - particularly if we are to strengthen the areas of external assistance, health and consumer protection and environmental policy, as well as justice and internal affairs.
In addition, we have proposed a one-off early retirement scheme for 600 posts, organised in such a way as to have no impact on the budget, which would drastically reduce the need for new posts.
As an interim solution - particularly for the purposes of external assistance - we would ask the budgetary authority to allow us, until such time as a new administrative structure is created, to use the funding that has been available hitherto for the Technical Assistance Offices, for contract staff within the Commission.
We would also like to increase funding for the delegations, which are to be more actively involved in the administration of external assistance in future.
The Commission has learnt from past mistakes, which boils down to making clear the fact that the Commission cannot perform miracles; all it can do is make it its business to perform to a high standard.
And if we are to acquit ourselves well of our tasks, we need the necessary resources, including the necessary staffing resources.
On a final note, it is fair to say that there are very testing times ahead again for all those involved in the budgetary discussions.
