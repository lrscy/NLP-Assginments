The first negative, meaning violation of democracy and the eventual introduction of sanctions against the undemocratic regime.
The second positive, meaning generous assistance and a helping hand if democracy wins in Ukraine.
The European Parliament should also strongly encourage safeguarding of the countryâs integrity, carried out in a peaceful manner.
We share the Councilâs and Commissionâs assessment of Ukraine as a key neighbour and partner.
If the rerun of the second round of the presidential elections meets international standards, we should ask the Council and the Commission to speed up implementation of the action plan for Ukraine and, as a priority, to focus on the development of civil society.
If Ukraine takes a positive step towards democracy, we should do more, act more quickly, and consider giving more relevance and true content to our new neighbourhood policy towards Ukraine and a new impulse to our eastern policy under the CFSP.
We should move beyond rhetoric.
Let us multiply the links between the European Union and Ukraine in all possible areas â education, culture, entrepreneurship, trade, investment, to name just a few.
If realities on the ground allow, we should grant Ukraine the status of a market economy and more access to our markets.
We should also allow for more flexibility in the visa system.
These concrete moves will constitute the best recipe for strengthening the emerging democracy on the doorstep of the European Union.
We should express â and not only verbally â our solidarity with the Ukrainian people.
We should keep doors open to Ukraineâs European aspirations.
If democracy prevails in Ukraine, it will be a triumph of values which are enshrined in all our European constitutional charters.
I end by saying in Ukrainian, perhaps for the first time in this House: ÐÐ²ÑÐŸÐ¿ÐµÐ¹ÑÑÐºÐžÐ¹ Ð¿Ð°ÑÐ»Ð°ÐŒÐµÐœÑÐ²ÑÑÐ°Ñ ÐŽÐµÐŒÐŸÐºÑÐ°ÑÑÑ Ð² Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐœÑ!â â the European Parliament greets democracy in Ukraine.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by welcoming Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
Commissioner, we have had a hand in somewhat extending the time you had to prepare yourself for your new office, but that had nothing to do with you.
By way of a word of welcome, let me tell you that you are for all of us the Commissioner for Foreign Relations of the whole European Union, and we offer you our constructive cooperation in the hope that it will reinforce peace in the world.
There are fine moments to be had in this House, and I have just enjoyed one of them.
The applause for MrÂ Saryusz-Wolski, who has just spoken, shows that we are united.
Speaking on behalf of our Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I can say that, when peace and democracy are at stake, when it comes to peaceful coexistence and the securing of fundamental citizensâ rights, which the state must guarantee if it is to deserve to be described as a democracy, then we are all on the same side, and that is one of the good things about Europe.
Over and above the gulfs that separate us in other respects, there are things we all want, and we Social Democrats are quite clear in our own minds what those things are: fundamental citizensâ rights, fundamental citizensâ freedoms, above all else the unrestricted right to vote, the sovereign right to determine who runs the state â all that is traditional European democracy.
I agree with Mr Saryusz-Wolski that, if the Ukrainians are now on the move towards this model of democracy, they will need more than anything else the help of the most successful model of multinational democracy in the world â that being the European Union, in defence of which we in this House should be united!
Discussing these things in the European Parliament is, of course, a straightforward matter; things are much more difficult in Kiev and in the countryside, and there are two crucial factors that must define the roles of all who are currently actively involved, both those based in Ukraine and with responsibilities in that country, and those whom we have sent there, where they act on our behalf.
I have not been there, nor am I going there â a delegation from our group is going there today and will assuredly get a much clearer impression than we will â but, when I see these pictures, it becomes clear to me that what there is on the ground is such a mass movement, with the power of the state on the one side colliding with the popular will on the other, that it will be very difficult to steer and direct it, and there is little distance to be covered between a peaceful solution and a bloodbath.
This is a responsibility to be assumed by all â by those who bear responsibility in Ukraine, and by those who remind them what their responsibility is.
What we need is a peaceful solution, one that will make the people sovereign while maintaining the countryâs unity.
I might add that that is not only in the Ukrainiansâ interests, but also in our own most essential interest.
For Europe too, a divided, fragmented or destabilised Ukraine would be fatal.
For that reason, we take pride in the fact that the European Union is conducting conciliatory dialogues on the ground, and we see this as an opportunity.
It also shows that it is not the European Union alone that gives itself important tasks, but that it is also sought out as a partner in dialogue and accepted as a mediator.
I take pride in the fact that our friends Javier Solana and Aleksander KwaÅniewski are playing key roles in negotiating between the parties â the involvement of the European Unionâs High Representative for Foreign Relations and the President of Poland is a good sign, for President KwaÅniewski, as you so rightly said, represents a country that has successfully been through this process, and Javier Solana was once a minister in a country â and a member of a party â both of which had freed themselves from a dictatorship.
So we now have two men in the thick of things who can draw on their own experience in making an important contribution towards the Ukraine adopting and realising what we describe as a European model of democracy.
So we Social Democrats too can address the Ukrainians and say: welcome to the democratic family of peoples!
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, each institution has a moment which becomes enshrined in its history.
The European Parliamentâs donning of the colour orange today will go down in European history.
This House is facing its defining moment, which will decide the role of the European Parliament in the Europe of the future.
I should like to express my great satisfaction at the fact that the European Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament have been united in their positions on an issue as important as Ukraine.
Parliament was actually the first to understand the significance of the colour orange in Europe.
In 1981, the Congress of Warsaw Trade Unions, held in Gdansk, home to the Solidarity Trade Union, appealed to working people all over the world, and particularly in the Soviet Union.
This bore fruit, and today the colour orange reminds us of the solidarity that is at the basis of Europeâs existence.
There is a connection between the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, the Rose Revolution in Georgia and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine.
The issue at stake here is freedom, and Europeâs future depends on the concept of freedom.
What is it we want at present?
I would like the Polish Parliamentâs voice to be heard, as it was the first to give an official welcome to a representative of the Ukrainian opposition, and to protest at the lies.
I would like the European Parliament to state clearly today that it will not accept lies or deceit, and that it will not recognise the elections.
I would also like it to make clear its expectation that truth and the principle of the rule of law will be victorious in Ukraine as well, and that no one can override this principle by means of violence.
In view of this, I would like the European Parliament to express its solidarity with those waiting in the cold on the streets of Kiev for results acceptable to them.
Let me add that we expect the political negotiations under way in Kiev, with the participation of Europeâs major institutions, such as the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, will deliver a solution that restores freedom.
Finally, I should like to say that Ukraine has opened itself up to Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must open itself up to Ukraine.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr Schulz, Mr Geremek, having spent last weekend in Kiev, I would like to start by adding a few words to the discussion on violence.
Having had many meetings and conversations in Kiev, my impression is that violence is not being threatened by those who have pitched their tents in the cityâs streets, or by those who have been demonstrating there for ten days and upwards.
If there is the threat of violence, it comes from the former powers, and of that problem we must be aware if we are going there.
Just what does crisis management mean in this situation?
Crisis management can in fact only mean an attempt on our part to bring into being what these orange revolutionaries, who are indeed far more than a Yushchenko party, are calling for.
What that means in plain language is that the run-off election must be repeated, that the re-run must be in December and no later, and that adequate provision must be made for the election to be observed.
Having failed to cover ourselves with glory when observing the last election, we Europeans really must get much more involved this time.
I think it important that Mr Saryusz-Wolski said that Ukraine had seemed a long way away.
That was self-criticism on his part, and I think we Europeans should be self-critical today.
I am glad that Members from Poland and other countries in the East that already, thank God, belong to the European Union, are being more far-sighted about policy on Ukraine than the rest of the EU.
For that, Mr Geremek, I am very grateful to you and to others, and I am proud of what you have achieved.
So much of our discussion of the Ukraine focuses on interests.
Again and again, I hear people talking about Putinâs interests, about Russiaâs interests, about American interests, about Europeansâ interests and about geostrategic interests, but, since coming back from Kiev, what I find lacking is any understanding, at the end of the day, among ourselves, that this mass movement in Ukraine is, at the moment, about the Ukrainiansâ interests.
If we do not put that centre stage in the debate and in our diplomacy, there is a very great risk of failure.
I am glad that we are setting out this very evening and that this joint delegation of the European Parliament has at last been put together.
I had hoped it would come to pass last weekend, but better late than never.
What I brought away with me from last weekend â and I think that will be our common experience â was that, after all our debates about European values and where in the world they are being realised, it does you a power of good to spend a few days in Kiev, for that, if anywhere in Europe, is where you can really feel that Europe shares a soul.
I hope that the delegation we are sending there will be what you want, what all the Members of this House want, and that we will be able to put flesh on the core demand â to which I referred at the outset â of the wearers of orange, the pressure from whom we too have needed.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the events that have been unfolding in Kiev over the last ten days are good news for democracy.
Overcoming fatalism and fear, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens are demonstrating their demand for change, with calm determination.
Their movement has gradually won over large sections of their parliament, the army, the media, and even, so it would appear, the Supreme Court.
That sea change has taken place because the Kuchma regime has, over the years, given rise to an increasingly broad opposition that now in fact contains differing schools of thought on the countryâs future.
It is worth recalling that the regimeâs drift towards authoritarianism got under way when the prime ministerâs name was not Yanukovich, but Yushchenko.
Nevertheless, a number of European leaders, usually western, have long considered the President of Ukraine as an ally to be treated with kid gloves.
As recently as last year, President Bush, for example, apparently put his trust in the incumbent regime to defend democracy in the Middle East with him, by saluting Mr Kuchmaâs decision to send troops to Iraq.
All of these elements should help us to water down certain democratic declarations of faith and to avoid any simplistic and Manichaean view of the reality of Ukrainian politics.
It strikes me that the great challenge now is to ensure that what is intrinsically good news for democracy is not in fact transformed into a tragedy for the Ukrainian people, by resulting if not in the partition of the country, then at least in renewed stirrings of nationalism and a resurgence of splits down ethnic lines, which would take us back to the periods of the Russian or Austro-Hungarian empires.
Accordingly, I find it somewhat archaic, not to mention irresponsible, to interpret the Ukraine crisis as a tug-of-war between the West and Russia and as something of a European take on the struggle between good and evil.
In light of Ukraineâs history, such an approach may only exacerbate the split between the two main sections of the country.
It does not in any way address the interests of the Ukrainian people, particularly the population from the western part of the country, which is highly reliant on the rest of the country given that cross-border trade has been in a state of collapse since Ukraineâs neighbours joined the EU.
Neither does it address the interests of the EU; the more we are committed to fostering an economic dynamic in Ukraine through our mediation, the more we have everything to lose from the destabilisation of such an economically and politically fragile country and, on a broader scale, region.
We should let PaulÂ Wolfowitz retain his imperial vision of Europe; he said, and I quote, âthe objective of a complete and free Europe will not be achieved until Ukraine has become a full Member of Europe and joined NATOâ.
From our point of view, we would be best advised to avoid exerting any pressure of that nature.
Once fresh elections have been held in Ukraine â this, at least, is what we hope will happen â in other words, once the entire countryâs legitimate representative has been appointed completely transparently, the time will have come to start calm political dialogue with both the authorities and society itself; dialogue that would not pit new relations with the EU against the particular relations between Russia and Ukraine, but would, instead, be aimed at developing a perspective that all sections of Ukrainian society can identify with.
This is yet another real-life test of our ability to implement a common foreign and security policy worthy of the name.
Â Â  . Mr President, the eyes of the whole world are glued to Ukraine.
The crowds in Kiev who are demonstrating in favour of normality and justice, and who retain their calm and their dignity, rightly deserve our admiration.
We all pray that, unlike in the past, it will be the Ukrainians alone who decide their future.
Whilst enthusiasm is a positive thing, however, blindness certainly is not.
There is a tendency to oversimplify the situation in Ukraine â one side is presented as completely black and the other completely white.
When we decide to give democracy lessons and speak of standards, we must ensure that that democracy applies across the board.
We rightly condemn one side for not complying with the basic rules on holding free elections, yet I have Internet pages in my hand, taken from a Ukrainian newspaper, denouncing, a few days ago, an election document distributed in Western Ukraine by some supporters of Yushchenko.
Under the heading âUkraine for the Ukrainiansâ, the article says thatÂ âthe election of Viktor Yushchenko guarantees us the installation of a national dictatorship...
Let us chase the Muscovites, the Polacks and the Jews out of our lands...
Our power will be terrible for the Muscovites, the Jews and the Poles who refuse to adopt our faith, etc.â.
If Parliament turns a blind eye to such incitement to hatred, then we will be made to look ridiculous.
If we preach morality to some, we must also preach it to others.
Let us be clear about this, I do not suspect for one moment that the vast majority of Ukrainians think this way, but history teaches us that particularly aggressive minorities can take power and confiscate from whole peoples the fruits of their just uprising.
The British delegation in Helsinki has also reported a number of racist statements made by Yushchenko supporters.
I therefore sincerely hope that my Ukrainian brothers, for whom I feel special affection, elect the President of their choice.
I also hope, however, that that President does not fall into the trap of discriminating against national or religious minorities, and let us hope that no more foreign countries meddle in Ukraineâs internal affairs.
I am a Member of the Independence and Democracy Group, so I say long live independent and democratic Ukraine!
Â Â  .Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, the colour orange so many of us are wearing today and so many of us in this House are carrying is the colour of freedom.
In the same vein, I believe the events I witnessed during my ten-day stay in Ukraine give me the right to say that at present the capital of Europe is not in Brussels or in Strasbourg, but in Kiev, as it is in Kiev that millions of our Ukrainian brothers are fighting for the most basic of European values.
I am proud and moved today to see so many Members of this House, on both the Left and the Right, uniting to defend basic European values such as freedom and democracy.
I should like to add that the fact that the colour orange can be seen today on both the Left and the Right does not mean that we support only one candidate, or that we are interfering in Ukraineâs domestic affairs.
We do not wish to interfere in the electoral process under way in Ukraine.
We do, however, want to make it quite clear that if we are to be proud of this European Union and of this European Parliament of ours, there can be no question of condoning electoral fraud or of allowing force, violence and lies to deprive the Ukrainian people of their freedom and of the right to elect their own president.
I am delighted that todayâs statements by the Council and the Commission and Parliamentâs motion for a resolution, despite being a compromise, will be a clear sign that irrespective of the political differences that divide us, Europeans are sending out the unequivocal message that Europeâs goal is freedom and democracy in Ukraine.
I should also like to add that statements that have unfortunately been repeated in this House, to the effect that PresidentÂ Yushchenkoâs supporters included chauvinists or nationalists, are lies and loathsome provocation, and it is a shame that Members of this House are prepared to be party to such provocation.
I spent ten days on the streets of Kiev and stood among crowds of people fighting for freedom, and not once did I hear a single person insulting Russians, Poles or Jews.
I should like to tell the Members of this House who are concerned about anti-Semitism in Ukraine that they should turn their attention to anti-Semitism in Poland, where it is much more widespread.
I should also like to add that tomorrowâs vote will provide us with an opportunity to send a very clear signal to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters, namely that Europe is opening its doors to them.
Let us hope that it will not be long before we meet in a united Europe.
Â Â  Â Â Â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of Ukraineâs fight for basic European standards, it must be said that today we are all Ukrainians.
We need to demonstrate our solidarity with those who are in the cold fighting for democracy.
We must demonstrate our solidarity today, and also in the days to come, when Ukraine might no longer be so fashionable.
Democracy is something we take for granted, although many of the nations represented here have only enjoyed it for a short while.
This is why we wish to show our understanding and solidarity, and I say this as a representative of a country in which the concept of solidarity has a special meaning.
LechÂ WaÅÄsaâs journey to Ukraine on a mission of solidarity was proof of this.
Is there any way today of reversing what has happened, namely the rigging of elections?
Yes, there is.
This was proven in Serbia four years ago and in Georgia one year ago, when those who allegedly lost the elections were ultimately victorious and came to power.
Today we stand shoulder to shoulder with the EUâs closest neighbour.
Yet we should admit our own mistakes, as the European Union is also to blame for what has happened, given that it failed to provide Ukraine with a clear signal this year that we are expecting it and that we trust it will meet the required standards.
Before the first round of the elections, Europe failed to tell PresidentÂ Kuchma that we were watching his actions closely.
After the irregularities of the first round Europe thumped the table, but failed to utter even a murmur of protest.
We should not forget that a number of nations are paying close attention to the EUâs relations with Ukraine, and that in future years these nations will provide us and themselves with an answer to the question of whether they want democracy and civil freedoms.
Finally, I should like to refer to a Polish saying that suggests: âif you donât know how to behave, be on your best behaviour,â and commend it to the Commission and Council representatives who have experienced major problems this year in adopting a position on Ukraine.
MrÂ President, I should like to say that I am proud to be a Member of the European Parliament, which is redeeming Europeâs honour today through its position on Ukraine.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Presidency of the Council and in particular the Commissioner for the clarity with which they have spoken and with which they have made it clear that fraudulently conducted elections can neither be recognised nor declared to be valid.
Ever since 1990, we have seen a change in Europe, with the peoples of Europe possessing the right to determine their own destiny, and that right must not again be jeopardised through interference from outside or manipulation from within.
That is what this is about.
It is not about one or other candidate; it is about this European Parliament taking the side of democracy and wanting to give the people the chance to say what they want to say.
I believe we have thorough and careful work to do in this area.
At the same time, the message to Ukraine must be that a president who rigs elections in order to legitimise his power has no credibility on the international stage.
That also means that we will have to do some thinking about the neighbourhood programme.
I am grateful to you, Commissioner, for having suspended the action programme, and, in view of the way things are developing in Ukraine, we will have to consider what is to be done about that country.
I would also encourage you to be bolder than your predecessor was.
Over the last two of three years, or so I believe, it was not enough to send Ukraine the message that we took it seriously and regarded it as an important partner in dialogue.
I think there were those here in Brussels and in the national capitals who failed to state their position clearly, and that is why we are in this situation.
That is something we should do better now, if we still have the chance to do so.
It is here, if we have the imagination to do it, that a European Economic Area and much else can be brought into play in order to open up new perspectives.
If we are to send a delegation to Ukraine, it must be made clear that what we are aiming for is the unity of the country, with no violence being used, and the continuation of the dialogue between the various parties, and that we have to ensure that the electoral legislation is amended, and the second round of the election â but only the second round â repeated.
Anything else would be yet another manipulation intended to deny the leader of the opposition the chance of an election victory.
That also means, though, that both sides must summon up the willingness to cooperate with us and with Russia equally; this must not, however, be the product of the desire for revenge, but must be characterised by respect for both sides if it is to help bring reconciliation to the Ukrainian people.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to greet Mr Tarasyuk, who once shared with me the chairmanship of the inter-parliamentary delegation, and whom I know as a champion of reforms in his country.
The reason for the political crisis in Ukraine is the violation of democracy.
The elections did not meet democratic standards.
There was no balanced campaign, the electorate was intimidated and fraud was committed in various ways.
That is unacceptable. It follows that we reject the result of the second round of the presidential elections.
What is central in this issue is the right of the people of Ukraine to make up their own minds in an open and transparent, democratic process.
We side with everyone in the Ukraine who stands up for their democratic rights.
We must, first and foremost, find a way out, a political and peaceful solution to the situation that has arisen.
The EU must deploy all diplomatic means in order to help bring this about.
There is, however, a greater challenge yet, for this political crisis does not stand on its own.
The outcome of the elections will have a great impact on the EUâs relations with Ukraine, either in the positive or negative sense.
The only satisfactory solution to the crisis is that justice be done to democratic principles and to the will of the Ukrainian people.
The outcome of the elections was also rejected by the Ukrainian parliament.
The solution is to re-stage the second round of the elections with the close involvement of international observers, ensuring that this third round takes place under circumstances that are totally different from those under which the first and second rounds were held, a situation in which democratic standards are, of course, respected under the close observation of the international community.
We call on everyone to cooperate in this.
The democratic aspirations of the people of Ukraine are unmistakable and receive our unqualified support.
The peopleâs involvement is evident from the scale of the demonstrations.
I would express my great appreciation and admiration for the protesters in the cities of the Ukraine who argue in favour of the recovery of democracy.
The situation in that country is tense, though, and we would call on both the opposition and the authorities to preserve the non-violent nature of the actions and to prevent the situation from escalating.
If the authorities were to decide on using violence against the peaceful protesters, this will, in our view, immediately impact on relations with the European Union.
Similarly, the division of the country, for which some appear to be pressing, will engender a fresh, much more serious crisis and would not in any way contribute to a satisfactory solution.
Moreover, this ambition gives a false representation of the current state of affairs.
What lies at the heart of the matter is the violation of democratic standards, and not the fact that there is a geographical division in the support for the candidates.
Neither is this about Ukraineâs choice between the European Union and Russia.
On account of its location, economy and history, Ukraine will always need to maintain in-depth relations with both.
Although todayâs debate is not about our relationship with Russia, Russia an important factor in the issue and, unfortunately, adopts a slightly different stance in this respect.
Last week, Mr Balkenende, the Dutch Prime Minister and President of the Council, on behalf of the presidency, expressed very clearly the contrasts between Europe and Russia, and on that we congratulate him.
It is, nevertheless, of major importance that Russia be involved in the way in which the crisis is solved and that the Kremlinâs support be sought for the staging of another second round of the elections.
Europe benefits greatly from stable governments in all its neighbouring countries.
On account of its size and location, Ukraine is a crucial partner.
The European Union must offer scope for the accelerated strengthening of political and economic cooperation.
Needless to say, the EU and Ukraine can only cooperate in a more concrete form if a satisfactory and democratic solution has been found for the present crisis.
In my view, the debate in question should produce a better response to the European aspirations of Ukraine than has been the case to date.
I think that not so much this Parliament, but certainly the Commission and the Council have avoided the response to that question over the past few years and like Mr Brok, I am not that impressed with the EUâs commitment to Ukraine in recent years.
We now have a different Commission, though, and that opens up new opportunities.
Today, we stand united in the reaction to the crisis.
I trust that once the crisis has been resolved, hopefully in the positive sense, we can start taking concerted action along with Ukraine and with better policy than has been adopted so far.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we who have the privilege of living in stable democracies sometimes forget that human rights, democracy and secret elections are not enjoyed by everyone.
Many Members of this House have personal experience of what it means to live under authoritarian regimes and of what it is like to have to fight for democratic rights.
Many of these countries are now members of the European Union, a fact that exemplifies what can happen when people are allowed to choose their own path.
The whole world has been impressed by the democratic national festivities that we now see on the streets and in the squares of Ukraine, in which hundreds of thousands of people are braving the snow and the cold and, in a cheerful, peaceful and well-organised way, are demonstrating in pursuit of their rights.
We are firmly behind the supporters of democracy and, as many have said, this is proved by the fact that we are all wearing orange scarves.
Like the Ukrainian people, we reject this election that has been surrounded by so much cheating, harassment of journalists, lies, buying of votes and other factors that really are out of place in free elections.
We support the demand for a second round of elections under quite different circumstances.
It was pleasing to hear from the Commissioner about the degree to which Europe intends to be a helpful presence in the event of a second set of elections, and it is to be hoped that this commitment will also continue in the same way and with the same vigour after the elections, however they may turn out.
I should like to address the representatives of the Ukrainian Parliament, if they are still here, and let them know that the message from this House to the effect that the Ukrainian people, like all other peoples, are entitled to enjoy freedom and democracy and to shape their own freedom has the support of this House across the political spectrum.
We support you in your struggle.
Good luck!
Â Â  Mr President, I also feel like rejoicing over what has been happening for the last ten days in Kiev and almost throughout Ukraine, over this massive, extremely determined and entirely peaceful demonstration in favour of strict transparency as regards the ballot box and the ballot papers, which have been falsified and manipulated by those currently in power.
I feel that the dynamic at work in Ukraine itself should be brought to the fore. Entire sections of Ukrainian society are collapsing, with journalists, intellectuals, civil society, the authorities and the institutions all claiming their right to free speech.
Against this backdrop, I feel it is useful to highlight the fact that the mobilisation of civil society has enriched and probably increased the effectiveness and coherence of EU action to address this situation.
It is also true that we are starting to dream that the EU can take a similarly coherent and effective stance in other EU-neighbouring countries where the will of civil society is stifled by authoritarian and autocratic leaders.
This is, for that matter, what the EU is doing with the countries in question, on the basis of common values and commitments.
This should be emphasised, as should the extent to which this approach differs from that of Russia and differs from what is already happening in that country, where calumny prevails in all of the State-monopolised media.
We are indeed entitled to feel much more concerned about democracy today in Russia than about the future of democracy in Ukraine.
Â Â  â Mr President, although I have no orange scarf around my neck, I feel myself no less close to Ukraine than you do, for I spent six continuous years of my life in Kiev.
The correct result of these elections must be put on the table â on that we agree.
No matter how this election may have turned out, though, the main thing it shows is that Ukraine is deeply divided â territorially, politically and ethnically.
This division is to a substantial degree the result of international interference going back long before this election and very much to the detriment of the Ukrainian people.
Mr Putin gave his favoured candidate massive backing and wasted no time in congratulating him on his victory.
In his own country, the Russian president is doing away with elections for the heads of the Russian regions, some of which are no smaller than the whole of Ukraine.
President Bush is concerned and criticises the way the election was conducted, seemingly having forgotten the grave doubts about the propriety of his first election and the numerous complaints about his second.
Innumerable advisors have given logistical support to the opposition in Ukraine.
For months, this election has been dressed up as a choice of direction â with Russia or with Europe, as if Russia were not itself part of Europe to a substantial degree.
Ukraine, however, cannot throw itself into the arms of one single ally.
If it wants to resolve its serious economic and social problems, the right thing for it must be a good relationship with all its neighbours, both new and old, and this it must be allowed to build up under whichever President, without empty promises, admonitory finger-wagging or unconcealed arm-twisting.
The people of Ukraine must take their decisions democratically and independently, and they will.
Â Â  Mr President, that Kiev is more European than Ankara is proved beyond reasonable doubt by what has happened over the past ten days in Ukraine, a country in which people stand up valiantly for the essential value of their ballot papers, and also one that has taught all European institutions a lesson about the true meaning of a European community of values.
Shoulder to shoulder with the United States of America, the European Union should aspire to review in the short term the outrageous electoral deception of the in Ukraine.
All credit to the Dutch Presidency, incidentally, for its efforts to date and also for the stance adopted by our new Commissioner.
In the long term, the Union must also draw conclusions from the current dramatic situation in Kiev.
Why should we not give Ukraine the prospect of membership when we would do the same for Turkey, which is â let us face it â a non-European country?
That appears to me to be an untenable, and in any event harmful, position.
The doom scenarios about the collapse of, or even a civil war in, Ukraine have been concocted by the actual losers of the ballot both inside and outside Ukraine.
Would President Putin actually put Russiaâs relationship with the United States and the European Union on the line for a Ukrainian President who has no credibility either inside or outside Ukraine?
That appears too irrational to be true.
Precisely a week ago, a Ukrainian author urged that âmore urgently than ever, we need the moral and political support of the democracies in the world, because if we gamble away the democratic Ukraine today, you can forget about your self-congratulatory and conflict-free Europe as soon as tomorrowâ.
As close neighbours, we should be quite clear about this.
Â Â  . The events following the parliamentary elections in Ukraine are a convincing demonstration to the democratic world that the Ukrainian people reject the direction taken by many states of the former Soviet Union, where authoritarian or semi-authoritarian regimes have imposed themselves.
The Ukrainian people reject the Belarussian model, which is a source of shame for Europe, and also the variant of democracy that is subservient to the President of Russia.
Whatever the outcome of the electoral crisis may be, Ukraine will never be the same again.
The demand by a wide section of society for its rights is mobilising society to take action not only in respect of the stolen election results, but also against corruption and oligarchical capitalism, and is forging a clear understanding of the choice for a democratic future for Ukraine.
Following an invitation from the Ukrainian Parliament, I was able to follow the course of the Ukrainian presidential elections in person.
I unequivocally agree with the conclusion reached by the international observers that the elections were fraudulent.
The ruling politico-economic elite is preventing the Ukrainian people from democratically electing their president.
The disinformation about the opposition candidate that poured out of the government-controlled mass media chimed exactly with the assessments broadcast by the mass media under the control of the President of Russia.
In the eastern part of Ukraine, it was precisely the Russian media that played a decisive role in turning society there against the opposition.
Russia has invested considerable resources into the campaign of the Ukrainian Governmentâs candidate. This included the direct intervention of the President of Russia himself.
This clearly shows Russiaâs fear that its policy in the region is under threat.
The victory of democracy in Ukraine would threaten the Russian-sponsored stability in Belarus and the amnesia regarding Moldova.
The victory of democracy in Ukraine would mobilise democratic forces in Russia itself.
Ukrainian society has come to the defence of its decision.
Now it is the turn of the democratic world â the European Union first of all.
The European Union must make it clearly understood that those who fail to observe democratic principles and fail to abide by the law cannot be partners of the European Union.
The same restrictions must apply to them as have been introduced against Belarus.
Ukraine is a European country, and the people on the streets of Ukraine have proved that an absolute majority of them have chosen democracy and the rule of law.
Those are concepts that unite the Member States of the European Union.
Ukraine has become a focus of world attention.
It must become a focus of the European Unionâs attention.
Ukraine must be given the opportunity of joining the European Union.
Starting to open up such an opportunity would be an enormously stabilising influence on the democratic process in Ukraine.
Â Â  â Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Italian Socialist Party.
The peaceful orange revolution currently under way in Kiev has a great deal in common with the ârose revolutionâ which brought President Saakashvili to power in Georgia exactly one year ago.
He was then democratically elected by a huge majority in January 2004.
Mr Saakashvili, whom I was able to meet in Tbilisi a few days ago, is leading Georgia towards a path of renewal, growth and development, within a healthy, pluralist context of democracy.
Back in November 2003, however, the peopleâs verdict had been overturned through the vote-rigging arranged by ex-President Eduard Shevardnadze, who was then driven out by a popular uprising, which, apart from anything else, took place without bloodshed.
Today the story is being repeated and, as all the international observers, including those from Europe, have confirmed, the Ukrainian peopleâs decision has been blatantly altered and misrepresented through obvious, flagrant irregularities.
Today the Ukrainian Parliament, the Rada, has passed a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Yanukovich.
Although this action in itself is not binding from a legal point of view, it does have a great intrinsic symbolic and political value and confirms the success of the popular pressure that has been exerted in recent days.
We must not allow Europe to remain deaf and dumb to all this.
Let Europe make its voice heard in that country, which lies so close to our borders, so that the tensions there do not degenerate into civil war or an escalation of violence, and so that all those young people can at last be heard.
The young citizens who courageously and proudly wave orange flags or Georgian flags demand and hope for a future of peace, justice, the rule of law, democracy and freedom â a new, different page of history.
Let us here in Parliament raise a cry of solidarity with the demonstrators in Kiev: today we are all Ukrainians.
Â Â  Mr President, this House should be proud that last week its MEPs were amongst the first foreigners to address the assembled crowds in Independence Square in downtown Kiev.
I was personally deeply moved by the faith of the young Ukrainians in that square in a free, democratic and European-value Ukraine in the future, and their belief that justice, through people power, will ultimately triumph.
There can be no doubt that they were cheated of their election result and the choice of a president of their own desire, but we in the western world cannot be neutral over a large European country struggling between a future as a potential EU and NATO Member State â a democratic one at that â and a powerful clique of corrupt, post-Soviet, anti-democratic authoritarians willing to steal the election, through fraud if necessary, under the tutelage of Moscow.
I welcome todayâs vote of no confidence by the Parliament of Ukraine, which has distinguished itself as the only body that is generally reflecting the views of the people.
I call on Prime Minister Yanukovich and his government, who unlawfully used the stateâs resources to further their campaign, to resign forthwith and on MrÂ Yanukovich to fight the election as a private citizen, to ensure free, fair and transparent elections on a level playing field.
The recent calls by eastern apparatchiks to split Ukraine in half is highly cynical in a country which in 1991 voted overwhelmingly for a unitary state.
This agenda is designed to produce immunity from criminal prosecution for electoral and other frauds, as well as to ensure that the Donetsk oligarchs, who have accumulated massive wealth which funded Mr Yanukovichâs campaign, are not open to challenge or scrutiny and that they are not subject to confiscation of some of the dodgy privatisations that have occurred in Ukraine in the last couple of years.
We do not want another Transnistria, 30 times bigger in eastern Europe.
Let us hope for a united, democratic and free Ukraine in the imminent future.
Â Â  Mr President, onFriday, in an interview on Russian television, Mr Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Vladimir Putin's man in charge of relations with the European Union, accused the new Members of the European Parliament and their Member States of interfering in Ukraine, adding that 20 years ago SolidarnoÅÄ was a creation of the West and that now the Poles were doing the same in Kiev.
Leaving aside this repetition of Soviet rhetoric about SolidarnoÅÄ, he does have an important point, which I would like to make here again today.
The new Members feel acutely, both negatively and positively, the course of events in Ukraine today.
Just as the founding Members of the EU recall the experiences that led to the establishment of the Union, so too we recall what was done to us and why for so many decades we could not join the Union.
We recall the sham elections in the three Baltic countries in 1940, when for instance, like Mr Putin's congratulatory call to Mr Yanukovich even before the announcement of preliminary results, Latvia's sham election results were accidentally published the day before they took place.
We recall only too well the rigged elections after the war in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
We have seen this before and we know what comes of it.
But we have seen the other side as well, how tens and hundreds of thousands of people come together peacefully to state their solidarity with democracy.
We saw this with SolidarnoÅÄ in Gdansk and Warsaw and with Charter 77 in Prague; we saw it in the streets of Berlin and we saw it in the singing revolutions of the Baltic countries.
In other words we know what is going on, we have seen it before.
The 75Â million people who became EU citizens this March are experiencing 'dÃ©ja vu'.
Our understanding of these events, our empirical knowledge, must not be dismissed by those who lack the knowledge or understanding of what this means.
Mr Yastrzhembsky, but I fear also some in the West, would paint the new Members' direct experience and knowledge as something that gets in the way of relations with Russia or that threatens illusions about what is going on in Ukraine.
We recall those in the West who said we should be careful with SolidarnoÅÄ, it might upset Brezhnev.
We recall Western politicians who said the Baltic countries should not seek independence lest it threaten Mikhail Gorbachev.
I am not here to take sides in a political contest between candidates and parties in Ukraine, but I do take a stand against manipulation of elections.
We cannot say no to the Ukrainians because we are afraid of losing investments or markets in Russia.
Democrats always try to find the Aristotelian golden mean, even in politics, but there is no middle ground between the truth and a lie, between democracy and its all too many opponents.
Â Â  Â Â Â I should like to thank both the European Commission and the Dutch Presidency for their decisive actions over the past week.
I shall be honest and admit that this was not what I expected.
After seeing how rapidly the European Union took immediate action to send JavierÂ Solana, AleksanderÂ KwaÅniewski and PresidentÂ Adamkus to Ukraine three days after the rigged elections, I felt for the first time that accession to the European Union had been worthwhile, and that we are now part of a group able to stand up for a defenceless nation that is struggling to achieve independence and freedom.
I should like to express my heartfelt thanks for this.
Up until now, such a rapid reaction could only be expected from the United States, or at least that was the case in our country, Poland.
I am delighted that this time the European Union was able to act more swiftly and effectively.
The European Union is now acting as mediator in the conflict in Ukraine.
As an observer of the presidential elections in Ukraine, I should like to share an observation with this House.
The crowd of people on Independence Square last Saturday numbered one million.
This number included many Poles, as the Polish people remember the explosive emergence of the Solidarity movement in 1980, and realise that history is currently repeating in Ukraine.
There are a great many Georgians and Georgian flags on Independence Square, as Georgians are aware that recent events in their own country are being re-enacted in Ukraine.
Yet there are also huge numbers of other young people who have travelled to Independence Square, Russian and Belarussian students, for example, The latter are anxious to experience in Kiev, albeit briefly, the freedom denied them in their own countries.
I am convinced that if the European Union supports the emerging democracy and civil society in Ukraine, it will in so doing ensure that democratic principles prevail in the whole of the East and in the whole of the area to the east of Ukraine and to the east of the European Union.
This is not about the division of spheres of influence. It is about democratic principles, which, after all, we would all like to be enforced to the same degree throughout geographical Europe.
In view of the fact that I will travel to Kiev tomorrow as part of a delegation, I should like to call on this House to adopt the amendment I shall now read out, tabled by myself and MrÂ Geremek.
This amendment calls on the Ukrainian Government to refrain from exerting any pressure on the media, and in particular on the public media, in order to ensure that the Ukrainian people are provided with objective and impartial information on the candidates and the situation in their country.
Â Â  â Mr President, as a Lithuanian as well as a representative of the Lithuanian nation, whose president, together with the Polish President Mr KwaÅniewski and Mr Solana, is today in Kiev, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that events in Ukraine and the success of the peaceful revolution will have important consequences not only for Ukraine, its nation and not only for the further development of the European Union, but also for the nearest of Ukraineâs neighbours â Belarus.
It is, therefore, very important for everyone now to show solidarity.
Our support for democracy today in Ukraine also sends out a signal to the dictator of Belarus.
I am sure that the close attention and hope with which the Belarus nation is observing the development of events in Ukraine is matched by attention and fear in the gaze of Mr Lukashenko.
Therefore, let Ukraineâs success today also be the prelude to success for democracy tomorrow in Belarus.
Thank you for you attention.
Â Â  Â Â Â It is very difficult to say anything original before this House today.
Yet this is a very good day for the European Parliament, as we are expressing our opinions on issues of the utmost importance to the European Union.
We are discussing our largest neighbour, which has a border of 700Â km with the European Union.
The EUâs 25Â Member States are experiencing problems relating to social apathy, yet there is a country in Europe in which electoral turnout is almost 80%.
In that same country, several hundred thousand people have been standing in the cold for ten days in many towns, demanding the right to free and honest elections.
After ten days, the people of Ukraine are now becoming impatient, and there can be no doubt that they are also exhausted.
Now it is up to us, the international community, to take the initiative by bringing pressure to bear on those in power and by calling for fair elections.
We should adopt a clear stance on this issue.
In my opinion, four key principles must be upheld.
The first is that those in power should avoid any kind of solution by force.
The second is that Ukraineâs territorial integrity should be maintained.
The third is that the second round of elections should be held again, with OSCE monitoring and an electoral law preventing widespread irregularities such as voting away from oneâs place of residence.
Fourthly, the candidates should have equal access to the media.
We appear to have already forgotten that this was our key principle even before the first round of elections.
There are also things we must demand of ourselves.
For example, observers are needed, and in far greater numbers than previously.
A thousand observers from the 25Â EU Member States, the European Commission and the European Parliament are needed for the next round of elections.
I ask for this figure to be agreed on, for the costs to be shared and for an appropriate number of observers to be sent.
This will prove that we are genuinely opening up to Ukraine.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am grateful to the Council for reminding us that the European Union does not have a candidate in the Ukrainian elections, that our responsibility is undoubtedly to contribute to the holding of democratic elections, and that we must press for a peaceful, political solution to the institutional conflict in Ukraine.
We call for the ballot to be repeated and express our solidarity with all Ukrainians, with the whole Ukrainian people.
We are not here to support either MrÂ Yushchenko or Mr Yanukovich, who have both, moreover, been heads of the Ukrainian Government; nor are we here to push for the partitioning of Ukraine between the East and the West, but to guarantee the territorial integrity of the country.
I find this contrast between the good guys and the bad guys rather nauseating.
Who are we to say that the democratic good guys are the Kiev students and the bad guys are the miners coming to protest in Kiev?
We need to make a non-simplistic interpretation of what is happening in Ukraine.
Unfortunately, Ukraine is already a geographically divided country, in which the Russian population makes up 33% of the total population.
In view of these figures â which are similar to those we find in Iraq, where the Sunni population makes up 33% of the total Iraqi population â we need to find a political solution that seeks to hold the two parts together and allows the president who is to be elected â and we want to see him elected in a democratic election â to be president of the whole country.
The danger now is not just that the country may split, Mr President, but that there may be civil war.
I have the feeling that the spirit of Yalta is perilously alive in this Parliament and that the only objective is to drag all or part of Ukraine into the western sphere of influence.
I do not agree with that.
The strength and the responsibility of the European Union is not to fight for the causes of the West but to fight for the cause of democracy and to play a part in helping the President of Ukraine to be truly the president of the whole Ukrainian people.
Â Â  â The joint resolution by the groups is clear and firm.
The wishes of the Ukrainian nations must be implemented in accordance with the principles of democracy.
I would also like to highlight the importance of those sections of the resolution that support Ukrainian unity and integrity.
Ukraine is in many respects divided, but splitting the country up into two states would be harmful and dangerous.
It would, if anything, cause new problems rather than solve older ones.
Ukraine should be given the opportunity for genuine independence.
It must have a right to good relations and cooperation both with the European Union and Russia.
The best situation would be one where we were able to build a multilateral partnership in which the EU, Russia and Ukraine were on an equal footing.
I am not happy with section 10 of the resolution.
In my opinion we should state clearly that Ukraine, as a European country, has the right of accession to the European Union as long as it meets the conditions of membership.
The new Neighbour Policy for Europe should not be seen as an alternative to membership, but a tool to help our European neighbours along the path to membership of the EU.
Now that Turkey has in principle been accepted as a member, the door must also be left open for Ukraine, which is a bona fideEuropean country.
Â Â  Mr President, I am encouraged by the clear conclusions drawn by both the Council and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
I have been the rapporteur for Ukraine on behalf of the Council of Europe.
What is happening today is nothing new: the same rigging of elections, curbing of the press, depriving people of their rights took place then.
It is a pity that continual reports about shortcomings in establishing the rule of law and transparent society have not been taken at their face value in the West.
For many years hopes were cherished that in due time and with patience all problems would be overcome.
The opposite has happened: policies of accommodation and attempts to keep post-Communist rulers as good allies at the cost of turning a blind eye to gross violations of democratic rules have brought about a dramatic worsening of the situation.
The EU also has to share responsibility for not reacting in time and for not clearly taking the side of genuinely democratic forces.
Instead, the Ukrainian people have given us a lesson.
Now there is not a minute to lose.
Some still argue for declarations in support of democracy but say let us be prudent and not offend anybody, let us not aggravate the situation further by taking sides.
It is right that we should not take the side of a particular candidate â that is the exclusive right of the Ukrainian people.
However, look around this Chamber and you can see that we have taken sides â look at the orange colours.
It is our duty.
It is also our duty to adopt very soon the important resolution we have prepared.
Â Â  Mr President, we cannot underestimate the sensitivity of the situation.
The stakes remain very high at a national and an international level.
What is the message that we should send to the Ukrainians, whether they support one candidate or the other?
We should send the message that we stand for democratic values, territorial integrity, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the impartiality of the courts, the rule of law, peaceful solutions, just solutions.
But what is the message that we are receiving from the Ukrainians?
We are receiving the message that the aspirations of a people may be stalled.
Obstacles may be placed in the path of democracy but ultimately justice will prevail.
What is the EUâs message to the international community?
I conclude by saying that we are relevant, we can speak with one voice.
We cannot compromise where democracy is concerned.
Â Â  â Mr President, I will be going against the current because I do not believe that it is just a revolution that is happening in Ukraine: what is also taking place is the last stage in the demolition of Russia, because Russia was born in Kiev.
In Ukraine, just as in Russia, oligarchic cliques have seized power and produced a criminal state with the blessing of the International Monetary Fund.
What is happening in Moscow is not to anyoneâs liking, but hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in the West to pull Georgia, Belarus and Ukraine away from Russian influence.
That is the truth, and the ideals of freedom and democracy have little to do with it: 49Â million Ukrainians are the victims of this situation.
Victor Yushchenko and Yulia Timoshenko are no more champions of democracy than Victor Yanukovich: both are in fact the children of Leonid Kuchma.
It is obvious that Vladimir Putinâs Russia wants to reassemble a few pieces of greater Russia, and that is no less legitimate than wanting to pull Ukraine into the West.
The question is whether it happens with or against the will of the peoples concerned.
It will be very difficult to keep all Ukrainians in a new Galicia and it may end in bloodshed.
Mr Yanukovich has proposed a compromise which at least buys some time to prevent a clash.
Mr Yushchenko has rejected it.
Clearly, Mr Putinâs strategic design will be in tatters without Ukraine and, clearly, Mr Putin will not give up easily.
If anyone is perhaps thinking of forcing him to do so, they should think of the consequences, which would be a serious blow to the future of European-Russian relations.
I do not believe Europe should venture along that path.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following on from Mr Battilocchioâs evocation of the ârose revolutionâ in Georgia a year ago, let me say that visitors to Tbilisi will find in the cabinet chamber, on the streets and in the Presidentâs office, the European flag hanging alongside its Georgian counterpart, as if the country were a Member State of the European Union, and, if you stand on Freedom Square in Kiev, you will see there the Georgian flag and the European flag, for all these countries aspire to make their way to Europe.
Not all of our neighbours, though, can accede to the European Union.
As early as when we take our decision in December, we will have to consider the European Unionâs capacity for accepting new members, and so we need to come to some clearer conclusions about our European neighbourhood policy, and that very soon.
In her hearing before the committee, the Commissioner was pretty clear about how that was one of her priorities.
If that is the case, though, if there is the expectation of coming to Europe, and if we are ready for it, then our response over the last few weeks was inadequate.
That the High Representative was willing to go to Kiev only when this House insisted on it was a mistake on his part.
He should have been there before the elections, showing that Europe has an interest in fair elections, and if it is indeed the case â as our fellow-Members tell us â that the Commission had to be asked whether it might not send a larger delegation, whether it was not willing to be more involved in these elections, then that too revealed an oversight, and one that is now a source of great pain to us.
Whilst we understand that massive staffs, lots of money and large numbers of personnel are going into the preparations for the Palestinian elections on 9 January, we could have shown the same commitment to one of our immediate neighbours, with its 50 million inhabitants, which wants to be part of Europe.
I therefore think that our European neighbourhood policy, with the report that we will be starting to consider in a few weeksâ time, needs to have new life breathed into it.
Participation in the internal market, participation in European programmes â we need to be sending out signals now about the many things we can offer.
This is not about thinking in terms of spheres of influence, nor is it anti-Russian, for a democratic Ukraine too will need to maintain good relations with Russia, and we Europeans need to support it in this.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is the self-evident responsibility of every progressive citizen to defend democratic freedoms in Ukraine without foreign interference.
It is the obligation of the European Union to remain constant on questions of principle and not to take a selective approach, as certain parties have hastened to do.
The sole objective must be the contribution of the European Union to a peaceful and democratic solution, by repeating the second round of the presidential elections under conditions of complete freedom, so that Ukraine can get out of the political cul-de-sac and so as to avoid any danger of destabilisation, which would have dramatic consequences for security and peace in Europe.
Our message must also be clear to Russia, concerning the avoidance of any action which would complicate the situation.
For the European Union, Ukraine cannot be batted back and forth between conflicting interests.
It would certainly be a strategic error if the European Union were to be trapped in the dilemma between Europe and Russia.
At this crucial time, the European Union must talk to all the political forces in Ukraine and win the confidence of all the Ukrainian people, not line up behind one side or the other.
Our collective stand must be linked to a guarantee of the democratic expression of the people and defence of the independence, unity and territorial integrity of the country.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, many in this Chamber will have heard more than once the rhetorical question about the extent of the borders of Europe.
After the recent events in Ukraine it has become evident that Europe is definitely larger than many people had previously believed it to be.
Despite the harsh eastern winter, the spirit of European democracy is once again decisively on the march.
The determination of the demonstrators in Kiev is not an attempt to protect the opposition leader, MrÂ Yushchenko, but to defend the territorial integrity of Ukraine and to demonstrate their support for the rule of law and a legal state.
I also support a united Ukraine, a country that is both our partner and a powerful neighbour.
It was not simply a question of the voters deciding between the two candidates.
It was, above all, a vote against one of the candidates.
They voted against the prime minister, Mr Yanukovich, who, in the eyes of many, represents the oligarchy and a corrupt state.
It was and still is an uprising of the humiliated and the outraged. An uprising in the name of human pride and dignity.
It is an uprising in the name of basic human rights and this is why the men and women of Ukraine deserve not just our support and our solidarity, but our help and our action.
This resistance by people who have nothing to lose represents a last hope for them just as it does for us.
For us it represents, above all, a responsibility to put our European institutions in order.
I congratulate the Commissioner, and I would like to make one other point.
Ukraine has contributed greatly to democracy and peace.
She has given up her nuclear weapons, which was an enormous contribution.
Now she deserves to be rewarded.
Â Â  Â Â Â Judging by the number of orange scarves in this Chamber, the Orange Revolution has also reached the European Parliament.
This should come as no surprise, as the virus of freedom and democracy is extremely contagious and fast-spreading.
My own country, Poland, and other Central European countries provide abundant proof of this.
They became infected with the disease of democracy and freedom many years ago.
Today the impossible is becoming possible in Ukraine, and the Ukrainian people are awakening from their lethargy.
Ukrainians are demanding their rights.
They no longer wish to be cheated, and they wish to make their own decisions.
Before our very eyes, the Ukrainian people are facing one of their most difficult tests, a test of their civil responsibility.
Yet today we too are faced with a test, namely a test of our solidarity.
What must we do to come through with flying colours?
Firstly, we must speak clearly and plainly about values, and about the values that connect us to the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the streets of Kiev.
We should speak in the very language used in the motion for a resolution.
Secondly, we should dispel myths, including those referred to by MrÂ Fava, among others.
Ukraine is not divided geographically, although there are many today who wish this were the case.
Ukraine is divided into those who have shed the yoke of fear and those who have not yet managed to do so.
The first should be given political support, and the second should be guaranteed a place in the new Ukraine.
Thirdly, the European Union must continue to participate in the political dialogue taking place in Ukraine, as without our international involvement, there is a threat that Ukraine will be faced with the worst possible scenario, namely chaos and fratricidal warfare.
This is the most important challenge facing us today.
In order to prevent such a disaster, the European Parliament should adopt the motion for a resolution by acclamation and without amendment, and it should be taken to Kiev by the European Parliamentâs mission.
The Council should support the continuing presence of the High Representative in Kiev, and outline its vision of a European future for Ukraine at the summit in December.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud of our Parliament.
We have woken up to our responsibility.
This is now a question of law, justice and freedom, because Ukraine and the EU share a common future.
The spread of democracy is our greatest challenge.
It is our mission.
One day mankindâs weapons should all be trained in the same direction.
It will be a long journey, but it is a morally right and just one.
At present this is not just about Ukraine: this is also about developments in Russia, which has, quite unexpectedly, got mixed up in the Ukrainian elections.
Russiaâs future is closely connected with ours.
At present, Moscow is rapidly moving in the wrong direction and away from democracy.
If we can steer Ukraineâs development in the right direction, that will also help Moscow make the turn in the right direction itself.
We cannot all have different notions about what democracy is.
They are universal.
We cannot allow Europe and Russia to head off in different directions: Russia must make the turn.
On this point we have to remain adamant.
The United States of America and the European Union need to work closely together, as there are such huge issues involved here.
I am proud of the Ukrainian democrats.
It now remains to be seen whether they will be proud of us for staying adamant about this through to the end.
This is a watershed in the development of Ukraine, but also for the EU.
It is a historic moment.
On one side of the watershed the murky waters of a totalitarian regime flow towards the past, where only the oligarchies and the present administration reap the benefits.
On the other side, pure waters, the waters of democracy, flow towards tomorrow, one where the Ukrainian nation can draw strength for a better future.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, it is pleasant to hear that in this Chamber today we are reasonably united.
Not only are various political tendencies united, but so are the Council and Commission.
However, I should like to draw your attention to certain truths which we should take into account.
There is a certain paradox, that often enough we see what is happening far away from us better than what is happening next door.
To be quite frank, I was surprised that even before the first round of the elections in Ukraine we were already receiving very many signals that there were violations and that the opposition candidate was not being given the opportunity to campaign openly.
We did not react, and it was only when these flagrant injustices manifested themselves in the second round that we all bestirred ourselves.
That too is good.
The policy of the European Union has never been and never will be aggressive, but the European Union is not and cannot be a mere talking shop that dispenses advice.
The European Union is a sufficiently strict and powerful political union and that is why the European Union must, at all levels â Council, Commission and Parliament â demonstrate a strict and determined political will.
That is why the European Union cannot merely point out the fraud involved in the Ukrainian elections.
We cannot pretend that we do not see what forces lie behind the falsification of the Ukrainian elections.
Those forces understand only determined and strong policies and actions.
Otherwise, we shall have a situation where on one half of the field a game of tennis is being played but on the other a game of rugby.
I do not mean here simply the European Union and Russia, the West and the East.
I am very familiar with Russia, and I know that there are a great many democratic and intelligent people there.
Yet the leading tendency is antidemocratic and thirsting for revenge.
We must therefore definitely support democracy in Ukraine, analyse the situation that has come about and forecast the future.
That is why I agree with my colleague Elmar Brok, that the Council and the Commission must also react very speedily and very determinedly.
Â Â  MrÂ President, what we are now seeing in Eastern Europe is a second wave in the fight for democracy.
The same applies as applied fifteen years ago, and the events will be as decisive for Europe and for the way Europe will look in ten to fifteen yearsâ time, and subsequently, as were the events of 15 years ago.
It is crucially important that we see the serious dimension to the crisis that is playing itself out, in which the old dictatorship is trying to rob the people of its new democracy.
We must be on our guard against a repetition of developments that might lead to a new Balkans.
The events pose a number of important questions, especially â as MrÂ Vatanen pointed out â concerning how we go on to view Russiaâs own development towards democracy, which is a matter requiring consistency and clarity.
The events pose questions as to how we ourselves are to have respect for our own common foreign and security policy, and this is a crucial test in terms of how we are able to take action.
I believe it important for us to act not only on the basis of how serious present events are but also with a view to preventing what, in the worst case, may happen tomorrow and in the months to come and which is something that makes the situation extremely serious and that calls for immediate action.
An unambiguous message to Russia and the Ukrainian leadership is required.
Our only concerns should be for the Ukrainian people and for democracy.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and our guests from Ukraine, who must be listening attentively to this debate.
Without any more fear of contradiction, we can state that the abuses that took place during the Ukrainian elections were such that the results are unacceptable.
Even Prime Minster Yanukovich himself has asked for the election results to be invalidated, particularly as there was some confusion in the western parts of the country.
The leader of the opposition, MrÂ Yushchenko, and international observers, on the other hand, discovered that there was some confusion in eastern parts.
Both, however, agree that the elections were not fair, something that everyone acknowledges.
The first countries to approve the rigged election results, which include Russia, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Belarus, should be the first to take a look in the mirror.
I would like to thank the Ukrainian opposition forces for calmly and patiently managing to make the voice of democracy heard in difficult circumstances.
The EU should adopt a calm but determined stance on the situation in Ukraine.
Our task is to promote democracy and human rights.
This we have done in the case of Ukraine.
Much will be decided in these elections.
The elections will decide whether Ukraine is to become a large version of Poland, a western European country with an open attitude towards democracy, or a small version of Russia, which looks to the east and an authoritarian, quasi-democracy.
I hope that we in the EU agree which would be preferable.
We will nevertheless respect the Ukrainian peopleâs right of self-determination.
As long as the second round of elections is organised democratically and fairly, we have to respect the outcome, whether it accords with our personal opinions or not.
If what I personally hope for were to happen and Yushchenko won, the losing party, that is, Yanukovichâs supporters, would not just fade into the background.
We have to be able to work closely with them too.
The Ukrainian nation is already a very much divided one, and we should not add to or aggravate this division and the policies it relies on.
We need to secure a peaceful solution to enable all the Ukrainian people to continue building their society as a united Ukraine based on democracy, human rights, and the EUâs common principles of the rule of law.
Â Â  . May I start by expressing my thanks for the congratulations to the Dutch Presidency and, more importantly, my appreciation for the EUâs major involvement in its important neighbouring country, Ukraine, which was evident from all the speeches that have been made.
I am delighted that this is also apparent from the fact that your Parliament is sending a delegation to Ukraine this evening.
I think that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and others have made it abundantly clear what part â in many ways an important one â the European Union has played in the developments in Ukraine.
Since a few somewhat more critical questions have been raised and comments made, it may be useful to point out that Europe was, of course, in Ukraine before the first round, and had given signals and sent warnings, for example in connection with access to the media during the preparations for the elections.
As you know, and I am saying this because there may have been some confusion in this matter, it was after the first round that we took steps, issued our statements and developed our activities.
I share the view of a number of Members of this House â first expressed by Mr Schulz, but later by MrsÂ Staniszewska â that this is also a moment to be proud of what the European Union is doing, of the way we are trying to get the democratic model to work outside of Europe.
As Mr Saryusz-Wolski, Mr Schulz, Mr Geremek, Mr Kaminski and many others have already stated, it is true that there is broad agreement in your House about what the position is and should be, and that there is also broad agreement with the Commission and the Council.
Understandably, reference has also been made to the historical significance of what is going on here.
Similarities were drawn with, among others, Poland in 1980 and the Commissioner mentioned 1989 in many other former Eastern European countries.
Rarely have I heard the Council, the Commission and Parliament speak with one voice to such an extent, because we refuse to accept the results which the central election committee has announced.
We demand a new second round for the elections.
Mr Saryusz-Wolski, Mr Brok and others did not pull their punches in that respect.
We have absolute agreement on this.
We all want free, fair and transparent elections, and a peaceful solution which also guarantees Ukraineâs territorial integrity.
With regard to the timing of the new second round of elections, to which reference is made in the resolution, both parties will first need to embark on further consultations.
On the one hand, a bit of time is needed to gain an insight into the correct circumstances, for example in relation to provisions to enable sufficient observers to visit that country.
On the other hand, I very much understand the concern that the whole process is being dragged out or delaying tactics are being applied.
We should not accept this, because everyone, the people of Ukraine in particular, is entitled to have a new President elected in a free and fair manner as soon as possible.
It is understandable that the size of the observation mission should also attract comment.
Allow me, further to a number of remarks on your part, to say that I too hope that the Commission will take initiatives, so that we will have an extensive European Union delegation in that country, obviously in tandem with the OSCE and the Council of Europe, to ensure that the elections will be truly free, transparent and fair.
Some of you have, of course, mentioned Russia as the other important partner in these developments, and in that connection I am pleased to inform you that we as presidency will, of course, maintain the very close contacts with Russia and that Mr Balkenende, in his capacity as President of the European Council, phoned Mr Putin again today and that both have concluded on a positive note that there is only one way forward, namely the peaceful solution within the legal framework by means of dialogue.
Needless to say, and I am addressing Mr Wiersma and others when I say this, many improvements are needed for those forthcoming elections.
I should like to flag one in the first stage in the run-up to new second elections there, namely access to the media for all parties, as we indicated prior to the first round.
That should mean that the media should show more examples which herald a bright future under the motto âthe future is bright, the future is orangeâ.
This time round, orange is not the colour of the Dutch Presidency, because as you know orange is the Dutch national colour.
Neither is orange the colour for a certain candidate, as has been remarked by a number of you, but is, as Mr Geremek and other have stated, a colour symbolising solidarity with all Ukrainians who demand free and fair elections.
Â Â  . Mr President, at my hearings, I expressed the hope that Europe would increasingly speak with one voice, and I am very glad to find us going in that direction the first time I address this House.
Rarely can there have been such agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and I hope that is something we can achieve more often.
My hope is that, if we speak with one voice, this will also really result in positive action of the kind we have just described and that I do not need to repeat now.
I did of course listen carefully to your observations, some of which were rather critical, and I would like to consider some of them.
Firstly, many of you said that the European Commission or the European Union itself had shown too much of a hands-off attitude when it came, for example, to the observation of elections.
To that I would like to say that I was myself President of the OSCE in 2000; we have a major organisation in Europe, which puts a great deal of effort into observing elections.
On the ground, there is also ODIHR, which is a very important institution, and I believe that the OSCE should work together with ODIHR and the European Union on a basis of complementarity.
In this case, though, it was the OSCE that made these elections its own particular concern.
Nevertheless, I will readily respond to your appeals and have already done some preparatory research.
We are more than willing to get involved; we will see how much we can do, and, as I have said, my rapid reaction mechanism contains a number of things, similar to those we used in Georgia, that I can now tell you about.
There is a whole range of things that we have been doing for two years already, including projects in support of training, for example the training of local election observers, along with projects for the information of voters and for training the members of local electoral commissions and journalists, and projects relating to the reporting of elections or helping to reform legislation on elections and the media.
As you can see, we have been far from inactive, but I do believe that the various institutions in which we all work should complement each other in the work they do.
My second point is that it has been said time and time again that Europe did not go far enough and that we too bore some responsibility for Ukraineâs present situation.
That is something I really must repudiate.
In my former capacity as Austriaâs foreign minister, I sought out very close contacts with Ukraine, and I can tell you that the European Unionâs partnership and cooperation agreement, which was negotiated above all by the Commission, has, unfortunately, been insufficiently implemented.
Over and over again, I really did go to a lot of trouble about this and told people that they had to do something themselves.
I believe that the time has now come to put this neighbourhood policy really centre stage in my policy, and that is what I intend to do; it goes without saying that what we do about the action plans in the immediate future depends on how Ukraine itself now reacts.
My plan is to put these things on the table provided that we can really make speed about tackling them.
One of you said that Europe shares a single soul and that shared soul is also present in Ukraine.
Let us all be inspired by that to join together in giving this shared soul wings!
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  â The policy of the ÎU is blatant, unacceptable, provocative intervention in the internal affairs of Ukraine.
The critical situation in which the people find themselves is the result of the restoration of capitalism and subsequent intervention by and competition between the imperialist powers and of the policy followed by the elite in the new imperialist order who have been governing the country over recent years.
The undisguised intervention of the ÎU, with the presence of Mr Solana and the governments of Poland and Latvia, suppresses any concept of national independence and is connected to efforts by the ÎU to safeguard a beneficial playing ground for controlling the region in the tug of war between USA and Russia.
The EU stand that it does not support either candidate is hypocritical in the extreme, when it has turned into Yushchenko's pre-campaign office.
The statements by the US administration on the Ukraine regime are also provocative when, exactly one year ago, it was praising it on its positive stand on the war against Iraq.
The ÎU, the USA and Russia are interested in securing their interests in Ukraine and are exploiting the dissatisfaction being expressed by the people with the policy being applied, which both contenders for power endorse.
It is in the interest of the Ukrainian people, who alone have the authority to resolve their problems, to overturn the current policy, expressions of it and foreign intervention.
Â Â  The next item is the Financial Perspectives, with an oral question to the Council on preparation of the next financial perspective.
Â Â  . Mr President, as Vice-Chairman of the Temporary Committee on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013, I am speaking on behalf of the Chairman, Mr Borrell Fontelles, to put his question to the Council, and I welcome Mr NicolaÃ¯ being here.
As the Council knows, Parliament convened this temporary committee and Mr BÃ¶ge is its rapporteur; so far we have eight working documents and because as yet they are only working documents, we have not taken any formal positions.
Hopefully the questions that we put before the Council and the responses that we get back will help us reach some conclusions.
Having said that, to be perfectly honest, I hope that when Parliament does make its decisions there are certain items that it will be resolute about.
In the previous Parliament, in a report that was voted in my name, we set out certain conditions, certain priorities, one of which was quite simple: there will be no interinstitutional agreement without the agreement of Parliament.
The Council is well aware of this but it needs to be stressed, as it is in the text of this oral question.
We have also the issue of the length of the proposed financial perspective and Parliament will, I am pretty sure, bring it down to something like five years rather than seven years.
More important is the position of a fallback.
Mr BÃ¶ge asks in one of his working documents: what are the options if we cannot come to an agreement with the Council?
Do we go for Article 26 of the IIA or do we go for Article 272 of the Treaty?â
Having been in this Parliament for the past 15 years and involved with the Committee on Budgets for all that time, I am pretty sure that Parliament will go for Article 272.
That message needs to be got across to the Council.
I know that you, Mr NicolaÃ¯, are well aware of that and also of the consequences if we do not reach an agreement.
Therefore, it is incumbent on both our institutions to make sure that we reach an agreement.
Moving away from the oral question for one moment, I am now the rapporteur for the discharge, and it is becoming obvious that Parliamentâs budget gets a bad press every November when the Court of Auditors report is produced.
I would hope that the institutions â and if not the institutions then at least I hope Parliament â can make a decision that we will not conclude an interinstitutional agreement until the budgetary authority has agreed a solution to the audit, to the legality and regularity of the European Union budget.
It is no use concluding a financial perspective that will be seen by the general public as being misspent, misused and irregular throughout the next five, six, seven years or whatever period we agree to.
I come now to the questions; they are there for everyone to see and are quite simple.
The first one is: âHow does the Council intend to cooperate with Parliament?â
We are talking about how we are going to work together.
Hopefully we will not work as two separate organisations and there will be some work in tandem, so that we can share our ideas and make sure that the building-block approach of the Council matches our own approach as set out in Mr BÃ¶geâs working documents.
There is also a question about the calendar of the Presidency, when you hope to conclude, what your present Netherlands Presidency hopes to achieve, and what you think the next Presidency will achieve by the middle of next year.
We mentioned the issue of trialogues, but it is fair to say that after an informal meeting we had this morning, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, you may give us a response to that.
Parliamentâs position right now is that we should be having monthly trialogues, but I am sure your response will enlighten us on your thinking on this.
I personally go some way towards your sentiments on this.
An important issue is the question regarding the âProdi packageâ.
We really need to know where the Council is coming from.
What is the basis for your building blocks?
What is the basis for your working documents?
Is it the Prodi package or are you taking a different approach?
Finally, the last question: âIn the Councilâs view, what connection exists between the Commissionâs proposals on the new financial perspective and the issue of own resources?â
Some of us, being British, are not bothered, but for the majority in this House it is a crucial issue.
On that, Mr NicolaÃ¯, we would appreciate some answers.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me start with Mr Wynnâs remark about what will happen if there is no agreement on the financial perspectives.
That was not the nicest way to begin a debate in the European Parliament, because I believe we will reach agreement with Parliament on the financial perspective on time.
As Mr Borrell and Mr Wynn pointed out, the next financial perspectives represent one of the weightiest and most significant dossiers currently facing the Union.
The Council is therefore grateful to have been given the chance of setting out briefly how it is envisaged that this dossier should be dealt with.
As you will be aware, the timetable for finalising work was laid out in the Multiannual Strategic Programme for 2004-2006, adopted by the European Council in December 2003.
Thus, with the majority of the Commissionâs financial and legislative proposals already on the table, work is currently under way within the Council, aimed at possibly reaching decisions on principles and guidelines this month.
The intention is to achieve political agreement before the June 2005 European Council so that both the framework itself and the detailed legislation can finally be adopted by the end of 2005.
Preparatory work on new Community programmes would thereafter be carried out throughout 2006 so that they could be implemented from the beginning of the new financial perspective period.
As already mentioned, after producing two overall communications â one in February and a follow-up in July â the Commission has also presented a package of detailed proposals setting out the legal framework for key policy areas.
These include cohesion policy, conservation and management of natural resources, Lisbon-related issues and external relations and will be completed by a small number of additional proposals concerning in particular freedom, security and justice, and research and development.
The Council wishes to reassure Mr Borrell that the Commissionâs proposal constitutes the basis for work in the Council and is in accordance with normal institutional practice.
However, I think you will agree that, again in accordance with normal institutional practice, it is open to any Member State to agree or disagree to a greater or lesser extent with the financial implications of a Commission proposal and thus endeavour to move the dossier in a direction more agreeable to it.
This is part of the normal process of negotiations.
As far as the Unionâs own resources are concerned, the Commission has submitted as part of its legislative package a report on the operation of the own-resources system as well as two proposals.
These proposals make provision for the possibility of new tax-based own resources to be operational as from 2014, as well as for a generalised correction mechanism.
Preliminary work on these proposals has started and it is generally agreed that the concept of the globality of the financial perspective negotiations implies not only that individual policy areas must be viewed together in the context of overall expenditure, but also that expenditure must be seen in the context of the overall negotiations, including the question of own resources in all its aspects.
The Council also recalls in this connection that own resources formed an integral part of the 1999 Berlin agreement on which the current financial perspective is based.
On cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament, it should be recalled that, as specified in the joint declaration of July referred to by Mr Wynn and MrÂ Borrell, the Council is committed to an exchange of information with the European Parliament throughout the process.
The precise arrangements for putting this into practice will need to be established by common agreement between the parties.
The Council continues to act in accordance with the terms of the July declaration whereby the financial perspective should be negotiated in a spirit of loyal institutional cooperation, with the institutions willing to take all measures necessary for successful completion of the procedure leading to its adoption.
The partners accordingly need to reflect on how best to give concrete expression to this spirit of cooperation, which will certainly need to deepen as negotiations within the Council intensify and firmer Council positions take shape.
The Council could, to this end, draw inspiration from constructive practices followed during the last financial perspective negotiations, which enabled a satisfactory dialogue to take place with the European Parliament, culminating in the adoption of the current interinstitutional agreement in May 1999.
In this context, to conclude I wish to refer to the idea, also mentioned by Mr Wynn, of holding a monthly trialogue.
Based on my experience as President-in-Office, I should like to stress that the Council, and therefore the President-in-Office, will not be able to take a position in such a formal setting.
The negotiations in the Council are ongoing and difficult, as you know.
In such a context it would be preferable to continue the current practice of informal contacts between the presidency and representatives of the European Parliament.
I am convinced that these contacts will be fruitful and enable our institutions to play our respective roles.
Furthermore, you can be sure that the Council will look very carefully at the content of relevant resolutions and use them in its deliberations.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we do indeed want the negotiations on the Financial Perspective and the European Unionâs political priorities to produce agreement in good time, but we want an agreement that, at the same time, does justice to the demands that are made on the new and enlarged European Union.
So let me tell you, as rapporteur for the temporary committee, that the quality of the agreement is also more important than the deadline.
Taking the discussions with Parliamentâs specialist committees as our basis, we in the temporary committee are trying to define the political priorities for the years to come, and to put forward the upper limits for the structure of the European Budget, thereby laying down this Houseâs negotiating position ready for its discussions with the Council.
By doing this, we want to guarantee that, on the one hand, of course, traditional policies will be no less important and, on the other, that the European Union will present itself better, both internally and externally, and finally become what the Constitutional Treaty defines it as being â a Union of citizens and states.
That is why we are discussing among ourselves the political priorities on the basis of what value they add to Europe, and talking about how the European Budget can take greater account than hitherto of the Lisbon objectives, such as growth, employment and sustainability.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I see it as very important, in the light of past experience, that we should make it very clear that we want agreement to be reached in good time, thus preventing us from getting into difficulties â not so much with the Budget as with the legislative process.
Let me say, though, that we could end up, in the course of the coming year, with a worst case scenario, and then we will all need to have safety nets at the ready, such as those provided for the Budget in the Treaties and the Regulations, namely Article 26 of the Inter-Institutional Agreement or Article 272 of the Treaty.
At the same time, though, we will have to guarantee that, if the worst comes to the worst, it is made clear that the legal bases for structural funds and for multiannual programmes will also be extended if need be, that is to say, if there is no alternative.
Perhaps the mere announcement of safety nets and alternatives of this kind and the fact that we are discussing them will help all the parties involved to become aware of their responsibilities and â with next yearâs referendums in sight â will help to make it clear that we in the European institutions are willing and able to announce, at the right time, that we have succeeded in reaching agreement on the Financial Perspective.
I want to echo what was said by Mr Wynn, the first deputy chairman of the temporary committee.
The issue of the Statement of Assurance is important, as is that of how we handle the financial regulation that has just entered into force, and these must, in this context, be sorted out alongside each other.
This is not just about the upper limits, commitments and payment appropriations, but also about how the Commission, and also the Member States, manage the Budget as a whole.
That is why we will also, in this context, have to discuss the Court of Auditorsâ Statement of Assurance and the issue of the financial regulation, and also whether, at the end of the day, financial programming should be for seven years or for four.
We will have to have in-depth discussions of these issues too.
It is vitally important that there should be guarantees of both a flexible and permanent trialogue whenever one is required, and, at the same time, of the informal and confidential conversations that we need to have if we are not to end up in a state of chaos at the end of the negotiations.
That is what we would urge the Council to provide.
Alongside this, we will also be addressing an oral question to the Commission in Strasbourg.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to take the precaution of saying that it is always possible to be frank with friends.
I agree with previous speakers, but I am not going to expand on that; I would like to focus on other issues.
The news reaching us from the Council is at times imprecise and partial, often because that institution tends to be rather secretive.
I believe, therefore, that this oral question is useful to us in terms of clarifying certain issues.
We all know that certain Member States have asked that payment appropriations for the next financial perspectives be below a certain percentage of the Unionâs gross national product.
We have also heard rumours that other States defend that maximum, but applied to commitment appropriations, although it is not clear whether they are doing so in order to test the waters or whether they are truly convinced that that is sufficient to cover the real needs of the European Union.
It appears that some people have the fundamental political objective of getting their minimal proposals accepted and then imposing âthe necessary cutsâ in order to achieve those minimums.
Could you tell us, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whether this method consisting of setting limits on resources and then making cuts also corresponds to a method you use in your deliberations?
If this is the case, it does not frighten us, because we suffer the same thing every year when we approve the draft annual budget.
This is what in English is known as the âbuilding blockâ method, which has prevailed in your work to date, and what has been the result?
Furthermore, in the letter signed jointly last December by those six States, we are assured of the following, which I would like to read in English, since it is the original language of the document:
The new financial perspective should allow us to exploit the extraordinary potential of the enlarged Union, and the opportunities it offers our citizens.
EU spending should add real value, and aim more actively at transforming the EU into the most competitive and innovative area worldwideOther key tasks are further developing the common foreign and security policy, protecting our external borders, and managing migration flows.
We are deeply committed to the principle of European solidarity, and to the maintenance of cohesion in the enlarged Union.
Does the Presidency agree with these priorities?
And if it does, to what extent and at the expense of what expenditure?
Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament is demanding â and previous speakers have done so â a commitment to a genuine and constant dialogue between the Council and Parliament.
A genuine dialogue.
Or does the Council think it can come to Parliament with a and present it to Parliament for rubber-stamping?
If that is the case, I would like to say that, despite the apocalyptic description of a Community world without financial perspectives given by the Commissioner for budgets over recent days, increasing numbers of Members of Parliament will not accept financial perspectives which do not guarantee, and now I quote Mr BÃ¶ge, âthe correct implementation of the policies we have drawn up in the European Unionâ.
I would also like to tell the Council that nobody has more interest in the financial perspectives than Parliament, but not at any price.
The European Parliament has been proposing that the financial perspectives be included in the Treaties since Maastricht, while the Council has only accepted it after the Convention has drawn up new financial provisions.
We, more than anybody, want to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives for after 2006.
But not financial perspectives based on accountancy.
At the end of the day, Mr President, we should never forget that the financial perspectives are an instrument, not an end in themselves.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we do know how difficult it is to bring about agreement between EU Heads of State or Government as to the framework for the EU Budget.
Everyone looks after his or her own interests, and each Head of State will be measured and assessed on how well allowance has been made for narrow interests in the final result of the negotiation.
Fortunately, we can, however, say that it is not exclusively this struggle between national interests that will determine the budget framework, or financial perspectives, for the next few years.
There is, of course, quite a lot that the European Parliament needs to say.
Â Â  . Mr President, the President of the Council has a positive attitude.
He believes in dialogue and is convinced that we will reach agreement.
The only conclusion I can draw from that is that he has distanced himself from the misbegotten requirement to have the budget at 1% of GDP, because that would, after all, render an agreement impossible.
Fortunately, he has abandoned this scheme, because it goes without saying that a larger European Union tackling more problems needs more funds.
Naturally, I do not have complete peace of mind yet, because there are plenty of Finance Ministers who mainly view 2006 as a basis for the budget of 2007 and think that the 2006 budget should certainly not exceed that of 2007.
My group takes a different approach to these matters.
We look ahead to 2013 and to what we want to have achieved by that time.
To the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Commissionâs proposal forms a sound basis, but one that needs fleshing out quite a bit.
That can be done, for example, by means of investments in the area of rural development, the environment, sustainable energy, research and exchange programmes for young people, teachers and artists.
We also attach importance to flexibility.
We need a framework which will enable us to meet the EUâs challenges, including those of 2013.
It is clear to my group that we should not only discuss the EUâs expenditure but also its revenue.
The President of the Council spoke about a number of minor adjustments a moment ago, such as the limit on net contributions, but we also, of course, require something far more fundamental.
These days, this whole discussion of net contributions often leads to irritation and to irrational spending, because much compensatory action is needed, and also to a budget that is far too low.
We should therefore discuss revenue on a more serious level.
We should discuss a minimum tariff on environmental pollution or company tax which is siphoned off directly to the European Union.
In that case, that amount is not added to national tax but replaces it.
That will only benefit a rational discussion about the EUâs expenditure.
Â Â  . Mr President, Parliament already has a clear idea about what the Commissionâs position is regarding the proposal by MrÂ Prodiâs Commission.
MrÂ Barrosoâs Commission is not making a new proposal.
What is not clear for Parliament is whether it will adopt a position in the forthcoming financial perspective just on common expenditure, or budgetary income also, that is to say, own resources.
Could the country to hold the Presidency predict at this stage whether it will agree to discuss own resources with Parliament?
The proposal by MrÂ Prodiâs Commission calls for the United Kingdomâs special rebate on its membership contributions to be abolished.
That is only fair.
Does the Council really need to have the support of Parliament to raise this issue?
How strong is the Councilâs commitment to a 1% maximum?
As a representative of the Netherlands, the country to hold the Presidency, could you say for certain whether this 1% refers to commitments or real payments?
Finally, many members of our group have taken a negative view of financing the work of the Union through special Eurotaxes, and in this matter we support the position of some Members of the Council.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as a member of the temporary committee, I abstained from voting on a resolution that I had not been allowed to study first and that I cannot support.
I wish, in this House, to summarise my position, which is different from that which emerged in the temporary committee.
I support the idea of there needing to be a ceiling on expenditure during the forthcoming seven-year period up until 2013.
In my view, it is important to have such a ceiling, which should apply not only to expenses and payments but also to commitments.
I think it important not simply to dismiss this view, which only six out of twenty-five countries are said to have supported, for the countries concerned are those that make major net contributions.
It should be emphasised that unity is required on this issue if it is to be possible to adopt a financial framework and that there is a very strong desire not to impose unduly heavy burdens upon national taxpayers.
It is also regrettable that the Prodi Commissionâs old report was taken as the basis for the Commissionâs proposal.
I believe that the basis should have been the one per cent target but that Parliament must, however, have a large influence on the distribution of resources within this framework.
In other words, this is not a tactic for moving resources to one area or another.
It is only within such a framework that a true prioritising of resources can be brought about.
I also support the seven-year plan because it provides regulations for budgeting in each country, an activity funded not by the European Parliament but by the national parliaments.
We are clearly opposed to the EUâs introducing its own forms of taxation, for that would lead to a loss of overall control of taxation.
I also wish to emphasise our belief that agriculture should not be exempt from such re-planning as is necessary if it is to be possible to invest in new areas.
Such re-planning will provide scope for many new initiatives.
Â Â  Mr President, what is now being negotiated about the Financial Perspective will, I think, turn out to be the most crucial litmus test in the whole of the European Unionâs history.
It will now become apparent whether the targets that keep on being set, and the declarations of intent, can be turned into real policies.
A litmus test makes evaluation possible.
Will it really be possible to top up the funds for research support â which is what they need â and move their focus to small and medium-sized firms, and away from the funding for large companies that major lobbyists favour?
Will it be possible to achieve the breakthroughs that are needed in education?
Will it be possible to make real savings in administration, without more new concealed channels being found?
On that will depend the amount of money that will actually be involved.
I would opt for a different approach: we should start by talking about what expenditure is actually needed and then decide on the ceiling.
Â Â  Mr President, this is the first debate on the financial perspectives and, therefore, I hope that we will have another opportunity when the chairman of our parliamentary committee can participate.
The question today focuses on certain issues on which there is undoubtedly no fundamental neutrality: firstly, the participation of the European Parliament, as several Members have stressed, such as Mr BÃ¶ge â and I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his statement of good intentions â and, secondly, the working timetable.
For many reasons, Mr President, whether the work ends in an agreement in 2005 or in 2006 is important because, if we are obliged to defer the budget, as the Commissioner responsible for the budget acknowledged yesterday, it will be the cohesion policy that pays the price.
I would, therefore, like to draw the attention of certain Members to the risk to solidarity in the European Union of having an unjustified showdown between the European Parliament and the other institutions.
We would like to reach an agreement during the Luxembourg Presidency.
I would, therefore, like the Dutch Presidency to tell us how work is going on approving the general lines of the reform at the European Council on the 17 December.
We are delighted that the Presidency has said that the basis for this debate will be the European Commission's proposal, but how do those of you who claim to be Europeanists intend to deal with the cost of enlargement, expand internal and external Community policies and at the same time reduce the European Union's budgetary spending?
I do not know whether you have a magic wand or the capacity to perform miracles, or whether perhaps you intend to destroy cohesion for the old Member States, in other words, make the poor regions of the statistically or genuinely rich countries meet the cost of the economic development of the poor regions of the new Member countries.
You have less than two weeks to answer these questions if you do not want the Dutch Presidency to be tarnished at the end of its term in office.
You should start thinking about how to justify wanting more Europe while spending less money, because nobody understands that.
What we do understand very well is that less money means less Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am glad to be able to greet you again so soon and to be dealing with you.
As many have said, what we are dealing with now is one of the greatest challenges we face, second only to the annual deliberations on the Budget.
If one is to accept such a great challenge, one already associated with such bellicose language and accompanied â in that figures have already been produced for our consideration â by the opening of many secondary theatres of war, it is a good thing to keep a cool head and work through things in a systematic fashion.
I can assure you that there are many in this House who will approach this matter with a calm mind, rather than allowing themselves to be distracted.
Our task is to see to it that this House is sufficiently involved, and we will of course insist on that through the proper channels and press the point if the need to do so arises.
My colleagues and I are very grateful to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for having refrained from playing games with numbers and for having adopted a âbuilding blockâ approach, which focuses attention on matters of substance.
You have said that we have to closely examine the individual policy areas in order to see what we can actually do, and what we want for Europe in the future, and the work you are doing reflects that.
We will work in parallel with you and make proposals where necessary, hoping that you will take account of them in your calculations during the process rather than only when it is drawing to a close.
There will inevitably be many questions in our own minds, those being the questions raised by the European policy of the future, and the public demand answers to them.
We will, in future, have new tasks to take upon ourselves, and we will also have to talk about whether the existing policies as set down to date were shaped in the right way.
We will not be abandoning principles, and one that we do not believe can be abandoned is that of cohesion in this Europe of ours.
It is in areas such as this, for example, that there is discussion as to whether we want to make universal provision â as we have done in the past â or whether we want to promote lighthouses and centres of growth.
This we will have to discuss with you, and a discussion of this kind, dealing with details and substance, calls for courage.
It will demand courage of the Council, for it is the Council that will have to say when certain things are to be sold to the public as European tasks, one example being the reinforcement of security in the wake of 11Â September, and another being cooperation in the foreign policy sphere, for which funding will be needed.
We, Members of the European Parliament, will also need the courage to repatriate to the national level certain things that are not best performed at European level.
We will have to have a debate about this.
I would like to give brief consideration to the issue of duration, which two speakers have already addressed.
The fact is that the seven years we are talking about â a period running until 2013 â amounts to nine years from today.
Just bear in mind that it is for a period of nine years that we will be making estimates; nine years ago, Michael Jacksonâs was number one in the hit parades, the word âeuroâ had only just been invented, and it was nine years ago that Austria, Sweden and Finland joined the European Union.
That was nine years ago!
As we now have to talk in terms of that sort of period running into the future, I do think we have to watch out.
We should in fact be putting this duration back under the microscope.
Four years or three years would be something else.
It was four years ago that we adopted the Treaty of Nice.
That is a manageable period of time, so let us talk about the periods for which the Financial Perspective might run.
Let us also, though, discuss the issue of flexibility, which we need.
The European Unionâs development is not linear; we need change.
Over past months, we have had, again and again, to make use of the flexibility instrument.
You know every bit as well as we do that discussion of that is on the agenda.
I also want to address the issue of the revenue side, for an MEP cannot be happy to be always given the task of maximising expenditure, that being assumed to be the only thing we are interested in.
Such is not the case!
If we are to talk in terms of net contributors and net burdens, we want to know whether the engines pulling us are capable of having more wagons attached to them until they are incapable of moving, or how we can raise the money.
So something else we want to discuss with you is the mechanisms that the revenue side requires, and what I would like you to tell us is whether you are willing to have us involved over and above the extent specified in the Treaty, whether you are willing to talk to us and take us seriously where expenditure and revenue are concerned, or whether that is where you want us to be completely detached.
If you want results, I can do no other than urge you to cooperate with us.
We will have to fight it out among ourselves at various points along the way, but I do believe that results are achieved when self-confident people deal with one another, each of them knowing what he is capable of and what is expected of him.
Â Â  Mr President, Minister, the EUâs forthcoming financial perspective is part of a whole entity that covers the exhaustive reform of Community policy.
Along with the financial perspective, the system of the EUâs own resources is to be reformed, as are several multi-annual programmes, including regional and structural policy.
All this will require an immense amount of work and familiarisation with the new arrangements on the part of Parliament, and good levels of cooperation from the different European Union institutions.
Some tough negotiations are to be expected on the financial perspective.
It is important that Parliament is not put under any pressure in these talks, although there have already been signs of that.
If there is no agreement on the financial perspective by the time of the deadline, the EU budget can be drafted reasonably successfully on the basis of Article 272 of the Treaty.
Of course, in that case the measures aimed at improving employment would be delayed.
The incomplete state of the financial perspective must not be an excuse for stonewalling legislative proposals.
The Member States have an enormous responsibility here and their disagreements should not be reflected in the day-to-day work of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to tell the President-in-Office of the Council that we agree to his timetable. We do so even though he has concealed from us the fact that, at the Spanish-German summit a few days ago, another timetable was referred to, with 2006 as the date set for agreement.
What that means is that they are juggling two timetables, and, speaking as a regional politician, I can only describe that as irresponsible.
The regions need to be able to plan ahead with confidence.
If regional planning comes to an end at the end of 2006, there will then be funds committed for only another year.
What we need instead is for the relevant preparations to be made twoÂ years in advance, thus making it possible for structural assistance to be paid out in good time, for if this is not done, there will be a black hole in support funding.
Nor is annuality any sort of solution for regional politicians, and so we all, in the eyes of the public, share responsibility, but the European Parliament will come to an agreement next year, and so the question that arises in my mind is that of what the Council proposes to do, and what you, in particular, are doing in the last days of your Presidency to stir the Member States into action at last.
On the assumption that you have got a move on â and I am given to understand today that you have â how do you get the others to do likewise?
The only way we can continue with this debate in a responsible way is if you really do take some action, rather than merely engaging in the cautious diplomacy we have seen to date.
Â Â  When economic and social cohesion was discussed at the turn of the 1990s, the figures were different.
They ranged from 1.22 to 1.32 and settled at 1.27.
Today everything has been rounded down to 1, even though thousandths could potentially show that some resistance has taken place.
When the latest enlargement brought yet more social inequality and regional imbalance, the number 1 became an unfortunate symbol, a symbol that has begun to develop a resonance with the wider public.
Whilst we project the unity of the business and military strands and whilst the unity of the Stability and Growth Pact only serves to exacerbate social and regional âdisunityâ, the adoption of 1% in the Financial Perspectives is a way of fostering individuality over solidarity and cohesion.
In order to reverse this trend, our group tabled some amendments.
We were the only ones to do so, and our amendments are the only ones to offer a clear sign of resistance.
We did this, above all, in opposition to the 1%, a symbol of what we do not want: an individualist, selfish Europe, a Europe that is united around business and the military, with no social solidarity or regional cohesion.
Naturally I had much more to say, but only had one minute in which to speak.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we are opposed to the European Union, as it cannot resolve the problems Europeâs citizens and states are currently facing and will face in the future.
The opposite is actually the case, as the EU aggravates and precipitates these difficulties, and gives rise to even greater differences, discrepancies and conflicts.
In economic terms, Europe is confronted with two basic problems.
The first is economic growth, which as a rule is slower in Europe than in the United States and Asia, with consequences such as high levels of unemployment and a fall in the competitiveness of businesses.
The second is the growing difference in income levels between the rich old Europe and the poor new Europe.
There are also two main problems with regard to social issues.
The first relates to values.
I have in mind the crisis of the family as a key institution.
This is linked to the second problem, namely the ageing of societies and Europeâs falling population.
These demographic problems do not only affect Belgium, Germany and France but also poor countries, such as Ukraine, Romania and Poland.
If we consider the EUâs actions or proposed actions in this field, it becomes apparent that the EU lacks a vision of how to solve problems relating to economic growth and reducing differences, for example.
Above all, the EU lacks a strategy for reversing the trend of Europeâs depopulation.
Have there been any changes to the 2005-2006 draft budget as a result of the fact that ten new countries have joined the EU, and that the number of its citizens has increased from 380Â million to 450Â million, or by nearly 20%?
No, there have been no changes.
The 2005-2006 budget is based on an increase in expenditure of less than 10%, which, corrected for inflation, is in fact less than 7%, and equivalent to the contributions made by the new Member States.
2005 and 2006 are therefore lost years in terms of EU integration, and, worse still, differences may even be exacerbated.
In the context of the budget forecasts for 2007-2013, this is a very bad sign.
Was the 2007-2013 budget negotiated and agreed with the new Member States?
Of course it was not, as it was submitted to Parliament by the outgoing Commissioners.
What is more, the debate on this draft is taking place within a temporary parliamentary committee, which was appointed to undermine the existing Committee on Budgets and spread the responsibility for whichever solution was adopted.
This is evidence of the way in which the EUâs procedures lack transparency and clarity.
It also illustrated the horse-trading that goes on within, the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
The provisions of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective provide no answer to Europeâs basic problems.
If we adopt the principle that the budget will be set at 1% of GDP, the economic divide will only be widened.
Worse still, as a result of the Lisbon strategy, expenditure on research and development will increase by 300%, with these funds going mainly to the old EU Member States, whereas expenditure on the Structural and Cohesion Funds will increase by only 30%, which means that backward countries will lag ever further behind highly--developed countries.
We advocate a free, safe and rapidly developing Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. It is said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
Many of the key documents of the European Union are full of good intentions.
This goes for the Lisbon strategy and doubly so for the financial perspectives setting out the new financial framework of the enlarged European Union for the period 2007 â 2013.
Perhaps this is why we are now witnessing aÂ slowing down in the economic growth of the Eurozone in comparison with our main world competitors.
During the 1990s, when the 15 Member States of the European Union were making aÂ particular effort to flood the markets of the Eastern European countries, the average annual growth in productivity was 2.3%.
Now it is just 1.2% per annum and productivity in the Eurozone is more than aÂ third lower than in the USA.
In this respect IÂ welcome the appearance of the President of the European Parliament, Mr Borrell at the meeting of the European Council, where he explicitly pointed out the discrepancies between the Lisbon strategy and reality.
This is a realÂ threat to any kind of financial perspective if it is not backed up by real implementation.
Any discussion about the new financial perspective cannot be confined to the financial frameworks and the intentions of the European Union but must consider the effective use of common resources and concrete measures to raise the level of competitiveness of the EU.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, when talking about the financing of the Union from 2007 to 2013, I personally have two concerns: one relating to the amount of financing and the second relating to the timetable for taking decisions.
As far as the amount of financing is concerned, it is clear that requirements due to the enlargement of the European Union are increasing.
That is why we need to look first at the priorities of the new enlarged Union and then to start to talk about financing quotas.
I fear that, in certain cases, exactly the opposite happens.
However, in all events, enlargement should not operate to the detriment of the current cohesion countries and should not operate to the detriment of the cohesion policies of the European Union.
Within this framework, I welcome the European Parliament's position that the Union needs satisfactory financing for the future, even though I am keeping a personal reservation for when we start discussing specific numbers.
My second concern is with the timetable.
Mr NicolaÃ¯ transmitted to us the Council's firm position that the objective is for us to finish in June.
I hope that is the case.
However, as you know and as certain honourable Members mentioned, there are rumours to the contrary.
I do not think this is a good thing for the Union budget overall, especially for multiannual programmes such as those of the Structural Funds.
Any delay here would have an adverse impact, because we need to know the regulations much earlier; the Member States and the regions need to prepare so that we do not lose time, as happened in the current programming period in 2000.
Alternative solutions to extend the budget would appear to me to be extremely difficult.
However, any alternative solutions would have an extremely adverse impact on the operation of the Structural Funds and on cohesion policies from 2007 onwards.
That is why I should like a clear position by the Council on the timetable and on the alternative solutions which, in my opinion, are out of the question for the Structural Funds.
Â Â  â Mr President, the debate on the financial perspectives is of strategic importance to the future of Europe.
It concerns the European Union's capacity to respond to the needs of its peoples and the challenges of the twenty-first century.
The proposals submitted by the previous European Commission are, in our view, a good and balanced basis for discussion.
However, the restrictive, accountant's approach taken by certain governments and the proclamation of 1% as a dogmatic objective are unacceptable at this stage of the negotiations.
We are truly worried by the Council's apparent inability to respond effectively to the need to safeguard the development and redistributive character of the Community budget; this is something that, unfortunately, we noted once again during the budgetary procedure for 2005.
The question of reliability arises when we call on the peoples of Europe to ratify the European Constitution, when we talk about speeding up the Lisbon strategy and we are not ready to make corresponding commitments about the financial resources for implementing these objectives.
This is deceiving the citizens of the European Union.
The Community budget which met the needs of the European Union of the 15 Member States cannot efficiently meet the needs of the Union of 25 Member States today or of 27 tomorrow.
We, as the European Parliament, want there to be an agreement in good time, during 2005, on the financial perspectives which will guarantee the necessary and adequate financing for the policies of the European Union.
We shall be working in this direction and we call on the Council too to stand up to its responsibilities.
However, we wish to make clear that only a good and efficient agreement will be politically acceptable, an agreement which will efficiently safeguard development, employment, cohesion and solidarity for all citizens and all regions of the Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I share the opinion of many in this House that it is important to have an agreement about the financial perspectives for the future.
That is preferable to falling back on some article or other, be it in the Treaty or elsewhere.
That is why I believe it is to be welcomed that the Council intends to develop these new financial perspectives in thorough consultation and consensus with Parliament and to meet regularly for that purpose.
I think that what the financial perspectives of the future could benefit from is more flexibility between the chapters.
The Council could question, however, whether that is dangerous.
I do not think so.
After all, we have, with the current forms of flexibility, always stayed far below the standards which the agreement provide for.
Another area of concern is cofinancing.
Not all components of the budget are being âcofinancedâ.
Some are, some are not.
I think that there is scope for flexibility in this respect too, including by different application in the poor and rich Member States of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, the European Parliament at the start of hard and difficult negotiations needs to send out three clear messages: first, that we categorically reject the coercive letter for the Six, because this will result in less of a Europe and greater internal inequalities, in a Europe which is unable to support the policies decided by the European Union itself.
Secondly, that we are seeking a multiannual financial framework which will allow prompt planning of policies and programmes and, of course, that we reject four- or five-year scenarios.
Thirdly, and finally, the European Parliament should clearly state that it is not prepared to agree willy-nilly, if there are no guarantees that the policies which safeguard economic and social cohesion in the enlarged Europe of the 25 will be financed.
We need more ambitious, not more wretched plans for the common Europe of the future which we are building.
The Prodi package is simply a good starting point and we all need to agree that a bigger Europe with less money is out of the question.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in many countries the public are getting the impression that they contribute too much to the EUâs Budget, while getting too little back.
All too often, though, the public do not know what the money is spent on and in what ways.
It is by their own strategy, Mr President-in-Office, that many Member States reinforce their negative attitude, transferring more and more responsibilities â rightly, let me say, and thank God they do â to the European Union, but they are willing to pay less and less.
They convey the impression that they pay too much, while concealing the fact that the European Union has never made full use of the financial framework that they have had a share in deciding.
I regard this dual strategy as irresponsible; it involves taking refuge in number games and in pointless formalities.
The Europe of the future needs honest cooperation between the Council, Parliament, the European public and the Commission.
What Europeâs future also demands, though, is a clear answer to the question of how much money we need in order to successfully realise our political priorities.
How much money do we need for growth, competitiveness, employment, research, the common foreign and security policy, the neighbourhood policy, social cohesion, sustainability, regional policy, small and medium-sized businesses, enlargement, the common agricultural policy and information and communication, to name only some of the items falling within the remit of the European institutions?
We call upon you to talk about the political priorities and to make available the funds that we need in order to carry out our tasks for the publicâs benefit in a professional manner.
Â Â  â Mr President, four points should in my view take priority in this crucial debate: 1) the financial perspectives should be converted to the Lisbon parameters and objectives: the chapter on representativeness is the most important innovation introduced by the Commission proposal and should be strongly supported by Parliament; 2) the financing of the agricultural policy no longer reflects the new requirements of the European Union, even though the Commission has been unable to depart from the guidelines on this topic laid down by the Council; 3) it is important to provide for a transitional stage so as not to penalise those regions which, because of the so-called statistical effect, can no longer enjoy the support put aside for their development within the European Structural Funds, as will happen to certain regions in southern Italy; 4) we believe that the question of reforming the system of Member Statesâ contributions to the Union budget should not be put off indefinitely.
In conclusion, we take a positive view of the Prodi package, particularly because of the new philosophy on which it is based, focusing on the creation of a competitive and growing Union, and, in our view, the own-resource ceiling cannot be brought down to below 1.27% if we want to achieve all our pre-established objectives.
Â Â  Mr President, I wanted to draw attention to the aspect of regional policy in connection with the next financial perspective.
The first matter giving rise to questions is this â why does regional policy have secondary status in the Prodi Commissionâs proposal and why is it not a priority, as it has been until now?
Possibly in order to obscure the fact that the amount of resources that the Prodi Commission wishes to devote to regional policy as a proportion of the gross domestic product of the European Union is falling every year.
The proportion allocated to regional policy in the European Union budget for the next financial perspective is at approximately the same level as it was previously.
In a situation where ten new Member States have already joined the European Union and where Romania and Bulgaria will be joining in 2007 the funds available for regional policy should be increased.
That is why we would like to hear the European Council of Ministers answer this important question: does the European Council of Ministers consider it possible to renew priority status for regional policy and does it consider that the amount of funds allocated to European regional policy in the Prodi Commissionâs proposal is adequate?
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to ask the Council some more specific questions on the financial perspective.
I too assume that solidarity should be the guiding principle for the distribution of cohesion funds in the enlarged EU.
I would therefore like to draw the Councilâs attention to two aspects of the Commission proposal which I find need further consideration.
Firstly, does the Council consider as adequate the method proposed by the Commission for calculating the GNI average for the 4% capping for the whole seven-year period of the financial perspective?
At the same time, for the other aspect of the cohesion policy, provision is made for a mid-term review to adjust the regionsâ eligibility according to their actual development.
As it stands, on the one hand the Commission proposals are flexible for the phasing-out and phasing-in regions, but on the other hand it leaves the countries and regions for which capping is proposed in a sort of straitjacket for the whole seven-year period.
I propose that the mid-term review granting some flexibility and adjustment to the actual growth of GNI should be considered for capping-designated countries as well.
Secondly, does the Council consider feasible the Commissionâs legal proposal whereby value-added tax would no longer be eligible for local government projects?
Such a proposal would further limit the least-developed municipalitiesâ opportunities to benefit from the European projects as it weighs heavily on their scant resources.
I draw your attention to the fact that under the present system they are exempt from VAT.
Â Â  â Mr President, I think that we should perhaps look at the problem from a different angle.
Parliament should point out to the Commission â and to the Council â that, over and above the purely quantitative method for strengthening the Lisbon strategy, there is also the question of European participation in the quality of global economic parameters, because quantitative data only allow us to look at economic growth statically, without any positive or negative coefficients.
Consequently, we should be looking at the Commission's proposals from the dynamic point of view.
One example clearly illustrates what I mean: research and technology.
According to the Commission, spending on this sector in Europe up to 2013 will rise to EUR 23Â billion.
What does this mean in relation to the global environment?
At the moment, in the United States, we have 2.7%.
However, there entrepreneurship has been strengthened so much because there are connections, what we call 'linkages' between businesses, the administration and the economy in the area as a whole.
2.7% is a higher coefficient than our current 2% in Europe, which we shall, of course, push up to 3%.
However, Japan, for example, has 3% and, precisely because it does not have these linkages, is now in recession and research and technology has not helped at all in getting it out of recession.
Consequently, it is research and technology, this important part, which is a necessary but inadequate condition for growth.
Two further preconditions are needed, the dissemination of technology â the linkages I mentioned â and, at the same time, the major problem in my view is that there must be recovery, because in times of recession, businesses â I am still referring to the 'research and technology' problem â only look at things from the point of view of their cash flow management and they are unable to push ahead with major technological inventions.
That is why I consider that we should work on another part, which is called 'the demand side'.
If the demand side is to work properly, there must be cooperation between what is now the single monetary policy and financial policy.
In other words, more attention needs to be paid to the broad economic policy guidelines than that which, as States, we pay to our spending policies, by which I mean not every three or four years but every year, so that we can achieve recovery, without which we shall be pouring all this money we are debating into the Danaides' cistern.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have risen to speak as a representative of the largest of the new Member States, Poland, in this debate involving questions to the Council on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
I should like to draw attention to this point, as it has mainly been representatives of the old Member States who have spoken so far in the debate, and this is an important distinction to make, as the views of the old and the new Member States on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective differ greatly.
In my opinion, one of the most important priorities for this Perspective should be to consolidate economic growth in the ten new Member States, which is currently experiencing an upturn, as this will facilitate cohesion and equality within the EU as a whole.
Integration has taken place on a legal and institutional level.
This process must, however, be accompanied by one in which the ten poorest countries together with the two due to join the EU in the near future catch up with the developed part of Europe.
Without a gradual reduction in the development gap between the rich and the poor, the integration of the EU as a whole will run up against major opposition.
There is also a danger of a two-speed Europe becoming a permanent arrangement.
This is why we are in favour of the Prodi Commissionâs proposal.
The latter sets the EUâs budgetary commitments at an average of 1.27% of the EUâs GDP, whilst being opposed to the position of the six largest net payers, who wish to limit the level of these commitments to 1% of GDP.
Only if the EUâs budget is greater than it has been to date will there be a realistic chance of significantly increasing funding under the Structural and Cohesion Funds, which would in turn make it possible to implement measures that effectively promote development in the new Member States.
This is all the more necessary in view of the planned generosity towards regions in the old EU Member States which as a result of the âstatistical effectâ will rise above the threshold of 75% of the EUâs average GDP as of 2007.
Given the restriction that has existed since the mid-1990s, namely that countries benefiting from the Structural and Cohesion Funds cannot receive funding exceeding 4% of their GDP, or in other words more than around EURÂ 17Â billion per year for the ten new Member States overall, we are not calling for anything out of the ordinary.
I should like to draw these issues to the attention of the Council representatives taking part in this debate, as they are related to the implementation of one of the enlarged EUâs most important priorities, namely reducing the development gap between the old and the new Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, it is important that we in this House should, today, seize the opportunity to have this opening debate.
I am delighted that Mr NicolaÃ¯ from the Council has indicated that we will be doing this more frequently in future and that we will, every month, have the opportunity to put our fingers on the pulse.
Nevertheless, this new Parliament has set very clear priorities with a view to pursuing the cohesion policy, because that proved effective in the past and because it has narrowed the gap between the differences between us in Europe.
Alongside this, new initiatives, including the Lisbon agenda, have been taken.
We are still not performing well, though.
The Kok report has shown quite emphatically that we cannot afford to rest on our laurels, but need to invest.
We need to do this at European level with renewed dynamism and right across Europe.
There are also new challenges ahead.
Today, for example, we were discussing the issue of Ukraine, and the new neighbourhood policy needs fleshing out; it needs investments.
Those are new challenges and this House wants to meet them head on.
My message is that we should draw lessons from what has happened in 1999, particularly in terms of regional policy.
The first year, 1999, was not a productive year because the discussions we held were too tentative and too protracted.
We must avoid 2007 being another tentative year, especially since the key objectives, if anything, require acceleration.
We will therefore need to muster perseverance as a group.
It is precisely the linking of instruments, a more integral approach to matters such as research, that opens up opportunities.
That is the sort of attitude that the electorate expects of us.
Fresh policy and new perspectives cannot be achieved with 1%.
We will need more than that.
Â Â  Â Â Â We are preparing the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective at an exceptionally difficult time.
Parliament and the Commission are both new, and the EU has only been functioning with 25Â Member States for seven months.
There is also the prospect of further enlargements, and of course the Lisbon Strategy to take into account.
The temporary committeeâs timetable and working methods should include an examination of the positions and priorities of the Prodi Commission and the previous Parliament.
An assessment of the current enlargement should also be carried out, and plans made for future enlargements.
These are tasks to be tackled by the new European Commission, with the Member States playing a major role.
The latterâs proposals must be studied thoroughly, and it is for the next Presidency to ensure that this is the case.
The new Financial Perspective contains plans for several years, and maybe for as long as a decade or more.
It is possible, and indeed certain, that conditions within the EU and beyond will have changed.
After all, this is a long time, especially in the twenty-first century.
It would therefore be a good idea for there to be a review of the new Financial Perspective after it has been in operation for three years, and for it to be adjusted as necessary.
It should not be forgotten that in 2009 there will be a new Parliament and a new European Commission, and provision should be made now for those key EU institutions to have the right to put forward proposals and make certain amendments.
The fundamental decisions on the new Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, however, are a matter for the Member States and the Council.
Europe cannot be reduced to mere percentages, and in particular not to 1% of GDP.
Â Â  . I should like to thank all the Members of this House for the remarks and specific questions they have put to me.
Let me start by responding to the issue of the timing, the timeframe and planning which we in the Council follow and has been questioned by some of you, first of all by Mr BÃ¶ge, but subsequently also by Mrs Schroedter and Mr Hatzidakis.
The latter two also spoke about rumours and indications that the timeframe which I gave you a moment ago would have been altered.
Reference was made to a summit and to other rumours.
I can put your minds at rest.
There is only one timeframe and it is the one I presented to you.
It mainly comes down to the fact that indeed, it is our plan and intention to achieve agreement in the Council by June 2005.
I can add to this that I agree with what Mr BÃ¶ge said about the continued non-appearance of the Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors.
He knows, as you do, that we in the Council share Parliamentâs concern about this.
Some of you, including Mr Galeote Quecedo, have enquired after the precise state of affairs in connection with the timing and the schedule.
The state of affairs is that the preparations for the Council of 17 December are now underway and that we will then do as agreed.
That means that we then hope to take a decision about the principles and guidelines for the financial perspectives, as well as the package, the survey of what we have achieved by means of the building-block approach.
That is what is before the Council and it is hoped that we can take a decision on this on 17 December.
I will return to this building-block approach in a moment, because a number of questions are linked to it.
I note that here too, rather like in the discussions in the Council, various priorities as to content are already being mentioned at this stage which should find a home in the new financial perspectives.
As Mr BÃ¶ge made explicit, one general point of departure is the discussion about the added value of what is happening at European level.
I naturally recognise a number of priorities that have been presented, including the Lisbon strategy, that has been mentioned by many, the international role of the European Union, cohesion policy, security and specifically also the item of the 4% cap on structural funds.
Those are all elements that are still being discussed here, as they are in the Council, and form part of the proposals we are in the process of formulating.
This brings me to the approach which we in the Presidency have decided to adopt for the steps to be taken during these six months in preparing the new financial perspectives.
First of all, I should like to distance myself quite categorically from the questions about the 1% approach put by, among others, MrsÂ DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop and Mrs Buitenweg, who was delighted that this approach would be abandoned.
As President of the Council, I have not abandoned anything, and neither have I held on to anything.
I am not speaking here on behalf of the Netherlands, nor on behalf of the Group of Six, who, as you know, have adopted this position about the 1%.
I am addressing you as President of the Council.
As President, I have done precisely those things that a number of you regard as grounds for criticism, Mr Karas, for example, who urged me to talk about priorities, or others who questioned how I could solve this problem from a financial point of view.
We have opted for the building-block approach, precisely because it allows the political priorities, the priorities as to content, and not the money, to be put first.
That is the step that we are now trying to achieve by 17 December, so this is exactly along the lines of many remarks which I have made in the past.
Since I seem to perceive some confusion about this, I should like to reiterate that the Commission proposal is very definitely the point of departure, although we all know that the Member States are entitled to adopt positions other than that proposed by the Commission.
What the building-block approach tries to do quite simply is to combine, classify and put into a readily understood format the different positions of different Member States in terms of category and subject, thus enabling us in the Council to make more informed decisions politically speaking.
That will only benefit the discussion as a whole and may even be advantageous to you.
I am therefore delighted to hear, as Mr Walter made explicit, that Parliament will venture a similar attempt.
I think that with this, I have responded to most remarks about the building-block approach and the line taken by the presidency.
I would now like to turn my attention to the other aspect.
Not expenditure, but revenue and own resources, which one or two of you briefly mentioned.
We all agree on how important these are.
Parliamentâs right to be consulted is unmistakable and abundantly obvious and there is no doubt as to the fact that you will be making use of it where this section of the financial perspectives is concerned.
