It is a question of people who have allegedly been detained, without first having been tried, for an unspecified length of time and without any appeal whatsoever, and who are therefore in all likelihood subjected to torture and inhumane and degrading treatment.
We therefore have potential violations here of Articles 3, 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as potential violations of the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights.
The latest news is that two countries, one belonging to the European Union and the other in the process of joining the EU, are cited as having housed such centres.
I say âhavingâ housed, since these countries are today denying these acts of which they are accused and because the reports in question date back to 2002 and 2003.
What they are denying is taking place today could therefore be compatible with the facts presented in the reports, and particularly in the report by the Human Rights Watch, but the fact of recognising that the potential existence of such centres can constitute a violation of the Treaty on the European Union and Article 6 thereof calls for you to do more than just issue statements, Commissioner.
You say that you are leaving the matter in the hands of the Member States.
You say that you are going to examine closely the investigation expedited by the Council of Europe; I will tell you, by the way, that the European Parliamentâs Subcommittee on Human Rights has already decided to invite MrÂ Marty as soon as his work has been handed over.
You say that you are waiting to see what the United States itself decides on this issue and you have expressed your desire for investigations to be carried out at a technical level. I, for my part, believe that all that is far from adequate.
Quite simply, Commissioner, you must expedite an investigation in order to shed light on this situation, which is detrimental to the foundations of the European Union and to its credibility on the international stage.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President Frattini reminds me â and this is not intended as an insult â of those famous monkeys which see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil.
He has spoken, however, although he did not even have the courage to say that what is really at issue are not hidden jails in general, but genuine torture chambers made available to the CIA and the United States by some European countries.
Commissioner Frattini, you are denying the obvious.
You are denying something that even reliable US sources have admitted.
We want you to conduct an investigation, but if there is no desire to find the evidence, the evidence will never be found.
Commissioner, you are perhaps unaware that in Milan, on 17 February 2003, Abu Omar, the former Imam of the mosque in via Jenner, was kidnapped, and that the magistrates in Milan, having found incontrovertible proof that the CIA was directly responsible, have requested the extradition of 22 US intelligence agents.
What stand did the Commission take when faced with this evidence?
What did it actually do, in the light of this breach of sovereign rights, to force the US authorities to comply with the conventions on human rights and torture?
The Commission did nothing.
In the light of this experience, I am not optimistic about the results of any future action that the European Commission is likely to take.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it may well be the case that the issue we are debating also concerns my own country, Poland.
The Polish Government has issued an official statement denying that there are any prisons of this kind in Poland.
It says a lot that the statement makes no direct reference to the past, however.
Further investigation is therefore needed into the matter.
The former Minister for National Defence has denied reports that al-Qaeda terrorists are being held in special prisons in our country, but he did so during a radio interview in a manner once favoured by the Soviet news agency TASS.
Anything denied by the latter was effectively confirmed as true.
At the same time, however, I would call on the Members of the House to keep a sense of proportion during this debate.
The war against terror is essential and we must be unyielding and resolute in fighting it, but it must be guided by public opinion.
There are two extremes that I firmly believe we must avoid.
The first of these is the attitude that the end justifies the means, and that even democratic values and human rights should be sacrificed in the fight against international terrorism.
This must not be allowed to happen.
Yet we must also ensure that the Western world and the values we uphold are not left in a state of paralysis.
I believe that these two extremes should be eschewed, and it would be regrettable if either were to gain ascendancy in the European Parliament or in any EU institution.
I believe that this Chamber is the right place to say loud and clear, without hesitation, that the war on terror will be fought hard and ruthlessly, but that it will be guided by public opinion.
In this way it will gain a public mandate and public legitimacy in the free West.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view a complex and multi-faceted problem such as terrorism cannot be tackled with a single, one-dimensional strategy.
Citizens of a sovereign State or States have a legitimate right to live in peace, devoting their lives to their work, to their families and to their freely-chosen lifestyle.
Wars have been â and still are â critical periods in the life of society; they upset all the normal benchmarks, but they involve precise military positions, clearly-delineated battlefields, a visible enemy and rules of engagement.
Terrorism, on the other hand, does not follow the rules of official war, does not only involve the military and does not operate on the battlefield.
It uses underhand tactics to strike the innocent at home, when and where they are least expecting it, with no specific aim, no social purpose and no values.
It is obvious that everyone must respect the rules, laws and sovereignty of the State.
It is undeniable that we all need to uphold not only the most elementary human rights but also the principles underlying all civil society and all relationships between nations.
However, before levelling accusations at what are undoubtedly democratic countries, we must firstly have full knowledge of the facts and circumstances.
We also need to think of the families of the defenceless victims of terrorism in recent years, and of the millions of citizens who are still living under the threat of attack.
We cannot use kid gloves to fight terrorism, but nor can we throw accusations at democratic countries solely on the basis of conjecture.
Faced with a choice between terrorism and democracy, I believe we would all choose democracy.
Mr President, we should allow the courts to do their job without looking for grounds to ascribe blame to countries which certainly do not deserve it.
I agree with the position of Commissioner Frattini and hope that, here in Parliament, we shall only make decisions in this matter once we can be sure we are acting democratically.
Â Â  â Mr President, the CIA keeps a network of secret detention centres throughout the world.
At the same time, the United States have accepted the use of a 'renditions' policy, in order to take people, even European citizens, for interrogation at locations of which we are ignorant.
The president of the USA is today threatening to veto the bill adopted by the American Senate in order to impose what was â until a few years ago at least â the obvious; in other words, the fact that international law must be applied to persons arrested by the United States anywhere in the world.
All this in 2005, by a large country, by a country with a long democratic tradition, by a country which insists every year in publishing a report on human rights and lambasting other states around the world for violating them.
The policy of the USA affects us all, irrespective of whether these centres are located on European territory.
The terrorist argument of double standards in European societies is something they pray for so that they can enlist new terrorists, so that they can undermine our policy.
Shall we allow them to do so?
What were inconceivable questions before the discovery of the US detention centres must be asked.
One of these questions is: are there today Member States of the European Union or candidate countries which keep such centres?
Secondly, are there today Member States of the European Union or candidate countries which send their detainees to US detention centres?
Where do they supposedly wash their hands, while using this network for their detainees?
This must be answered.
Thirdly, have the USA sent people snatched from Europe to these detention centres?
In fighting terrorism, the objective is not to sanctify any means.
Let us Europeans not create a European-inspired Frankenstein which we cannot control and let us not allow any other country to do the same.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, all of this information is overly detailed and convincing, and you too speak in such a convincing manner that it is almost tempting not to believe you.
The commitment you have made here to investigate this situation is therefore laudable, but it does not reassure us.
We expect the Commission and the Council to act firmly and not to be content with nothing more than fine words or denials by politicians expressed at cocktail parties.
We expect genuine action and investigation.
Commissioner, on the orders of the public prosecutor, the police on the island of Mallorca are investigating the illegal transportation of prisoners; it has taken great efforts to do so, but nevertheless, all of the police investigations are moving in exactly the same direction as previous journalistic investigations.
And all without any support from the United States.
I would ask you to demand similar investigations by all of the countries which may allegedly be involved in this situation.
I would insist, political denials using vague words about the present, that say nothing about the past and which are simply intended to evade responsibility, are not enough.
We want a genuine investigation and a commitment to a police and judicial investigation that provides evidence to prove that there is no truth to these allegations.p
It is extremely repugnant to us to see this from a country that has been our ally for a very long time.
To see it on European soil, to see centuries of civilisation and moral progress in the fight against crime, or, in this case, against terrorism, renounced is profoundly repugnant to us.
Furthermore, Commissioner â and another speaker said this a moment ago â I entirely agree: countries must be innocent until proven guilty.
But the fact that they are innocent until proven guilty does not mean that you are not required to investigate.
The very credibility of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice is at stake.
Since that is your responsibility, you cannot rely on explanations given by others.
You must take the appropriate measures and also demand that the Council do so.
Â Â  Mr President, for a secret service, the CIA is in the news an awful lot.
Germany and Italy are up in arms about reports of its alleged abduction of radical imams in both countries and, as my fellow Member said a moment ago, an enquiry has just been launched in Spain into the transit of suspects via Majorca.
It is a matter of rumour in Europe that there are also secret camps, where detainees, deprived of their rights, are kept.
In the first case, the European countries involved are infuriated, but in the second case, they are partly to blame.
You have said as much; you have said that this is in contravention of human rights and of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, but I am very curious as to what you will actually do about it.
When the Council of Europe mounts an enquiry, your response to that is just to ask to be kept informed.
That strikes me as a very narrow interpretation.
The European Union, as a community of values, cannot afford to look away now, and I want you to take an active part.
I want you to check not only with governments, but also with NGOs and the press whether certain statements are true.
I want you to talk to members of parliament, and I want to hear you say that, if those statements are true, there has been a contravention of Article 6, at which point an Article 7 procedure is supposed to kick into effect.
I want to hear you say that Article 7 is applicable, if the statements are true, that is!
This is not, however, a merely institutional issue.
This is not simply something the Commission has to do, although I do think that it should play a far more active role.
It is also, and above all, a political issue.
A few moments ago, a Polish Member of this House rightly said that such matters should also be discussed at national level, and I think that we should all go back to our sister parties at national level, for this is something that must be broached with them too.
We should not simply place the responsibility with the Commission, but we should, via our own sister parties, ensure that these things are checked to find out whether or not they are true.
Â Â  Mr President, it is not only dictatorships threatened with extinction that keep people detained in an unacceptable manner.
Since the use of the Guantanamo Bay military base as a prison where non-Americans can be kept without trial and without support from a lawyer, we know that human rights are violated to that extent by NATOâs most powerful member state too.
In Europe, we expect virtually everyone to reject such practices, even if this involves people whom we think are a threat to our lives in peace and democracy.
If secret prisons are located in one of the current or future EU Member States, or in states that benefit from our neighbourhood policy, then that is a stain on the European claims of democratic rule of law and protection of human rights.
It is therefore necessary that the Commission and Council make every effort to put an end to the possible existence of such prisons.
Commissioner Frattini now reports that the Member States involved flatly deny their part of the responsibility.
He then goes on to refer to the Council of Europe that is already taking care of this matter.
If such prisons exist, it has always been the intention to keep their existence secret for ever.
Their denial is the first instrument to protect this secrecy.
This denial does not convince me or certainly those who have drawn your attention to this.
The European Union must check out for itself whether there is an American network of secret prisons and whether some of them are located in Europe.
I can endorse the procedural points mentioned by Mrs Buitenweg.
Instead of simply denying their existence, we must get to the bottom of this matter.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, MrÂ Czarnecki and CommissionerÂ Frattini have already referred to the fact that the Polish Government has denied allegations that camps exist in Poland.
I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this statement myself, of course, since I have not scoured the forests around where the suspect plane is reported to have landed in Poland.
Even if a CIA-owned Boeing had in fact landed there in 2003, however, it would not constitute any kind of proof that such camps existed or still exist in my country.
We do not know what reason the plane had for landing.
It may have been to refuel, to carry out repairs of some sort, or maybe to take someone on board.
We do know, however, that this Boeing also landed in the Czech Republic and Sweden in 2003, and, more recently, in Palma on the island ofÂ Majorca.
Yet noÂ one is accusing these countries of housing such camps, or voicing suspicions along these lines.
One can only ask whether this is because it is mistakenly assumed that there is no such thing as freedom of the media in Poland, and that journalists would not immediately have been hot on the trail of such a sensation.
Logically speaking, I would be astonished if the Americans had decided to use an EU Member State for this purpose, thus forcing the country in question to violate the Treaties and EU legislation, instead of using American military bases or countries where freedom of the media really is non-existent or limited.
Examples of such countries include Egypt and Thailand.
One possibility is that we are participating, at our own behest, in the deliberate sending up of a trial balloon to gauge the reactions of the new EU Member States, by putting the strength of the transatlantic alliance to the test.
Another possibility is that someone is keen to point out new targets for al-Qaeda terrorist attacks, and to ensure that these attacks are carried out against Poland and Romania.
I therefore believe that we should exercise great caution and avoid reading too much into the facts, as certain people have done.
In so doing they not only contrive to ensure that Europeâs real problems are pushed to one side, but also place the Polish people at real risk of terrorist attacks.
I am delighted that there is a possibility that the Council of Europe will carry out a thorough investigation into this problem, and the sooner this happens the better.
In response to MrsÂ Buitenwegâs suggestion, I should like to make it known that I would be more than happy to invite the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to Poland in order for them to investigate the matter for themselves.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that the denials referred to by Vice-President Frattini in relation to the countries involved are extremely formal and unconvincing.
In the top-secret CIA documents, which virtually the entire European press is currently discussing, the clandestine jails in Poland and Romania, referred to in the and , even have a name â âblack sitesâ.
They are a sort of no-manâs land, beyond the law and beyond the right of habeas corpus.
If proven, these allegations are serious and present us with a difficult problem â the need to find the delicate balance between protecting citizensâ rights and combating terrorism.
I should like to underline a contradiction â the fact that shortly, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament will tackle the issue of data retention and will again attempt, with a great sense of responsibility, to find common legal and political ground to reconcile rights and emergency situations.
We need to protect the rights of citizens and to use all available means to combat terrorism, at the very time when we discover that European countries have become the CIAâs own back yard.
MrÂ Frattini, what is really serious is that we do not even have the right to be surprised.
Two years ago, as the current legal investigations â of which you are well aware â have shown, Community and non-Community citizens were kidnapped in European countries by the US secret services.
Once again, however, we appear to be turning a blind eye.
We have noted your final comment, namely that if the episodes we are discussing today were proven, they would constitute serious violations of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union.
That, I believe, is an important statement and one we would ask you to develop further, by launching an exhaustive and in-depth investigation into the events we have been discussing this evening.
Â Â  Mr President, contrary to our Polish friendâs opinion, there are not, in Europe, two legal doctrines as to whether the end justifies the means.
The law is unambiguous and binding.
Terror may not be fought with terror.
There is nothing problematic or uncertain about this issue.
Deprivation of freedom, abduction, enforced transportation, torture, abusive treatment, solitary confinement, and disregard of the presumption of innocence are crimes and themselves constitute acts of terrorism.
That is not Europeâs way.
You refer to comments in magazines, and say you have no evidence.
I can assure, you, Commissioner, that this is but the first of very many debates until such time as this matter has been settled, and settled beyond doubt.
There you have them: the numbers of the flights, the airports involved, the flight times, the companies and firms that operated the flights, the destinations to which they flew; you have statements from detainees, evidence from a dozen international organisations, investigations by the CIA itself, albeit into the breach of secrecy rather than into the crimes themselves.
The Austrian military authorities are conducting investigations into CIA aircraftâs flights through Austrian airspace, and enquiries by the justice authorities in Spain, Italy and Germany are also underway.
I call on you to wake up, perform the duties of your office and take responsibility.
Â Â  Mr President, last Friday Condoleezza Rice, the US Secretary of State, ordered the highest level enquiry into the leaks to the Washington Post and Human Rights Watch.
Clearly the United States Government believes there is some veracity in these allegations.
Today the Commissioner has, on the one hand, told us that the Copenhagen criteria might have been breached by Romania and that ArticleÂ 6 may be being breached by Poland, but we already knew that.
The Commissioner has come here today and told us that there is no evidence of these breaches.
Well, both Poland and Romania issued official government-level denials last week, so we knew that.
We asked the Commission to investigate the leak that the United States itself is concerned about â the highest level leak to the most credible of sources. newspaper and other bodies are repeating these allegations.
These are not radical newspapers or non-credible organisations.
Mr Lambrinidis said we already knew that the CIA operated black sites and torture centres in other parts of the world.
We want to know if it is happening in the European Union.
We want to know if it is happening in the candidate countries.
As you said, Commissioner, it is the most serious breach of treaty obligations.
You are not investigating it.
We need an investigation which brings credibility to this House so that we can leave this debate knowing whether this is true or false.
Â Â  Mr President, we as Europeans must clarify whether CIA detention centres exist in Europe, how many there are and where they are located, etc. As a citizen of the Balearic Islands I have a special interest in this.
The end does not justify the means.
We must defend our values.
We may be fighting terrorism, but we cannot do so with arms that are not democratic.
We understand why US organisations and institutions, including the CIA, are being closely protected, especially in Eastern Europe, where so much hope for change has been pinned on the United States.
However, not placing limits on the means we employ makes for a terrible contradiction, since democracy and transparency are fundamental to the maintenance of law and order and to democracy itself.
Human rights are applicable to all human beings, including terrorists and suspected terrorists.
I therefore call on the Commissioner to investigate this issue.
Â Â  â Mr President, some time ago, information led to the discovery of the huge barbarity of torture chambers at the Abu Graib prison in Iraq and at Guantanamo prison in Cuba.
Today reports, although not yet confirmed, have nonetheless not been denied by the American authorities.
I am worried that, in the name of combating international terrorism, we are on the brink of a new Middle Ages.
We are on the brink of a direct threat to democratic culture in Europe and, more importantly, the European governments and European institutions cannot remain impassive.
I wish to highlight in particular the direct reaction of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
Unfortunately, we did not see this direct reaction by the Council of Europe on the part of the European Commission.
Today, the guarantees and statements made by the competent Commissioner, Mr Frattini, were not in my opinion at all reassuring.
What needs to be undertaken by the European Commission and by Mr Barroso, by Mr Frattini and by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, as the competent Commissioner for transatlantic relations, is an investigation in all directions, in order to ascertain where, by whom, how and when these black places were created.
The European Union has a political and moral obligation to cooperate with the American Congress.
We already know about the initiatives by Senators John MacKein and John Kerry in this direction.
The same initiatives must also be taken by the European Parliament.
The promotion of transatlantic relations is inseparably bound up with respect for democratic values and the principles of international law.
This is a message which needs to be sent clearly to the American leadership.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, on 2Â NovemberÂ an article by DanaÂ Priest positing the existence of secret CIA prisons in Eastern Europe was published in the .
I should like to make two points in this respect.
Such âsecret CIA prisonsâ operate outside of any judicial system.
I refer not only to that implemented by international institutions, but also to the US courts, civil and military alike.
This alone constitutes a violation of the fundamental democratic and liberal values upon which America, the European Union and the transatlantic alliance are founded.
There is a great deal of public opposition to secret CIA prisons and the interrogation methods used in detention centres for suspected terrorists.
This attitude is shared by many Republican politicians in the USA, as evidenced by Senator John McCainâs recent initiative to abolish the use of torture or methods akin to torture in such centres.
My second point relates to the possibility that secret CIA detention centres are located in EU Member States or in countries that will join the EU in the near future.
This state of affairs undermines the fundamental principles of the EU Treaties.
The European Union has every right to demand that its Member States, including my own country, Poland, take these accusations seriously, that they look into the matter again and that they investigate all the circumstances surrounding the landing in Poland of a CIA-owned Boeing carrying prisoners.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank those who have spoken and to say that everyone here is in agreement with a principle which I personally underlined in my introduction.
There is unanimity on the basic principle of the European Union, namely total respect for the life and dignity of every individual.
Therefore, everyone here in Parliament agrees with the view that, if the allegations prove to be true, we shall be faced â as I have already said, but it is worth repeating â with a serious breach of the Treaty on European Union, a violation which, if it were confirmed and proven, could lead, as you all know, to the application of serious political sanctions against a Member State of the European Union.
That is only the start, however, because it is obvious that, in addition to the serious violation â and I have drawn attention to Article 7 of the Treaty â there is also a second consideration: if these allegations proved to be true, they would constitute criminal activity.
Someone mentioned this fact, a large number of you emphasised it and I am fully in agreement.
It is therefore clear that the national legislatures of the Member States have the duty to investigate situations of this type.
In Italy, as everyone is aware, an investigation is in progress into certain serious allegations of unlawful acts committed in Italy by CIA agents, which, if proven, would constitute a serious crime.
Ladies and gentlemen, the problem is that legal means must be used if they give us every opportunity to achieve the result that we, both Commission and Parliament, are seeking.
Let us therefore look at what actions the Commission has taken, is taking and will take in the future.
Many of you asked this question and I may have failed to cover this point adequately in my introduction.
I believe the most appropriate way to describe it would be as a political action involving continuous requests to Member States and accession candidates.
I am referring to possible actions such as debate and discussion with NGOs, which obviously have information they supplied to the media and which they could certainly provide to the Commission as well; also dialogue with other institutions that hold further items of evidence and with bodies able to supply information to the European Commission; and, finally, intense and continuous discussion with the authorities.
I refer, in particular, to the United States Congress and Senate, which have decided to conduct investigations, the results of which could be passed on to the European Commission.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am not someone who minces words and I would ask you to forgive what is perhaps an excess of frankness.
However, I believe that the indignation we all rightly feel at these serious crimes â these absolutely disgraceful situations â will not suffice to alter the rules of the Treaties.
When some Members refer to an âinvestigationâ, they are not just referring to the approach the Commission is intending to adopt â and will adopt â namely to conduct a political enquiry.
They are also thinking of inspections, the taking of evidence and the obtaining of documents, even where such documents are not spontaneously volunteered.
Even if Parliament voted that the Commission should exercise such investigative powers, it would be unable to do so, because the Treaties do not give it that authority.
When we use the word âinvestigationâ, we need to understand what we are talking about.
Do we have the power to question the Interior Ministers of the candidate countries and Member States referred to?
No, we do not.
Do we have the power to obtain classified CIA documents if they are not handed over?
No, we do not.
Do we have the powers of the Council of Europe?
No, we do not have those powers.
That would require a change in the Treaties.
I should be very happy if the European Constitution had already come into force, because it gives the European Commission wider powers than those it currently possesses.
When someone here referred to the powers of national courts, they may have imagined that I have powers identical to those of a public prosecutor or examining magistrate in one of the Member States.
However, there is no comparison between the power of a national judge and that of the European Commission.
We may not like it, but those are the rules of the Treaties and, therefore, when we talk of an âinvestigationâ we need to use the word in its legal sense and, above all, within the meaning defined in the Treaties.
To sum up: I intend to use all powers of political investigation, because these are permitted under the Treaties.
We are allowed to ask the question, but if a Member State replies that it has never had clandestine jails in its territory, I shall need to have proof, as in the case of Abu Ghraib â photographs, evidence and testimonies.
At present, we do not have these items.
I am not saying we may not have them in future, but I do not have the authority to summon anyone, or to order the interrogation of someone who refuses to testify, because these powers are vested in other bodies.
I am talking, therefore, about a political investigation, an action aimed at obtaining information and collecting evidence, where it exists.
Important information may also be obtained from Members of Parliament, of course, because these are political actions.
They are not legal actions; they are actions which, if the allegations are proven, could lead to political sanctions.
That is what complying with the rules means â and it is something I have always done, even when I may not have liked it.
In this particular case, I do not like having limited powers, but these are the powers vested in me under the Treaties, and they are the political powers of investigation which I intend to use.
Â Â  Colleagues, I have to draw your attention to the fact that we have among us Observers from both Romania and Bulgaria, and they are very welcome.
Since Romania has been mentioned frequently during this debate, one of the Observers wished to take the floor.
I pointed out that this could not happen, but he has passed a note to me expressing his concern about some of the attacks made upon Romania and stating that the Romanian authorities would welcome any inquiry into the allegations made in the .
I state that for the record.
I do not want to set a precedent, but the Observers are among us and they obviously have strong feelings about these matters.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on banana import arrangements.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I should like to thank you for this opportunity to share with you our current thinking on the new import regime for bananas.
Needless to say, we are very disappointed at the second arbitration award issued on 22Â October 2005.
The current import regime for bananas was agreed at Doha in 2001.
On this basis we obtained a waiver from our WTO obligations for granting a preference to our ACP partners.
It was also agreed at the time that we would move to a tariff-only system not later than 1Â January 2006.
For this purpose we opened negotiations with our main trading partners for modifying the concessions in our schedule on bananas and went through arbitration as foreseen in the annex to the Doha waiver.
The relevant benchmark set out in the annex to the Doha waiver is whether the rebinding of our tariff on bananas maintains market access for most-favoured-nation suppliers.
Following a first negative award on 1Â August 2005, the arbitrator determined in a second award issued on 27Â October that the European Community had failed to rectify the matter with its proposal for a new most-favoured-nation tariff rate at EURÂ 187 per tonne.
This was a very disappointing result.
Our calculations were done in an objective and transparent manner and were supported by thorough economic and legal analysis.
The aim has always been to ensure a neutral modification of the import regime with a most-favoured-nation tariff that provides equivalent market access conditions to let in American suppliers â as the current quota regime does â and keeps an equivalent level of ACP preference.
Throughout this process we had consultations with our trading partners but there were no common positions from their side that could have been the basis for a negotiated solution.
Where does that leave us now?
The arbitratorâs award does not indicate what could be an appropriate tariff level.
In deciding on the import regime for bananas there are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account: most importantly, our responsibility to all the different stakeholders.
We have considered the interests of Community producers and the management of the common market organisation for bananas with a view to its future reform.
We have our commitments towards the ACP partners in the Cotonou Agreement to maintain their tariff preferences.
In the light of all the above, we need to move to a tariff-only system from 1Â January 2006 and we must move quickly as our operators need legal certainty.
At the same time, I am fully aware of our responsibilities towards all stakeholders, which we take very seriously.
The Commission will therefore be making a proposal very shortly on the level of the tariff starting from 1Â January 2006.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, I have been draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development for successive reforms of the COM in bananas, and I have spoken in all the debates we have held, on 13 April 2000, on 13 December of that same year and on 4 September 2003, to mention just the most recent.
Before leaving his post, Commissioner Lamy informed us, on 21 April 2004, that he intended to propose a tariff of EUR 230 per tonne of bananas imported.
Since then, since the new Commission took office, both you and your colleagues and the Commissioner for Trade have sought to reach an agreement.
You must acknowledge, Commissioner, that what you have said tonight does not shed much light on the direction you intend to take.
You must clearly take the decision to apply a tariff from 1 January and we shall see how high it is.
Nevertheless, you are very well aware â the Commission is very well aware â that that decision guarantees you a new dispute with the producer countries of the âdollar areaâ within the WTO almost immediately if that tariff exceeds their expectations.
In other words, we shall gain a few months of time at the expense of creating certain risks for the ACP group of countries and new uncertainties for our European producers.
In the end, provided that nothing unexpected emerges from the imminent Hong Kong Summit, the Commission will have to seek a negotiated solution with the Latin American banana-producing countries.
The legitimate question I would like to ask is why the Commission expressly gave up the search for that agreement during the months of March, April and May, when there is reliable evidence that, via various diplomatic channels, the Latin American producers sought an agreement, though of a transitional nature, on a temporary extension of the system in force which would provide a margin for the negotiation of a more stable and lasting solution.
Commissioner, I believe that the Commission did not pay any attention to these wishes because, at that time, it was confident that the arbitration within the World Trade Organisation could agree to the establishment of a tariff of EUR 230.
That was our first setback.
Then a new tariff of EUR 187 was proposed, with identical results.
You have confirmed here today that you are very disappointed by the result of the second arbitration of 27 October.
At that time, the comments of certain officials, and your own comments, Commissioner, showed the same perplexity and disappointment that you have expressed today.
You said then that it was necessary to prevent the banana dispute from being included on the Hong Kong agenda.
I believe that this is another mistake, Commissioner.
All it needed was for a country such as Honduras, which may be many good things, but is hardly an all-powerful giant of a country, to ask that the banana dispute be included on the agenda of the Hong Kong Summit, in order to achieve what the Commission wanted to prevent at all costs.
You may feel reassured to know, Commissioner, that, during this final stage of the negotiation, with so much disappointment and bad news in terms of our interests, you have not been alone.
You have been accompanied by certain national governments, such as that of my own country, and the governments of certain banana-producing regions.
You have also had the understanding of certain representatives of the European banana producers, who appear to be resigned to awaiting a solution, which you have mentioned in your speech, involving a magic formula such as the one achieved in the so-called âMadeira Agreementsâ, which for the moment just has the air of a Portuguese , which, as you know, Commissioner, is more a song of nostalgia and sadness than one of hope.
Â Â  . Commissioner, I would like to point out a few aspects to you.
You showed how disappointed you are, which is no surprise after a second negative arbitration decision.
That is no pleasure, but I can tell you after looking at the website that the story of bananas is a never-ending one; so you should not be too disappointed.
I am sure this issue will be with us for many more years to come and even if this is resolved, another one will come up.
That seems to be inherent in the case of bananas.
Maybe you could be a little more precise and explain the timeframe for action.
There is not a lot of time left, but I would like to know what timeframe you have in mind.
Secondly, what are the different scenarios you are evaluating?
For the Committee on International Trade, it would be more than relevant to know what you have in mind.
Finally, as my colleague said, I wonder whether this is not going to overshadow Hong Kong.
I would like to know how you are going to make a situation that is not easy in any case â given that sugar and many other difficult issues are on the agenda â look a little more positive.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate provides evidence of how important socio-environmental criteria are in the argument about international trade, and how important it is that the Commission should bring these quality criteria into the WTO negotiations.
The same can, I might add, be said of sugar, which is a good example, although here in Europe â with the possible exception of our peripheral areas â we produce hardly any bananas.
The situation is, then, better than it was at the time the Soviet Union disintegrated and Germany was united.
When the central and eastern European states acceded to the European Union, West Germanyâs former suppliers â the producers of dollar bananas â thought they could now supply the rest of the EU.
âWith this common market organisationâ, they thought to themselves, âwhich was not there before, there will now be free trade in bananas, and we will be able to offload our dollar bananas throughout the EUâs territory, and let the others look after themselves.â
This House, at the time, debated this in depth.
In those days, the Commission was on our side, and we worked out a proper market organisation, which is now becoming the subject of recurrent debate.
It is not the case that the dollar bananas have done anything like cede any of the market and that the Americans are doing less business; the very opposite has happened, and their share has increased dramatically.
If, though, we had not introduced these criteria and had no quotas, the ACP countries, with their so-called small bananas, would have been out of business ages ago, and hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of small banana farmers would have lost their livelihoods.
They are not yet exactly out of danger, but at least we have, by holding this debate, made our contribution.
What I would welcome from you â and I am also thinking of sugar here â is that this debate should go forward in the European Union, and that, instead of liberalisation being simply proposed as a quantative solution while policy and social and environmental concerns are disregarded, the Commission, as an advocate for these quality criteria, should speak up clearly and ensure that social, labour, and environmental concerns should be brought to bear on global trade relationships and be taken into account in them.
That is most particularly the case where the use of quotas is concerned.
Â Â  , .
Mr President, bananas are not only produced in plantations run by powerful international undertakings that employ large numbers of badly paid workers; more and more small farmers are growing them too.
Since the 1980s, cooperatives of small farmers in the developing world and non-commercial import organisations in Europe have struck up good working relations.
Over half the bananas eaten in Switzerland originate from imports based on fair trade.
The key factor is not the country of origin, but the method of production that protects man and the environment.
In contrast to Switzerland, the success of fair trade in the EU is hindered by a tradition of quotas and levies.
This means that it is difficult to import bananas from countries other than those in Africa, the Caribbean or the Pacific Ocean, or, to put it another way, those countries that were colonies of the Member States up to half a century ago, unless they fall within the scope of import licences held by a number of big undertakings in Europe and America.
I have a question I would like to put to the Commission.
Will it, after this arbitration, create room for a transition to the Swiss model or will volume restrictions only be replaced by higher import tariffs, which means that little will change, if anything? In that case, the Latin American countries will regard Europe as being in breach of its agreements.
Â Â  . Here we go again.
Another EU import tariff scheme has come unstuck: recently sugar, now bananas, and all for pan-EU harmony.
This scheme is hampered by the origins of Member States, many of whose former colonies produce bananas and whom they now rightly wish to assist.
Although complex, the three-tariff system helped, with the C quota reserved for ACP countries to export up to 750Â 000 tonnes annually to the EU at zero rate.
Hence the problem: because non-EU countries, especially Latin America, now want parity.
I suggest two solutions.
We can go to tariff only, as proposed for 2006.
In October 2004, EURÂ 230 per tonne was suggested, but that was too low for ACP and too high for dollar countries.
However a common tariff is set up, it will disadvantage ACP countries, causing loss of production and unemployment.
Already the Windward Isles report that 24Â 000 small producers have dropped to 7Â 000 under dollar-country pressure.
In many ACP countries bananas grow in terrain unsuitable for other crops, so unemployment grows massively.
Will these people migrate, some to Europe adding to our 20Â million unemployed, or will they take to crops like cocaine that will grow on the former banana plantations?
I suggest an alternative solution based on the repeated statements that we are supposed to be in an EU which retains its individual Member State status.
Mr Barroso recently claimed that regulations might be cut.
Combine the two: ditch the banana import scheme and make individual Member States sort themselves out with their own arrangements.
After all, we are all grown-up democracies.
EU countries would buy on the open market or support their former colonies just as they wish, without repercussions on the world market.
The UK operated Commonwealth preference up to 1972 without great problems.
If that sounds a little nostalgic, well, why not?
We owe these former colonies.
What is wrong with a little humanity in trying to maintain employment in the Third World?
Rather that than the arid scratchings of the bureaucratic Brussels pen-pusher.
Â Â  Mr President, the 2001 agreement with the United States and the Latin American countries, to which the Commissioner referred earlier, and which we thought could put an end to the banana war, now brings with it a radical change to the Community import regime from January 2006, a change that the European sector will have to face in a situation of great uncertainty.
In 1993, the Union decided to establish its own import regime and a common organisation of the market for bananas that is completely different to the common organisation of the market that governs the rest of the fruit and vegetable sector.
The Union therefore gave the banana sector special treatment, almost favourable treatment, and this is even more justified today, because this fruit is only grown in the European Unionâs outermost regions.
I would remind you that, because of their island and outlying status, these regions are treated differently, and this is necessary, above all, if we want to continue to maintain their agricultural activity.
Given that my government, the Spanish Government, has forgotten this â as has the Government of the Canary Islands it would appear â I will point out that bananas play an essential economic and social role and the new import regime could jeopardise the survival of Community production if the European Union does not have sufficient funds in the future to compensate for a drastic reduction in prices as a result of the possible establishment of too low a border tariff.
The essence of the problem is ultimately an accounting adjustment on which the future of the banana sector in the European Union depends.
The lower the tariff, the greater the financial effort required to compensate European producers will be.
But that effort has a maximum limit and that maximum limit should determine the European Unionâs room for manoeuvre in terms of giving in to international pressures in international negotiations.
The Union has already sacrificed a significant proportion of its agricultural production for the sake of opening up to international trade, a sacrifice which unfortunately always impacts on the same people, on the producers, and which benefits just a few, in a very small number of third countries.
In the case of bananas, moreover, the big multinationals would benefit, while local producers will hardly notice the change.
Â Â  â Commissioner, firstly let me say it is regrettable that the Commission chose the path of litigation rather than that of negotiation, which would probably have provided a much more practical solution and might have produced a more satisfactory result.
The reality â as others have said â is that, for instance in the Windward Islands, bananas provide employment for over a third of the working population and account for 50 to 70% of export earnings.
It would be extremely serious if that were to be jeopardised.
As you suggested, Commissioner, preferences for countries such the Windward Islands harm no one and are not aimed at damaging the trade of Latin American exporters or of any other exporters.
The best approach would be to find ways of postponing the single tariff, and to negotiate and agree to a fair solution that allows all suppliers to continue to trade.
Arbitration has obviously been a failure, but the Commission must try to ensure that the trade can continue until such time as you, in conjunction with the Development and Trade Commissioners, can find a viable way of ensuring that other sources of income can be found for poor farmers in the Windward Islands so that they continue to have a future.
Finally, I fear that bananas and sugar will be well and truly on the agenda in Hong Kong as far as the ACP countries are concerned.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for Agriculture for what she has said.
I would like to point out that banana production in the European Union is currently significant, that thousands of European Union families living in the outermost regions live from it and that, if banana production were to disappear, we would be abandoning some of Europeâs islands to their fate, despite the fact that, although they are far away, they are as European as the place from which I am speaking at this moment.
Secondly, I believe that we must bear in mind that the panels of the World Trade Organisation cannot choose arbitrarily.
According to the principles of the Charter of the World Trade Organisation, an equivalent tariff must be sought, and that equivalent tariff is not arbitrary; it must provide us with at least the same level of protection that we enjoyed previously.
I do not know to what extent the Commission is considering this factor.
Thirdly, time is running out.
1 January is just around the corner and I very much fear that, as a result of the âtrial and errorâ procedure being employed by the panels of the World Trade Organisation, we will not have a tariff on 1 January.
Should we not consider the possibility that, at least during the transitional period, the regime in force could be maintained?
Can the Commission negotiate in any way with the third countries to suspend or interrupt the negotiation, with a view to reaching a reasonable solution?
I am finally going to make a comment on the things my compatriots from the Spanish Peoplesâ Party have said.
Until last year, the Peoplesâ Party was in power in Spain and until a few months ago, before its expulsion by the Head of the Government, it was in power in the Canary Islands.
The question I wanted to ask is whether, until that time, the Peoplesâ Party had been doing anything differently to the current governments of Spain and the Canary Islands.
In any event, Commissioner, I hope that you will defend the interests of these hundreds of thousands of European citizens whose ability to maintain their living conditions depend on you.
Â Â  . Mr President, when I look back in time I find that the issue of bananas has always stirred emotions.
1992 was the first time I really heard about this discussion, which has lasted for so many years. We have not yet actually finalised this issue.
Addressing some of the remarks made here today, firstly, it was a priority for me when we started these discussions immediately after I came into office last November to reach a negotiated conclusion on this issue.
Yet it soon turned out that even within the Latin American countries there is no common agreement, so it was not possible to reach a negotiated conclusion on the issue in January.
We tried over and over again to see whether it was possible.
I will not go into details about the various big companies in the Latin American countries that hold completely opposite views on how this is will end, but do not believe those who say that negotiation possibilities have not been explored.
It is quite right that Honduras has put bananas on the agenda for the Hong Kong ministerial conference.
I can only say that we will do our utmost to ensure that this issue does not unduly disturb the whole process.
To this end, we are counting on our approach being reasonable, on our continued preparedness to discuss with our partners and on the support of the ACP countries.
Regarding sugar, which has also been mentioned, it is my intention to try to reach a political compromise in the Council at the meeting before the Hong Kong meeting, so that this will not be an issue.
As regards the timeframe and the different scenarios, there is currently a proposal on the table before the Council for moving to a tariff-only system and this will be the basis for further discussions.
At this stage I cannot go into details, because this is issue will be dealt with and negotiated with the Council before I put all the figures and ideas on the table in Parliament.
Of course our target is to get fair trade on this banana issue.
The fact is that at the end of the day it is the consumers who decide what is going to be on the supermarket shelves, so those who have a huge interest in this issue should use any opportunity to encourage consumers to make their choice.
As a number of speakers have mentioned, it is clear that we have to find a balance on this very delicate issue.
In deciding on the import regime for bananas there are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account and, most importantly, as I said previously, our responsibility to all the different stakeholders.
We also have to consider the interests of Community producers and the management of the common market organisation for bananas with a view to the reform that we will hopefully achieve with the Council during the second half of 2006.
I can only assure those of you who have an interest in this difficult, long-lasting issue that we will do our utmost to arrive at a positive outcome so that the tariff-only system enters into force on 1Â January 2006.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the âReasons for the poor implementation of the Occupational Pensions Directive by Member Statesâ, by Ieke van den Burg and Othmar Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (O-0094/2005 B6-0338/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to say a few words on our reasons for raising this oral question.
As we explained in the text, many Member States have not implemented this directive.
Discussions are taking place between the Commission, the services concerned and the Member State representatives, and in the context of CEIOPS.
However, Parliament as co-legislator should also claim to have a role in interpretations if there really are problems with the directive.
This is why we asked you to come here to discuss this with us, Commissioner.
Reading between the lines, you will also note our concern that Member States are not taking implementation of the directive seriously.
We also urge you to make an important issue of the Pensions Directive â because it is a separate issue specifically concerning financial markets and social policy â particularly where respect for national, social and labour laws are at stake and where host country rules, rather than the country of origin principle, are prevalent.
We are eager to be involved closely in the outcome of the implementation and the possible interpretations.
We raised two other issues: the involvement of CEIOPS and the state of affairs regarding the prudential rules, as well as possible additional quantitative rules added by Member States, but I will not go into details on those.
A very important point for me, not just as spokesperson for the PSE Group, but also as a Dutch delegate, is my concern over developments in occupational pension schemes due not only to financial market developments but also to regulatory developments: there is a trend to move from defined benefit to defined contribution systems.
This is a very fast-growing development in the UK and Ireland, where in particular new participants in schemes are not given a defined benefit system.
That is not possible in the Netherlands because we have collective systems and obligatory systems in most cases, and we are very attached to them.
I do not agree that a shift from defined benefits to defined contribution is a necessary development, let alone a desirable one, because the quality of pension schemes is a major asset of the European social model.
The first pillar in the Netherlands would be incomplete and insufficient without a second pillar of such high quality.
It is also important that this tradition give the best overall results.
Therefore, these blurred borders are also a concern for us and we would invite you to clarify your interpretation of these developments and how you will debate this issue further with us.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs van den Burg has already said, we are concerned â concerned about the lack of seriousness with which this directive has been transposed since it was adopted two years ago.
There are two sides to this directive: one has to do with the internal market, which the directive makes stronger for all service providers in the field of occupational retirement provision, and the other has to do with social security for workers, with more dialogue between employers and workers when occupational retirement schemes are set up and in the course of their further development.
Boarding the airliner this morning, I was handed a magazine. The headline on the cover stated that there would, in future, be no getting away from occupational retirement provision.
As you, Commissioner, will have seen from having read the new German Governmentâs working agreement, two substantial paragraphs of which are devoted to securing the old age pension system, this has become no less important an issue in the years since the directive was drafted and adopted.
There is still not enough risk capital in the European Union; in the USA, as we are well aware, it is the pension funds that do most to create it.
The internal market and the financial services sector still offer potential.
The pension funds â the businesses that deal with occupational pension provision â do not yet enjoy a complete single internal market.
Much is at present being said about the European lifestyle model and the European social model.
Occupational retirement provision, which involves more of the market at the same time as social security â is an essential precondition for workersâ mobility and flexibility, as well as for the securing of our systems of provision for old age and of securing a comfortable old age in a society in which people live for longer and longer.
What this directive also makes clear is that there is an imbalance in powers and responsibilities, an imbalance between single market competence and social security systems.
This is something that the directive attempts to rectify, but it is also the very reason why we are putting this question, for it is the Member States that are empowered to transpose this directive and to take account of those aspects that we have addressed but that are not set down in law; they are also responsible for doing so.
From your speeches and from the facts, we know that, to date, only six Member States have notified their transposition measures; six more have done so in part and 13 are unaccounted for.
As things stood on 23 September 2005, 13 states had not done what they were supposed to do.
That, Commissioner, is why we are asking you what action you propose taking if, by the end of the year, not all the Member States have transposed this directive.
What is it that makes it so difficult for them to do that?
Unless I am misinformed, there were meetings of the Member States and the Commission in October 2004 and April 2005, at which it became evident that its provisions relating to social security and labour law were the source of the most problems.
We have to face up to the tension between these two; the one must not be an excuse for a blockade by the other, whether in the single market or in the necessary security measures that we have addressed in our directive, and so we also ask you what conclusions you draw from this, whether you believe that more measures will be needed and what effect the disparities in tax legislation have on the transposition of this directive.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the Member States that have not or that have only partially communicated implementing measures to the Commission will be subject to infringement proceedings for non-notification under Article 226Â EC.
It should be emphasised that such infringement procedures concern only the communication of national measures and do not refer to the quality of the implementation.
Once complete notifications have been received, the Commission will examine the national implementing measures, which might at a later stage lead to infringement proceedings due to incorrect implementation of the directive.
The directive does not confer any comitology powers on the Commission.
It is not a âLamfalussyâ directive.
Therefore, no mandates are given to the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors â CEIOPS â nor will any implementing measures be adopted by the Commission.
As there is no practical experience with the directive yet, it is too early to take a position on the need for comitology and, therefore, on the role CEIOPS could take in this.
However, CEIOPS has an important role to play in the context of ArticleÂ 21(2) of the directive and supervisors have the duty âto collaborate closely with a view to facilitating supervision of the operations of institutions for occupational retirement provisionâ.
In that respect, CEIOPSâ Occupational Pensions Committee is currently drafting a multilateral cooperation protocol, such as already exists for insurance.
A draft is out now for a second open consultation with stakeholders.
It is expected to be adopted by the CEIOPS membersâ meeting in February 2006.
In the past two years, the Commission has organised two meetings with Member States in order to help them implement the directive.
To that end, the discussions focused on issues identified by Member States, the Commission and other stakeholders as a potential source of difficulty for the transposition and which may give rise to a diverging interpretation by the Member States.
On the basis of those meetings, the Commission has concluded that although some articles appear to cause problems, that is not the case for all Member States.
Hence it is difficult to define any particularly problematic provisions. This is not surprising, since Member Statesâ pension structures and arrangements differ significantly.
Nonetheless, there is reason to believe that the implementation of ArticleÂ 20 â cross-border activities â causes problems for many Member States.
However, it is too early to assess whether the origin of those problems lies in the formulation of the legislative proposal as adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, or just in different interpretations in the various Member States.
In 2006, a first meeting will be organised to discuss further some of the issues which have been identified as problematic and essential during the examination of the national implementing measures.
The in-depth analysis of the national measures transposing the directive has not yet begun.
At this stage the work focuses on the quality of the partial or full notifications.
An indication as to the extent to which Member States have adopted additional quantitative investment rules and elements that might jeopardise the proper functioning of the directive can only be provided once most Member States have notified.
As the Commission expects a large number of Member States to communicate their legislation to the Commission before the end of this year, such an indication can only be provided in the course of 2006.
A number of defined benefit pension schemes took advantage of the 1990s bull market to reduce the level of contributions or even take contribution holidays instead of building up their financial reserves.
When the inevitable market downturn occurred, some of these reserves were found to be insufficient.
In response, sponsoring undertakings and Member Statesâ supervisory authorities employed different solutions: increased contributions, top-up payments, reduced indexation of pension rights, changes in the pension schemesâ rules and the closure of schemes to new entrants.
Irrespective of the remedies applied, all stakeholders again realised that a pension fund involves a long-term commitment to employees and pensioners.
This recognition has only been reinforced by other developments, including the application of IASÂ 19 for sponsoring undertakings and stricter rules for the supervisory valuation of technical provisions.
Sponsoring undertakings have realised the need to achieve improved cost control and more stable earnings in order to match their pension promises.
A shift from traditionally defined benefit final pay schemes to pension schemes whose cost can be more easily controlled can indeed be observed.
However, there is clear evidence that this shift has not been solely towards purely individual defined contribution schemes.
Hybrid schemes combining defined benefit and defined contribution elements are also available.
The rationale behind all these changes is better cost control and more stability in earnings for the sponsoring undertaking.
There is a trend towards some blurring of the borderline between the three pension pillars, not just between the occupational second pillar and the individual third pillar, but also between the second pillar and the statutory first pillar.
This is not a problem, as the pillar structure is only a general classification system, and schemes where assets are allocated to individuals are to be found in all three pillars.
This is not the case in every Member State, as pensions reflect specific cultural and historical situations.
Thus, although the basic differences between the first, second and third pillars will remain, the solutions envisaged may be equivalent.
Different choices have been made in the 25Â Member States as to the existence, level and funding of state schemes, occupational schemes and individual arrangements.
There is not one EU-wide answer to the challenges of the ageing society.
Appropriate solutions must be adapted to Member Statesâ different pension systems.
Therefore, the final responsibility lies with Member States.
The Commission could be of help to Member States by ensuring that the European regulatory framework for financial services supports the emergence of secure market-driven responses to retirement financing.
Bottlenecks must be removed so that assets earmarked for retirement can be managed as efficiently as possible, thus allowing Europeans to enjoy the highest possible payouts and annuities on retirement.
The directive fulfils this objective.
In the second half of next year, the Commission will present a white paper in the field of UCITS, which also play a role in the pension arena.
Other initiatives that aim at improving European pension provision include the recently adopted proposal for a directive on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights, and the ongoing infringement cases in the field of equal tax treatment of pension contributions.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, that was a highly technical description of something that is going nowhere.
That there is such dragging of heels when it comes to the transposition of the directive on occupational retirement schemes is not only disappointing but also â or so I believe â negligent.
Occupational pension schemes are burgeoning within the European Union, and the directive itself offers nation states enough scope to be able to organise them properly.
The population statistics are changing dramatically, and many states are, for ideological reasons, progressively withdrawing from retirement and healthcare provision, the idea being that private provision should step into the gap.
If pensions are to be secured in future, other areas of capital-building retirement provision will have to be promoted and managed with vigour.
If occupational pension schemes are to be a stable means of making additional provision for old age, there must be a guarantee of the risks to employees being reduced in real terms, for they already risk losing their jobs and must not also risk their own voluntary contributions, and the contributions made by the companies they work for, being put in jeopardy.
That is why there must be an explicit separation guaranteed between the businesses and the institution for occupational retirement provision, so that, for example, the entitlements acquired are not lost in the event of the business going bust or the employee changing job of his or her own accord.
A single market for occupational retirement provision organised on a European scale would mean more mobility for workers, and that is precisely what they want.
Alongside the decoupling of the risk of job loss from the risk of employeesâ claims on the amassed capital in the event of the business going into administration, there must be minimum standards for occupational pension institutions, which must involve explicit information rights for both the supervisory authorities and the employees.
Both those entitled to benefits and those actually in receipt of them must be entitled to receive information on the way in which their schemeâs capital is invested or on the state of the stock market.
Employees should also, if possible, have a right to be consulted by their companies when the choice of these institutions is made.
If the objectives named in recitals 18 to 23 are achieved, that not only puts the workers in a more secure position, but is also what modern stock market supervision in the Community requires.
Now, Commissioner, is the time for action, and action is what we are used to getting from you.
Â Â  . Mr President, we all agree with the Commissioner that increasing the uptake of pensions is of paramount importance, especially in relation to voluntary pensions, whether by virtue of this directive or through any other means.
However, incentives to take up pensions, as he has quite rightly said, remains a competence of the Member States as these may be linked with the tax and benefits systems.
I am not proposing that there should be any change to that.
Nevertheless, it is important to share best practice.
Could the Commission therefore indicate whether it is already monitoring incentives or has plans to do so?
Can it envisage a mechanism through which best practices can be shared and encouraged?
In the context of cross-border provisions, which we want to encourage in order to achieve a better and more vibrant pensions market, public confidence in all regulators and underlying guarantees â and not just in those of oneâs own state â is very important.
It is also important, especially for schemes relating to the self-employed, that it is understood that the information provided by the different countries should be comparable.
ArticleÂ 9 of the directive requires that members be given sufficient information on risks.
ArticleÂ 10 requires that the annual accounts should give a true, fair and comprehensive view.
Other articles provide that members should have access to those accounts.
However, this raises the question of what constitutes sufficient information, and whether account will be taken of the differences between prevailing practices in Member States, or at least whether potential investors will be alerted to the differences that may exist in areas in which they are not comparing like with like.
Clearly it is also important for the solution found to this not to result in a multiplication of regulation and for CEIOPS to take that into account in any forthcoming protocols.
Â Â  . Mr President, perhaps the Commissioner could explain what he means by a âtirdâ pillar.
It sounds rather unsavoury to me.
Is not the real problem of the implementation of the directive on occupational pension schemes that there is no political will for its implementation?
In western Europe there is a serious demographic problem as the population grows ever older, with the birth rate continuing to fall in the leading industrial countries of the European Union.
There is a major pensions crisis, which national governments are simply failing to address.
In the case of final-salary schemes, as indeed with public service pensions, the concept is that young people pay for the old; that one generation supports the next.
It is not only the demographics that are against the old economies of western Europe, but also the so-called social model.
This much prized social model seems to consist of 40% youth unemployment, welfare dependency and the break-up of the traditional family.
Thanks to the economic absurdities of this place, as well as of national government, we cannot rely on the generational support system any longer.
Indeed, in the United Kingdom, it is politically even worse: there are over GBPÂ 800Â billion of unfunded public service pensions, with recruitment in the public sector out of control.
Pension funds in the private sector have been taxed since 1977, taking over GBPÂ 5.5Â billion every year out of ordinary peopleâs savings, whilst politicians enjoy privileged pensions at the expense of the hard-pressed taxpayer.
Indeed, if public companies now fail to show pension liabilities in their accounts, the director would face prison, yet national government finance ministers flout the rules daily.
In my own constituency there is a company called Ballast Nedam which has simply abandoned its pensioners in a most disgraceful way and set up a new company to avoid its responsibilities.
This is quite against the directive, which has failed to be implemented.
Is it not interesting how keen governments are to standardise car heaters, windscreen wipers and spirit bottles but, when real people need help, as usual the European Union is found wanting?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, first the operating framework and the advantages of occupational pension funds must be clarified.
They are financial market institutions and cannot be connected to or it cannot be implied that they can gradually acquire such scope that they can even partially replace the social security systems.
The social security systems must continue to guarantee general coverage of workers and they are public systems; in other words, if the insurance fund cannot pay pension benefits and liabilities, the state must meet their financial liabilities.
By contrast, if occupational pension funds are unable to meet their liabilities, there is no financial intervention or guarantee by the state.
However, I clearly support the fact that these funds are useful as credit institutions which undertake to guarantee auxiliary pensions, insofar as they are decided within the framework of collective agreements.
Of course, it must be emphasised that they only provide a retirement income in the case of workers, creating a degree of discrimination against those who do not have stable employment or who work part time.
It should also be emphasised that these credit institutions, these funds, only have the facility for cross-border cooperation with countries in the present eurozone.
On the basis of these characteristics and the development of the application of the legislation to the Member States, it is advisable for the directive to be promoted in all the Member States, but to become more flexible.
What we want is to integrate the directive into national law and, most importantly, for it to be accepted by the social partners, by employers and employees.
In this direction, it does not seem to make sense to use averages in order to ascertain the breadth of coverage of the workforce by the funds in question or the capitalisation of these funds and their accumulated reserves as a percentage of GDP or per insured.
On the contrary, highlighting the factors which contributed to the development of the institution in specific individual countries, where the confidence of the workforce attains an average of 45%, also appears to be of exceptional importance.
The parameters which contribute to the serious disparity in the application of this directive in the various Member States need to be abolished.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Mr President, having already had the experience yesterday lunchtime of the entrance to the Parliament building being blocked by Strasbourgâs taxi drivers for three-quarters of an hour, I made the discovery this morning that German taxis, evidently on the instructions of our head of security, Mr Suarez, were no longer being allowed to drive onto Parliamentâs precincts, so that passengers had to alight from them outside.
Moreover, one taxi driver told me that no reason had been given for this.
I regard this sort of thing as an absolute scandal, and as discrimination, and I call on the House authorities to withdraw the order that people are no longer to be allowed in.
I will also be ascertaining, in an hourâs time, whether taxis are again being allowed to drive in.
I really do wonder how it has come to pass that we in this place should give in to pressure from the street yesterday and prohibit taxis from driving on to Parliamentâs precincts in the way they used to.
Â Â  The first thing I can tell you about that is that the possibility of some sort of instruction from within Parliament can be ruled out with absolute certainty.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the French taxi driversâ organisations have been up to something.
There will be official consultations about this, and the administration will be able to deal with it immediately.
Â Â  The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditorsâ annual report for 2004.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me thank you, on behalf of the members of the European Court of Auditors, for the invitation to the debate on the Courtâs report â its 28th â on the financial year 2004, which I presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control yesterday evening.
In this, my first year in office as the President of the Court, I am glad to be able to be present at the commencement of the annual process of giving discharge in respect of the handling of the EUâs Budget.
Among the main sources for the annual report are the financial audits and checks on legality and propriety that the Court has carried out.
By way of contrast, the general practice is to publish the Courtâs findings on financial soundness in the form of special reports.
What made the financial year 2004 noteworthy was the accession of 10 new Member States, which meant that the estimates for payments rose from EURÂ 98 billion in 2003 to EURÂ 105 billion in 2004.
Improvements in planning and in management made possible a marked increase in the use of funds in comparison with previous years.
The surplus in 2004 â EURÂ 2.7 billion â was significantly lower than that in 2003, being, indeed, half the amount.
I would now like to consider the main statements in the Courtâs Statement of Assurance, also known as the âDASâ, starting with the statement on the reliability of the accounts.
When considering the financial year 2004, the Court came to the conclusion that the consolidated financial statements gave a faithful picture of the income and expenditure for the year and of the financial position at its end, with the exception of the entry for âsundry debtorsâ.
As was the case in the past, the accounting system used to draw up the annual accounts for 2004 is not equal to the task of listing all the assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, although it has to be said that the Commission made distinct progress in introducing accrual accounting in time for the financial year 2005.
At the time of the audit, though, it did appear to the Court that further progress would be needed, as the figures needed to draw up the opening balances for 2005 had not yet been validated by the Commissionâs authorising officers.
If appropriate action is not taken by the end of this year, the reliability of the accounts for 2005 may well be compromised by the defects highlighted by the Court.
As regards the lawfulness and regularity of the underlying transactions, the Court stated, in its Statement of Assurance, that consideration of the financial year 2004 led the Court to the conclusion that the supervision and monitoring systems that had been installed were operating effectively and that the underlying transactions, considered overall in relation to receipts, commitments, administrative expenditure and the pre-accession strategy as part of the payment appropriations were lawful and regular.
As regards the other appropriations â agricultural expenditure, structural measures, and both the internal and external policy areas, the Court again finds itself unable to give unreserved confirmation.
The supervision and monitoring systems were not yet fully installed, were not yet operating effectively, and payments continue to be largely blighted by errors.
The Court is able to report, and for the first time, that the efforts by the Commission and the Member States in connection with the introduction of the Integrated Administration and Control Systemâ abbreviated to âIACSâ â which covers 59% of agricultural expenditure, have had a positive effect.
When properly used, IACS is a highly effective instrument for reducing to an acceptable level the risk of irregular outgoings.
I would now like to discuss in greater detail the specific assessments of the individual areas of activity as contained in the Statement of Assurance.
The Court came to the view that transactions relating to receipts were conducted lawfully and in good order, but systemic faults were discovered in the handling of GNI own resources, both within the Commission and at Member State level.
In the same way as in previous years, the Court has found more evidence indicating that errors are still endemic in expenditure under the common agricultural policy as a whole.
Although the Court has stated that IACS is effective when used properly, there is, in the case of agricultural expenditure not made under IACS or for which IACS was not used in an appropriate manner, a higher risk of irregularities by reason of weaknesses in the monitoring systems.
The Court, having conducted spot-checks on the structural programmes, again found weaknesses in all of their administration and control systems at Member State level.
On auditing the Member States, the Court found such weaknesses as the failure to carry out checks or to document them, the failure to check eligibility criteria for funding and lack of evidence of the co-funded services having been performed.
The Member Statesâ returns of expenditure, on the basis of which the Commission makes payments, have revealed frequent errors.
The Court examined a spot-check of 167 projects and discovered a broad spectrum of problems, including a large number of cases in which expenditure was reported on projects not eligible for grants.
In the internal policy areas directly administered by the Commission, the Court discovered that the supervision and control systems â despite the progress achieved in some areas â did not operate in an appropriate manner, and that there was a high incidence of errors in the underlying transactions.
The complexity of regulations is a frequent cause of error.
It seems likely that the risk of error will remain high for as long as the legal framework remains unchanged and procedures are not simplified.
The main cause for this state of affairs, which shows no improvement over against previous years, was, in the main, the entry of excessive or non-eligible costs or the absence of documentation, for example evidence of services paid for having actually been rendered.
Turning to expenditure on external policy areas, the Court found that the systems had been improved and that few errors were being made in the underlying transactions at delegation level, but weaknesses were again found in the internal monitoring systems of the organisations tasked with the implementation of projects, along with a fairly high incidence of errors.
Overall, the Court was able to pass a favourable verdict on the pre-accession strategy, as the underlying transactions were essentially lawful and in order.
The supervision and monitoring systems in the central Commission offices, the delegations and the certifying authorities are fundamentally reliable and function well in practice.
The Court did, however, uncover weaknesses at national level in the systems of the implementing organisations in Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and other Sapard countries.
The underlying transactions in the area of administrative expenditure were essentially lawful and regular, and the supervision and control systems generally worked in an appropriate manner.
What are the most significant statements that can be made on the basis of this?
The Court has established that there were, again, fundamental illegalities and irregularities in much of the payment appropriations at the level of the underlying transactions.
These were attributable to the risks inherent in the transactions themselves and the fact that the supervision and monitoring systems fail to limit the risk of irregularities with an acceptable degree of effectiveness.
It was, however, evident that improvements had been made to the systems, particularly to IACS, the most important system for supervising and monitoring agricultural expenditure by the Member States, but also to the systems in the Commission, where the process of reforming the administration and finance systems, initiated in 2000, has produced good results.
Much, however, remains to be done, particularly at Member State level.
The legislation, rules and procedures applicable to expenditure are still often over-complicated.
There are, in any case, risks inherent in much of the expenditure, the sole evidence for which is to be found in statements by its recipients.
It has to be said that the European Union has itself expanded to a considerable degree, and has undergone major changes, since the DAS was introduced in 1994.
In the eleven intervening years, annual expenditure on payments has risen from EURÂ 60 billion to EURÂ 100 billion, whilst the number of Member States has increased from 12 to 25.
It follows that management has expanded and become more complex with the involvement of an ever-increasing number of authorities and organisations.
This, in turn, makes ever more effective systems for supervision and monitoring necessary.
In its Opinion No 2/2004 on the âsingle auditâ model, the Court proposed the creation of a common internal audit framework including every level of administration, whether Community institutions, Member States and recipient countries.
The Courtâs Opinion on the âsingle auditâ model was a contribution to policy debate on the improvement of administration and control of Community funds.
The Commission has gone even further by adopting what it called a roadmap for the creation of an integrated internal audit framework.
This roadmap will serve as the basis for the extension of the reform to the management of all types of funds, notably to those areas of administration that are shared with the Member States; it is here that cooperation between the Commission and the Member States is indeed crucially important.
The Court welcomes this initiative on the part of the Commission for a roadmap.
In its capacity as the EUâs external auditor, the Court will closely observe progress and assess the effects of these changes on financial management and the control of the EUâs finances over the coming years.
It has to be said that the Courtâs position on another issue, that of the future of the finance, management and control of the common agricultural policy and the structural measures, should be taken into account in the final formulation of these important pieces of legislation.
The provisions relating to the retention of documents in the present draft Regulations on structural measures would make it impossible for the Court to audit some of the items of expenditure concerned.
The Court is well aware of its need, in a constantly changing Union, for continuing self-improvement and for the best possible use of its resources.
We aim to work for the interest of the European Union as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Although the view is sometimes expressed that the Court should give no further ammunition to those in whose interest it is that the EU should be depicted in a poor light, I am firmly persuaded that the public interest is best served by the intervention of an external auditing body, one that is capable, objectively and independently, of making clear and even-handed statements on the basis of objective facts.
There are those who see the latest events â the votersâ rejection of the draft constitution in two referenda in two Member States, and the difficulty of coming to any agreement on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective â as indicating a lack of confidence on the part of the public in the European Union and its institutions.
I am quite convinced that the EUâs legitimacy can be guaranteed only if our institutions function smoothly and if management â whether in the making of policy or in its implementation â is of high quality.
The Member States, too, must discharge their responsibilities in connection with the administration and control of much of the EUâs Budget.
The Court of Auditors has a key role in this respect: it must convey an independent, professional and objective picture of the way in which the EUâs finances are managed and help to ensure that change is in the public interest.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the President of the Court, Mr Weber, for the fair presentation of the 2004 annual report and the Members of the Parliament for giving me the opportunity to give the Commissionâs first reaction.
The Courtâs report is fair and balanced: it says that the Commission is having success in implementing tangible improvements in its management systems, but that many areas still need to be improved.
The Commission welcomes the Courtâs positive opinion on the reliability of the accounts, which faithfully reflect the revenue and expenditure of the Communities for the year and their financial position at the year-end.
The Court has only one reservation, which has been resolved through the introduction of the accrual-based accounting system in 2005.
This means that the accounts met their primary objective and that the accounts have been drawn up according to the provisions of the Financial Regulation in force.
The Court gives a positive assurance on the accounts, on revenue, on commitments, on pre-accession aid, and on administrative expenditure.
It is also satisfied with EDF development aid, some EURÂ 2.4Â billion outside the budget.
The Court also notes two key improvements since last year: in a large part of the common agricultural policy and in aid to candidate countries to the EU.
The system used to check much expenditure under the common agricultural policy â the integrated administration and control system (IACS) â is considered an effective control system in limiting the risk of irregular expenditure, when properly applied.
This system will be applied to an even greater percentage of agricultural expenditure in the coming years.
So simplifying greatly, in addition to the several positive assurances I have already mentioned, the Court is now reasonably satisfied with the systems of control and spending in an increasing part of the EU budget, roughly estimated to represent one third of the budget.
This is tangible and quantifiable progress towards a positive statement of assurance.
The conclusions of the Court have not always been fully understood by the general public and the media.
I liked very much the remark in the President of the Courtâs speech that makes it clear that the Courtâs qualified opinion on certain areas cannot be interpreted as meaning all transactions of the 2004 payment budget are affected by error, nor can it be interpreted as an indicator of fraud.
We must all understand the comprehensive nature of this large budget discharge exercise.
This procedure shows that the Commission is accountable to directly elected Members of Parliament.
This may be the eleventh consecutive non-positive Statement of Assurance, but I hope it is clear from my initial remarks this does not imply that we are not making progress.
Members of Parliament have pointed out repeatedly that the Commission alone cannot âproduceâ a positive DAS.
The 2003 discharge resolution gave very valuable guidance on how to further improve, and we are working to do that.
As you know, this Commission has proposed a âroadmap to an integrated internal control frameworkâ, looking for support in Parliament and Council.
While I am very grateful for Parliamentâs support on the roadmap, the ECOFIN Councilâs statement of 8Â November was not as radical as the Commission had hoped it would be; political declarations at national level were not accepted.
But a cascade of operational management declarations by payment and similar agencies is not an impossible goal, though a national synthesis report for each sector, similar to that which the Commission draws up on the basis of the annual activity reports of its directors-general, will be more difficult to achieve.
We will go ahead with our proposals.
Our action plan towards an integrated internal control framework will be published next month.
It is based on the results of the âgap assessmentâ between the control framework in place for all types of budgetary expenditure and the general principles defined by the Court in its opinion NoÂ 2/2004 on a single audit.
We hope that the legislation being finalised for the new series of programmes in the years after 2006 will reflect the new thinking.
The proposed revisions to the Financial Regulation and the implementing rules also reflect this thinking.
Court sampling reveals substantial errors that we are of course concerned to reduce to a minimum.
To do so, we are focusing and seeking assurance on the procedures for managing the risk of irregularity.
This is the way to ensure, within a limited resource base, that the costs of extra controls provide added benefits in terms of reducing risks of error.
I would especially mention here two quotations from the speech made by the President of the Court: âin structural matters, the Court found weaknesses in the management and control systems in the Member States across all programmesâ; and the second quotation: âin the area of internal policies the Court notes that the errors often stem from complicated rulesâ.
Certainly I agree with these remarks.
Need for simplification of rules was repeated yesterday at the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control but, if I look for the individuals who are responsible for the large number and complexity of the programmes and rules, I find hardly anyone.
Everybody talks about the need for simplification but, when business goes into detail, it is not so simple any more.
A large part of the complexity often comes not from the officials but from clients, policy makers, politicians in Member States and Members of the European Parliament.
The changes are often resisted by the same players.
I use this opportunity to call on all policy makers, when the creation of another goal, plan and programme is under consideration, to look critically at aspects of fiscal management and the need to control and audit these programmes.
There is a lot more to be said, but the budget discharge process is now only at the beginning and within the coming months Members of Parliament will have all the answers to their questions.
Parliament and the Commission will work together to finalise the process of discharge of the 2004 European budget.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is the eleventh time that we have been given a non-positive Statement of Assurance.
I no longer know whether I should say that this is scandalous; it has become customary.
Efforts have clearly been made all over the place, but, at the end of the day, this is an unachievable goal following the 11 examinations of the accounts by our Court of Auditors.
Things are improving, but not to a sufficient extent.
What is the political consequence of this non-positive Statement of Assurance?
Well, for our House, for our officials who have to take decisions, it is highly demoralising.
It seems a pointless effort to try to comply with the rules, because we never achieve a positive Statement of Assurance.
There is a lack of will to take responsibilities and all of the officials are tempted not to spend, in case there is any doubt and they have any problems.
It is therefore demoralising on the inside.
And on the outside?
A great loss of credibility.
What are the European citizens going to think if our Court of Auditors, for the eleventh time, says that the accounts are not managed here properly!
A scandal.
More of the same.
Very bad.
Even when there is a change of Parliament, a change of Commission, a change of make-up of the Council, things carry on in the same way.
Perhaps we should cast our minds back to the Santer Commission, which had to resign as a result of this kind of problem: it does not matter, things remain just as bad.
And the Member States?
Where is the British Presidency?
The Council spends 80%.
Where is the British Presidency?
It is not here: this really is scandalous, because the Council spends 4 out of every 5 euros but is not even attending this presentation of the accounts.
This really is scandalous.
The Member States are happy.
While their national courts approve their accounts, it is not their problem whether the Union, the money of all the Europeans, is managed properly or not.
There may even be some Member States that actually feel quite happy and say to themselves, âmy money is getting to the farmers, although I am not conforming precisely to the requirements that the Court of Auditors is demanding of meâ.
They are pleased with themselves.
They are not even here.
Mr President of the Court of Auditors, as you know, at the last discharge, this European Parliament called for national statements of conformity on the part of Finance Ministries.
The objective was to help the Court to publish a positive Statement of Assurance.
The ECOFIN of 8 November, as Commissioner Kallas has said, has rejected such national statements.
I would like to ask you, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, about what you think of the usefulness of these statements to your work, in terms of your relations with the national authorities, and about the future without such statements.
Finally, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, it is of no use to us for you to say that the average across a class of 25 Member States is a fail.
Tell us â and this well help you â which are the three best Member States and which are the three worst.
Â Â  MrÂ President, thank you for giving me the floor.
I should also like to thank the Court of Auditors for a constructive annual report.
One of the areas in which the EU has the biggest image problem of all is specifically in relation to the issue of how the Communityâs money is managed.
We know from numerous opinion polls that Europeâs populations do not have a particularly high degree of confidence that their money â that is, the money they pay in taxes â is properly managed.
This distrust is partly justified and partly based on misunderstandings.
I wish to thank the Court of Auditors for an annual report that helps us MEPs fulfil two objectives: firstly, that of eradicating the misunderstandings and, secondly, that of coming up with good advice and helping solve those problems that do in actual fact exist, for problems there undoubtedly are.
With regard to myths and misunderstandings, anyone who takes the trouble actually to read the Court of Auditorsâ annual report will be able to see that the scare stories circulated by the press and also by the opponents of the EU here in Parliament are not credible.
It will become apparent that all these stories are based on myths and misunderstandings and that matters are not as bad as the frequent horror stories would suggest.
Particularly by highlighting the agricultural sphere, in which we have now reached a point at which approximately 60% of the resources are managed properly, the annual report documents the fact that big improvements have taken place.
That is obviously a good thing.
Some praise is in order, because progress is being made.
That being said, it must naturally be emphasised that the mere fact that improvements are taking place in certain areas does not of course mean that we can live with the overall picture.
It is simply not good enough.
I agree with the previous speaker, MrÂ PomÃ©s Ruiz, who said that it is scandalous.
That brings me, of course, to the second task.
The first task was to explode myths.
The second task is, of course, more important, for it consists of finding out how we are to solve these problems.
I quite agree, moreover, that, on this subject, a clear picture emerges.
It is in those areas in which there is shared administration â in other words, in which the Member States have just as high a degree of responsibility for managing the money â that the problem area in fact lies.
The Member States are simply not complying with their responsibilities and are not doing enough.
I agree that we must do further work on the recommendation made last year to the effect that there is a need for what have been called political statements from the finance ministers of each individual country every single year.
Over the next few months, we must debate the annual report in more detail and implement the discharge procedure.
I can now already see that the responsibility of the Member States is one of the issues on which we must focus most of all.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too would like to add my thanks to the President of the Court of Auditors for his report.
I can only echo the sentiments that have already been expressed by other speakers, namely that it is extremely regrettable that, for the eleventh time in succession, a positive Statement of Assurance has not been forthcoming, and that is something that will stick in peopleâs minds.
We must work on turning the DAS into a positive one, and as far as I can see, the root of the problem lies with the Member States.
It is unfortunate that the President did not take the trouble to be here today.
The other benches are also exceptionally devoid of representative of the Member States this morning.
I do not know whether that is symptomatic of the interest in financial control as a whole.
To me, the essence still is last yearâs resolution in which we insisted that the highest financial authority of each Member State â and I am pleased that these are listening so intently â should be called to account every year about the spending of funds.
This is something to which most of the Member States are opposed.
This is, I think, something that this House must continue to work on.
The suggestion mooted in the Court of Auditorsâ report, namely that certification bodies be established for all the components of the budget other than agriculture, strikes me as one that needs further exploration.
It is to be welcomed that a positive DAS can be given for pre-accession aid.
In 2004, experience in the new Member States had not yet been taken into consideration.
We hope that in future, the control mechanisms will remain in place in the new countries too.
I welcome the peer review, which the President of the Court of Auditors did not mention this morning, but did announce yesterday, about the running of the Court of Auditors itself.
No institution can be without criticism, without constructive criticism that is.
If the Court of Auditorsâ work over the past few years were to be assessed, that could, to my mind, benefit the whole functioning of the Court of Auditors in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, this debate is kick-starting the 2004 discharge procedure.
An initial cursory reading of the annual report tells us that the Commission has organised itself more effectively since the fall of the Santer Commission and since the start of the reform process.
The good news is that spending of the European budget has improved for the third year running.
The bad news is that, for the eleventh time in succession, the Court of Auditors has failed to issue a positive Statement of Assurance (DAS).
There is therefore no certainty about the reliability of the figures.
The reason is clear: the monitoring and control systems have either not yet been implemented, or they are ineffective, or the payments show up errors of significant importance.
We are talking about the agricultural and structural policy, as well as the internal and external policy, which involve more than 4/5 of the entire European budget of 105 billion.
A central problem in this connection is that 80 to 85% of the management and supervision is shared with the Member States.
The Finance Ministers refuse to accept their part of the responsibility in this respect, which is an absolute disgrace.
They want money from Brussels, but not the accountability that goes with it.
Once again, the annual report calls attention to the problem of export restitutions which account for EUR 3.6 billion, or 7.5% of the agricultural budget.
In terms of value, though, they account for 26% of the irregularities reported to the Commission.
The Member States should physically check 5% of the export restitution dossiers, but they fail miserably in that respect too.
I was pleased to see that point 4.30 and note 20 of the annual report contained the recommendation to have the inspection take place at the level of the final beneficiaries, and I quote: âsuch a reach would form a stronger and clearer chain in terms of accountability for CAP spending.â
That is why I would make another urgent plea to make the lists of final beneficiaries public.
That is precisely what Estonia, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands did.
Flanders and Belgium, on the other hand, opted for mock transparency by lumping all the figures together, which made proper analysis impossible.
We can, however, learn a great deal from those tables in terms of anomalies in our agricultural policy.
For example, over the past five years, Philip Morris, the tobacco giant, has received EUR 6.5 million in the Netherlands for adding sugar to cigarettes.
Given the high sugar price at EU level, Philip Morris has been compensated for this.
Similarly, the KLM catering service received EUR 646Â 000, because it uses sugar, dairy products, vegetables and fruit on flights outside of the European Union.
They are considered as exports and are therefore eligible for export restitution aid.
Surely that is too crazy for words, but it is only the tip of the iceberg.
Europe, the European Union and the European agricultural policy will be acceptable to its citizens only if these excrescences are addressed.
I wish all rapporteurs in the discharge procedure, and particularly Mr Mulder, much success and I hope that in the next few months, we will be able to carry out our work effectively and issue sound discharge reports in the April part-session next year.
Â Â  . Mr President, here we go again.
I stood here nearly a year ago to comment on the tenth anniversary of the European Court of Auditorsâ refusal to sign off the EU accounts.
I said then and I will say again that it is time to admit that this form of European government is an abject failure and that it should be abolished.
The nation states would be far better off looking after their own interests.
Personally I would not trust the European Commission, past or present, to look after my grandchildrenâs pocket money.
Three weeks ago I made a speech in this House calling for the 2006 budget to be rejected on the grounds that this Parliament has no business authorising further expenditure when we have the shame of a decade of dodgy unapproved accounts behind us.
Well, this is year eleven; it is a shameful situation that cannot continue.
The Courtâs latest report is another litany of the failings of European Commission bureaucracy.
We were promised that a new computer system would close all the loopholes.
The reality is that that the accounts will still be about as watertight as a colander.
The Members of this institution should feel a strong obligation to the taxpayers of Europe, for it is their money that is pouring through the holes of the colander.
The British Government is under an obligation to spend taxpayersâ money wisely and yet it goes on tamely writing the cheques to the European Union.
Make no mistake, I shall go on being the conscience of this institution.
I shall keep pointing out what a disaster it is.
My conscience is clear.
Is yours, I ask?
Incidentally, I look at the attendance of Members here today as an indication of the importance they attach to the handling of the taxpayersâ money by the European Union.
Enough said.
Â Â  Mr President, what Europe could really do with, particularly under present circumstances, is a Court of Auditors like a dynamic tiger, prowling through the landscape and pouncing where necessary.
This annual report, though, is yet more evidence that it is not, perhaps, really a predator, but rather a toothless creature sitting in a cage.
It is toothless because it is impossible that such an institution should have teeth.
If you compare the powers of the European Court of Auditors with those of its Bavarian counterpart, the two are worlds apart.
I know of only one institution constituted as a Court of Auditors that is even worse equipped in terms of theoretical and practical powers than the European one, and that is the Audit Office in Vienna.
Whenever discussion turns to how it might act transnationally, the constant refrain goes like this: âI can assure you that the Court of Auditors welcomes any debate on potential improvements to the audit procedure.â
What I suggest is that you should be constructive.
Put out a memorandum in which you, the Court of Auditors, cannot really discharge your duties because you lack the powers, because there are things that you are not allowed to do, and because the way in which your staff are selected â which, politically speaking, is what makes everything happen â means that you are not in a position to perform your functions.
Do that, and you really will be doing Europe a service.
That would be a first step towards transparency and towards making monitoring possible, both of which we need if we are to help this Union of ours regain its credibility.
Â Â  Mr President, listening to the UK Independence Party talking about the Commission not being able to manage its grandchildrenâs pocket money, I must say that I would rather have the Commission managing it than the UK Independence Party!
In any case, I would like to make three main points, firstly a general point, and then two points aimed at the Commission and then the Council.
My first and general point is that I think this is a good report.
The aim of the report is to improve the control environment as it stands, to make the use of money more transparent and more understandable and to get rid of fraud and mismanagement.
There have been some improvements but, as many have said, a lot remains to be done.
Having said that, I do not think any company would receive a positive Statement of Assurance â DAS â using the method that the Court of Auditors does.
My second point is that I would like to congratulate the Commission.
I know that it gets a lot of flak for the way in which it uses the money at its disposal, some of which is justified, but most of which is not.
It has made a lot of improvements.
I like what it has done on establishing a roadmap to a positive DAS and what it has done on accounting.
My final point is a criticism of the Council, not merely of the fact it is not present today but of the fact that â just as the UK Independence Party was doing a second or two ago â it is trying to create the illusion that everything is the fault of the Commission or the other EU institutions.
That is simply not the case.
Eighty per cent of the money used in the European Union is used in the Member States.
That is why I condemn the fact that, at the Ecofin Council two weeks ago, the Finance Ministers once again refused to sign a declaration of assurances.
I think we could go very much further in this whole process of the management of finances if the Finance Ministers were to take their responsibility.
To sum up: one, we are improving the system; two, the problem is not the Commission, but the Member States; and three, I am optimistic that in five yearsâ time we will have a positive DAS.
Â Â  Mr President, 2004 was the year of enlargement, so the 2004 annual report is the first that relates to all twenty-five Member States.
This is another reason why it is good that the report before us gives a positive, realistic and balanced statement regarding how European Union money was spent in both the old and new Member States.
The Court of Auditorsâ Annual Report 2004 shows the impact of the reforms launched last year.
This was the aim of the report produced by my colleague, Terry Wynn, and adopted by Parliament by a large majority; it is also the aim of the integrated administration and control system announced by the European Commission and Commission Vice-President, Siim Kallas.
The reform is based on mutual trust and close cooperation between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Auditors.
In addition to these, to bring the reform about the Council would need to intervene to introduce declarations of assurance at national level, but there seems to be continued resistance to this.
Without it, however, we cannot move forward; we need a declaration of assurance from the Council too.
Â Â  Reviewing the results of the audit of the Community financial accounts for the year 2004, I am delighted to see that the auditorsâ evaluation in respect of the administration of pre-accession funding allocated to my homeland, Lithuania, has been positive.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the general evaluation of the status of EU accounts.
A paradoxical situation has arisen where the beneficiaries are unable to access the funds appropriated to them since the various supervisory requirements are overly-complex and disproportionate in relation to the benefit obtained, while the auditors maintain that such requirements do not provide sufficient grounds for debate.
It is obvious that the current support accounting system prevents the attainment of the main fiscal objective of the EU â to transparently and efficiently use the funds of the EU budget.
Therefore I would like to call on the European Commission and the auditors to urge the implementation of the reform plan and speak more decidedly of the problems that constitute vast and inexhaustible resources.
I am optimistic in believing that the reforms and an integrated internal control system may be instrumental in coping with the outstanding problems.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to begin by issuing a protest against our having to debate the Court of Auditorsâ report without having access to it in advance, a state of affairs that puts us at a big disadvantage.
Fortunately, we recognise more or less everything from previous years.
We could perhaps have read last yearâs report and put forward the same views.
What we have here are the same problems and the same accounting deficiencies, and we learn that the problems will remain. We are told that the Court of Auditors âcannot guaranteeâ etc.
The talk is of dicey transactions, defects in the monitoring systems and hosts of errors etc, etc. There is a road map for an internal monitoring system, which I greatly welcome, but matters are mostly as they were before, that is to say in a bad state.
I wish nonetheless to point out that the European institutions are of course audited by the European Court of Auditors, while the national systems are obviously audited by various national auditing bodies.
As in so many other areas, there applies, in this context too, a rule whereby an 80/20 ratio applies according to which a fifth of the cashflows may be controlled here and the remaining portion on a national basis.
It is incredibly important for us to put forward a proposal concerning the way in which we can produce some structured cooperation on this issue.
Otherwise, the Court of Auditorâs task will continue to be impossible in practice.
The main problems we see stem from the common agricultural policy, the Structural Funds and the Committee of the Regions.
There is good cause for abolishing the agricultural policy, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee.
These are all things that belong to another era and perform no function in todayâs EU.
Instead, amounts from the Structural Funds should begin to go directly to the EUâs poorer Member States. All the problems about which we are now talking would then largely disappear.
Â Â  â At a moment when Europe is not going through a good time in public opinion it is not easy to explain to the people that the European Union, which for many is a model of how things should be done well, is in fact not only not perfect, but it needs to do much more to guarantee that the money passed to it is in fact being used as it should.
The report we have in front of us is a case of dÃ©jÃ  vu; it told us again that the Court cannot be sure that every Euro spent was in fact spent in a completely regular way, although the report notes as well that some progress has been made in a problematic sector such as agriculture, which after all takes up an enormous share of the budget.
However it would be a mistake if we give up looking for a more effective system of budgetary control.
On the one hand, we feel a sense of sorrow when we hear that there are still a lot of shortcomings in the control system, however, on the other hand there is the frustration that it looks like we are always seeking further perfection, a perfection represented by the DAS system, up to a perfection which year after year we are continually realising that yes, we can come closer to it, but that we will surely never reach.
Now we can either play the game of those who want to make everything look black or else admit that nobody is perfect and everybody shoulder their responsibilities.
This applies both to us at the European Parliament, as well as to the European Commission, but also to the Member States themselves.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much want to congratulate the Court of Auditors on this report.
In the short time in which it has been available to us, it has become evident to me that it contains much data that provides us with outstanding criteria for what is, in the final analysis, our task â that of giving or withholding discharge.
So often has it been said that the finance ministers have to sign their accounts, but let us consider the areas where it is the Commission alone that has responsibility for what is spent: it is there that we will see terrible things.
In the internal policy sphere, six out of eleven Directors-General are unable to give an unconditional guarantee.
Show me a minister of finance who would do so in their position!
I have never come across one yet.
This outstanding report leads me to press on the Court of Auditors the urgency of our focusing on the directly-managed expenditure and trying to get that absolutely right.
If we do that, we will be much more successful in our dealings with the Member States than we are at present.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can echo what Mr BÃ¶sch said.
I think we are oversimplifying things if we say that, as 80% of funds are administered by the Member States, it is for them to see to it that everything is in order.
We have indeed had problems over recent years, and it is true to say that they led to the Commission standing down in 1999, but none of them had to do with resources managed at national level â all of them, on the contrary, were administered by the Commission itself.

We, in the Terence Wynn report â and let me make this quite clear â said that we wanted to involve the national and â where they exist â provincial Courts of Auditors in the discharge procedure.
Looking today at the way in which things are done at the national and European levels, it is clear to me that the two are incompatible.
Do not misunderstand me: I object to the idea that what we in Europe do, those things that you are there to do, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, should be handed over to the national systems; instead, we should be giving some thought, where the auditing framework is concerned, to doing things the other way around.
There is room for improvement in Europe, too, and we can certainly learn from the Member States.
What is needed is for the Heads of State or Government to be astute enough and wise enough to provide the legal framework that is needed to make that possible.
It is not your problem, Mr Weber; it is a problem for those from whom you receive your mandate, and that is not us, but rather the Heads of State or Government.
Speaking, among other things, as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, let me say quite plainly that we need to denounce the attitude they adopt, of not wanting to pay anything into the EU, of wanting their own countries to get as much back as possible out of it, while not wanting to let anyone in Brussels see what is going on.
It is this attitude that we have to deal with; that is where we have to make a start.
If we do, we will really have done something for Europe, for its credibility and for its people.
The Court of Auditorsâ report is important, but not crucial; what is crucial is what we in this House do with it.
I look forward to the debates in the Committee on the Control of Budgets and to the discharge procedure, which will be completed early next year.
Â Â  Mr President, a week ago the Ecofin Council rejected Parliamentâs proposals for national declarations, which in effect means that we will not see a positive DAS in the foreseeable future.
The Ecofin proposals are a poor substitute for real action and came out of a two-day panel of experts meeting which I attended.
It was a meeting that reminded me of Margaret Thatcherâs comments at a similar meeting when she complained of being surrounded by people who found every reason for not doing things and not changing things rather than giving her solutions to the problems she had.
Parliament needs to know which Member States agree, and which disagree, with its position.
In all seriousness, the comment from the UK Independence Party should not be disregarded.
Why, indeed, should we agree a new financial perspective when supervisory and control systems are so blatantly flawed within the Member States?
That is a message that must be conveyed to the Council loudly and strongly.
Â Â  . Mr President, our being able to present our report to policymakers, among them the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Kallas, makes this a great day for the Court of Auditors.
We are grateful for the responses our activity elicits from policymakers.
Our report shows that considerable improvements have been achieved.
Without doubt, there is a certain amount that remains to be done in some areas, not only by the Commission, but also by the Member States.
The importance of the declarations has already been mentioned, and I can only agree with that, but they are not everything.
What we really should be doing is pressing on to find the source of the errors and seek there the incentive for reforms.
Hundreds of times over, we have done spot-checks and examined transactions.
We have discovered hundreds of errors â errors both of form and of substance.
The Commission knows about these errors, and it will deal with them.
The Member States know about them too.
This is where we should start.
I believe â and I am saying this also for Mr Martinâs benefit â that our mandate is an excellent one; we are satisfied with it, and we need no other.
International comparisons show us in a very good light.
What matters is that our conclusions be taken seriously and acted on in good time.
It is not enough for us to bring in a new system; we also need to make use of it and make it practicable.
What has also become apparent is that the legal framework needs to be simplified.
There are many areas in which no improvements will be made if procedures continue to be so complicated.
I also have to say that, if we apply such rigorous standards to the offices and departments we audit, then we cannot complain if the same standards are applied to us.
It is planned that this should be done through a peer review.
We are always being told that the Court of Auditors wants more audits.
On the contrary, we want no such thing.
We do not want more audits; we want more effective, more efficient audits, from which lessons can be drawn in due course.
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
Â Â  â It is disappointing and frustrating that the Statement of Assurance should once again be negative.
This means that there is still no guarantee that spending is legal and above-board and means that doubts persist as to the reliability of the accounting practices.
Who should be held responsible for this?
The Member States, for the methodology used and for the poor implementation of the payment system?
The Commission which, in accordance with Article 274 of the Treaty, is responsible for executing the European budget?
Let us draw some lessons from the observations made by the Court of Auditors: it is vital to make the national administrations aware of their responsibilities so that the European appropriations may be properly accounted for.
The Court also has to provide a clear outline of the practical measures that the Commission has to adopt in order to achieve a positive DAS.
In Europeâs present context of disrepute, the weak points in the management and control systems must not allow the Eurosceptics to undermine the fundamental principles and main policies of the Union, which are aimed at strengthening territorial, economic and social cohesion.
The Commission and the Member States must enhance their efforts in order to achieve a positive DAS. The credibility of the Union and the peopleâs confidence in it depend on this being done.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission Statement on the Legislative and Work Programme for 2006.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, 2005 has not been an easy year for Europe.
Europe has had to face terrorism, social uncertainty and natural disasters.
As for the institutions, we have had to face all these difficulties without the help of a Constitution and, until now, without having a multiannual budgetary framework.
The Union has been led to wonder about the integration process itself, but we are convinced and our Commission is convinced that there has never been such a need for the European Union as there is today.
We are proud of the determined and clear response that the Commission has been able to give to this situation.
Working closely with Parliament, we have all been equal to the challenges.
Here are some examples of what we have accomplished together: the renewal of the Lisbon Strategy; a revision of the Stability and Growth Pact that will strengthen the credibility of Europeâs economic governance; more solidarity, thanks to the adoption of a renewed social agenda; full recognition of the key role played by social dialogue and the actors involved in this dialogue; the fight for a cleaner environment, by means of the adoption of thematic strategies and the pursuit of our international action in the sphere of climate change; greater security thanks to the implementation of our ambitious Hague Programme in parallel with a large number of other initiatives, in particular our proposal on data retention; the promotion of European values worldwide â in this regard, let us cite the commitment made to double EU aid for developing countries and the adoption of a strategy for Africa; strengthening our partnerships with our strategic allies such as the United States and pursuing an open dialogue with new and important partners such as China; and, finally, opening accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia.
The Commission has assumed its responsibilities.
Our guiding principle was, and remains, the general European interest.
The set of initiatives that we developed in 2005 is the first tangible expression of the strategic objectives that we set ourselves over five years.
The programme that we are presenting today remains faithful to the objectives that we adopted at the start of our mandate: prosperity, solidarity in an enlarged Europe, security and a strengthened role for Europe in the world.
These objectives remain pertinent.
They are shared by the three institutions which derive their main impetus for action from them.
I can see there a sign of the partnership for European renewal that I wanted to place at the centre of our action.
The framework agreement is a tangible expression of this partnership between our two institutions.
It is a qualitative leap in the development of the policy initiatives.
It has enabled a close and targeted dialogue to take place between the parliamentary committees and the Commissioners on the best way to translate the annual policy strategy into practical initiatives.
I am keen to tell you that this dialogue has made a positive contribution to the programme that I am presenting to you today.
I hope that you will recognise your ideas, including those that you expand upon in todayâs debate, in the action that we plan to carry out in 2006.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, releasing Europeâs full potential is the approach maintained by the Commission in drafting its legislative and work programme for 2006.
What are the key actions for 2006?
First of all, action to bring about prosperity.
2006 will be a crucial year for the implementation of the renewed Lisbon Strategy.
The Commission will fully undertake its role in instigating, managing and supporting the Member Statesâ efforts.
The Member Statesâ national reform programmes, which we are already analysing, will play a fundamental role in this process.
We need to link these programmes to our political priorities, to improve the Unionâs economic governance and to strengthen national and European efforts in relation to reform and investment â an investment at national level, but also at European level with a view to tomorrowâs economy, to innovation, to knowledge and to new infrastructures.
These two types of investment â at national and at European level â must go hand in hand.
We have to support these efforts by means of other initiatives, such as the proposals aimed at supplementing the single market, the promotion of geographical and professional mobility and, for example, the creation of a European Technology Institute.
I emphasise in particular the proposals on the single market made by Parliament itself in its resolution on the work programme.
I should like to highlight, in this context, the importance of the measures aimed at providing a framework that supports the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the main source of jobs in Europe.
The second aspect relates to solidarity.
Solidarity remains a fundamental part of European integration, and I should like to speak in this Chamber about solidarity between employers and employees.
I should also like to speak about solidarity between generations, through sound management of natural resources, including marine resources, and the implementation of a new strategy for sustainable development â by the way, we shall present this new strategy in December.
Solidarity between generations is also brought about by creating jobs for young people and by seeking fair solutions for pension funding.
Let us not forget, either, solidarity between men and women, solidarity between the most prosperous Member States and the less prosperous ones and solidarity between the European Union and the rest of the world, in particular with regard to developing countries.
2006 will be a crucial year for attacking on all these fronts.
On the subject of security, priority will be given to improving coordination in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
We saw how much influence Community legislation had in these areas.
By way of example, I can assure you that one of those accused of having carried out the London attacks was extradited from Italy to the United Kingdom within less than 50Â days.
Such a procedure would undoubtedly have taken several years in the absence of Community instruments.
This is therefore an area in which the people, including people from the countries least enthusiastic about European integration, are clearly asking more, and not less, of Europe and the European Union.
Furthermore, we will be doing a great deal of work in the area of illegal immigration, as we have said.
The problems encountered by some of our Member States are not exclusive to these countries: in reality, such problems affect the whole of Europe.
We have to stand firm in fighting against this scourge, in collaboration with the Member States.
Of course, the immigration issue is not just a security issue.
It has a security dimension, admittedly, because illegal immigration has to be fought against.
Yet, it is our responsibility to act at the same time with regard to development aid in the countries of origin.
We have to combine our approach to immigration with our approach to development and, at the same time, we have to do everything possible to ensure the harmonious integration of communities of foreign origin in our countries.
We also intend to carry out our action in the area of health protection and consumer protection, an area that also comes under the broader sphere of security.
One crucial element will also consist in the development of a rapid reaction capacity on the part of those responsible for civil protection.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the 96 priority initiatives that we are presenting to you are together the proof of our commitment to these objectives: prosperity, solidarity, security and the promotion of Europe in the world.
Yet, the credibility of these objectives will also depend on their quality.
That is why the Commission will be rigorously enforcing the enhanced methods contained in its âBetter lawmakingâ programme.
These methods are not an end in themselves, but a means of turning the intentions, which we share, into a reality; a reality that our people will really be able to experience in their everyday lives.
Our ambition for 2006 extends to Europeâs becoming a more influential global partner.
On this subject, furthermore, 2006 must also provide tangible results: tangible results as regards the enlargement process and the stabilisation and association process; tangible results for our neighbourhood policy, which represents a very important policy for stability in Europe and in its closer geographical context; tangible results as regards the fight against poverty, with our promise to double the amount of aid transformed into a tangible reality; and, finally, results as regards promoting European values in the world, in particular through support for the political transition and reconstruction in Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine.
One issue will dominate the international economic agenda in 2006: the completion of the Doha Development Round.
Pascal Lamy said that adjusting expectations for the ministerial in Hong Kong next month does not mean lowering our ambition for the Doha Development Round.
I agree.
The round is important to opening markets and freeing up trade.
In the European Union strong exports boost our growth.
We want the round to succeed.
That is why we made our recent strong and conditional â and I should like to underline âconditionalâ â offer on agriculture.
Europe has done more than anyone to keep this round on track.
Our commitment remains but now others have to move.
The focus of the round must be broader than just agriculture, important as it is.
There must be balance.
Therefore I call on our WTO partners to engage in a full negotiation, including on goods and services.
Europe does not need more lectures from countries that close their markets to the poorest and, in some cases, keep tariffs on agricultural products higher than our own.
I do not accept that some people put the blame on Europe because of this round.
In the European Commission we believe that these negotiations cannot simply be conducted for the benefit of a few large farm exporters in very rich or fast-developing countries.
There is a huge difference between the very poorest developing countries and those that are growing rapidly.
It is time to stop lecturing and start negotiating.
The costs of failure are high, not just for all trading nations, but also for the fair, rules-based international trading system we have worked so hard to create, as well as for global business confidence.
The international economy now needs some good news, especially because of the high costs of energy.
So we have an interest in this round succeeding.
That is not only in our interest, it is especially in the interest of the poorest countries.
That is why the Commission will put forward ideas before Hong Kong on how to make sure this really is a development round.
Tomorrow we will discuss the follow-up to Hampton Court.
The new consensus that began to emerge there links up with our debate today.
We saw, at the informal summit, a confirmation of the Commissionâs analysis on how to safeguard our values in a globalised world.
If we want to preserve our values we must modernise our policies.
We saw an agreement on areas where people want Europe to lead: science and innovation, higher education, energy, border management and immigration.
We also need a more coherent Europe as a global actor.
So many of our internal Community policies now have an external element: environment, migration, transport, energy and others. That is why the Commission will present ideas next year on improving the coherence of the European Unionâs external actions.
We are now preparing a concept paper on that matter.
The European institutions must play a central role in this process, rebuilding a consensus and reconnecting with citizens.
That is why I have announced today that the Commission will come forward with a new truly European energy policy in 2006.
It is good that at all levels in the European Union people now understand that it makes no sense to go it alone when dealing with energy challenges.
Even those who were most reluctant now see that this is a European issue and that we face the same challenges, such as rising prices, falling reserves, increasing dependency on a few parts of the world, and also the need to protect our environment.
We need a coherent energy policy for the 21st century, one that looks at all these issues and options in a calm, determined way.
We often forget what a remarkable accomplishment European integration is.
It is all too easy to forget that one of the achievements of 2005 was to make an enlarged European Union work and much of the credit for that must go to the new Member States.
I think we can, and will, do even better in 2006.
Very often we forget that now our Europe is not the ââ. Now Europe consists of 25 Member States that are free, independent and living in peace and democracy.
The challenge is to make this enlarged Europe work.
This year we made a very important contribution to meeting that challenge.
At the end of this week I am going to Prague and Budapest to see and support this new enlarged European Union.
I am confident, because there is a growing understanding that the endless debates about widening or deepening and about the market or social protection are at an end and that even in the middle of the difficulties we know, there is a growing awareness that we need a more European dimension if we want to solve the problems facing us.
A new consensus is emerging that a powerful, dynamic Europe cannot have 25 mini-markets in services or 25 mini-markets in energy, but that a single market also needs a powerful, dynamic political and social Europe.
The market alone is not enough.
The market alone cannot address concerns such as air safety, global warming or the integration of immigrants.
Yes, this is about pragmatic Europe, but pragmatism with principles, adding value in areas where we can make a difference, shaping policies that provide an answer to globalisation and meet the challenges and opportunities of our ageing population, a Europe that is part of the solution and not of the problem.
I see a parallel with the activity relating to the period of reflection in which you, as Members of the European Parliament, are heavily involved.
We must show as institutions that we are listening carefully to our citizens and that we are addressing their concerns.
That is why we will implement our Plan D for dialogue and democracy and count on open cooperation with Parliament.
I have left perhaps the most important message about the 2006 work programme until last.
Let us be frank.
The plans for 2006 will count for little without agreement next month on the financial perspectives.
That agreement is the test of whether Europe is on the move.
How can we deliver for our citizens on prosperity, solidarity and security without the means to achieve them?
Agreement on the financial perspectives is a key to unlocking Europeâs potential in 2006.
An enlarged, more diverse European Union needs more investment.
We have a duty of solidarity to the new Member States that look to the European Union for support in their rapid and remarkable progress in modernisation and reform.
We need a fair sharing of this burden.
No Member State can do enlargement on the cheap.
I trust in the common sense of the British Presidency to deliver a fair and balanced agreement next month.
I hope that it will do so by strengthening, not reducing, the ambition the Commission and Parliament share for an enlarged Europe.
I hope and believe that the proposals which I presented to you last month can help to unblock the negotiations.
My call to you today for 2006 is that we consolidate and build on this new consensus, that we restore that shared sense of purpose that will get Europe back on its feet; a united Europe acting collectively on matters that most concern our citizens.
In my view this is the best possible response to the ânoâ votes to the Constitution earlier this year.
It is also what lies at the heart of the Commissionâs programme for the second year of our partnership.
I hope it finds your active support.
I can think of no better signal to our citizens that Europe is working for them.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Barroso, the programme that you are presenting to us is aimed at the key priorities of security, competitiveness, social justice and the internal market, and we emphasise your desire to translate the Lisbon objectives into actions.
It is still necessary, though, to provide ourselves with all the resources to achieve these objectives.
My fear, however, is that there is a lack of ambition to meet the expectations of a Europe in crisis.
Your plan D methodology promoting democracy, dialogue and debate is also interesting, provided, however, that it does not become the plan of demagogy or of disappointment.
For something is missing in this plan D, namely determination: your determination to find practical solutions.
What concerns me, MrÂ Barroso, is knowing what jobs we will have in Europe in five yearsâ time.
Not only jobs in the service sector, but also jobs in industry.
What jobs will we still have in Europe in five yearsâ time?
Growth, employment and security are the three pillars on which Europe has to construct its policy.
Yet if we are to do that without a Constitution, we need a policy initiative, bringing together the Council, the Commission and Parliament, so that the measures required for the European institutions to operate can be made effective.
Under no circumstances is it a question of flouting the outcomes of the referenda.
Quite the contrary.
You know that the future enlargements are of concern to a large number of Europeans.
Although it is undeniable that Europe has to support our closest neighboursâ efforts to promote democracy, you must nonetheless not give the impression of moving too quickly and of wanting constantly to enlarge the Union when we have resolved neither the problem of our institutions nor that of Europeâs finances.
MrÂ Barroso, we reiterate our ambition to be able to rely on a strong European Commission.
