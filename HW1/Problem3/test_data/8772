It really is high time that we in the EU took a fairly tough line and at least fulfilled the pretty mild demand made by the European Parliament, namely that we suspend the Association Agreement with Israel.
The least that can be asked is that the Council and the Commission ensure that the demand is carried out in practice.
Mr President, although the Israeli-Palestinian question was central to the debate at Valencia - it could not be otherwise, given the tragic situation - there is no doubt that progress was made in adopting an agenda developing dialogue and partnership.
Moreover, I feel that the decision to establish a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is not insignificant, and we must work towards this objective with great energy.
I have expressed my opinion regarding the resolution of the conflict many times in the past and I am tired of saying the same things over and over again; moreover, I agree with much of what has been said here.
I would therefore like to use my time today to read you some of the things said by Palestinian and Israeli women who came to Parliament together to call for a European peace-keeping intervention.
They are women from The Jerusalem Link, Israeli and Palestinian women.
They are voices preserving a glimmer of hope for the future, the voices of people who really are counting on us to act upon our resolutions.
I do thank both Mr PiquÃ© and Mr Solana - who is not here - and Commissioner Patten for both their words and gestures, but I feel that we must implement what we stated in our Parliamentary resolution.
This is what the women said: 'The deliberate killing of innocent civilians, whether Palestinian or Israeli, cannot be condoned.
Prolonging the suffering of the Palestinian people, destroying infrastructures and civilian houses and keeping President Arafat segregated will serve only to exacerbate the suffering and insecurity of both peoples and will destroy any possibility of peace.
The two peoples cannot enjoy peace and security unless the root cause of this conflict, the true enemy of peace - military occupation - is eliminated.
The two peoples are currently trapped in a climate of fear and of obsession with retaliation.
We women refuse to be paralysed or divided by these fears.
We cannot turn a blind eye to the policies and practices conceived with the aim of humiliating and oppressing the Palestinians and forcing them to submit to the strategic programme of expropriation, settlements and colonisation that Israel has been pursuing throughout 34 years of occupation.
We cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that non-violent attempts by Palestinian movements to oppose the denial of their fundamental human rights have, in the past, always been met with violence and repressive measures from Israel and with silence on the part of the international community.
If peace and security are to be achieved, we must put an end to the continued denial of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and do so in the context of fair, global negotiations.
To this end, we call upon the international powers to provide an international presence in the Middle East to protect the civilian people.
To this end, we call for the UN resolutions to be implemented.
The rule of law, reciprocal recognition and reciprocal respect for individual and collective rights will pave the way to achieving peace.'
This is what those women said, and I feel that we cannot block our ears to these voices which are the voices of Israeli and Palestinian women but also of Palestinian and Israeli men uniting to say 'That is enough!
Stop the military occupation!'
Now we must turn words into tangible actions.
The presence today of the European Union, which I hope will have been able to meet with President Arafat, is important, but we must make absolutely sure that Israel understands that we cannot allow it, in its unmitigated defence of its existence, its unmitigated defence against any potential threat to the Jewish people, to continue along its current path.
We must use the instruments available to us too.
We cannot be racist and suspend the agreement with Zimbabwe while treating Israel indulgently all the time.
We must lose no time in taking action, for peace will benefit everybody.
Mr President, one of the conclusions of the Valencia Summit is represented by the EU-Algeria and EU-Lebanon Association Agreements.
I feel that Parliament must realise that the clauses making all the economic and institutional agreements concluded between the Union and third countries subject to respect for human, civil and political rights are destined to remain a dead letter.
The Lebanon and Algeria will not abide by these commitments, although for different reasons, of course.
This is a hypocritical action which undermines the Union's internal and international credibility, for while, on paper, it is reassuring the European public of its commitment to freedom and to providing guarantees for the citizens of the contracting countries, in practice, it never dares to make a stand against the governments - of Tunisia and Laos - which take the money and then blatantly make no effort to honour their commitments.
We need to reflect on this and to choose a more honourable way of abandoning the clauses rather than continuing to display our hypocrisy and impotence.
Parliament must reflect on this matter: it has called and continues to call for sanctions against Israel, the only country in the Middle East which is, in spite of everything, committed to respecting democracy and human and civil rights, and yet it is not, in practice, making - and nor has it made in the past - any such forceful demands of the other countries.
Mr President, Europe has concentrated and is continuing to concentrate on the north-eastern border - with enlargement - but it is guilty of neglecting the southern, Mediterranean border.
Many of Europe's afflictions, in areas such as immigration and security, for instance, originate from Europe's southern border, from its relations with the Islamic world.
I welcome the words and proposals regarding the reinvigoration of the Barcelona Process.
Some speakers have hailed the Valencia Summit as a success.
I would point out that the Barcelona Summit was also hailed as a success and now we are labelling it a failure.
I fear that Valencia will suffer the same fate if we do not take practical action.
One example will suffice: for how long will we continue to discuss Europe's protectionist trade policies which are restricting the manufactured goods markets and the agricultural products market too?
Are we going to continue to defend the CAP against what are, or ought to be, our own interests, namely that agricultural products should be imported from the Maghreb with the consequent generation of employment and maybe even a fall in immigration?
Lastly, on the subject of the Israeli-Palestinian question, I understand the satisfaction expressed at the visit of our delegation to Palestine.
We know what we are asking Israel.
Yesterday, the Council urged Israel once again to end the siege on Yasser Arafat in Ramallah.
That is all well and good, but what are we asking of President Arafat?
Will we be content with his 'No' or will we call for an end to the constant suicide bomb attacks?
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to underline firmly how necessary and appropriate it would be for the European Union to display its willingness to bring about full integration of the Israeli democracy into the European Union.
Yesterday, the Speaker of the Knesset, Avraham Burg, voiced disapproval of the stick approach of sanctions, advocating the carrot of full integration instead.
This is an opportunity to be seized by a Europe for whom the peace and future of that region are very important, an opportunity for a Europe with a vision.
And what a vision this is!
Mr President, I thought that you had omitted to give me the floor and, had you done so, you would unfortunately be in breach of the rules, respect for which is something you criticise MPs in France for failing to show.
I regret that President Cox is no longer in the chair, if I may say so, as I would have liked to say to him directly - although I am sure that you will pass on my comments - that, in France, many sectors of public - and especially sovereignist - opinion believe that the positions we adopted on Monday on the outcome of the presidential elections in France are not only null and void and have no effect, but above all, they mark a very serious dereliction of the duty of impartiality that must be respected by any Parliament's president, on the one hand, and even more so by an international rather than supranational Parliament, which has no place interfering in the political affairs of a Member State.
I hope that he will come to his senses and that he will withdraw the utterly useless and scandalous remarks that he made on Monday.
With regard to the Middle East, we are struck by one thing - from a European perspective at least - which is that Europe and its Member States, bound together as they are by a false sense of European solidarity, are once again absent from the Middle East stage where the tragic events we are witnessing have been going on not just for weeks and months but for years.
We do not want to hear once again, Mr President, that Europe must have a foreign policy.
We heard this in 1991 during the Gulf War; we heard this mentioned again two or three years later in the affair in the Great Lakes Region of Africa; we heard this once again in relation to Bosnia, and again in relation to Kosovo.
Each time, it was a pious hope and, each time a new international crisis rears its head, Europe is mute, mute because European countries are incapable of agreeing on a common approach.
Europe can only speak with a single voice when it has nothing to say, and it says nothing because it is held prisoner by an extreme and dangerous concept of its unity, it prevents the nations from expressing their views.
This is a serious matter, particularly for France, which would have had, were it not bound by its European handcuffs, a voice of justice, a voice of peace and a voice heard by a large number of the world's countries.
It is time for France - and I myself have been convinced of this for some years - to throw off this yoke and I do not doubt that it will do this, which is what the great majority of French people desire, in the years to come.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I do actually believe that the Foreign Ministers' meeting in Valencia was a success, and, step by step, it is also becoming clear what significance the Mediterranean region has for all of us - not only for those countries of the European Union for whom the Mediterranean forms a border, but also for those countries further away from it.
The Mediterranean region is important, enlargement is important, and all these things are in our common interest.
We can see that if there is no genuine and peaceful development in the Mediterranean region, it is to all our streets that the fire spreads.
The attack carried out on Djerba, which was aimed at tourists, shows us how close the flames have already got to our front doors.
It is important, for this reason, that this dialogue should be engaged in on the basis of equality of rights.
The dialogue is also cultural and not capable of being brought about by politics alone.
We attach great significance to the creation of economic, social and political prospects for people in North Africa, as these can bring the region stable development which will in future be democratic.
That, indeed, is another reason why it is so important that the region should get speedy and effective help unhindered by bureaucracy.
I am aware of Commissioner Patten's great exertions in recent years towards achieving improvements in this field, but now as much as then we are in a position in which money is spent and formal resolutions adopted, the effectiveness of which, however, leaves something to be desired.
That implementation is inadequate is due both to difficulties on our side and to bureaucracy in the countries in question, and that must change.
No success will be achieved across the Mediterranean region as a whole for as long as there is still no resolution to the Middle East conflict, which keeps bringing emotions to the boil and making the whole Mediterranean problem difficult to resolve.
The shuttle diplomacy currently going on there sometimes strikes me as ridiculous.
Mr Powell and Mr Solana keep travelling there - on alternate weeks.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, how about a Council resolution to the effect that the next delegation would be sent, not to Jerusalem, but to Washington, in order to enforce the sending of a joint delegation to Jerusalem and Ramallah, with the Russians and the United Nations joining in?
I believe this would make a real difference.
On this issue, what Commissioner Patten has said in this House about joint efforts is precisely what needs to be said loud and clear.
I know that there are major diplomatic reservations on one side or the other, but I do think that we have to get the idea accepted that only a joint effort with those Arab states that are willing to try something can bring an end to the violence, giving the message that the end of the road has been reached.
This is the only way to credibly guarantee security in the region, and it could also create the conditions for a measure such as a sort of Marshall Plan, for which we are prepared, to be effective.
It is a vital prerequisite for further development that we get both states - Israeli and Palestinian - recognised by all their neighbours.
In particular, we also need a solution to the refugee problem, so that people there can have new prospects and so that the refugee camps cease to be the epicentres of incessant new terrorism.
That must be stopped.
It is not acceptable to send them to Israel and by this means to bring about change within Israel; rather, the Arabs must be prepared to offer the Palestinian refugees a future in their countries.
I believe that it is not just Le Pen's people, but also ourselves when we express differing viewpoints, who need to be reminded of the quotation from Voltaire: 'Your opinion is quite the opposite of my own, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'
Mr President, a positive assessment of the Valencia Ministerial Conference must be considered within the context of the tragic situation in the Middle East.
It was not obvious whether the Conference could take place, whether the Arab members of the Barcelona Process would agree to sit down with representatives of Israel, whether the representative of the Palestinian Authority could attend, etc. We should not simply express our satisfaction with the results, but we should also try to explain the reasons for them, which to me are clear.
Firstly, the process has acquired its own logic, and there is an awareness of shared interests and a common destiny.
Some years after Barcelona this seems absolutely clear.
But I would like to stress the second reason, because the European Union's external policy is so often criticised that we should sometimes stop and consider to what extent the success of the Ministerial Conference in Valencia is due mainly to the perception our Mediterranean partners have of that policy: their perception that our horror at the tragedy in the Middle East is sincere, their perception that we have not backed away in the face of this problem, their perception that our position is not unilateral but coordinated, and finally their perception that we are not indulging in empty posturing in the face of the current problems.
As Commissioner Patten said in a comment to the Conference, which is not entirely original, but which is brilliant, the European Union wants to be tough on terrorism but also on the causes of terrorism.
We have earned interest on this policy and I am perfectly happy to congratulate Mr Solana, Mr Patten and many others on these good results, although I am not in favour - naturally - of personality cults.
However, this satisfaction should not blind us to the great fragility of the Barcelona Process.
Poor people - and there are many in the Mediterranean - always have enormous patience as long as two conditions are in place: the first is that they feel that next year is going to be a little better than this one or the last one, that the situation of their children is going to be better than that of their parents and that their grandchildren are going to go to university; the second condition is that they do not feel humiliated.
These are the two basic challenges of the European Union's Mediterranean policy.
Barcelona, as Mr PiquÃ©, President-in-Office of the Council, has said, has survived in Valencia, but it will not survive unless we meet this twin challenge.
I too have just returned from the Jenin refugee camp, and it is impossible to capture in words the horror of what we have seen and heard over the past couple of days.
A man had been attempting for four days to locate his brother under the rubble with his bare hands, while Israel obstructed the bulldozers that were needed for this.
A doctor was not allowed to attend to a bleeding man on the street until this man had bled to death.
A Palestinian family had been living in East Jerusalem for fifty years and was evicted from their home on Monday night in order to make room for Israeli settlers.
Computers of the Palestinian Ministry of Education were piled up by Israeli soldiers and subsequently blown up with grenades.
Can someone tell me what these acts have to do with the fight against terrorism?
The Israeli Government is not only fighting terrorism. Sharon is maliciously destroying the Palestinian infrastructure and, with it, Palestine's hope, and people without any hope are driven to acts of despair.
Loathsome suicide attacks are then the end result.
And this is how Sharon himself contributes to Israel's lack of security, which he claims he wants to promote.
Israel's security can only be guaranteed if we remove the causes of this despair: the colonisation and occupation.
However, Sharon has indicated he would like to build new settlements.
How is this supposed to guarantee Israel's security?
Finally, we are all shocked by the growth in anti-Semitism in Europe.
We condemn this emphatically and call on governments to take vigorous action.
However, it is unacceptable to do as Mr Perez does and instantly label everyone who levels criticism at Israel as anti-Semitic, and it is a very easy way out of addressing well-founded international criticism.
Mr President, like the last speaker, I was also in the Jenin refugee camps yesterday.
The horror we witnessed has been described by previous speakers.
It is not just a question of Jenin.
The Palestinians we spoke to told us that the situation was the same in Nablus, in Ramallah and in all the cities of the West Bank.
The horror is also political.
The Palestinian Authority is completely destroyed.
They destroyed the ministries, the schools, the infrastructures, the archives; everything.
Meanwhile, on the road from Jerusalem to Jenin - on which police vehicles, tanks and jeeps stopped us frequently - we saw colonies of foreigners who arrive on Palestinian land, which looked like residential areas of Paris, London or Madrid, or any European capital.
Wealth next to misery.
We saw that it is possible for a sovereign State to confine the President of the Authority of a territory which has absolutely nothing to do with it, or a leader such as Barghuti, or how helicopters and tanks carry out terrorism.
In fact, there are terrorists who commit suicide out of desperation, but there are also terrorist helicopters. We witnessed this the day before yesterday.
With this in mind, I can only express pessimism if there is no clear intervention by the international community and the UN, the European Union and the United States in particular.
Nothing can be done if the UN resolutions are not truly applied.
I am aware - like everybody - of the initial Arab opposition to Israel, but this is not the fundamental problem today.
The problem is that Sharon, and practically all the others, believe in their historical, moral, cultural and technological superiority.
A religious minister who recently entered the government said that all the Palestinians should be thrown into the sea and that those who stayed there would be like the Turks in Germany or the Algerians in France.
The progressives themselves do not really want a Palestinian state.
In the face of this situation, what can the bantustans do when they are divided by settlements of colonists, by roads which are only used by colonists and the army, and divided by the army itself, in an area which furthermore is small and would lack, for example, the gorgeous Jordan valley?
I believe that the Palestinians are right - the President of the Palestinian Parliament, or the successor in Jerusalem to the late Hussein - when they express their desperation to us.
For us the only solution is the intervention of the UN and the European Union in particular.
They cannot sort things out amongst themselves because Israel does not want a Palestinian State, it does not conform to their ideology, that is the reality.
I believe that we must be aware of this problem in order to resolve it.
I do not believe that Europe can feel guilty in this situation.
Many sources in the United States say that Europe must not get involved given their previous experience.
We are European citizens of the present, we cannot feel guilty and we cannot fall prey to the blackmail of anti-Semitism: since we are in favour of a Palestinian State, we are anti-Semites.
It is not a religious problem but a political problem: a State which is humiliating and destroying a population.
The problem is the occupation and how to convince, how to impose a solution on Israel and how to help Palestine. That is the issue for the European Union.
Mr President, I was also in Jenin yesterday and I was amazed, as a doctor and a teacher in the Faculty of Medicine, as a professor, at the words of the Director of the Jenin Hospital, when he expressed his regret that he could not attend to the wounded who were dying in the area around the hospital because tanks, machine guns and helicopters were preventing him from doing so.
This is a tragedy, it has nothing to do with security.
To terrorise a population is pure State terrorism.
And I would therefore like to thank Mr PiquÃ© who, when he rightly condemns the terrorism of the Palestinian suicide bombers, also condemns just as roundly the terrorism of Israel, because if we do not have yardsticks, our credibility could be called into question.
I would like to point out that the cause of the failure of the peace process stems from the fact that it is not acceptable for one State to occupy another and establish colonies within it, as is happening at the moment.
This reminds me of what happened when Germany invaded France and it is completely unacceptable; this situation leads to a logical reaction against the occupying army, against the occupiers.
Anybody, any soul, would rebel on seeing the wealth of the colonies and the misery of the refugee camps.
We must therefore immediately recognise the Palestinian State and the fact that Palestine, as a State, can put its claims to the international community.
Mr President, I too have just come back from Jenin and, when Commissioner Patten says that 'Israeli soldiers have sometimes shown a disregard' for human life, I have to say that I am very surprised to hear him use that terminology.
There is no doubt that what we saw in Jenin was a complete lack of respect for human life.
Bulldozers were sent in to raze houses to the ground and, to make certain that under no circumstances could anything living be found or a single body dug out, tanks were subsequently sent in so that there was little more than a broad road where the houses had been.
If that is not a lack of respect for human life, I do not know what is.
It is completely unknown how many dead there are under the rubble in Jenin.
The fact that there are dead bodies there can be smelt, however.
There is a disgusting smell when one walks around the area, and a start can therefore be made on digging where the smell is worst.
If it is not known how many bodies there are down there, it is because men and women were separated from each other.
The men have still not been handed back to Jenin, so it is not known how many are still prisoners of the Israelis and how many are lying dead beneath the rubble.
If we are to condemn the suicide bombers, as of course we must, we must condemn what has happened in Jenin just as vigorously.
We must not just demand that Israel withdraw its troops.
We must condemn its action and we must demand that the guilty be held responsible, with Israel itself holding the soldiers who have committed these inhuman acts to account.
There is no doubt at all as to how many civilians have been killed.
We have the exact figures from human rights organisations. More than 2 000 civilians have been killed.
We know how they have been killed: whether they have been killed in bombardments or whether they have been shot and, if so, where they have been shot.
We know how many of them are children.
We know how many of them are men and how many are women.
We also know that a systematic destruction of the whole infrastructure is taking place in the Palestinian areas.
We know that there is now no registration of births or deaths.
Marriages are not being registered.
There is no registration of criminals, yet at the same time it is said that President Arafat should imprison the criminals. However, there are no longer any registers, for everything has been systematically destroyed.
I would ask Commissioner Patten to withdraw his statement about guarantees that this must not happen again.
Following such completely systematic and very deliberate destruction, how in the world are we to expect to receive guarantees from Israel to the effect that nothing like this will happen again?
If we do not receive guarantees from Israel, are we really to delay putting the whole of this structure in place, or not to put it in place at all?
There is no doubt as to what is desired by Israel or, rather, Ariel Sharon.
I decline now to distinguish between the two, for it is of course Ariel Sharon that we are talking about.
Last week, he imprisoned a leader, Marwan Barghouti, who has been one of the main people behind the demand for peace.
He is now being held in detention. In eight days, he has only spent one hour with his lawyer.
He is being interrogated 21 hours at a time and is only allowed to sleep for three hours. He is my colleague.
He is under the same immunity as myself. At the moment, however, he is being tortured in an Israeli jail.
It is a phase in the complete destruction of Palestinian society, its infrastructure and leaders. Let us tell it like it is.
Let us not make any assumptions. There is evidence enough.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first of all, I would like to underline the fact that the General Affairs Council has behaved in a responsible manner by refusing to support Parliament's recommendation for an outright suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel.
And furthermore, you, quite rightly, did not agree, Mr President, to sending observers or a peacekeeping force without a negotiated political agreement.
What sort of role could they perform in a situation which, quite clearly, does not involve two regular armies?
Any lack of coordination in the European Union's behaviour can only undermine the supply of confidence that we must have when dealing with each party, if we wish to provide an effective contribution, when the time comes, to finding a lasting peace.
The ideological gesticulation and passionate blindness leave open the diplomatic terrain, in other words, that of the genuine search for peace which will benefit the United States alone.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what you said this afternoon goes more or less in the right direction, there having been many detours, such as the ambiguous positions adopted by Europe at the Durban conference, our shambolic performance at the meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, and Parliament's biased resolution which sent out the wrong signal at the wrong time.
Your statement, Mr President, was balanced.
The Council is asking for a withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territories as well as an end to the attacks in Israel.
You have strongly condemned the suicide attacks, describing them as inexcusable and indicating that those who carried them out were not martyrs, but terrorists.
The European Union must be totally unambiguous, unequivocal and show no complacency on this point.
In the coming weeks, the European Union must also help to make the United Nations investigation into the events in Jenin impartial rather than a pretext for manipulations or excesses which will not help the cause of peace.
With the prospect of establishing a Palestinian state on the horizon, we must also help to convince the Palestinian Authority to abandon its twin-track approach and to start behaving in a fully responsible way.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, you have remained here to follow this marathon debate, and my thanks go to the Council and the Commission for their statements on the Euro-Mediterranean meeting and the situation in the Middle East.
We in Parliament naturally wish to keep abreast of developments, and my own group supports all balanced attempts to achieve a state of peace in the Middle East.
Simply to discuss this issue from one month or one week to the next, however, seems almost grotesque.
We in Parliament cannot influence the situation in any concrete way.
We come here to speak to whoever happens to be listening, but do we then go away feeling pleased with ourselves, having done so?
I hope we do not.
It would appear that, just as the rescue and clearance work at the World Trade Centre finally reached 'ground zero' level, relations between the Israelis and the Palestinians are also at ground zero.
An optimist would say, and I am one, that from here on things can and must get better.
Commissioner Patten also suggested he hoped this was the case.
It seems clear that only through the joint efforts of what has been called the 'quartet' - the United Nations, the European Union, the United States of America and Russia - can progress be made.
Solo endeavours, whether those of Colin Powell or the High Representative for the CFSP, Javier Solana, who are both held in high regard, do not produce results.
One of the parties in the dispute always suspects the other of being biased.
When a mission that seems as clear as the one Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent President Martti Ahtisaari on to investigate the devastation at Jenin and the number of human casualties there meets with suspicion on the part of the other party, we really are at ground zero point.
President Ahtisaari, who I know well, could hardly be accused of prejudice.
The international community must unite to achieve the only possible solution: the Palestinians must have their own unified state, whose entire area they have complete sovereignty over, and not just the whole of the land area but also the waters that surround it and the airspace above it.
The Israelis must be given an unconditional assurance that their children, their old people, and mothers and fathers can travel in absolute safety within the territory of their own state without the threat of continued, devious, terrorist bomb attacks.
Only this can be the basis of a constructive common existence built on mutual respect.
Mr President, I do not believe in sanctions - pressure should suffice - but unless constructive, genuine and goal-conscious talks get under way soon and furthermore lead to a result there will definitely be a feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu.
How long and how pointless were the talks in the former Yugoslavia before sanctions were imposed?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the Spanish Presidency and, in particular, Mr PiquÃ© on all their efforts to bring the Valencia Conference, whose results I do not underestimate, to a successful conclusion.
I also congratulate Commissioner Chris Patten on the intelligence, impartiality and astuteness of his intervention.
My question is a simple one and is addressed to Mr PiquÃ©: do you believe - having heard Commissioner Patten state that the Middle East is in flames, which is indeed the case - that the Barcelona Process can withstand the conflict in the Middle East?
In implementing his reprehensible policy, Mr Sharon has demonstrated that he does not respect the resolutions of the European Union, those of the United Nations or even the recommendations of President Bush.
He does not take them seriously!
I wish to ask: are we going to continue to churn out the fine words, the stirring speeches and the impressive-sounding votes, which we know are not really having any effect, when we have within our grasp the means to force Mr Sharon to change policy?
Why is the Resolution, which was approved by a large majority by the European Parliament, to suspend the Association Agreement between the European Union and Israel not being implemented?
Why is no serious initiative being adopted under the auspices of the UN, to impose a peacekeeping force on Israel?
As a long-standing friend of Israel, it pains me to have to say that Mr Sharon is irredeemably tainting Israel's honour and is putting his country in a morally indefensible position and in a greater situation of international isolation than ever before.
Mr President, I am also just back from the Jenin visit and I share the distress of breaches of human rights law by both sides.
We must ceaselessly remind Mr Arafat that suicide bombings are not only morally repugnant but also that they stop us helping him to get a Palestinian State.
They play into Ariel Sharon's hands.
The majority in this Parliament called two weeks ago for a suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.
I support an arms embargo but not sanctions, and I am even more convinced on my return that, while it may satisfy our desire to be seen to be doing something, this is a potential dead end.
Presumably, they are meant to work through the Israeli public, feeling the painful bite of loss of exports and jobs, pressurising the Sharon Government to stop its crazy policies.
But in Commissioner Patten's interview in Herat on Monday, it was indicated that Brussels was frustrated that the Israelis did not seem to appreciate the EU link.
They regard us with distrust, rightly or wrongly.
While Palestinians see themselves in a struggle for national liberation from oppressive Israeli occupation, 75 percent of Israelis see themselves as the principal victims, struggling for national survival.
I am not commenting on the justification for these two narratives, but how can it help to cut off, as two British professors have urged, academic and intellectual exchanges?
These are channels through which we Europeans could convey our experience of using mutual respect to overcome hatreds, helping Israelis and Palestinians strengthen their dialogue.
How would it help to stop funding human rights NGOs in Israel?
If we suspend the Association Agreement, we will merely reinforce the Israeli perception of a perfidious Europe.
What will our exit strategy from trade sanctions be?
What conditions would need to be satisfied to restore the Association Agreement?
I have not heard anyone explain how that will work.
It is much better, in my view, to focus on a different paragraph in our resolution: the need for an international force in Palestine.
If our objective is to be effective in achieving a Palestinian State as soon as possible, and establishing peace and justice in the region, we should exert all our diplomatic efforts in that direction and not in suspending the chance for dialogue that we have.
Mr President, I would first like to thank the Members who have visited the region recently and brought their first-hand experiences back to us here today.
Like many other Members of the House, in the last few weeks I have met representatives from the Middle East who have come here to appeal for our help.
Like Mrs Morgantini last week, I had the privilege of meeting very brave and very inspirational Israeli and Palestinian women who are working together for peace - peace between equals as they see it.
They explained to us very vividly way just how desperate the situation is.
The work that the Palestinians have done in building up the very basics of a state over the past 10 years is systematically being destroyed.
Most of the women worked for NGOs and their files, computers and property had been destroyed so they could no longer continue their work.
There have been many resolutions and conferences.
They are all essential and there will be many more, but these women did not see the intervention needed to stop further bloodshed.
They were calling for a peacekeeping force to protect the people and I believe that we should support that call.
A policy of force can never get rid of the levels of desperation and despair that lead to further acts of violence.
There must be a just and peaceful solution for the long term, as well as a swift response to stop any further killing now.
We must ensure that we keep up the pressure at all levels, in every way we can, to get that lasting peace.
Mr President, numerous speakers have protested about Mr Le Pen's presence here during the debate on the Middle East.
Unfortunately, it is not just our economic and social policies; it is also our policy in the Middle East that feeds this sort of extremism.
We all know what ideas movements such as the National Front harbour.
They harbour ideas of national splendour.
Which is only natural when our people see Europe as the lackey of the United States, blind, deaf and dumb to the genocide of the Palestinians, and turn their back on established political forces, charmed by the magic flute of past national splendours.
They harbour anti-Semitic ideas.
Which is only natural when Europe allows Jenin to become a latter-day Warsaw ghetto, when - in a Europe with the blood of the Jews on its hands - voices can again be heard saying 'the Jews are to blame' and forces have started fishing in the murky waters of anti-Semitism.
They harbour xenophobic ideas.
Which is only natural when, instead of letting these Islamic and Arab countries move towards secure regimes and enjoy social cohesion and birth control, we throw them into the conflagration of the Middle East.
And what will the upshot be?
Will it be less immigration, fewer Maghreb nationals and fewer opportunities for certain parties to talk of xenophobia?
I should like to close, Mr President, by saying that we have a duty to intervene at once in the Middle East in order to protect the Palestinians, in order to protect Israel from anti-Semitism and in order to protect the very future of democracy in Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Patten has once again, and impressively, set out a convincing position by the European Union on the conflict in the Middle East, and I want to make some comments on it.
I want to preface them by saying that I feel a sense of obligation to Israel, both to its people and to the state itself.
That being understood, I want to ask my Israeli friends this: What will you have achieved if, as you are expected to do shortly, you withdraw your tanks from the Palestinian territories after killing many Palestinians, suspected assassins, murderers and potential murderers, after having destroyed many homes and schools, and wrecked the structure of the Palestinian Authority?
Has that brought you even one millimetre closer to peace and security?
Or is it not rather to be feared that your actions have begotten new hatred a thousand times over, a hatred that will explode at the next opportunity, be it in the Middle East or perhaps even here in Europe?
I also want that question addressed to us ourselves, however. Have we really done enough to give us the right to make all the self-righteous demands of Israel that we hear in this House?
Did those who went to Jenin also go to Jaffa, to meet the people who, at the feast of Passover, lost members of their families in the cruellest of ways when a bomb reduced everything to blood and broken bits?
Is it not the case that Israel had already, and for many years, been a victim of Palestinian terrorism, long before Ariel Sharon had his crazy idea of marching onto Temple Mount as a provocation? Was what we did on such occasions enough?
Is what we always do on such occasions enough? Adopting an urgent motion condemning terrorism whilst well aware that not one Palestinian would, even for a second, consider himself bound by it?
Have we, then, done enough in this situation?
Is it not the case that Arafat was never willing - and was probably not even in a position - to put a stop to terrorism?
How do we justify the way we make substantial amounts of money available to the Palestinian Authority on a monthly basis?
Do you know what happens to this money, Commissioner Schreyer?
Have you ever checked up on it?
Can you give Parliament evidence of it?
How has the Commission responded to the documents that provide evidence to justify the suspicion that Arafat himself is involved in the financing of terrorism?
Last week, a major German newspaper carried a report on a bloody terrorist attack in Jerusalem four years ago - long before the second intifada - which cost many innocent people their lives or their health.
It describes how the pictures of the terrorists of that time are venerated in Palestinian schools as the images of heroes.
Have we really done enough to contain the terrorism that is striking Israel now, as it has done for years?
That is why I do not believe that it is enough to demand that the Israelis withdraw.
There is no doubt that they have to do that, but that alone will not secure peace.
It is not enough to condemn Palestinian terrorism while doing nothing more than deliver declarations on paper.
There are many indications that the parties will not be in a position to free themselves from their mutual hatred, and that an international force will have to be deployed there.
The European Union, too, must be an advocate for that.
Mr President, first a word about the distasteful scenes that have unfolded this week. I am referring to the utterly despicable attacks on Jewish synagogues and citizens in Europe under the pretext of the Middle East conflict.
The authorities should warn public opinion most emphatically and must take a tough stance against the perpetrators.
However, this also applies to verbal, xenophobic attacks by the extreme right in Europe on migrant fellow citizens.
The exploitation of fear and turning others into scapegoats is, as we have seen in the previous century, a cancerous growth in our society.
Only by building a future step-by-step and by joining forces, with due respect for everyone, irrespective of creed or race, can viable prospects emerge.
This applies to Europe and the Middle East alike.
The announcement that Mr Solana and Mr Moretinos are on their way to meet Mr Sharon and Mr Arafat is hopefully a minor breakthrough.
It is high time that Europe acted in a more united manner and more effectively than it has done so far.
The European Parliament has asked for maximum pressure to be exerted, for a suspension of the Association Agreement and for a willingness, in the event of a ceasefire, to contribute immediately to the monitoring and intervention force which would help develop the Palestinian Authority and help separate the warring factions.
The pressing question is: at the level of the European Council, have the necessary preparations been made, as stipulated in the Association Agreement, to convene the Council to discuss the violations of that Agreement with Israel?
Has the Council started the internal preparations for a contribution to the UN's monitoring and intervention force, or have the words still not been backed up by action?
At the risk of labouring the obvious, this is not about Europe versus the US. We need each other, as well as Russia and the Arab countries, in order to reach a genuine prospect of peace.
As Yossi Beilin, the architect of the Oslo agreements which now seem to have been destroyed by Sharon, told me this week: 'A ceasefire and an international peace force only make sense if the parties are forced to actually work on a political solution and to negotiate.'
We are both of the opinion that all the necessary ingredients are there.
It may be true that in the darkest hour, when things are at their worst, mutual bloodshed seems to go on forever and extreme strategies appear to be never-ending, only serious negotiations can offer a true way out.
The pressure exerted by a self-aware, strong and united Europe would serve this purpose.
This is the best and most credible way of getting the United States on our side and making a contribution to an effective second Madrid Summit.
Mr President, Minister, we all feel a great deal of sorrow and frustration at what is happening in the Middle East.
The violence and the killing must stop.
Together with the United States, the EU can play an important role in the process of achieving a ceasefire, together with peace and reconciliation.
Europe's decision-makers must be able to create a broadly based confidence in the EU as a partner in the Middle East.
That is not the situation at present, my friends.
Up until now, a balanced approach has been demanded, able to resolve conflicts and create a climate for coexistence, not a climate of isolation or exclusion for any party.
Today, more and more people, especially in this House, are talking about trade sanctions.
Are trade sanctions against Israel, and thus indirectly against Palestine too, really the best way of preparing the way for peace?
Is isolating Israel a fruitful path to go down if the EU is to be able to acquire a more significant role in the region?
I do not think so.
I also want to say that the comparison which Mr Gahrton has just made between Israel and the policy of apartheid in South Africa is appalling.
Experience of previous international sanctions should give pause for reflection.
Look at Cuba. Look at Iraq.
Have Castro and Saddam Hussein been weakened? Hardly.
Who is it who have to suffer?
It is not Ariel Sharon.
Instead, it is the farm workers and orchard labourers who cultivate fruit and wine.
I have a few direct questions for you, Minister.
I have heard that, at the last Council meeting in Luxembourg, the Swedish Foreign Minister talked in terms of the EU's needing to prepare itself for introducing trade sanctions against Israel.
Is this information correct?
Which countries can conceive of trade sanctions as a method?
I have also received information to suggest that the Swedish Government is preparing to introduce trade sanctions.
Is the same thing happening in other countries?
Finally, Minister, I want to ask what you personally think about trade sanctions and threats to isolate Israel.
Is that a path which you personally believe the EU should go down?
You said that all alternatives are open?
What do you mean by that?
Do you mean that you too are prepared to isolate Israel?
Mr President, I agree with most of the statements that have been made today and, therefore, if you do not mind, I shall not repeat them.
Instead, I shall focus on other aspects of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, which is of such great importance.
The adoption of the action plan between the European Union and the twelve States bordering the Mediterranean is a step forwards in the much-needed creation of a Mediterranean free trade area, which I would call a genuine form of discreet enlargement towards the South.
In formalising this project, we must ensure that criteria of sustainability and ecological, economic and social benefit for both sides of the Mediterranean are taken into account in sectors such as agriculture.
In this process it is a matter of priority to foster mutual knowledge and cultural ties between peoples.
We saw that the first action to be taken when the tanks entered the refugee camps was to ban the media.
For this reason, we must promote joint projects such as a Euro-Mediterranean television service that would maintain stations in all the States bordering the Mediterranean, and which would broadcast in all of the region's languages and provide live transparency for this action plan and others.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us learn the lesson of what happened in Jenin.
We must prevent any repetition of these episodes and be prepared to address and resolve issues as explosive as this one - or as in the case of the Western Sahara, to which no one in this Chamber has referred - and which are extremely important to the creation of an Arab Maghreb union.
Mr President, here we are, taking part in the umpteenth debate on the situation in the Middle East; in actual fact, we are witnessing the European Union's impotence.
At Valencia, we attempted, at last, to give a sign that the Union is present, to make it clear that it is now time for action, that the time has passed for argument and declarations.
Europe should be making increasing efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, but so far it has failed in its task.
The Middle East crisis is in danger of sparking off localised crises throughout the Mediterranean area and of breeding further terrorism, not least by providing conditions conducive to the recruitment of terrorists.
Therefore, Europe must certainly adopt a position which gives it a strong, an increasingly strong, presence but which is also a position of neutrality between the two parties in conflict.
I did not support the outcome of Parliament's vote on the resolution in Strasbourg, for it was weighted against Israel rather than adopting a position of neutrality between the parties.
The Palestinians have the right to an independent State but Israel's right to security must be recognised too.
Mr Arafat must stop the suicide bombers, who are all too often children, and Mr Sharon must withdraw his troops from the occupied territories with due regard for human rights.
What path, then, can we follow to give Europe a major role?
First of all, we must set up a negotiating table involving the European Union, of course, the United States, Russia, the Arab League, the Palestinian Authority and Israel.
Italy has declared its willingness to host a peace conference.
Then, we must immediately set in motion a humanitarian aid programme and food aid for the Palestinian people and, clearly, even if Israel is against the idea, start to think seriously about sending an intervention force to separate the two parties in conflict until the situation has calmed down.
Lastly, we must set in motion a Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of infrastructures in the tragically war-torn Palestinian territory.
We must prevent the Middle East crisis from sparking off a fresh wave of anti-Semitism in Europe.
Our - quite legitimate - criticism of Israel must not - must never - cause us to overlook the attacks perpetrated in our Union on Jewish synagogues and cemeteries.
In this context, we must remember what happened at the cemetery in Strasbourg.
Woe betide us if we jeopardise the freedom of religious expression of our fellow citizens of the Jewish religion!
That is why it is important not to leave room in politics for the extremist movements which raise their heads every now and again, as has happened in France and in Germany.
That is why we must all genuinely strive to build a new Europe with a single foreign and security policy, an influential Europe which is the Europe of inclusiveness and subsidiarity.
This Europe will win through, for the European citizens are on our side, on the side of peace and tolerance.
Mr President, I want to welcome Commissioner PattenÂŽs statement today.
It was a model statement which was at once calm and rational and strong and balanced, outlining the situation as it exists and the steps that are necessary on all sides to create a sustainable peace in the region.
I am puzzled by the Council's excessive caution.
I say 'excessive' caution.
I am not arguing against caution, but the Council expressed views today which were not balanced.
I have also been to Jenin and seen the destruction there, the destruction of homes and of people's lives, the burying of people in the rubble of their own homes.
I would like to suggest one practical thing here today.
What we were asked for was heavy equipment to enable the people in Jenin to dig out the bodies that are still there.
There was no heavy equipment when we were there yesterday.
I appeal for urgent aid in that regard.
We have a responsibility as parliamentarians to avoid extreme language and extreme solutions.
We need to demonstrate that the Sharon extremism will not bring security to the Israeli State, nor will Palestinian suicide bombers bring a Palestinian State into existence.
Only through slow and painful negotiations with compromises can that occur, only then can the Israelis and Palestinians be secure in their own states.
I met with ambassadors in Tel Aviv, moved on to Jerusalem to meet Israeli peace groups and then on to Jenin to talk to the residents there.
The objective of the Sharon Government at this point in time is the destruction of any possibility of a Palestinian State.
I have no doubt about that at all.
Europe, therefore, must bring pressure to bear on Sharon and his government to see that this is not a viable option for Israel.
In conclusion, the most important and effective weapon we have is the Association Agreement.
What we are calling for is the suspension of that agreement, not a suspension of all contact with Israel, but a suspension of the preferential arrangements that Europe has with Israel so that at least it will begin to recognise that we are prepared to take action.
It is a moderate approach which can be stepped up or cancelled when progress is made by Israel in withdrawing her troops from the Palestinian area, giving free access to humanitarian aid and free access to the United Nations mission in Jenin and elsewhere.
There are many other conditions we could perhaps apply.
There is no problem about an exit strategy.
We simply state what our conditions are and what is necessary in order to begin talks under the quartet based on Oslo.
Mr President, as a Spanish Member of this Parliament, as a Valencian and as a member of the European People's Party, I shall not take too long to say that I consider the Valencia Summit to have been a success.
I do wish to reiterate what other Members of this House have said, however.
I consider it to be a success that the summit took place in such difficult circumstances; it is a success that it was attended by twenty-five of the twenty-seven Members who were invited; it was a success that a joint action plan was agreed on by consensus and I consider it to have been a success that a conclusion was reached - explained better than I can by Commissioner Patten: in order to speed up the Barcelona Process, the peace process in the Middle East must be speeded up but there will be no stable peace in the Middle East unless it is achieved within a framework of stability, development and cooperation such as the framework put forward in Barcelona.
Having said this, I am not going to repeat any of the solutions that have been put forward for the Middle East.
There clearly needs to be an end to the killings that we have condemned here so rigorously and with such sadness, and political dialogue must be re-established on the basis of international law.
The President-in-Office of the Council has referred to all the statements detailing how this needs to be undertaken, from the Madrid Conference or the Oslo process to the United Nations resolutions.
What is hard to explain to our voters, to the media or to our visitors is how the European Union, which is Israel's largest trading partner and the main donor to the Palestinian Authority, is unable to do any more than it is currently doing.
I agree that it was very positive that our positions were reaffirmed in Valencia.
I also agree that our mission to the Middle East is a success, particularly because it is repairing the damage suffered by the previous mission but, I repeat, we will have to explain to our voters what we are going to do, how we are going to do it and when we are going to do it, as long as it is soon.
With regard to the Barcelona Process, the action plan starts by acknowledging that what is needed is literally 'momentum', which simply means accepting that the 1995 Barcelona Process has made slower progress than originally expected and, of course, much slower progress than the needs we have been discussing here require, when we talk about the Mediterranean as a strategic border, when we talk about the 45 million new jobs that must be created on the southern shore of the Mediterranean in order to maintain current levels of unemployment.
I repeat that in Valencia it was acknowledged that there is a gap - actually an enormous distance - between what we want to achieve, that is, what is needed, and what we are going to do.
I welcome the fact that the fight against terrorism and the fight against drugs were discussed.
I welcome the fact that the idea of establishing a free trade area by 2010 was reaffirmed, but I wish to emphasise that in order for there to be a free trade area, there must be goods to trade.
We therefore need to be more effective and more flexible in our approach to the MEDA Plan, in economic cooperation, and to be less hesitant about setting up the Euro-Mediterranean Bank.
Does this Parliament want such a bank?
Do our partners in the southern Mediterranean want this?
Do certain members of the Council?
The Spanish Presidency wants it, of course; let us also convince everyone else that it is much needed.
To conclude, Mr President, I wish to emphasise that a foundation working for multicultural dialogue is absolutely crucial.
It is impossible, however, to create a foundation without financial support.
Without financial support there can be neither a foundation nor spiritual exercises, however modest they may be.

Mr President, I took part in the work at Valencia and would like to draw your attention and the attention of this House to a couple of - strong - impressions I received there: firstly, confirmation that there cannot be a future of peace and stability, prosperity and economic growth in Europe if the Mediterranean area continues to experience the present conflict; secondly, I do not want to go against the general feeling but, for the first time, I had the impression, which was subsequently confirmed during the bilateral meetings, that the Arab world and the southern shore of the Mediterranean see Europe and the European Union as the only interlocutor that can possibly help them with their problems, the only interlocutor that can live alongside their problems and resolve them.
In this, I must congratulate Mr PiquÃ©, who directed all the meetings and troikas with truly rare neutrality and balance, given the difficulties of the political situation.
What are we, as the European Union, going to propose?
We must propose a path which we all unequivocally support; we must propose reinvigoration of the Barcelona Process, striving to bring about lasting change; we must propose a Parliamentary Assembly to monitor the initiatives undertaken; we must propose a new dialogue between the two shores of the Mediterranean and further consolidate it with regard to humanitarian issues, justice and combating terrorism.
Moreover, there is a need for our proposals to be implemented practically without delay.
The creation of the Bank, relations of closer cooperation and association relations are all tangible projects which show the European Union to be the ideal partner for the other shore of the Mediterranean.
The peace process and the current conflict between Israel and the Palestinian world are threats to these projects.
However, if, as the European Union, we do not have the courage to dare to go further, using all the means available to us and taking advantage of the hopes that are placed in us, then we will in all probability waste an opportunity that is historic, not least in terms of the European project which is in the minds and hearts of many of us and which is taking shape in the Convention.
As regards practical action, I am taking up the call made again this morning by the Supreme Pontiff.
I and Mr Mario Mauro are following the developments of the conflict in the holy places of Jesus' birth through direct contact with Fr. Giacomo Bini, the Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor.
Well then, the situation will soon be beyond humanitarian aid.
The monks and sisters who live in the religious community of Bethlehem cannot be considered hostages.
It is a symbolic fact of extreme importance: the attention of the whole world is focused on what is happening in the place where Jesus Christ, the bearer of peace to all men, was born.
Millions of men and women are awaiting an intervention that will defeat the designs and actions of death.
We call upon Parliament, upon you, Mr President, upon the Commission, upon the President-in-Office of the Council and upon Mr PiquÃ©, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to take practical action to bring this affair nearer to a conclusion.
I feel that it would be a genuine sign of hope and a promise of stability for the future of this tragically war-torn Holy Land.
Mr President, I welcome both Commissioner Patten's contribution to this debate and Kofi Annan's decision to send a fact-finding team to ascertain exactly what happened during the Israeli bombardment of Jenin refugee camp.
I am, however, somewhat concerned at the motivation underlying attempts by Israel to delay the investigation.
Israel claims that its invasion of Jenin and other areas was an attempt to destroy the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure.
However, serious allegations have been made that the Israeli defence forces were involved in extra-judicial executions and the use of human shields.
If these prove to be true, then Israel itself and its army are as guilty of acts of terrorism as those who plan, support and carry out suicide bombings.
When he was defence Minister, Ariel Sharon masterminded the 'Operation Peace for Galilee? invasion in 1982.
His objective then he claimed was: 'to eradicate the Palestinian terrorist threat in Lebanon?.
This resulted in the massacre of 800 Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps.
A subsequent Israeli commission of enquiry concluded that he bore responsibility, as they put it ' having disregarded the danger of acts of vengeance?
Are we seeing history repeat itself?
Mr Sharon must take personal responsibility for what has happened in Jenin and elsewhere on the West Bank.
It is a consequence of his policies, his prejudices and his hatred of Yasser Arafat.
If the UN team concludes that war crimes have indeed occurred, then the international community must take action including referring the matter to the International War Crimes Tribunal.
Mr Sharon does a grave disservice to the people of Israel.
Single-handedly he has caused his country's political isolation.
Furthermore, he has fed the hatreds that have resulted in the escalation of anti-Semitic activity which I deplore.
He humiliated the US Government during Colin Powell's recent visit to the Middle East.
Perhaps, however, this will have a positive effect and lead to a reassessment of US policy in this area and encourage them to abandon their one sided approach of unequivocal support for Israel and instead to work with the EU and others for a balanced, peaceful resolution to this terrible conflict which has already cost too many lives.
Mr President, almost all ordinary citizens of Israel wish to live in peace in their own country.
They wish to have a country with secure borders and normal diplomatic relations with all its Arab neighbours.
How can we help extinguish the fire that has devastated Palestine and reduced the people to a life of humiliation, fear and deprivation of the basic amenities of life?
Jewish people, Muslims and Christian Palestinians worked and lived together for centuries before Israel was established.
The Jewish people dreamt about their own country and they got it, and rightly so.
The Palestinians, both Muslims and Christians, dream and wish to have their country as well and they will not rest until they have a secure and viable state based on a just and fair settlement.
How can the EU help?
Let us stop being polite and politically correct.
To my delight today is the first time in my two and a half years as an MEP that I have heard Members of this House address this topic with such confidence.
We have been gagged for all this time.
Let us spell out what is needed for such a fair and just settlement; things that we all believe in but are too afraid to say.
Firstly, Israel must have the right to exist with a secure border and it must be fully recognised as a state by all its neighbours.
Secondly, Israel must respect international law and its own national laws, as well UN Security Council resolutions.
Thirdly, Israel must accept neutral international observers under UN sponsorship to facilitate a ceasefire.
Ordinary people, Jews, Muslims and Christians, are fed up with their politicians.
They want peace now.
Let us help them with courage and confidence and say clearly what most of us privately believe, that for Palestine to be a viable state, to allow that state to take back the millions of refugees, there is only one border and that is the border as it was before 1967.
That is what Israel has to pull back to.
Until that happens there will be no peace in the Middle East and that brings the terror, fear and difficulties that we now see in the European Union.
It is time that we spelt out the way it should be.
Mr President and the Council, two weeks ago, the joint resolution on the situation in the Middle East tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left was voted through by a narrow margin here in the European Parliament.
We in the Christian Democratic Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats voted against.
The truth is the only way to genuine peace, reconciliation and coexistence.
Those who tabled the resolution chose to criticise the State of Israel on twelve occasions, but the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority on only three occasions.
Neither Hamas nor Islamic Jihad, labelled as terrorist organisations by the United States and the EU, were mentioned or criticised in the European Parliament's resolution.
Nor was there any mention of the groups designated as terrorists by the United States, namely Hezbollah and the Al-Aqsa Brigades.
The last-named group constitutes the military wing of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement and is responsible for the suicide bombing in Jerusalem on 12 April in which six Israeli civilians were killed.
Only three speakers made any specific mention at all of these terrorist groups during the two-hour plenary debate in Strasbourg on 10 April.
Nonetheless, everyone knows that these men associated with violence and suicide bombings - these people who are happy to see sons or daughters sent to kill other people and who receive money from Iraq for the purpose - are not at all prepared to recognise the State of Israel's right to exist in the area.
I say to the President and to the Spanish Presidency that these terrorist groups are a part of everyday life in the Middle East.
How are we to deal with their existence?
The PPE-DE Group chose to vote against last time because we feel that the EU and the European Parliament are becoming less and less relevant to the parties.
The debate in this House reveals a type of one-sidedness which means that we are not taken seriously by either party to this deeply tragic and bloody conflict.
The time should be past when the European Parliament adopts politically lightweight resolutions simply in order to achieve what, from an objective point of view, is an impossible consensus across the whole political spectrum, from left-wing socialists and communists by way of social democrats to green liberals and Christian democrats, Eurosceptics and members of the radical right.
The time has come for the EU to become relevant to both parties in the Middle East.
Mr President, I should like to say firstly that I feel very proud to be working in this Parliament and to see how, at the Valencia Ministerial Conference everything that we have been told corresponds to a position of agreement on cooperation, to which other countries are signing up.
I believe that it is a strong Europe, a Europe of the future, that is achieving this, and I believe that institutional cooperation and cooperation between other countries are aspects that should be highlighted.
With regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference, I should like to furthermore offer my congratulations on the excellent idea of introducing - or of trying to introduce - solutions on a Mediterranean scale.
One of the failings of the MEDA Plan, one of the causes of the delay in incorporating the countries of the Mediterranean into European policy, or into the offer that we are making, is the need for these to be accepted according to their own logic, to their own scale and with a new sensitivity and a new way of addressing problems.
Along the same lines, I should like to also express my satisfaction that culture, tourism, education, integration between peoples and dialogue were addressed as issues of the utmost priority.
In my view, to culture, education, tourism and cultural dialogue we can add sustainable development and globalisation, the benefits of which also have an effect in the country that provides these and I think that this is an example of successful coexistence between a world that is in the process of modernising itself and a world that still needs to become part of the change, but which has a great history of its own.
As Vice-Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with Israel, I should also like to say something about the conflict in the Middle East: our position - my position - is quite clear and we have stated it in other forums.
We have now reached a time when institutional positions must be adopted.
It is true that we can all express our regret - and I do so now - at Palestinian terrorism, at the disproportionate response of Israel, and at the intolerable situation that currently exists.
Furthermore we, with a European sensitivity and with our history of peace and democracy and our rules of the game, cannot accept that humanitarian assistance is not being provided and we must call for this loud and clear.
This is not the time, however, for the Members of this House or even the delegations or the groups, to make statements in isolation.
This is the time to strengthen European cohesion, to help Europe to develop a single vision, an institutional position of the Presidency, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, because we are deciding on the future of an entire region and the problem does not just concern the present, but also the future.
Therefore, I now clearly state my support for peace, but for a peace that must be accompanied with very clear and solid positions, on which we are all united, not at a personal or emotional level, but for the sake of reaching an objective, consistent and lasting solution, and in which we bear in mind that our obligation is to ensure that there is peace, but also to look after the future and to look after this Mediterranean area.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that there are certain specific weapons available for preventing the situation in the Middle East from continuing to deteriorate and even, on the contrary, improving it: the weapon of diplomacy, which has been tried, which has been tested, but which is no longer accorded sufficient respect because diplomacy often gives way before the clash of military weapons.
The other major weapon which is, on the other hand, effective and non-violent - the weapon of the law of the economy, of aid to developing countries, of aid to the poorest communities - has certainly not been used enough, and this is because it has even, on some occasions, been rejected in the dialogue between the countries who were to receive assistance and the assisting countries.
The response from this House must clearly, once again, be 'No' to weapons and 'No' to suicide bomb attacks, but also 'No' to tanks and 'No' to retaliation.
Well then, what is the formula on which peace in the region should be based? Once again, it is a formula as old as the hills.
Governments acting cooperatively within the framework of shared institutions and governments acting individually.
The Italian Government has developed a plan, a proposal for economic aid - a sort of Marshall plan as it has been called, with good reason in my opinion, although there has been criticism of this - to the poorest country, Palestine.
This is an important weapon which has not been used at all in recent years, although many States set aside considerable sums to help the peoples of the Middle East who were in most need of such assistance.
What do I find most disturbing?
I think it is the conditions of degradation in which countless young people live in the refugee camps in Palestine from the moment they are born to the age at which they can start work.
These camps are extremely dangerous breeding grounds.
In my opinion, certain Arab governments have failed to give their brothers sufficient help: on the contrary, they have done nothing but incite them and tolerated movements within these countries which have led to the consequences we have witnessed recently.
Mention must be made of the United Nations, which has certainly played a role which has been exhausting, not least, and important but inadequate and, in any case, ineffective; an intervention force was needed and it has been called for on many occasions.
In my opinion, reasoning, experience and history teach us how an intervention force can be employed effectively in this modern age, and yet no such force has been deployed.
What initiative can Europe, the European Union, pursue?
It can reinforce the thrust of the UN initiatives, particularly the initiative to establish what could be an intervention force separating the two opposing nations.
Mr President, I share your deep concern at the upsurge in violence which has taken place in the Middle East in recent weeks, because both sides appear to have locked themselves into a downward spiral which leaves little room for dialogue and progress towards a final settlement.
The only possible solution is one based on UN Resolutions 242, 338, 1397 and 1402, involving the acceptance of a two-state solution which will give security to the State of Israel and dignity to the Palestinians.
This will involve an eventual total withdrawal from the occupied territories and a dismantling of all the illegal settlements.
We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that there is a huge convergence of international opinion as violence increases, which we need to build on.
It must also be made clear that the right of return for Palestinians can only apply to the new state of Palestine, as otherwise the Jewish State of Israel's, security would be compromised.
Compensation, however, will need to be considered for those whose properties were expropriated as a necessary prelude to a resumption of meaningful negotiations over a final political settlement.
On the one hand, tragically, we have suicide bombers engaged in indiscriminate attacks upon Israeli civilians and, on the other hand, there is a tragic civilian loss of life on the Palestinian side, when Israel sends in its troops to root out those responsible.
I did not support the call for an immediate suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement as I felt this move to be too punitive and selective at this juncture.
I did, however, agree to call for an emergency EU-Israel Association Council meeting to discuss the crisis.
In particular, I felt, along with many of my colleagues, that the Palestinian authority, which receives EUR 120 million a year from the EU, should have done more to restrain the suicide bombers and Islamic terrorists.
I call upon Chairman Arafat to condemn, regularly and in Arabic, the terrorist attacks, and recognise Israel's right to exist in peace behind its 1967 borders.
At the same time, I call upon the Likud Party to remove all references in its manifesto to its claims that the West Bank is an integral and perpetual part of the State of Israel.
Nevertheless, I am concerned at the excessive use of force by the army, the disregard of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the application of collective punishments to civilians and the ban on ambulance passage into Israel proper which affected wounded civilians, as well as fighters and terrorists, and which, I was glad to see, was lifted the following day.
I believe that with the Two-State Solution the international community has now established the basis for a lasting and durable peace.
We must all now seize upon this opportunity from the international community to implement this before we have a major Middle-Eastern war on our hands.
Mr President, I am a friend of Israel and I am proud to be so.
I am also a candid friend of Israel.
Those are two words: 'candid' and 'friend'; so let me be a candid friend to Israel first of all.
Yes, Israel must accept that there has to be a Palestinian state in secure borders.
Yes, Israel must withdraw from the territories which it has occupied these past few weeks.
Yes, Israel must allow the investigation of what happened in Jenin to take place, provided that investigation is fair and balanced and takes a view which is objective to all sides.
Yes, I say to the State of Israel that I am not entirely convinced that the action which it has taken these past few weeks will succeed in the object which it sets itself, because I fear it may have created more people who want to engage in suicide missions.
So there I am, the candid friend to the State of Israel.
But as a friend of Israel, I am also entitled in this Parliament to speak up for it.
I say to this House that it has to understand that what Israel has suffered these past months, the murder of 418 innocent men, women and children, is almost too much for any democratic state to have to bear.
What is Israel expected to do about that almost daily assault on its innocent citizens?
What is Israel expected to do when it is surrounded by countries who do not even, to this day, accept its right to exist?
I support the Saudi peace plan, but it is a shocking comment that it has taken nearly 53 years for some Arab states to come forward with a plan which actually recognises the State of Israel.
Israel, too, must face a situation with Yasser Arafat, where he not only does nothing to prevent the terrorist actions taking place, but there is the strongest possible evidence that he is actually complicit in what has happened.
That is unacceptable in a partner with whom any state, any government is expected to negotiate.
I say to this Parliament that after the events of September 11, we took a view in the civilised world that terrorism was indivisible.
Yes, people had rights, but terrorism was unacceptable, there was no such thing as a good terrorist.
We must keep that proposal solid, because if we fail, if we say terrorism is OK if it is in the Middle East, but not if it is in the United States or Europe, then we are making a mistake for which we will suffer.
The way towards peace and the way for Europe to contribute towards peace is to use its influence in the area, particularly on the Palestinians, and to say to them, yes, there should be a Palestinian state, yes, there should be a State of Israel, but both must have security throughout the years to come.
Mr President, I should like to thank all those who have spoken for their opinions and their contributions which mean that I do not now have to speak for too long myself, since all possible arguments from all points of view have been put forward, and I must say that many of them, furthermore, were made in a similar vein and in almost identical words.
I repeat, then, that I wish to thank all the speakers and I should now like to focus my answer on two aspects:
The first is the potential relationship between the Barcelona Process and the situation in the Middle East.
Despite the gravity of the current situation, peace will one day be achieved in the Middle East, and since this is the case - and we all hope that peace will be achieved sooner rather than later - the Barcelona Process will prove its full potential and effectiveness and at that moment, furthermore, it will prove that it is more necessary than ever.
A stable peace can only be achieved on the basis of prosperity, cooperation, economic integration, mobility between the peoples concerned, the exchange of ideas, exchanges between educational systems, the exchange of peoples, and all that the Barcelona Process entails, in its political, economic, cultural and social aspects, is, therefore, of extreme importance in this regard.
Consequently, I deduce from today's debate that we all agree on the need to persevere with the will that we demonstrated in Valencia to revitalise the Barcelona Process.
With regard to the second issue I wish to address, which is specific to the situation in the Middle East, many of the honourable Members have mentioned the policy of Mr Sharon, the current Prime Minister of Israel.
I should like to remind you that Mr Sharon has been Prime Minister for just over a year, not even two years, and that he was elected Prime Minister because he reflects the will of Israeli society.
I should also like to remind you that the government of Mr Sharon is a government of national unity in which the Labour Party and various other parties are represented, and therefore, when we talk about the policy of Mr Sharon - these things should not be forgotten - we are actually talking about the policy of many others besides him.
This is a policy accepted by all the members of his government, because, otherwise, they would have resigned or they would have been removed if they voiced different opinions.
We very often fall into the trap of excessively attributing the causes of the conflict to individuals.
The conflict in the Middle East, in its most modern incarnation, started over fifty years ago, and Mr Sharon was not around at that time.
I should like to remind you that the second intifada started before Mr Sharon became Prime Minister.
Therefore, we must bear all of this in mind and get to the roots of the conflict.
It is true, however, that there are specific policies that are especially worthy of criticism and that should be rejected, and as such have been roundly condemned by both Commissioner Patten and myself, not only today but also on many other occasions.
The problem has not been caused solely by specific individuals, however, but by something much more profound, and when a conflict lasts for such a long time, with its various shifts of balance, it is because there is no majority will for peace on either side; because there is no sincerity or honesty in the desire for peace expressed by either side; because, when some express their desire for peace, but in their hearts are hoping for the destruction of the State of Israel, they do not want peace, and because when others say that they want peace, but in their hearts what they really want is to make the myth of a greater Israel a reality and, therefore, the consolidation of a State of Israel on the current occupied territories, they do not really want peace.
Since these two attitudes stem from the historical aspirations of both sides, and since these historical aspirations are not compatible with one another, until there is an explicit renunciation, which is sincere and honest, of these historical aspirations, there will be no peace however much we attempt to impose sanctions, and however much the international community does all that it can.
It is, furthermore, in this context that we must place the actions of the international community, because our role is especially clear now, and consists of convincing both sides that Israel must issue a sincere and honest renunciation of increasing its territories on the basis of the occupation and the Palestinians and the entire Arab world must issue a sincere and honest renunciation of the destruction of Israel.
If this were achieved, we would then have a completely solid foundation on which to build effectively.
Our task is one of persuasion.
I am far from sure that this task should be carried out on the basis of sanctions.
It must be a task of genuine persuasion, which reaches the political leaders and the general public of both sides.
Because the Israeli public, which has now voted - just over a year ago - for Mr Sharon, previously voted for Mr Barak in order for him to achieve peace, and before that, for Mr Netanyahu, and before him, five or six years ago, for Mr Rabin.
There are, therefore, prospects for peace, and this is why we must pursue the approach of cooperation; this is why it is so important that we work together with the United States, with Russia and with the United Nations, and when the opportunity arises to act with a degree of dilettantism, for Europe to have an independent voice, which sets us apart from the United States, I think that we have to be extremely prudent.
I am not implying that we should support every position adopted by the United States.
What I am saying is that we should act together, because this is extremely important and, if you read the Madrid Declaration carefully, it states what the European Union has been saying for a long time, and it is other countries, including, to a large extent, the United States, that have come around to the positions of the European Union.
I take great satisfaction from this, and we shall also pursue this policy because I believe it is absolutely crucial.
It is in this context of the international community, all working together, that it makes sense to talk about observers, that it makes sense to talk about peacekeeping forces, because, otherwise, these things would not be feasible; and that is when it makes sense for us to talk about Marshall plans and economic contributions - which will have to be considerable, of course - and that we also talk about the full import of the rapprochement of the two peoples on the basis, amongst other things, of their educational systems.
The presence of the historical aspirations which I referred to earlier is clearly reflected in the educational content provided by both sides; the young people on each side have been trained not in conciliation or in peaceful coexistence, but in hate.
We have, therefore, a great deal of work ahead of us but the way forward has been mapped out.
We know what the final outcome must be and what we need to do is continue working in this direction.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Mr Alyssandrakis has the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, honourable Members, the High Representative of the European Union, Mr Javier Solana, stated in an interview with the Greek Tribune that, unless the Cyprus problem can be resolved, only the Greek Cypriot part of the island will accede to the European Union.
Mr Solana's successive replies to the repeated questions put by the newspaper journalist, who stressed that this contradicted everything we know about the Helsinki resolution, leave no room for error or misunderstanding.
The position taken by Mr Solana confirms the reading of the Communist Party of Greece, especially after the Helsinki Summit, that the process for Cyprus to accede to the European Union will split the island, legitimise the Turkish occupation and justify the 1974 invasion.
And furthermore, Mr Solana demonstrated total contempt of the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus and international law in general in his statement.
I should like to ask you to speak to the High Representative, Mr President, given that the position which he has expressed completely contradicts the decisions and resolutions passed by the European Parliament.
Thank you very much, Mr Alyssandrakis.
The Presidency takes note of the point of order you have made.
Mr Korakas has the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, I too have a point of order to make concerning Mr Solana's visit to Greece.
Last week, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr de Miguel told the House that Mr Solana would be visiting Greece in order to put pressure on the Greek Government to accept the Constantinople text, or rather the Ankara text, drafted by Great Britain, Turkey and the United States, a text which contests the territorial integrity of Greece so that the European army can use NATO infrastructures in order to promote the so-called common European defence and security policy.
That Turkey's demands are dictated by the United States goes without saying; unfortunately, the European Union is going along with them.
I should like, Mr President, to denounce this pressure being exerted on the Greek Government and warn the House that, if the Greek Government, which is digging in its heels and refusing to accept the text under pressure from the Greek people; if the Greek Government makes the concessions being asked of it by the Fourteen and Mr Solana, there will be serious problems in Greece where, as I have said, the Greek people are unwavering and united in their opposition.
I should like to ask you to take note of our objection, Mr President, and to do whatever you can to put a stop to this unacceptable pressure.
The next item is the joint debate on two reports by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy by Mr Van Hecke (A5-0106/2002), on human rights in the world in 2001 and European Union human rights policy, and by Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez (A5-00084/2002), on the Commission communication to the Council and to the European Parliament on the European Union's role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries.
Mr President, the main themes of the 2001 human rights report are, in fact, mainstreaming and the EU's human rights policy.
This means in the first place that we should put an end to the harmful tradition whereby the European Union and the Member States set great store by the concept of human rights in their resolutions and reports, but whereby in practice, and in day-to-day foreign policy, they often allow other interests to take precedence.
I have just returned from Geneva where, along with the Parliament delegation, I attended the 58th meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee.
During a talk with the 15 EU ambassadors, it transpired that the world's most important human rights forum is not only struggling with a huge problem of credibility, but that the Union also fails to succeed in pursuing a consistent and coherent human rights policy and in speaking with one voice.
During a motion on humanitarian situations in the Middle East last week, the European representatives in the UN committee were divided in their vote.
This, of course, affects our moral authority.
Moreover, the impression is created that the European Union sponsors without any hesitation resolutions on human rights violations in countries such as Congo, Sudan and Colombia, while its attitude is far more restrained when it comes to strategically or economically important partners, including China.
The new EU guidelines on human rights dialogues will undoubtedly strengthen the coherence and consistency of the EU's human rights policy, provided they are applied.
In fact, these guidelines also form the basis for a programme document in which priority is given to the European initiative for democracy and human rights.
Commissioner Patten has played a pioneering role in this respect.
However, we are anxious about the implementation of the document.
Despite the high priority which Parliament accords this budget chapter, the appropriations were already reduced in 2002.
In my report, I confined myself to two topical themes: the modern forms of slavery and the delicate balance between the war on terrorism and respect for human rights.
Although slavery was officially abolished fifty years ago, it continues to exist in all kinds of forms: people are trafficked and sold like commodities, are employed in forced labour, receive very little pay and are restrained in their freedom of movement.
The little statistical data that is available is alarming.
Especially in the current European climate, where the extreme right is in the ascendant, the European Union has every reason for tackling this growing problem.
This report calls for national and international changes in the law in order to prosecute human traffickers, protect victims and prevent people from ending up in modern forms of slavery.
The second theme concerns the complex relationship between terrorism and human rights after the attacks of 11 September.
It is patently obvious that terrorist attacks are serious crimes that should be treated accordingly.
However, human rights violations can also be a breeding ground for terrorism and, at the same time, the fight against terrorism can lead to new human rights violations, can serve as justification for human rights violations or can make countries turn a blind eye to violations committed by allied forces in the fight against terrorism.
Prominent politicians, including Lord Russell Johnson, have warned against repeating the mistakes of the Cold War when dictatorships in developing countries were supported in the name of the fight against Communism.
It is important, as part of the fight against international terrorism, to remove the underlying causes which feed extremist feelings or which are used by terrorists to recruit followers.
Above all, the attacks of 11 September and the fight against terrorism have painfully exposed the shortcomings of international law.
The Geneva conventions are still based on the assumption that wars between states form the biggest threat to peace, while most current conflicts are civil wars or terrorist action.
The Geneva Convention on prisoners of war is based on the protection of soldiers of regulated armies, while the majority of the fighters today are guerrilla and militia fighters and the majority of victims are civilians.
The report therefore calls for new rules, new conventions and new instruments which accommodate these new types of conflict.
The Union will need to fulfil a pioneering role in the review of international law and will need to ensure that the International Criminal Court becomes operational at the earliest opportunity.
We as the European Parliament, with a worldwide reputation in the field of human rights, must ensure at all costs that a number of universal and fundamental human rights are observed at all times.
I would therefore like to thank those of my fellow MEPs who, with their contributions, have helped create a well-balanced report which already met with a broad consensus in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I hope that Parliament will be able to give its unanimous backing to this human rights report tomorrow.
Mr President, we have drafted this report that I am presenting today mindful of the fact that the Commission communication notes the importance that the Union attaches to human rights in the development of its external policy and this, in our opinion, should be warmly welcomed.
I should like to emphasise, however, that although this communication puts forward important proposals and suggestions, it does not provide, in our view, practical instruments that will enable us to successfully confront the new challenges resulting from the new vision that we share and in which human rights and their promotion are fully integrated into the Union's external policy.
In theory, there are no substantial differences in the approach adopted by the Union institutions on defining how to address the development of human rights and the consolidation of democracy in the world, but it is when it comes to translating words into deeds, however, that differences between the institutions emerge.
All too often, the democratic demands made on our partners take second place to the economic and commercial interests of the Union as a whole and of its individual Member States.
Let us add to this another observation, which is in my view even more paradoxical: despite the fact that we share a single doctrine, a number of different policies are in force.
Just take the paradigmatic case of Cuba, and I only mention this as one example.
The Council is blocking relations, whilst the Member States maintain bilateral relations, in trade and in all types of other fields with the island.
Under these circumstances, the aim of this report is not to reiterate the Union's by now well-known position on this matter, but rather to seek to put forward proposals for firm action, both in the negotiation of agreements of all kinds between the European Union and third states and in the application of these agreements, as well as their possible suspension.
The proposals contained in this report are intended to provide the work of the various Community institutions with greater coherence, putting an end to the de facto contradictions and to the particular predominance of the political will of the Council in this field, because in our opinion, the fact that the Union does not have a position of its own, expressed with a single voice, causes us to act on the international stage according to necessity or under the changing leadership of others who do not always share our interests in this field.
In drafting this report we have been both ambitious and responsible; we have shown the ambition that committing ourselves to the defence of human rights in the world requires and the responsibility that comes from realising that the challenge of integrating human rights into the Union's external policy is a genuinely complex matter.
We have also borne in mind, however, that the contradictions between institutions and the lack of unanimity, coordination and unity in action are the worst enemy of human rights and of democratisation in the world.
The proposals put forward in this report must, therefore, be seen as a means of overcoming this situation and of overcoming our own contradictions.
As Mr Patten stated this afternoon in his intervention, we are fond of lecturing others on human rights but we would sometimes do well to look at ourselves.
My first proposal is, therefore, to ask the Commission to draw up an interinstitutional code of conduct, designed to ensure a more coherent and more equitable approach in the Union's external action in this field.
This code must govern relations between the Union and the more than 120 States to which the democratic clause currently applies.
A code, ladies and gentlemen, that will be an instrument for defining the terms, both internal and external, under which dialogue takes place; a code to provide cohesion for the speech and the actions of the Union, but never to undermine dialogue; a code which serves as a political instrument, not a legal or ethical one, which systematically collates the Union's values and political thought and its rules of implementation.
I should like to emphasise that such a code must not be based on the punitive and suspensive nature of the human rights clause, but on mutual respect between the parties concerned, incorporating as many positive incentives as possible and including generous cooperation programmes, that will enable respect for human rights to be strengthened at all levels.
Our objectives must be not only to evaluate the progress made by the various partner countries in the field of human rights but also to achieve a coherent balance between countries and regions, above all preventing unfair results, comparative injustices and the treatment of these countries and regions with double standards, all of which we saw in Geneva.
The code must, ultimately, be the handbook for parliamentary democracy.
The second proposal that this report makes, and which I should like to go into, recommends that the Parliament produced by the 2004 elections should establish a Commission on Human Rights responsible for problems relating to human rights, democratisation in third countries and relations with international organisations active in the sphere of human rights
Thirdly and lastly, I should like to mention the proposal for the Commission to establish a European Union Agency for Human Rights and Democracy, a suggestion that was made by the Cologne European Council.
This agency, ladies and gentlemen, would be a body whose objective would be to establish common criteria and parameters for analysing the human rights situation in the world, drawing up an annual assessment that will facilitate interinstitutional action in accordance with the elements that constitute the code.
It is, of course, the Commission that will have to establish the areas in which the agency will act but it would be very useful, in order to produce more effective and coordinated work, if it could, for example, include the evaluation of the impact of structural measures, given their enormous importance in the processes of reconciliation following armed conflict.
Lastly, it will be a useful instrument, that does not take competences away from anyone, but which adds both its own and external efforts and resources.
Finally, with regard to the five amendments tabled by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, I must say that I am not going to accept them and that I am going to ask plenary to vote for the report, which was adopted by a broad majority in committee, with three abstentions and not a single vote against.
Nevertheless, I thank both Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and the other honourable Members of all political groups who tabled amendments and who discussed matters with us during the drafting of this report, because their work has helped to enrich it.
I should furthermore like to ask Parliament's services to bear in mind that the original text is in Spanish and to revise the other versions, because there are some differences in the finer points of meaning.
Mr President, while we are yet deliberating in this House, live pictures of Parliament are coursing through the world of the media, and they are of the collective 'no' that the overwhelming majority has just delivered to a man who is doing precisely the opposite of the things that this report stands for and which constitute Europe's core values.
Together and quite decisively, we have said 'no' to those who would seduce us with their radicalism, and to those who treat humanity with contempt, and, in this report, we are saying 'yes' to human rights with no ifs or buts.
This is far from being only something we call for in politics; it is also a challenge to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and, although it might be wondered what it has to do with this issue, it is actually a great deal, because, in an age of globalisation, it is increasingly the multinational enterprises that are called on to take steps in this direction.
Whilst we in politics have to hear the accusations of hypocrisy levelled at the former foreign policy of the USA and at the EU's foreign policy, which does not yet really exist, that accusation applies yet more to businesses.
Only if they too manage to come round to defending human rights with no ifs or buts, will we be spared much of what we all feared was coming to us when the terrible events of 11 September struck us.
What is astonishing about this report is not so much that it pays lip-service to many familiar things, but that there was, in our Industry Committee, which is a rather conservative set-up and not very familiar with these topics, unanimous support for establishing social standards, and for a Green Paper that would trenchantly call for social responsibility on the part of enterprises, even though the person to whom today's 'no' was directed is also a member of this committee.
Our decision was unanimous.
Why?
Because the despiser of democracy, who plays this down, was not even there and did no work on it!
I hope that all of Europe's voters will see this, and, at the same time, also see when we are saying 'no' and to what we are saying 'yes', that is, to this report and to human rights without ifs and buts.
Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I would firstly like to thank the Commission for their communication on the promotion of human rights and also congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez, on her excellent report, which complements and strengthens the already positive proposals put forward by the Commission in their communication.
The European Union's commitment to the defence of human rights and democratic principles needs effective, and above all coherent, action; if there is no coherence, there is no credibility, and without credibility there is no authority to promote and demand respect for human rights.
For this reason I support the strategic and comprehensive approach proposed by the Commission with regard to integrating human rights into EU foreign policy and ensuring that all policies, all Community programmes and projects, take this issue into account.
Finally, I support the approach geared towards humanitarian aid based on human rights, because of the importance it can have in terms of conflict prevention, and I believe that Country Strategy Papers should propose specific measures for the promotion of human rights, which should be treated as a priority.
The struggle for human rights cannot be disassociated from the fight against poverty and development cooperation policy, inasmuch as both promote the establishment of the economic and social conditions necessary to guarantee peace and to ensure that everyone can live in dignity; conditions without which the respect for fundamental rights is no more than a pipe dream.
For this reason I would make a particular request to the Commission that, in the context of political dialogue and the discussion of the Country Strategy Papers, universal access to education should be considered as a priority issue, because education is indispensable for the development of populations, and without development it will be very difficult for us to talk about full respect for human rights.
Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I should like to thank the Commission for its communication. Above all, however, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for their sound reports.
Parliament has always given high priority to human rights and defended them in all circumstances, and we have not defended them any the less since 11 September 2001.
In relation to the candidate countries - which are also of course, in a way, third countries - we have had great success in attaching importance to human rights and democratisation through the Copenhagen Criteria and the whole set of EU regulations. In that connection, we have also focused upon women's rights and rights in general.
That applies not merely to the candidate countries but also to the developing countries.
I do not think that the Commission's communication is completely clear regarding how, in purely practical terms, we are to secure human rights specifically for women.
There is of course no doubt at all that, in a long list of the countries we cooperate with, women are oppressed in a range of different areas.
They are very often victims of religious or cultural traditions, and I believe we need to take stock of the concept of religious and cultural traditions used to oppress a quite specific group, namely girls and women in general.
In this connection, I believe that we must try to involve women themselves more actively, and perhaps we should start by developing a number of programmes with the help of those women who have come to Europe, for we do not always have precise policies for tackling their status in our own countries.
If we were to adopt this approach, we could perhaps also obtain some experience of use in connection with the developing countries.
I should like especially to refer to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities in which we propose that the Commission do some very practical work on a number of aspects of this area.
Mr President, it is right and proper that the European Union should focus strongly on human rights issues.
I have been in the forefront of those campaigning for human rights, democracy and the rule of law in countries such as Burma and Zimbabwe, where the re-election of President Mugabe last month and the political violence and intimidation that continued to accompany it, were a matter of great concern and make a mockery of international actions.
If we are to be more effective in our efforts, then it seems to me that we need to focus more specifically on such areas of genuine human-rights abuse.
We should not define the concept of human rights so widely that every human desire and affliction is embraced.
We must take care that we do not allow extremists and terrorists to exploit our concern for human rights.
While we must be ever watchful of the civil liberties of our citizens, we must ensure that human rights legislation does not intrude excessively into operational areas which affect our ability to protect our law-abiding citizens and our democracies, particularly at a time of heightened threat.
Human rights must not become a device that helps give comfort, even financial compensation, to those such as terrorists, themselves the worst abusers of human rights.
The reports before us today are commendable for their coverage, but they sometimes stray into areas best avoided.
To some extent they lose sight of the original concept of human rights.
They make no mention of the need for good governance and the fact that corrupt governments in failed states are often the prime source of human rights abuse.
These are general points, but there are some specific points that we cannot support.
For example, while we strongly support a ban on the horrendous exploitation and abuse of children as child soldiers in countries such as Uganda and Sierra Leone, we cannot support a ban on the recruitment of soldiers under 18 in our own countries.
The British Army is probably the best in the world.
Some 5 000 personnel, 4.5% of its strength, are under eighteen.
More than a third of its personnel proudly and voluntarily sign up before they reach adulthood.
They are not deployed to areas of conflict until they turn 18.
It would be a gross mistake and an intrusion into an area of uniquely national competence to try and ban such recruitment.
We cannot accept the incorrect interpretation of the Geneva Convention, or the excessive criticism of US actions in its handling of prisoners at Guantanamo, when the United States administration has made it clear that it will ensure that the basic human rights of all those held in custody will be respected.
We do not share the enthusiasm for an international criminal court, as currently proposed, which might easily become a political instrument and whose jurisdiction over real human rights abusers, such as terrorists, is unclear.
We do not support the communitarisation of foreign policy in the European Union.
There is much we can support, but I have outlined those areas which we cannot support.
Instead of constant self flagellation, hand-ringing and searching for flaws in our own democracies we really must be more effective in correcting the constant and massive abuse of human rights which is the daily lot of people is so many far-flung countries.
Mr President, let me disagree with the previous speaker.
We absolutely have to acknowledge the flaws of our own democracy.
That was absolutely germane to the debate about the Middle East Unless we recognise our own flaws and inadequacies, how can we ever bring about changes in other democracies?
That is what these two reports do brilliantly.
Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez' report reminds us that we have agreements with human rights and democracy clauses yet we do nothing.
We stand by because the economic factors prevent us from acting.
We look at the economic provisions rather than the demands of citizens who look to us to improve their lives through the agreements that the EU and its Member States have signed and ratified.
Mr Van Hecke's report reminds us that there is much that is wrong with the world and brilliantly focuses us on the need for the European Union to speak with one voice.
As a delegate last week in Geneva, I witnessed that the Commission is arguably one of the most ineffective Commissions known to those long attenders.
Why?
Because the Middle East is being used as a ball that is being batted between one group of nation states and another.
At the same time, what happens?
We stand here in this chamber, enjoying this luxury to contradict one another, to belong to different parties, to have different ideas, to have different sexual orientation, a different colour, a different way of life.
That is the reality of human rights abuses.
We cannot be narrow in the interpretation of human rights.
We need to be global.
We need to be expansive.
Finally, a quotation after September 11: 'an attack upon one is an attack upon us all.'
That is the reality.
That is the immutable principle in the defence of human rights and universal freedoms.
Mr President, it is perhaps more important than ever today to stand up for tolerance and human rights at a time when racism and intolerance are raising their ugly heads and when the winds of xenophobia and anti-Semitism are being felt in ever more European countries.
I am proud that, in general, the European Parliament holds its head high when it comes to defending human dignity in the world.
Tolerance, respect, democracy and human rights are building blocks of European cooperation, and these values must always be defended.
The EU has a good policy in this area but, as many have said, it is far too fuzzy and incoherent.
We need a coordinated, credible and consistent strategy that is integrated naturally into the EU's other activities.
That is something we have repeated many times.
It is also unfortunate that we have abandoned the tradition of holding a major human rights debate at the part-session in Strasbourg and have instead spread the debate out so that, for example, Mrs Swiebel's report on human rights in the EU is to be debated much later.
That is symptomatic of the fact that, in this area too, our work is incoherent.
For quite a few years, Parliament and the Commission have proposed different measures for coordinating policy between the institutions and improving follow-up.
Few of these proposals become a reality.
They are nonetheless quite pressing, and I cannot understand why it should be so difficult to put them into effect.
Mr Van Hecke's report focuses on terrorism and modern slavery.
Slavery and trafficking in human beings, especially children, are terrible problems and they occur, to some extent, in secret.
It is truly excellent that these matters are being brought out into the open.
Terrorism and human rights are topical subjects too.
Especially here in the European Parliament, we have highlighted the fact that the fight against terrorism, which is obviously incredibly important, also raises a number of issues about integrity and legal certainty.
The open society must never be weakened by undemocratic methods.
We should like to have seen more of these issues addressed in what is otherwise a very good report supported by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
We agree entirely with the philosophy and the intentions behind Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez' report.
We have doubts, however, about some of the proposals made in it, for example that concerning the new interinstitutional code.
Certainly, this is extremely praiseworthy, but we wonder how it relates to the demands we are already making.
Shall we ever be able to cooperate with anyone if all these demands have to be fulfilled?
We believe in dialogue and, now already, we are making demands, for example in Article Two of the Association Agreement, which are not being fulfilled.
Should we in that case be adding more hoops that have to be passed through?
We also have our doubts about setting up a new human rights agency.
What is such a bureau meant to do?
What mandate is it to have?
A single committee for citizens' and human rights is, however, an excellent idea that we support.
Human dignity is still violated in the most odious ways throughout the world.
The EU can play an important role when it comes to defending human rights.
We need increased coordination, improved assessment and follow-up and better documentation for analysis purposes, however.
We must speak with one voice.
Only then can the EU obtain real influence.
Mr President, recent events both in the Middle East and in the heart of Europe, in the French elections, have once again made us realise how thin, fragile and under threat of danger the shell that protects democracy, human rights and the structures of the rule of law can be.
As Mr Van Hecke and Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m stated, in the fight against terrorism we have also come up against totally new dangerous pressures that make human rights work more difficult than before.
In these circumstances we are also in danger of being guilty of the same thing we accuse the governments of many countries of, which is to say a rhetorical commitment to human rights that fails, however, to lead to any purposeful and coherent action being taken.
It is just empty talk.
We do not need the new agency that Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez is proposing in her report; what we need instead is political will.
We must find this political will in our own institutions, in Parliament, the Commission and, first and foremost, in the Council of Ministers, which has shown little but uncertainty and only now and again given a credible performance in the Human Rights Forum, which Mr Van Hecke once again reminded us of, to his credit.
Instead of merely praising and filing away Mr Van Hecke's excellent report - and that also goes for most of Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez's report, which I think is very worthy of our support - we should for once take our own words seriously.
When we adopted the report on human rights last year we decided that we would assess the working methods of the EU's competent bodies responsible for human rights issues and democracy.
We have not done that.
We are expected to hold the other EU institutions accountable regarding the implementation of the EU's human rights policy, but we have not done that. Instead we have settled for rhetorical commitments and fine words, which have also been heard here today almost ad nauseam.
For that reason I hope we shall for once take Mr Van Hecke's report, and much of Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez's report also, seriously and undertake the relevant work accordingly.
Mr President, the EU is the civil and economic power that can make a contribution to democracy and human rights, a contribution beyond the scope of weaponry, namely work on crisis prevention.
The real fight for democracy and against oppression and terrorism begins, of course, here.
Through its association and trade agreements, the EU can conduct an active policy in favour of human rights and democracy.
We know that human rights violations have terrible consequences, and when these happen and when terrorism occurs we all too often come out with the question, 'Who is behind this?' and all too rarely with the question 'Why?'.
It is not enough to know 'who'. We must also know 'why'.
We know that behind terrorism lie frustrations, oppression, an absence of democratic opportunities and a lack of human rights, as we see, for example, in the Middle East today and as we see when individual acts of terrorism strike civilians at random in Israel.
We have problems with our policy in the EU.
Not with producing fine phrases, but with taking action initiated by ourselves.
We accept clear breaches of the human rights clauses attached, for example, to the Association Agreement with Israel - clear breaches which have no consequences.
We need to put an end to this hypocrisy.
Our long debates will lead nowhere if we are unwilling either to put an end to the high-flown speeches or to allow the splendid words to be followed by action.
The EU is not powerless. We can in actual fact make a difference.
We could have made a difference in such a way that what some of us experienced in Jenin yesterday might not have actually happened.
We are not powerless. Let us use the influence and power we have.
Mr President, many of you this week will have noticed the exhibition about the work of Herman Hesse in the Spinelli building.
Anyone who has taken the time to look at the exhibition must have been impressed by one of his statements and I quote, "For me the world is not made up of nations, but of people."
Would not the world be a different place if, in our shaping of policy and legislation, in our negotiations and decision-making, we as politicians could keep these words in mind.
There is a need for a new approach to foreign policy and indeed not only to foreign and development policy, but in all aspects of our dealings with third countries.
If we could move away from thinking in terms of facts and figures, sums and statistics, markets and merchandise; if we could remember at all times that our policies impact on the real lives of real people, then we would demonstrate a genuine commitment to the fundamental values we claim to cherish.
The promotion of democracy, respect for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms are all values which form an integral part of the Union which we have built together over the past number of years.
These are the values which have brought peace, prosperity and freedom to our continent, and it is only right and fitting that we should seek to promote these benefits further afield.
I share the view of the rapporteur that what is needed are concrete proposals for firm action.
Lofty ideals and expressions of goodwill are not enough.
We must fully integrate our human rights policies with all policies which involve countries outside the Union, be that trade, agriculture, fisheries, etc. I support the requirement for a democracy clause in international agreements as well as strict monitoring for compliance with these clauses.
The Irish Government currently allocates almost EUR 2 million to democracy and human rights projects.
The grants are aimed at promoting respect for human rights and democracy worldwide.
The emphasis is on helping people to assert their rights and to understand to participate fully in the democratic process.
Building a stronger democratic structure must be a key aspect of development efforts.
There are a broad range of projects which we can support, involving the promotion and protection of human rights and support for democracy and good governance in developing countries.
It is perfectly legitimate to link financial incentives to human rights and democracy questions through our funding of key projects.
Practical steps are being taken to make an ethical foreign policy a reality.
I firmly believe that continued action in this direction would ensure that the support of projects would have a real and positive impact on the lives of poor people living in developing countries.
Mr President, everywhere in the world, people are persecuted, tortured or humiliated.
I applaud the fact that the European Union wants to stand up for these people.
After all, the European Union wants to be a community of values.
This also means that it employs the instruments it has at its disposal in order to protect the oppressed elsewhere.
Mr Van Hecke rightly calls for a more structured approach to this problem.
However, I should like to make two observations regarding this human rights debate.
Firstly, we must be cautious. In our Member States, racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism still constitute a considerable danger.
As such, it is not appropriate for us to set ourselves up as a benchmark for the rest of the world.
This is why I feel that some statements, particularly in the report by Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez, go too far.
Without disputing the fact that every state must adhere to international law, I call for more respect for other choices and for other cultures.
A second observation concerns the question whether the protection of human rights is best served by an approach which is as centralised as possible.
Unlike Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez, I do not think so.
The interests and contacts of the Member States are too diverse.
Gathering all these too tightly would only lead to an internal competitive battle. In the final analysis, this would be at the expense of the protection of human rights.
If every Member State and every European institution employs its own instruments wisely, a great deal could be improved today in the fight for recognition of human rights.
Mr President, as the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has stated, the human rights clause is not producing real effects because of the failure of the Commission and the Council to act.
Today, the democratic clause serves only to compel Parliament and the public to accept trade and economic agreements concluded with military, religious or political totalitarian regimes.
Some months ago now, when Mr Dupuis went to Laos to call for democracy and the release of five democratic activists of the Movement for Democracy of 26 October 1999, he and another four radical activists were imprisoned in breach of all the international agreements, including, in particular, the agreements between the European Union and Laos.
Some months on, with regard to the non-violent action of Mr Dupuis, we can warn the human, civil and political rights activists who are placing their hope in the European Union not to be under any illusion.
We feel it is our duty and our responsibility to declare that the inertia of the Commission and the Council is encouraging political crime while, in terms of law and jurisdiction, they are guilty of omission.
Some weeks ago now, Commissioner Patten, responding to a question from Mr Cappato regarding these Laotian militants who have been in prison for over three years, stated that the Commission was not planning to convene an emergency meeting of the Joint Committee but that it was going to pursue the channels already open.
I am sure the democratic activists who have been in prison for three years will be delighted to wait for the European Union to wade through all its diplomatic red tape before it does anything to help.
I have just one thing to say to Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez.
She said that the Commission and the Council are turning a blind eye to the violations that have been observed.
That is not true: they are turning two blind eyes; they do not want to see anything, they do not want to hear anything and they do not want to say anything, and above all, they do not want to do anything.
Mr President, I would like first of all to thank Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez and Mr Van Hecke for the enormous amount of work that they have put into their respective reports.
I am going to concentrate on the work of Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez because it reflects work I myself began in the early 1990's, after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
There are very few people in the Chamber who were here at that time, but I can still see one or two officials from those days.
At the time, Parliament decided to work closely with the Commission in establishing a programme to promote democracy and human rights, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe, but also in those countries close to us and in the wider world, and to put the whole process onto a more systematic basis.
That led to the creation of budgetary chapter B7-700, now known as the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
The first thing I would like to say is that the success of this scheme is not widely recognised.
Over a period of years, many millions of euros have been spent on projects large and small, near and far, by and large with tremendous success and a very high profile in the countries in which they have been active.
This initiative has been a success.
There are criticisms, as with any programme, but by and large we should congratulate the Commission on the way in which it handled this matter.
However, in 1999, the whole process was reversed.
The process under which the Parliament and the Commission, alongside the G-24, the Council of Europe and one or two other entities, was involved in the monitoring and selection of programmes.
The Commission then took on the whole process in-house.
I now come to the heart of the recommendations of Mrs. DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez' report.
Should there be an agency for human rights and democratisation?
My answer, and the answer of the PPE-DE group is: not yet.
We think that the Commission should still be given the responsibility for maintaining these programmes.
Obviously, we need to watch it closely, but to create yet another bureaucracy does not seem appropriate to us at this time.
I personally have no objection to the restoration by Parliament of the Committee on human rights and democratisation.
This discussion, however, needs to take place nearer the time of the next election.
In the meantime, we could surely restore the working party on human rights and democratisation within the Foreign Affairs Committee to maintain the oversight that this Parliament should now have on the EUR 100 million being spent annually under the Budget.
My proposition is fundamentally this: Parliament, and I am grateful to those colleagues who are still in the Chamber, should re-focus on human rights and democratisation.
These are political projects, they need political oversight.
We should not leave it all to the Commission, still less to the Council.
So, colleagues, let us take an interest again.
I am grateful to Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez for focusing attention on this matter.
Many of her propositions are well worth pursuing, but not the ones I have singled out as being rather bureaucratic.
I am very grateful for the work she has done.
Mr President, today's debate and report on human rights would appear to be timely.
Consider the pictures of Jenin which have been recalled in this House today, the war which is degenerating into hatred, the hatred which is taking root and generating intolerance, but consider too the need for respect for diversities and minorities, which is an extremely sensitive area of the uphill struggle to secure human rights.
That is precisely why our debate is timely, for it is taking place at a time when we are calling upon Parliament to renew its efforts to protect diversities; furthermore, all this is happening on the very day that Mr Le Pen would have us assert a political doctrine, a design, a resolve to deny any respect for diversities and any form of tolerance in politics.
This would seem to be a helpful coincidence giving our endeavours positive and proactive meaning.
One more word on the subject of terrorism: I was pleased to hear the point made that terrorism is not a threat to the West or to democracy: it is a threat to and a denial of human rights.
The response to terrorism cannot fail to disregard human rights, whoever the people are we are dealing with.
It is wrong to punish barbarism with barbarism - and I am quoting Cesar Baccarat here, not our group - and so we demand that there be no hasty convictions, no short cut taken around the proper procedure in the trials of the Guantanamo prisoners, and we call for provision to be made for an appeal procedure as in all trials for any crime.
We call upon the United States to act quickly, diligently and rigorously in ratifying the convention which will allow the International Criminal Court to start work.
A few words on the subject of underage working, Mr President: we believe that all forms of underage working, of child labour, are a violation of the right to childhood, which is a stage of life during which people are not supposed to use machine guns, for example.
This also applies to child soldiers and suggests, once again, that human rights are only taken into account when it is convenient.
Although it might not be convenient for the British army, we would prefer it if there were no more underage soldiers.
Mr President, wherever else the world may make progress, it fails to do so in the area of human rights.
The number of violations increases, and with it the feeling of powerlessness to do anything about it.
Europe, the mother of moral values, should not resign itself to this.
The European Union must adopt a more consistent and less hypocritical policy.
However, I do believe that every country where violations occur should be assessed individually.
The implications of punitive measures are ultimately more important than the way in which they are targeted.
A rigid code of conduct is not effective.
It is preferable to apply clear guidelines strictly, taking into account the specific circumstances.
If sanctions are imposed, the population should always be spared as much as possible.
In the European Union's policy, human rights should not only be given priority in words, but mainly in deeds.
Without civilisation, there is no progress, and without human rights, there is no civilisation.
Mr President, the European Union's commitment to human rights and vigilance in their defence must shape all our Community policies.
As the world's leading economic entity, the Union can exert a powerful diplomatic influence on human progress, especially in the poorest countries that most frequently breach these rights, but which are most often victims as well.
In fact, these countries, which have suffered unbalanced and desperate economic and commercial foundations for far too long, are fertile breeding grounds for human rights violations when a cultural or religious wall of silence which single-handedly seeks to justify tradition or customs condemns more than half the population, namely women, to innate and eternal inferiority.
We speak of 'the rights of man'.
We should in fact say 'right of the human person', since we must be aware that when men are persecuted, women are always treated even worse.
We only have to cast our minds back to the barbaric events not so long ago, when two Nigerian women, in a parody of justice, were condemned to death by stoning for adultery.
These cases, which received extensive media coverage and had fortunate outcomes, must not hide the extreme distress of other women, a whole population of which, in the Islamic Republic of Iran, for example, are held prisoner by laws and customs that are based on the inequality of the sexes.
Segregation and genuine State terrorism govern and shape the lives of women, if they do not decree their death through savage practices such as stoning.
Human rights also grant this recognition of individuals, sexes and peoples.
Parliament would do credit to these rights and its democratic ambition by recognising aboriginal peoples, as has been possible since a United Nations permanent body on aboriginal issues was set up, and by establishing a delegation to deal with these issues, which is what we voted for in 1992.
We need more than declarations and resolutions, we need practical action which must promote human rights.
Mr President, to my mind, the European Union's self-appointed position as the guardian of human rights is sheer hypocrisy.
As far as I can see, we have as many violations in the European Union itself, such as violations of the right to work, to housing and to free education, health and welfare, as in other countries which the European Union supports, such as Turkey, Israel and others.
The European Union is also responsible, as a result of its policy, for the starvation and misery in the rest of the world.
I too have just returned from Palestine; how, if not as a blatant violation of human rights, are we to describe the ultra-modern Israeli weapons turned on the unarmed people of Palestine who, in the final analysis, are fighting for the whole of mankind?
Faced with this situation, the European Union has kept to its policy of sitting squarely on the fence between oppressor and oppressed and has confined itself to making statements and calling on beleaguered President Arafat to stop the intifada, which it calls terrorism, in order to stop the Israeli attacks.
In addition, those here in the House calling for the same thing, Mr President, do not even have the courtesy to explain to us with what right Israel is holding the elected president of a nation prisoner, with what right it is going about arresting people, including members of the Palestinian assembly such as Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who has distinguished himself in his untiring efforts to bring about peace, with what right it is killing and laying waste.
One thing you can be sure of is that Israel does not want peace.
Its objective is to wipe out an entire nation and implement the chauvinist expansionist plans of its most extreme elements...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the annual report on human rights in 2001 shows comprehensively that the human rights position across the world has deteriorated dramatically.
There have been 250 conflicts since the Second World War, and 86 million people have been killed in them.
Mr Van Hecke, our rapporteur, deserves our thanks for not having shied away from also addressing the present-day consequences of 11 September.
We are faced with the incomprehensible phenomenon of the crimes of 11 September being taken as an excuse to abrogate human rights that had been won over centuries of struggle, such as the Geneva Convention and the rule of law over nations.
Crimes are thus being used to abrogate international law, which is part of civilisation's cultural riches.
To such an extent has this become the case that we can observe something like a reversion to 'might is right' on an international scale.
To combine, as one sees fit, martial law with something alleged to be criminal law is utterly intolerable.
It is to be feared that the next step will be for the law of the strongest to even acquire some sort of legitimacy.
The European Union must counter these developments by demonstrating the courage of its own convictions to a high degree.
It cannot be acceptable for states to consciously place themselves outside the international judicial order, with the effect that they are thereby actively stimulating the spiral of violence and accelerating it still further.
Mr President, I shall concentrate mainly on the report by Mr Van Hecke who, I think, has, to his credit, focused on a small number of issues.
The report concerns modern slavery and threats and violence on the part of terrorist groups.
Slavery is on the increase throughout the world, including in Europe.
Slavery is not a thing of the past.
It is based upon a view of human beings that is as out of keeping with our civilisation and Christian culture as it can possibly be.
It is based on the very opposite of the idea of people's equal, unique and inviolable worth.
The UN's children's fund, UNICEF has raised the alarm about the fact that 200 000 children in West Africa are victims of trafficking, with the cocoa industry responsible for a significant proportion of this.
There is also evidence that child labour and trafficking in human beings are on the increase.
It is mostly boys who work on the cocoa plantations of West Africa and often have to do the heavy work of harvesting the cocoa beans.
The working day for these children is up to fifteen hours long.
It is not only a question of child labour, but children are also sold as slaves by one cocoa producer to another.
The Council, the Commission and the EU Member States must take action, and vigorous action at that.
Mention should also be made of the trafficking in women and children that is taking place more and more in Europe.
The countries most affected are Romania, Moldavia and the Czech Republic.
Such trafficking is a great tragedy for those affected, who are exploited in a horrible way, above all within prostitution.
The UN protocol on trafficking in human beings, added to the UN Convention Against Organised Transnational Crime, is an important tool in this area.
The Member States and the candidate countries must now translate their words into genuine action in order to put an end to this loathsome trade.
National governments, police and judicial systems appear passive, powerless and resigned faced with the task of tackling these fundamental issues of human dignity in depth and combating the sex trade and trafficking in human beings in similar detail.
Such resignation is dangerous for democracy itself.
People demand vigorous and determined efforts when it comes to solving these problems.
Allow me also to emphasise paragraphs 52, 53, 54 and 55 of Mr Van Hecke's report, which are about religious freedom.
I find it completely incomprehensible that converting from Islam to Christianity, Buddhism or other religions is punishable by the death penalty in most Arabic and Muslim countries.
That is not consonant with human dignity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both these reports have addressed many important issues, not all of which can be considered here, but tolerance, respect and mutual esteem always reach their limits when universal human rights are violated.
The way politics works, it always involves a tightrope walk with hope on one side and despair on the other.
Events in Zimbabwe at present tempt us to despair, while we can perhaps derive hope from developments in Sierra Leone.
Things can, though, seem quite different the day after tomorrow.
We pointed the way with our collaboration with the ACP states on the Cotonou Agreement, with its clauses on human rights and democracy, and its commitment to good governance and the rule of law.
We have an instrument, even if it is not as solid as we - whose political dialogue in Parliament supports this work - might well have wished.
This political dialogue, I believe, is of outstanding importance, as agreement can be reached, in the final analysis, only through discussions with each other.
That is why there is also the entitlement to consultation before suspension is resorted to.
Even that is not a straightforward matter, for we have to ask ourselves how we are to punish the dictatorial regime, without at the same time affecting the people.
In this connection, then, I tend to go along with a proverb that is often used in Germany: 'The impossible gets done at once, but miracles take a bit longer.'
We will have to have staying power, and I do not know whether human rights really are violated more frequently today than in the past.
What is certain, though, is that crime, too, has become public.
More things become known to us today, and we are of course forced to take action.
The fact, though, that crime is now public and that there are almost always cameras there to record it, gives a chance of fighting things that used to remain hidden away.
Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation of both reports, which I feel complement each other well, although I am not fully satisfied for I feel that the grand declarations they contain are extremely hypocritical: while progress in the world is advancing at an exponential rate, we have to admit that violence, oppression and barbarism are increasing and human rights are being violated at the same exponential rate.
However, I do welcome the fact that human rights are among the priorities of our foreign policy, that new forms of slavery are being highlighted such as terrorism, in particular, and the slavery of forced child labour and the slavery of forced prostitution; moreover, there are common positions relating to a capacity for cooperation within the World Trade Organisation and the International Labour Organisation to combat these forms of slavery: this is therefore a fight against the exploitation of man by man in all fields and all areas, especially where minors and child abuse are concerned.
It is important that these two reports have stressed positive actions promoting human rights, for this is the first time that has been done.
This is not just a question of condemnation, therefore, it is not just a matter of identifying these violations: it is the promotion of human rights. This is achieved through two innovations: firstly, an ambassador for human rights, the expression of Parliament, and secondly, a European agency for the promotion of human rights.
To achieve these two innovations we need a responsible foreign policy made up of practical proposals: that is what we will be calling for and we will make sure we are involved in their development.
Mr President, human rights are an issue we Spanish Socialists are particularly sensitive to, since, at a time when for the majority of men and women in the countries of the European Union human rights formed the main foundation for their system of coexistence, Spain still had to go through decades of hard work and suffering before achieving acceptable and dignified human rights conditions in our society.
Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez, the rapporteur, is well aware of this.
She understands the situation better than most, perhaps, given that, being a Basque and a democrat, she belongs to a category of Spanish and European people who, even now, have to fight against ultra-nationalist terrorism to consolidate the fundamental rights which are the European Union's distinguishing marks.
The purpose of my speech is mainly to express my support for Mrs DÃ­ez's and Mr Van Hecke's proposals and suggestions, adding just one or two observations.
The first is that there should not be a restrictive interpretation of the many excellent initiatives they have suggested.
For example, it should not be the case that very high standards in human rights should be a prerequisite and unavoidable condition for the European Union to be able to cooperate with third countries, but rather that to raise the level of respect for human rights in each country with which we cooperate should be the objective and result of such cooperation.
My second observation comes as a response to criticisms we have heard with regard to the fact that, whilst we make many demands in the area of human rights in relation to third countries, particularly countries in the developing world, we are far more tolerant, on the other hand, when faced with frankly unsatisfactory situations in this area within EU countries themselves.
This is not true.
These reports refer specifically to third countries, but I take it for granted that the moral and political authority of our debate on cooperation in the world surrounding the European Union, with which we hope to be able to have a coherent relationship, will be much more credible and effective if we practice what we preach, and when what we require of others is endorsed by our own conduct, and by our self-imposed requirement to continue making progress, day after day, to improve the protection of human rights within the EU itself.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission and especially of my colleague Mr Patten, who is unable to take part in today's discussion, I wish to thank Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez and Mr Van Hecke for their reports, which complement each other well.
Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez, in your report on the Commission communication on human rights, you call on the institutions to work out a common code of conduct to serve as a basis for the EU's relations with third states.
The Commission reaffirms the significance, for the European Union's relations with other states, of a constructive and dynamic concept founded on critical partnership and collaboration.
The Council, too, reaffirmed this approach with its guidelines for dialogues on human rights.
Such dialogue shows particular promise when respect for human rights and for democratic principles forms an essential component of agreements concluded with third states and when such agreements include a clause on human rights.
As has already been mentioned, the Cotonou Agreement was a forward step of this kind.
The Commission is prepared to discuss the form this clause should take in future and how it is to be applied efficiently, and, in doing so, will attach great importance to Parliament's conceptions.
In her report, Mrs DÃ­az GonzÃ¡lez goes on to advocate the establishment of a European Agency for Human Rights and Democracy, which would perform a reporting and advisory role.
As stated in its communication, though, the Commission takes the view that the European Union has no lack of either facilities for consultation or sources of information.
The European Union can rely on reports by the United Nations, the Council of Europe and, not least, a large number of international non-governmental organisations.
The actual challenge for every institution is to make prompt and comprehensive use of the information available and then summon the political will to take difficult decisions.
An additional advisory forum would make it impossible to cope with this challenge, and it would, furthermore, be extremely difficult for the Commission to transfer powers to such a body in the sensitive area of human rights.
Mr Van Hecke's report is devoted to two main subjects, one being counter-terrorism and the other the fight against modern forms of slavery.
The European Union emphatically condemns slavery in all its forms, including, as the concept does today, alongside traditional slavery and the slave trade, such things as serious violations of the rights of children and of women, the exploitation of certain dependency situations, and apartheid.
These continue to afflict millions of people in many parts of the world.
The European Union has only recently made a statement to the Human Rights Committee in which it welcomed the various international instruments, notably those of the ILO, for combating these forms of slavery, and also called for more positive action against trafficking in human beings.

As regards basic working norms, the Commission included in last year's communication a comprehensive strategy with the title of 'Promoting core labour standards and improving social governance in the context of globalisation' under which countries are to receive incentives and be put in a position to implement core labour standards and adhere to them.
One definite step was the Council's acceptance of a revised generalised scheme of preferences - the social incentive system - which provides for additional preferences for countries which adhere to core labour norms.
From now on, in addition, serious contraventions of one of the ILO's fundamental conventions will be among the grounds for temporary withdrawal of generalised preferences.
It was above all on these grounds that the EU suspended the Generalised System of Preferences for Burma.
The Commission is now giving increased financial support to projects in many countries against trafficking in human beings, against trafficking in women, against child labour or slavery, for example, projects combating the exploitation of juveniles in Gabon, Benin, Togo, and Nigeria, or projects within the frameworks provided by the STOP or DAPHNE programmes, which are aimed at combating trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation.
Mr Van Hecke is quite right to emphasise in his report that the events of 11 September manifest new forms of terrorism.
It is to that part of the report that I now turn.
It is only right that the whole political debate has been permeated by the fight against terrorism.
Considerations of human rights have an effect at different levels.
The European Union holds fast to the important legal distinction that it is states that can violate human rights, whilst terrorist acts are to be categorised in legal terms as criminality.
Despite the urgent need for action, it is most important to counter-terrorism in all its aspects that we ourselves and our allies strictly maintain the values of international human rights and of humanitarian law.
Mr Van Hecke's report furthermore refers to the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
The Commission is actively endeavouring to implement its new strategy, which comprises a longer-term concept providing for the selection of a limited number of subject areas, which it treats as of core importance and in which the Community's contribution can bring about real change.
As before, the Commission will continue to involve Parliament in the discussion on how the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights is to be implemented.
Let me again congratulate Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez and Mr Van Hecke on their reports.
The Commission welcomes the collaboration with Parliament in further advancing our common cause of democracy and human rights.
The European Union is founded on respect for human rights, and this is true both of internal affairs policy within Europe and of Europe's policy in foreign affairs.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.03 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0109/2002) by Mr Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Draft Amending Budget 2/2002 of the European Union for the financial year 2002 (7033/2002 - C5-0131/2002 - 2002/2043(BUD)).
Mr President, looking around we could have met in the bar.
It would have been a lot more cosy than this.
It is nice to see those of you who are here.
Whilst this appears on the agenda as the Wynn report, it has only just become the Wynn report.
It was the Costa Neves report.
Carlos Costa Neves, who was the budget rapporteur for 2002, has now moved on to the Portuguese Government, and I for one was sorry to see him leave.
He has done a sterling job and I want to put on record my thanks for the work that he has done on the 2002 Budget.
I understand that the PPE-DE group have now nominated Mr PodestÃ  as the new rapporteur.
So I am the in-between bit.
Hence you have the Wynn report on Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2.
The Council and one or two Members are concerned about the amendments that we have tabled.
The Member States, quite rightly, want the money back that was not spent last year.
This amounts to around EUR 10 billion, a significant amount of money.
It is not the total amount, however, because one amount went back last year, and there is probably still another one or two billion which will come forward in Supplementary and Amending Budget No 3.
We have a choice of whether to give the money back to the Member States or whether we try to put it to use in other areas.
One thing that has been made clear to us is that in next year's budget there could be shortfalls, especially in the Structural Funds, where the Category 2 expenditure on payments may well have to be exceeded.
Therefore, one of the reasons for our amendments is to alleviate that problem next year by making the monies available this year.
Consequently, the Member States will not receive ten billion back, but something in the region of EUR 5.5 billion.
The Council and certain Member States have queried the legality of the amendment and our right to do this.
The simple answer is yes, we do have this right.
We have done similar things since 1994, which have never been challenged by the Council, because it recognises that, at the end of the day, it is the Treaty that counts, and the Treaty gives Parliament the final say on the budget when the President signs the budget.
Consequently, what we consider a routine operation in amending this SAB has given one or two of our friends in the Council some ideas about challenging it from a legal point of view.
I think they would be unwise to do that.
The second problem seems to be that we will delay the new system of own resources by not voting the SAB through in its entirety tomorrow.
