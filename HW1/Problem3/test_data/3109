Differences of opinion notwithstanding, the majority of those affected are agreed that we need to do more.
In particular, we need stricter controls, we need better application of the rules, we need to reduce discards, we need to promote scientific research and we need to involve those affected, especially the fishermen themselves, at an earlier stage and more intensively when taking decisions on fisheries policy.
The Commission therefore agrees to the motions for resolutions on several points.
However, it has the impression, as regards the delicate question of the 6/12-mile zone, that the majority of those affected are in favour of maintaining the status quo.
The Commission will publish its Green Paper in a few weeks' time, together with the reports under Article 14 paragraph 2 of Regulation 3760.
We must use the ensuing debate to discuss how to rectify the shortcomings identified in the reports and suitable solutions for doing so in order to put the fisheries sector in the Community back on a viable basis.
On the evidence of the motions for resolutions, the main objectives of the reform process identified by all three rapporteurs are as follows: to reduce excess capacity and improve coherence with environmental policy measures in order to maintain and re-establish stocks; to ensure that the people directly affected are more closely involved in decision making and to resolve local or urgent problems more efficiently in order to ensure that the rules are adhered to and applied and fisheries management is improved overall - in other words, everything which qualifies as good governance.
Then, to create a fisheries sector which is both sustainable and economically viable and internationally competitive - while at the same time helping those who are forced to look elsewhere for work; to develop a modern foreign fisheries policy which is closely coordinated with other Community policies in order to achieve responsible and rational use of resources, and, most importantly, to redevelop the Mediterranean dimension.
This brings me to Mr Cunha's report on Guinea-Bissau.
This resolution will guarantee the activities of the Community fleet in question, while at the same time supporting the local sector.
I am delighted that the rapporteur supports our proposal.
The sum of EUR 6.5 million now released will be used specifically to restore the fisheries-related installations which suffered serious damage during the armed conflict in Guinea-Bissau.
This will help the Community fleet to make better use of the agreement.
In detail, we want to support the following activities: reconstruction of the infrastructure, controls on and monitoring of the fleet and new research programmes.
I should like to make a few comments here on the terms of payment: a tranche of 50% of the overall amount will be paid out first, as soon as the government has submitted an action programme.
The remainder, in other words the second half, will be paid out once Guinea-Bissau has filed a detailed report on the implementation of individual activities under the action programme and the use of the funds earmarked for them.
Finally, a brief word on the proposed amendments.
Proposed Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 extend the deadline for implementing the activities required to 2003.
I think this proposed amendment is both reasonable and justified and the Commission can therefore support it.
We fully share the concern expressed in proposed Amendment No 4 but, as we already inform the budgetary authority of all financial and budgetary transactions under the terms of our Interinstitutional Agreement, proposed Amendment No 4 is in fact superfluous.
As far as the contributions to the debate on the current state of negotiations with Morocco are concerned, I should like to thank Parliament for its obvious confidence in the Commission's work.
I have to tell you that the agreement ceased de facto to apply 14 months ago, and that the Moroccan side was, unfortunately, not prepared to enter into serious negotiation on a new agreement until the end of October last year, in other words, just three and a half months ago.
We did, however, make good use of the time up to Christmas, with one technical discussion a week in either Brussels or Rabat.
Negotiations were held practically every day in Rabat between 2 January and 9 January.
We really have done our utmost here.
For the rest, it is wrong to say that we have received no support from the Council.
Both the main countries affected and the presidency have supported us in our efforts and I think that, at the end of the day, the meeting between the King of Morocco and our Commission President was a useful one.
I hope that negotiations will again get properly under way, and that hopefully we shall soon be on the home straight.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Bangladesh
The next item is the joint debate on:
the report (A5-0360/2000) by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the People' s Republic of Bangladesh [7595/1/1999 - COM(1999) 155 - C5-0356/2000 - 1999/0086(ACC)];
the oral question (B5-0004/2001) by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to the Commission, on Bangladesh.
Mr President, Bangladesh is rich and poor at the same time.
Rich in human resources, poor in capital means.
It is one of the world' s poorest and most densely populated countries.
It is regularly afflicted by natural disasters.
This is why it is important for Europe to give as much aid as possible.
The agreement with the European Union bears witness to good relations and provides an excellent backdrop to stepping up development cooperation and trade.
In addition, the agreement lays the foundation to the political dialogue which provides for human rights, good governance and democratic freedoms.
On my recent visit to Bangladesh with Mr Miranda, I noticed that they attach far greater importance to relations with Europe than we often realise.
The government as well as the opposition, but also academics, journalists, industry and non-governmental organisations look up to Europe and expect a great deal from us, more than America, for instance.
We should not disappoint them in this expectation, and make every effort to promote positive developments.
The following recent trends can be cited as favourable: economic growth by more than 4%, a fall in the population increase, falling illiteracy and greater participation of women in the political and social arenas.
This is in contrast to the fact that the country labours under the burden of an increase in domestic violence against women, but also in violence on the streets and in political confrontations.
Abused women accounted for more than 30% of the patients in a hospital we visited.
Child labour is still widespread, despite the recent progress made and initiatives presented by the government and industry.
Mass-scale political strikes regularly bring life in Bangladesh to a standstill.
Foreign investment is only possible if the government ensures more peaceful social conditions.
There is also instability politically speaking.
There is a deep historic distrust between the two major parties, despite the fact that you can hardly tell them apart in terms of content.
The opposition must resume its constructive role.
Without peaceful cooperation between the key parties, the country cannot come out of its political and economic impasse.
It is therefore essential for the forthcoming elections to be above board. The European Union should not fail to send observers, including members of this Parliament.
In addition to flooding and erosion of the river banks, the population is also suffering on a large scale from the poisoning of drinking water.
In principle, the European Union can provide valuable aid to help alleviate all of these problems.
Reinforcement of the government apparatus should take centre stage in aid provision.
The state is functioning ineffectively in very many ways, especially in the finance and education sectors.
It is unfortunate that with regard to aid, the European Commission does not have the sound reputation among donors which it should really have.
Often, funds only become available after long delays, it at all.
The delegation is not sufficiently involved in defining the programme.
The shortage of personnel leads to a lack of supervision in projects.
In short, this is a good, practical example which illustrates the need for reforms in the management sector.
In order to provide efficient aid, it is vital for the European Commission, the EU Member States and other donors to dovetail their policies.
The many non-governmental organisations which are present fulfil a key role in the implementation of programmes.
The resources are pooled sector-by-sector, which benefits effectiveness and harms European visibility.
But the advantage outweighs the disadvantage.
Premier Hasina assured us that the Chittagong Hills peace agreement is being implemented to the letter.
From our visit to the site, we gleaned a different impression, if the truth be told.
Neither the Land Commission nor the Regional Council were functioning.
The military presence has not let up.
European aid can only be given to this region if substantial progress is made when the peace agreement is being implemented, which, unfortunately is not yet the case.
The development of Bangladesh hinges on the good governance of the country' s own leaders. Europe cannot offer anything but aid.
My conclusion is that the country should not be as poor as it is now.
Absolutely not. If only the country' s resources were better employed.
Mr President, in actual fact, suffice it to say that I concur with Mr van den Bos, and I would like to take the opportunity to emphasise how fitting Parliament' s recommendations are here.
Bangladesh has always been one of those poor countries which are regularly in the news, and the disasters which hit that country are always heart-rending.
When we now study the statistics, we notice that, all of a sudden, the country could be considered a success story, with economic growth of 5% of the GNP per capita, with growth in export of no less than 12.8% in the five years between 1993 and 1998, and even boasting a decrease in the population growth.
Mothers now have three children instead of seven.
In short, you could be forgiven for thinking that everything is moving in the right direction, but, of course, this is the difference between a country which is very, very, very poor and a country which is only very, very poor.
It remains a problem if you realise that 60 million people live under the poverty line, and you have economic growth which cannot keep up with the population growth.
Out of the 162 countries on the Human Development Index, Bangladesh does not come last, but 145th, which is very sad indeed.
So we welcome this toll-free access of the country' s goods into the European market.
We think that this will have a favourable impact, but we believe that we, ourselves, should make a greater effort to, for example, breathe new life into the jute organisation which died a death.
Finally, I, too, would appeal for more use to be made of the human rights clause which is encapsulated in the first article of the agreement, so as to realise those aspects which Mr van den Bos expressed so eloquently.
Mr President, Commissioner, today, at last, we have an opportunity to express our opinion on the new cooperation agreement concluded with Bangladesh.
Our fellow Member and rapporteur, Mr van den Bos, with whom I visited that country last year, has already stated that we have approved this.
But he also outlined some of the central thoughts of the Committee on Development and Cooperation as to what the Community' s future action in Bangladesh should be.
Without wishing to repeat what has already been stated, I would nevertheless like to highlight some issues, on which we would also like to hear the Commission' s thoughts.
This is the most heavily populated of the so-called 'less-developed countries' .
The fragility of its economic situation, marked by the predominance of the primary sector, which involves around 65% of the working population, and also the acuteness of social problems, are highlighted by the most varied indicators.
And as if this were not enough, there are also the terrible disasters that constantly afflict the country.
In addition to these factors, the political situation, as has already been mentioned, still shows a worrying degree of instability on all counts.
We were able to confirm this for ourselves during our visit to this still young country. We saw the widespread poverty and the problems facing health and education but also some possibilities that are opening up, such as initiatives arising from cooperation, which are taking place at every level, either under the auspices of the government or which are being implemented by NGOs, the interesting use of microcredit, even though it benefits limited numbers of people, and the role and the particularly difficult situation of women.
We also saw the disastrous effects of erosion and of successive floods, and also the dangers and consequences of the huge environmental and health disaster caused by the presence of arsenic in drinking water.
We were also able to see the shortcomings in the political arena, which were quite clear in the climate of great violence that marks relations between the government of Mrs Hasina Wajed of the Awani League and the opposition, particularly the Nationalist Party of Bangladesh, which does not participate on a regular basis in the work of the national parliament.
We also saw the problems and delays in resolving the conflict with the people in the southern part of the country, specifically the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
As you all know, the European Union is Bangladesh' s main trading partner.
Around 45% of that country' s exports come to the European Union.
Bangladesh has also benefited from various development instruments, such as aid for technical and financial cooperation with Asian countries, food and humanitarian aid and exemption from customs duties on exports.
The European Union has also provided Bangladesh with a considerable amount of external aid that has been earmarked for it and on which, in fact, the country is heavily dependent.
We also know that the current agreement carries on from the 1976 agreement, and can be extended according to future needs.
The question we now face now with regard to the circumstances I have just described is to know what real objectives and priorities this new agreement hopes to achieve and in general, what effects we hope to have on sustainable development in the field of administration and on the participation of the public and public organisations in national life.
In the resolution that we adopted in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, we indicated the directions that we felt to be the most appropriate.
Mr van den Bos has already mentioned them in his speech.
We now hope that the Commission will express its agreement or disagreement with the guidelines that we proposed.
We also hope, however, that the Commission will state to what extent it will be willing to provide political support for Bangladesh in order to overcome the problems to which I referred earlier.
Given the requests that the government and the opposition have already made we would also like the Commission to tell us how it intends to support the forthcoming electoral process and whether it will be sending a mission to observe the elections that have already been scheduled for this year.
Mr President, let me first of all say that I feel it is a privilege to discuss these matters, as we are doing here on the basis of your report. For me it represents a sort of idyllic political consensus.
We agree on your report and we welcome it very much and this is not just nice, it is also really valuable for Bangladesh and other partners.
It is very useful that we in Europe should profoundly agree on how to work with our partners.
If we were discussing aimlessly without any sort of direction, they would not have a good partner, so it is really important that we agree.
A year ago I deliberately chose Bangladesh as my first destination on a normal bilateral field trip.
We went there after the UNCTAD conference in Bangkok.
I wanted to go to a non-ACP LDC country to start in the right place.
I also wanted to start in a country as Commissioner doing field trips, a country that I knew well already in order to better be able to assess how the Commission works.
If I went to a country I did not know, there would be too many disturbing impressions, but this one I knew quite well and I am happy to say that I was positively surprised by what I saw in the field.
We were closer to the poor women, we were further out in the villages than I had expected and we worked more through Bangladeshi NGOs than I had expected.
This is a good basis and also one of the reasons why Parliament and Commission are in harmony about where we go now.
There are big problems to discuss with the Government of Bangladesh, notably its inefficiency: it performs as badly as the Commission, so the two of them have a lot to talk about, but we know that and we are clear about it saying "our delivery problems are clear and well-known, but please do not add to them by also being slow and unclear in your decision-taking process".
This is why the new agreement that we are now deciding on is so important, because it, in fact, brings cooperation one step further forward and clarifies priorities.
We will go from one country to another across the world and bring what we are doing up to normal standards concerning the basis of cooperation and priorities.
So this is all very good
As to the questions that have been put concerning the elections, on 27 January we are sending the assessment team from the Commission over there and we will be ready, willing and eager to include representatives of Parliament in an observation capacity.
If this is what we finally decide to do, we think it may be very useful.
Bangladesh has done quite a number of valuable things in recent years: regionally, agreeing more with her neighbours and approaching solutions to very old problems.
As to the Chittagong Hill tribes, we take the view that the issue there is moving too slowly.
I clarified this when I was there in February last year.
On the other hand, problems relating to land-ownership and other things are very difficult to solve in any country.
The attitude is important and I believe they are trying to do something meaningful.
What Mr van den Bos has mentioned concerning donor coordination and the many NGOs in Bangladesh is interesting and important.
Many innovations have taken place there.
Microcredit is a great achievement and it is not only one very famous organisation that has been successful.
But I would come back, when we talk about development in Bangladesh, to the role of women. This is quite remarkable.
Their ability to change the life and the situation of families is extraordinary, but I would, in fact, point to the many young women and girls in the textile factories who in a strange way represent the chaotic way of modernisation.
The alternative - not having jobs - is quite problematical, but the kinds of jobs they have are also very problematical.
At the end of the day our liberalisation, the access for them to our market, is part of the hope of these women and of Bangladesh, so I think we are on the right track and I very much appreciate the support and the agreement that we have on what to do in Bangladesh.
Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to speak in this debate on European Union cooperation with Bangladesh, a country I know well, a country I was proud to visit with the European Parliament's delegation in the autumn of 1998.
There are, of course, a great number of people with Bengali roots settled in London and other parts of the European Union, people originally from Dhaka, Sylhet and other parts of Bangladesh.
I know from them and from my visit that Bangladesh is a country of proud, hard-working people and a country with great prospects, but one which does need assistance from the more wealthy and developed parts of the world like the European Union.
This report helps provide that support and should be commended, and accordingly I pay warm tribute to the rapporteur and my other colleague.
But the rapporteur said something which struck me, as did Mrs Maes.
The rapporteur said that state structures in Bangladesh work badly and Mrs Maes derided some of the advances that Bangladesh has made in recent years.
Yet in many ways I think that Bangladesh is amazing for the way that it does work.
It does work despite its turbulent and violent history, despite the political problems, despite its other difficulties and despite the poverty.
It does function and, as the Commissioner has just said, that is amazing considering all the difficulties.
I believe that this is fundamentally a credit to the people and indeed to the Government of Bangladesh.
Now on the positive side - and some of you from other countries may not be aware of this - Bangladesh has lately been admitted as a full test cricket playing nation.
Perhaps more significantly, reserves of natural gas have now been discovered in the Bay of Bengal.
The European Parliament has to help ensure that Bangladesh is not exploited by the big multinational companies, that it is able to use its reserves properly and to sell them at the most competitive price, which may not mean just to India or to Russia.
The cricket aspect may seem irrelevant but it does show a determination to succeed and Bangladesh will do well in this field of test cricket and this will be an inspiration to millions of people in that country.
The report makes it clear that if the European Union works in partnership with local people it can help on big issues. It can help with family planning, the key to stability for Bangladesh.
A poor or developing country cannot sustain a birth rate above two children per woman.
The idea that a large family is automatically the route out of poverty must be eradicated and women, all women, must be able to choose whether or not to have children.
European companies must also make certain that they do not exploit the cheap labour and do not continually perpetuate the working environment in factories, where the women suffer and work very long hours for very little money.
Furthermore the European Union has the expertise to help with other problems in Bangladesh - the flooding that we have heard about, that destroys great swathes of the land on a regular basis is not inevitable.
Europe has the know-how to prevent the deforestation.
We have the knowledge and experience, for example in the Netherlands, to help improve low-lying land and land susceptible to flooding.
We, as a European Union, already help Bangladesh with grants, with least-developed country status, and with the preferential access to markets that this brings with it.
But we can, I believe, and we must do more.
The future of Bangladesh also depends on its youth.
To my mind too many of the young people in Bangladesh leave to be educated abroad in Europe and the United States, which I commend, which is good; but then many of them do not go back to Bangladesh to take back their education, their experience and their great strength.
We must encourage them to do so.
I will end as I began, by saying that Bangladesh is a country with a future.
Just as the last part of the twentieth century belonged to the countries of south-east Asia, the Tiger economies, I believe that the first part of this century can belong to the countries of south Asia.
With help from this Parliament, Bangladesh can share in that sense of belonging, in the wealth, the prosperity and ultimately the success that will bring.
Mr President, like others in this Chamber, I am one of the fortunate group of people who has visited Bangladesh, not several times like the Commissioner but in such a way as to be able to form some modest impression, and it is against that background that I wish to emphasise how important it is for cooperation between the EU and Bangladesh to be continued and developed further.
There are a number of conditions present in Bangladesh that are not present in a number of other developing countries, in as much as Bangladesh - and this, I think, is very important - has only one language and one religion and consists of only one ethnic group, which means that the ethnic conflicts we see, for example, in Africa do not exist there. Nor do religious wars.
However, it also means that it would be still worse if we were to let down just such a country, precisely because Bangladesh does not have a number of the problems we see in other countries, and we should be failing the country if we were not to commit a good deal in terms of aid, including development aid. Bangladesh can only hold its own if we are willing to help the country, and that means both the EU, as the Commissioner mentioned, and also the Member States, among which I can call attention to my own country, Denmark, which is one of the largest providers of aid in the area.
There are three points I should like to emphasise in addition to the general need for aid and development.
There is the need for good governance and support for democracy.
Others have touched upon these, so I shall not comment further upon them.
There is the need to continue helping to promote women' s independence, for example by continuing and developing further our support for microcredits.
Women suffer a good deal of oppression in Bangladesh and, as a number of speakers have already pointed this out I shall not go into any more detail on this subject either. In this connection, I should like to say that women were precisely those who left me feeling most encouraged following my visit.
However, I should like to emphasise our need to make further progress now.
We cannot be satisfied with microcredits. We must move on to the next phase of development, whether it be concerned with textiles or something else.
I come, then, to my third point, which the Commissioner perhaps takes a rather different view of.
I believe that, in this context, we can perhaps make use of information and communications technology, precisely in order to support women too - since they are now a mainstay of society - and so as to give a boost to their cause and, all in all, to strengthen the country' s further development.
Mr President, we very much welcome the cooperation agreement which is an affirmation of the good relations between the European Union and Bangladesh and provides a framework for their further expansion.
Article 7 of the agreement deals with regional cooperation, and I would firstly like to touch on two points which relate to Bangladesh's regional situation and her relationship with neighbouring countries.
Although there is still some tension in border areas with India, there has been a great improvement in relations between the two countries. Evidence of this has been the signature of the water sharing Treaty with India.
Following this there has been an interim agreement for sharing the waters of the Tista river and Indian assistance in preparing the project report on the proposed Ganges barrage which will be located on Bangladeshi territory.
The two countries have also recently begun talks on fighting floods which have deluged both countries with tragic consequences.
This cooperation is good news and to be encouraged and supported.
I have to say I do not see the same positive approach on the part of the Burmese authorities.
In fact, in the last few days, there have been troop deployments by the Burmese in support of Burmese attempts to construct a dam on the Naf river close to the Bangladesh border, sixty miles south east of Cox's Bazar.
In the past, such actions have resulted in military action.
A particularly regrettable aspect of this activity is that anti-personnel landmines have reportedly been laid along the border by the Burmese.
Bangladesh is the only south Asian country to have signed the Ottawa Convention banning these weapons.
Deplorably, Myanmar is not a signatory to the Convention and there are indications that she has planted mines inside Bangladeshi territory including on agricultural land.
Myanmar should accede to the mine ban Treaty immediately and Bangladesh should take steps to ratify the Treaty.
I hope the Commission and Council will pursue these points in their dealings with both countries.
On a separate matter, the report describes the impact of population growth in Bangladesh on food security and economic development.
The population of 127 million is likely to grow to over 200 million by 2030.
This represents a huge push factor for emigration including to the European Union.
Bangladesh must facilitate the re-admission of nationals who are illegally in the territory of an EU Member State.
This is recognised in the declaration attached to the cooperation agreement.
It is important that the Government of Bangladesh should take early steps to enter into negotiations with those Member States that so wish and to conclude mutually acceptable re-admission agreements.
I trust the Commission will also attach importance to this.
Mr President, I would first like to say a few words about the intervention of jute organisations and Bangladesh's role as a host of the old organisation.
A year ago there were quite dramatic problems and I tried to see if it were possible to rejuvenate the old organisation.
There was no agreement between our Member States to do what we in the Commission would have liked to do, which explains the phase that we have been going through with this organisation.
The good news, however, is that the need has been accepted for a special effort, based in Bangladesh I hope, to promote the use and new uses of jute as a raw material, so perhaps it is now possible to continue with the substance of what the old jute organisation could do.
There was a meeting in Dhaka at the beginning of October and all the different parties agreed to create what is called an international jute study group.
The draft proposal for the constitution of this body will be discussed and hopefully finalised at the meeting of the International Jute Organisation to be held in Dhaka at the end of this month.
Subsequently it will be submitted to UNCTAD in Geneva and, once adopted, sent for signing and ratification to the governments concerned and the UN treaties section.
So we now have very high hopes that a new body that can promote renewed international cooperation in the jute sector will come out of the long painful discussion about the old jute organisation.
This is very good because the International Jute Organisation is the only international organisation of this kind that is actually based in a least-developed country.
This is what I can report on this matter that was brought up in our discussion here.
To Mrs Djubkaer I would say: yes, it is a strong asset for Bangladesh that it is a nation and we definitely should encourage the use of that potential.
The Chittagong Hill Tracts problem is a challenge to that picture of Bangladesh but fortunately, compared to the past, the tensions are lower and they still seem set on the right course.
As to the role of IT in Bangladesh, yes of course we will try to be useful and do something but I do not honestly see it as an easy shortcut, so we will stick to the basic priorities of our agreement with Bangladesh.
But we will use IT in all possible applications.
As to what you say about focusing specifically on women in this respect, I would say that Bangladesh may be one of the places where it would be possible to experiment with this.
So we should be open to these possibilities.
I agree very much with what Mr van Orden said about the regional aspects.
It seems that Bangladesh is the nice guy around and we certainly should recognise this as a fact and we should relate to Bangladesh in that perspective.
It has neighbours who are not all very easy and the whole region is more problematic than we may often think.
There are some eleven million Bangladeshi living illegally in India.
That is a large number in a European context, so from the point of view of stability, democratisation, orderly elections and so on, it really is facing quite some challenges.
Let me once again thank you for this very positive debate.
I look forward to working with Parliament on our relations with Bangladesh.
Things are moving so rapidly there that compared to the past we may be able in just a few years to expect and to detect real changes as a result of our cooperation there, and it is a great inspiration.
Finally, we look forward very much to welcoming Bangladesh as one of the leading participants in our conference in May in Brussels on LDCs, to be held with UNCTAD.
This will be a big opportunity for Bangladesh and the other least-developed countries to present themselves not as patients on a sick bed in hospital, with the rest of the world looking at them like curious doctors, but as partners in the global society, representing cultures and potentials which are important in keeping alive the diversity of globalisation.
So we are also looking forward to that partnership.
The first EC-Bangladesh Joint Committee meeting under the new cooperation agreement is now planned for the first half of March 2001, so the train is on the move.
I have received a motion for a resolution tabled pursuant to Article 42(5).
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
Use of depleted uranium in Bosnia and Kosovo (Balkan syndrome)
The next item is the Council and Commission declarations on the use of depleted uranium in Bosnia and Kosovo.
I shall give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Danielsson straightaway.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Commission, the information concerning health risks posed by depleted uranium to the population and to staff in peace-making missions in the Balkans, as well as its possible environmental consequences, has caused great concern in Europe.
It is a concern which must be taken with the greatest seriousness.
The issue ought to be investigated by organisations and institutions with competence within this area.
In November of last year, representatives of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited Kosovo.
UNEP has been working for some time on a report on the toxicological and radiological consequences of the use of depleted uranium in the Balkans.
We welcome this report, together with the report which the World Health Organisation (WHO) is at present in the process of compiling on the same subject.
The issue of possible health risks to those soldiers who take part in peace-making efforts in the Balkans is mainly a responsibility for NATO and participating States.
The EU countries which take part in these missions do so on the basis of national decisions.
In the interests of the greatest possible transparency on the issue, views are, however, being exchanged within relevant consultative bodies.
A discussion is to take place over lunch during the meeting with the General Affairs Council on 22 January.
This also reminds us of how important it is that the effects upon health and the environment of military crisis management initiatives should be discussed now that the EU is developing its crisis management capacity.
This is a natural part of a crisis management organisation' s activities, and work of this kind is being done both within NATO and the WEU, as well as within the UN.
The issue of the possible health risks and environmental consequences involved in the use of depleted uranium also draws attention to a very important issue: that of the general environmental problems in the Balkans.
The populations of Kosovo, Yugoslavia and other war-torn countries in the Balkans have been sorely tried, with tragic and long-term consequences.
It is in the interests of Europe as a whole to overcome these consequences in cooperation with the governments in the region, which are all democratic and peace-oriented.
Through the Commission' s aid programme, the EU is offering support to the countries of the region in their efforts to get to grips with their environmental problems.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to speak on a matter which I believe, as I am sure you will agree, rightly deserves to be dealt with as a matter of top priority by Parliament.
It is only right that we should be concerned for the health of our military personnel, of the citizens of the Balkans and of those working for Community institutions, non-governmental institutions, international organisations and Member State organisations operating in the area.
I therefore share the anxiety expressed regarding the health of all these people.
I should like to begin by expressing my solidarity with all those who are experiencing health problems, who are concerned about their families and who are suffering from illness.
The fact is that there are many such individuals and they are entitled to receive the best care available.
They have the right to be informed of the cause of their condition without delay, and we shall devote all our energy to doing so.
We are all under an obligation to do what is needed to ensure that the relevant information is available to those concerned.
I stand before you today as Secretary-General of the Council, but I am also here in my capacity as the High Representative for the Union' s Foreign and Security Policy.
In dealing with the matters which have given rise to concern in the House, I shall endeavour to do so from the Council' s point of view.
I should first like to reiterate my personal commitment and the commitment of all Members of Council to this region, namely the Balkans.
I am sure they will make every effort to help clarify the situation.
Our states are democracies, they have nothing to hide, and it is our intention to forward Parliament all the information available at any given time.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crucial issue we are confronted with is to establish clearly whether there is a link between the use of these weapons and the illnesses notified by the troops or by those who served in peace-keeping operations in the Balkans, or whether, on the contrary, the incidence of these illnesses is no different from that usually recorded amongst our troops.
This is the question we have to answer.
If we are to provide a clear answer to it, we must proceed in as rational a manner as possible. We should investigate: if this really were a syndrome in the etymological sense of the word, then all those affected would show similar symptoms.
In time, those symptoms would develop in a similar way, and the outcome would also be similar.
That is what is generally understood by the word syndrome. So these are the indications we must seek and we should deal with them in a fully open and transparent manner.
All of us involved in establishing the truth must base our conclusions on facts and not on mere assumptions.
Furthermore, if we are to assess the facts, we must have access to all the information available.
We must make a particular point of fostering openness and transparency amongst ourselves.
Once we are aware of the facts, we should study them in such a way that all the results we make public generate calm and inspire confidence.
Our work is indeed inspired by this spirit.
Such openness and transparency must be common to all: they must permeate all the Member States of the European Union, relationships between the Member States of the Union and NATO, and those between NATO and other allies involved in peace-keeping operations in the Balkans.
Obviously they must also characterise relationships between governments in the region.
Accordingly, the European Union' s Political and Security Committee dealt with this matter on 9 January.
Member States shared their concerns and information on the measures each had taken, as the current presidency stated.
There was broad agreement that NATO, as the institution that had assumed responsibility for handling the Balkan crisis, should be charged with assembling information from all those involved regarding the use of depleted uranium, the location of military contingents, and all medical data.
As you are aware, ladies and gentlemen, at that meeting the Commission also explained the measures it intended to take. I am sure that the Commission will today be able to supply information on the measures it has taken, either through Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m or through her representative.
As regards NATO, I have to tell you that as soon as the matter became public, I personally contacted the Secretary-General. We have remained in constant contact ever since.
The Secretary-General, his assistants and the Council' s assistants have ensured that we have all kept each other as well-informed and up to date with developments as possible.
Allow me to recall briefly the measures taken by NATO at its meeting on 10 January: first, it convened a meeting of national military medical experts to allow them to make contact with each other and exchange the whole gamut of ideas, background information, objectives, etc. A working group was set up immediately to serve as a forum for exchanging information.
I think it is important to highlight that membership of this group was open to all countries who had played some part in peace-keeping operations in the Balkans, not just to NATO members.
It was also agreed to consult more closely with the countries in the region.
Hence the matter was raised with the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, Mr Goran Svilanovic, on 10 January. He was assured that all of us, especially NATO, would forward all available information.
In addition, it was agreed to make all information concerning this incident available to the United Nations Environment Programme.
Furthermore, as you are aware, NATO members reiterated their view that at that time there was no evidence to suggest that the use of the weapons in question constituted a significant risk for the armed forces of the countries involved, or for the civilian population of the Balkans.
NATO has also made it quite clear that it is by nature a military organisation, not a medical one.
It is therefore required to submit all the necessary information to the European Union. It fully intends to do so, to enable better qualified organisations, notably the World Health Organisation, the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Atomic Energy Agency to draw the appropriate conclusions.
As you know ladies and gentlemen, NATO' s Medical Committee held its first meeting on Monday 15 January, and the newly established group for the exchange of information met for the first time yesterday.
You are aware of the outcome of that initial discussion, it has been published and placed on the NATO web site, together with the scientific data exchanged at yesterday' s meeting.
I think it is worth emphasising once again that, at NATO' s suggestion, membership of the group dealing with the exchange of information will be open to all fifteen Member States of the European Union, and that maximum transparency is fully guaranteed.
As the presidency has correctly stated, the next step will be to review the body of scientific material as it becomes available. Together with Mr Persson, Prime Minister and President of Council, Union Foreign Ministers will also deal with the matter at the first meeting of the General Affairs Council on 22 January.
I am convinced that this is a sensible way of proceeding at the moment, to ensure that we assemble all the information required and arrive at conclusions soundly based on facts.
As you may imagine, I have remained in contact with the governments of all Member States, and I must say to you, quite sincerely, that if a report pointing to a possible link does emerge, I will personally see that it is forwarded to the House. I promise you that.
I should, however, state that to date, the Council has not received a single scientific report establishing a link between these illnesses and the use of depleted uranium weapons.
Let me stress once more, ladies and gentlemen, that if such a report does emerge you will be made aware of it immediately.
I should mention that since I was called to appear before the House, that is, in the last few days and hours, some countries have submitted scientific reports.
I refer for example to the reports submitted by the Committee of the Belgian Federal Nuclear Monitoring Agency.
I believe this is a document well worth reading. In connection with the monitoring of radioactivity levels, I ought to say that Portugal and Spain have already submitted what are to all intents and purposes their final measurements.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what the European Union is doing, wants to go on doing and will continue to do, in that spirit of transparency and good cooperation the Presidency-in-Office mentioned earlier.
So much then, for information.
I do not however believe that it would be right, at a formal sitting like today' s, simply to pass on the sum total of information currently available without putting it in the actual context we find ourselves in.
As I stand before this House, which represents the people of Europe, I am bound to say that we need to remember our starting point and the fundamental cause underlying today' s debate.
We must not shy away from it.
The fundamental cause underlying this debate is that there was a problem involving failure to respect human rights in Bosnia, which this very House condemned time and again.
Madam President, I cannot forget how, when serving as Foreign Minister for my country in 1994, I used to study the findings and conclusions arrived at in this House very carefully. Through them, Foreign Ministers of Union countries were being urged to take action and not to allow such violent disregard for human rights in Bosnia Herzegovina to prevail.
(Applause and protests)
I have an even clearer recollection of when I stood before you in this very House in 1995, as President of the Council of Ministers of the European Union, and you pleaded passionately with me, calling for action to prevent a disaster.
We did take action, spurred on of course by the good intentions of all democratic countries who wish to defend the rights being violated in others.
That is what we tried to do.
And I should like to remind you...
(Protests and applause) with all due respect and in a spirit of fellowship, that the House later adopted important resolutions on the situation in Kosovo.
We must not forget our starting point.
I believe we have to find time in this global debate not only for the causes which are the subject of current research, research we are determined to carry through to the end because we represent democratic societies, but also for the underlying cause of the whole problem. That is none other than the serious violation of human rights in the Balkans, part of Europe, our own continent.
We tried to put an end to it as best we could with the means available to the countries of the European Union and to NATO members.
As I conclude, I would like to take you back to the last emotive moment we shared together.
You will recall that on 5 October, in this very House, seated in this very seat, I was privileged to share a highly emotive moment with you all: the time when the Parliament in Belgrade began to fall to the democrats.
Let us not forget what we have achieved.
Let us not forget the positive developments leading up to the Zagreb summit. That was the first time that the fifteen governments of the European Union met with all the governments of the Balkan countries, and that every one of them had been democratically elected.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say with some feeling that in recent years I have, as you can imagine, been intensely involved in trying to build a more democratic Europe, a Europe in which human rights are respected. I shall do everything in my power to ensure respect for the qualities I mentioned earlier: the scientific approach, the spirit of transparency, community spirit, since that is what we are.
I shall also do my best to ensure that the facts we have available at any given time are forwarded to the House.
As I have said in all sincerity, no link has so far emerged between the facts and the consequences.
That is what the scientific committees are saying.
I also want to state, however, that we cannot and must not be satisfied with this. Let me reiterate that the Council and I are fully committed to pursuing the investigation of this matter through to the end.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have absolutely no doubt that we shall all be true to those guiding principles I referred to: responsibility, transparency and honesty.
Thank you for your attention.
(Applause and protests)
Before giving the floor to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, to speak on behalf of the Commission, I have received a request for a procedural motion from Mr Alavanos.
In view of the fact that we cannot possible reorganise our debate on the basis of procedural motions, I would ask you to please tell me immediately, Mr Alavanos, in accordance with the terms of the Rules of Procedure, to which Rule your procedural motion refers.
(The President gave Mr Alavanos the floor after he had clarified that his point related to Rule 37)
Madam President, under Rule 37 of our Rules of Procedure, the Council and the Commission may ask to make a statement to the European Parliament; however it is up to the President of the European Parliament, it is specifically up to you to organise the debate.
In this sense, and because the debate is public and European public opinion is horrified by what it has heard, I think that we all have an obligation, if we are to avoid being accused of complicity, to ask the High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union who, until recently was the Secretary-General of ÃÃÃÃ and who is under investigation by the International Tribunal in the Hague for crimes against humanity, according to a statement by the public prosecutor in the Republica and other newspapers, to explain why, as Secretary-General of ÃÃÃÃ, he gave the go-ahead for a mini nuclear war in the Balkans.
Especially as Mr Solana has thrown part of the blame on to the European Parliament.
You must give a reply here.
He has said that we, too, are partly responsible for the mini nuclear war because we called for action in the Balkans.
I would remind you that we agreed on the organisation of this debate at the Conference of Presidents last week.
I shall give the floor straight away to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, to speak on behalf of the Commission.
Madam President, before I turn to the specific question of depleted uranium, let me first put the issue in context by saying a word about the environmental situation in the Balkans and what the European Commission has been doing to tackle it.
Nearly a decade of regional conflicts, combined with weak institutions, old-fashioned polluting industry and a legacy of years of unchecked pollution, have left the environment of the Balkan region in a state of serious neglect.
In June 1999, a report conducted for the Commission by the Regional Environment Centre in Budapest gave a preliminary assessment of the environmental effects of the conflict in the Balkan region.
In October 1999, the United Nations Balkans Task Force then provided its assessment of the environmental damage arising as a result of the Kosovo conflict.
In our efforts to tackle the health and environmental situation in the Balkans, the Commission has established a twin-track approach.
This combines action on the one hand to address immediate problems with longer term assistance.
Our longer-term assistance is designed to embed a process of sustainable environmental protection in the countries in the region, all of which are potential candidate members of the Union.
Let me set out briefly what we have been doing.
In the framework of the Stability Pact, the Commission has been the driving force in the development of the Regional Environmental Reconstruction Programme.
This provides a framework in which environmental actions can be pursued at regional level in the Balkans.
By bringing together the various bilateral donors and the countries in the region, we are providing a focus for the coordination of otherwise disparate and overlapping bilateral actions.
To help launch the Regional Environmental Reconstruction Programme the Commission is currently funding actions to the value of EUR 5m.
Other donors have committed a further EUR 2.5m, and others still have expressed their intention to commit around another EUR 5.8m, bringing a total of around EUR 13.3m.
Through these actions we have targeted institution building, participation in the activities of the European Environment Agency in the region and two environmental hotspots in Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Our contribution reflects the balance between setting the basis for long-term environmental protection and urgent remedial action.
Let me now come to the specific issue of depleted uranium and the public concern about the possible health risks associated with the use of depleted uranium weapons in Kosovo and Bosnia for the local populations, as well as the international personnel serving, or who have served, in the region.
The Commission is naturally also concerned to ensure that the interests of its own staff and contractors placed in the region are properly assessed.
Let me stress again that this is an issue which has aroused considerable public anxiety and that anxiety must be addressed.
But it can only be addressed on the basis of facts and the provision of all the information on this issue.
Our watchword must be "openness".
That is why it is essential to proceed rationally and on the basis of scientific evidence.
What then are the facts?
Uranium itself, as you know, is a radioactive and toxic element that occurs in several minerals.
Depleted uranium is less radioactive than natural uranium.
It is readily available as a by-product of the nuclear fuel cycle and it is very hard and self-sharpening.
As such, it is used to make tips to shells to increase their penetrating capacity.
However, there is currently no unanimously held scientific opinion on the health and environmental effects of depleted uranium.
At the time that the UN Balkans Task Force provided its original assessment of the environmental damage arising as a result of the Kosovo conflict, it had not received any official document confirming whether or not depleted uranium had been used during the conflict.
When that confirmation was given, UNEP carried out a mission to collect, for example, soil, water and vegetation samples in autumn last year.
We expect that the results of their examinations will be known in March this year.
For our part, the Commission has acted swiftly in the face of recent concerns to ensure that any Commission action on depleted uranium is based on sound scientific knowledge.
We have used existing structures to convene a meeting of an independent group of experts under the Euratom Treaty to give an opinion on the possible health consequences in general of exposure to depleted uranium.
In their opinion the experts will be expected to draw upon all available scientific evidence.
We expect to have the scientific opinion of the independent experts within a month from now.
In the light of the opinion the Commission will review whether or not follow-up actions are indicated, for our own staff for example.
We will also decide whether it is appropriate to adapt existing assistance programmes within the longer term with the aim of ensuring the sustainable development of the region.
The Commission will, of course, invite Member States and international authorities to share information on their findings and approaches and to discuss any proposed follow-up actions resulting from the opinion provided by the independent scientific experts.
The twin-track approach I have set out underlines the value added of the Community contribution to addressing the health and environmental situation in the Balkan region.
The Commission confirms its commitment to strengthening our medium and long-term support to improve the environmental and human health situation in the Balkan region.
Madam President, the population is concerned, because there are indications of a link between this depleted uranium in munitions and effects on people's health and on the environment.
At the same time, however, we are aware that there is no proof yet of the existence of such a link.
Not a single scientific study, not one of the studies that have been conducted in Spain, Italy or other countries, has come up with evidence.
For this reason, following on from the remarks made here by the High Representative of the EU, Dr Solana, I should like to say that this discussion does not in any way amount to a rehabilitation of Slobodan Milosevic.
The missions undertaken in Bosnia and in Kosovo by the troops of NATO and of EU Member States were missions against a war criminal.
We owe an undiminished debt of gratitude to these people for having committed themselves in this way to the cause of human rights.
Those who bear political and military responsibility also deserve our appreciation.
Let me state that here categorically on behalf of my group.
We hear, however, that the deployed weapons set off chemical processes on impact, processes which result in the creation of uranium oxide, for example, and which may pose problems.
Over the past few days we have been hearing about examinations conducted by the Pentagon in January 2000 from which it emerged that this ammunition sometimes contains small amounts of plutonium too.
This entails risks, and the troops must be instructed to take particular care in areas where these munitions have been deployed.
In view of these considerations, it is indeed necessary to conduct tests for safety's sake.
These tests are not a sign of weakness but a sign of the credibility of democracies which investigate such matters and sweep nothing under the carpet.
We owe that to the military personnel and the staff of non-governmental organisations who were involved, as well as to the civilian population of the region.
We must establish whether there are actually effects on human health and the environment, so that we can either sound the all-clear or take such weapons out of circulation for all time.
At the same time, it is also essential, during the period in which these weapons and their effects are being studied, that existing alternative ammunition be used which is equally efficient without having any of the feared effects.
May I express my thanks to Dr Solana and the Commission for their willingness to keep the European Parliament informed, so that we can make our final assessment in due course on the basis of their information and thus guarantee the safety of our citizens and our troops as well as ensuring the credibility of any military operations we may have to undertake in future in defence of human rights.
Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the Commission, the Council and the High Representative for agreeing to take part in a debate on this subject and to reassure the High Representative that we are not going to reopen here a backdated debate on the motives behind the operations in the former Yugoslavia; it would not be right, apart from anything else because the context has changed radically.
Today we have a reasonable hope of including these countries in the European Union; yesterday we were in the thick of the nightmare of ethnic cleansing and atrocities encouraged by the nationalistic dictatorships of Izetbegovic, Karadzic and Milosevic.
It is appropriate for the European Parliament to be the forum for a responsible, transparent debate on the issue of the possible relationship between the use of depleted uranium shells and a substantial number of deaths and cases of ill health among the soldiers of different countries who have participated in operations, initially in Bosnia and more recently in Kosovo, and on the concern regarding the direct and indirect impact on the civilians involved.
There would be no cause for alarm if there were no more than the suspicion that the frequency of these cases exceeded the average for the same age categories, and it is precisely for this reason that we must establish the exact causes.
To this end, various initiatives have already been undertaken at national and international level.
We call upon NATO itself to support these initiatives, making use of the contribution of the US administration where necessary. In order to obtain all possible reassurance from the world of science, we call upon the Council and the Commission to take an active part in this coordination operation and exchange of information and we urge the Commission to set in motion its own autonomous scientific enquiry.
Lastly, the moratorium and the precautionary principle: this is not a question of asserting a principle, the precautionary principle, which was established in the context of food safety, and transferring it wholesale to foreign policy.
Rather, it is a matter of realising that the military problem has become a civilian problem and concerns the protection, for a long time after the operation itself, of the health and lives of civilians as well as soldiers.
Madam President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wants to see uncertainty replaced by certainty and confidence.
Young men and women must be able to report for peace-keeping and peace-making service in the confident assurance that everything is being done in the interests of their safety.
Every risk must be investigated, every soldier who is concerned must be able to obtain a thorough examination free of charge, and civilians who may have been exposed to danger must receive every attention and, if necessary, be examined, partly so that we can learn from experience.
It was, of course, out of regard for civilians that we intervened in Kosovo and Bosnia, and we did so on sound moral grounds.
The examinations must be thorough, they must be carried out by independent experts and there must be transparency about methods and possible factors of uncertainty.
If there are any reasons at all for concern, alternatives to depleted uranium must be invested in and, until certainty has been arrived at, its use may have to be suspended.
I should like to thank Mr Solana for promising that all information will be published.
We shall hold him to this, and he will also be held to account if the promise is not kept.
I should also like to thank Mr Solana for pointing out our common responsibility for the military and humanitarian action, which is the reason why we are sitting here.
It did in fact produce results and paved the way for democracy in the Balkans.
It was a moral duty to take that action, and we can be proud that we complied with that duty.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, High Representative, I am delighted that this debate is taking place at last.
We tried - unsuccessfully - to have this debate during the last parliamentary term in April 1999, when the NATO bombing was starting.
A few days after that, on 5 May to be exact, because we were convinced that this type of weapon was being used, I together with 11 fellow Members sent a letter to Mr Solana, the then NATO Secretary General, to request that a stop be put to the use of such weapons which were likely to cause health problems at a later date for the local population and the military forces involved, not to mention irreversible contamination of the environment.
We did not receive any answer at that time.
I think that is worth pointing out.
NATO drip-fed us with a series of information bulletins. In support of this, I would refer you to the comment made by the United Nations Environment Programme assessment group, at the end of 1999, that it did not have sufficient data to assess the state of depleted uranium contamination on the territory of Kosovo.
What Mr Solana has just told us, a few moments ago, namely that the action taken would be completely transparent, is novel and it is good news, but I feel rather doubtful regarding this commitment to transparency considering the attitude adopted by NATO over the last year.
I feel even more doubtful when I hear the statements of the current NATO representatives.
There are a number of points which I should like to clarify.
I think this is necessary.
When we are told that a link must be established between the state of health of the military forces and the presence, or absence, of depleted uranium, we have to be careful, as this is no simple matter, and there are several parameters which must be taken into consideration in order to explain the poor state of health of a number of members of the military: chemical pollution, a whole range of aspects of environmental damage, living conditions.
It is known, moreover, that the effects of radioactive contamination do not become apparent until after a relatively long period of time.
It would not, therefore, be proper to say at this stage, as some scientists have done, rather thoughtlessly in my opinion, that there is no connection.
It is too early to say.
Perhaps it is true for some military personnel, but I would be astonished if it were possible to generalise.
My second point is that depleted uranium is not a naturally occurring substance, as people would have us believe, or a less radioactive one.
It is approximately 20% less radioactive than natural uranium.
It is a by-product of nuclear processing and must accordingly be treated as waste.
I would point out that we have a European directive adopted in 1996, which should have been transposed by the Member States, stipulating that, where the radioactivity of such waste exceeds a concentration of 10,000 Becquerels per kilo, its radioactive contamination must be prevented from spreading.
In this instance we are talking about a concentration that is 4,000 time greater.
It is therefore quite absurd to use arms of this type to spread it in the environment, creating insoluble particles which collect in the respiratory and digestive system and then to claim that the existence of a problem remains to be proven.
Either there is a problem here, of necessity, or I have failed to understand this European directive.
Why should the conditions applicable to the people of Europe not be applicable to the people of Kosovo or Bosnia or to military personnel?
I should like to end with one last comment. Please excuse me for going on a little too long.
Mr Solana, I must tell you that the end does not justify the means.
(Applause).There is no one in this House that supported the Milosevic regime.
Yet it is not Mr Milosevic and his allies who are the victims of the radiation, who have ingested depleted uranium, but the local population, the military forces and the representatives of NGOs.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, High Representative, a month ago, in adopting the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Fifteen intended to set themselves out as a community of values.
The credibility of such an ambition is not won by texts alone, but by our real-life responses to significant events, by means of strong political actions underpinned by ethical principles, even though this action, quite possibly, costs a great deal to those taking it.
True merit is recognised when one' s back is against the wall.
The Balkan syndrome, ten years after the Gulf War, is one such significant event.
It brings the Fifteen face-to-face with their responsibilities in a spectacular fashion.
In my opinion and that of my group, accepting these responsibilities means taking bold decisions in at least three respects.
There is, firstly, the human aspect of the problem.
People have died, more are suffering, and still more are now living in anxiety and in fear of the future.
These people include military personnel and many civilians.
The barbarous thing about some types of weapons is that they continue to cause casualties, indiscriminately, after the war.
We are clearly faced with a situation of this type in the Balkans.
In the past, the international community has done itself credit by prohibiting anti-personnel mines on these grounds.
It should now, by the same token, ban weapons containing depleted uranium.
It is up to the European countries which manufacture them, including Great Britain, Portugal and, unfortunately, my own country, France, to agree to put an end to the manufacture, storage and, of course, the use, even experimentally, of such arms.
This would be doing no more than to comply with the principles of the 1980 Geneva Convention, which prohibits weapons with indiscriminate effects.
At the same time, all victims must be granted the right to health care, all potential victims must be granted the right to scanning, and all the regions concerned must be granted the right to decontamination and rehabilitation.
Is ducking one' s responsibilities by claiming today that the dangerous nature of these arms had not been identified at the time, even though a great many government inquiries and internal reports clearly demonstrated as much, really a serious and fitting attitude?
I sincerely feel that this is a rearguard action, out of step in terms of the information now available to our fellow citizens.
This brings me to my second point, the democratic challenge which this tragic case poses for us, for there is a long litany of culpable silence, counter-truths and lying by omission in which both NATO and some Member States have indulged as much as possible.
Having agreed in the past to act as a sort of intermediary between these parties, Mr Solana, you cannot now be surprised to find that we are asking you to give us some explanations regarding the serious matters which are gradually emerging.
There is, as you have said, an undeniable demand for truth regarding past matters and transparency regarding future matters, but, in all honesty, in this respect I do not think that either the Fifteen or NATO can possibly think they have paid their dues after what you have just told us, Mr Solana.
(Applause)In the end, we must take this difficult ordeal as an opportunity to reassess our concept of the organisation of European security and relations between the European Union and NATO.
In our opinion it is high time that we ceased to allow ourselves, both on the European continent and in the rest of the world, to be dragged into the tragic deadlocks of American strategic options.
I am thinking of the horrific effects of the Gulf War on the Iraqi people, particularly the children.
I am thinking of the systematic destruction of the economic potential and the ecological heritage not only of Yugoslavia but also of its neighbouring countries - take the Danube, for example - compounded, as we have just seen, by confirmation of the widespread use in this conflict of arms and munitions which, in addition to causing countless innocent casualties in the short term also represent a long-term threat for people coming into contact with the areas which have been bombed.
This, Mr Solana, has nothing to do with defending human rights.
No, as far as Europe is concerned, the end must not justify the means.
I am convinced that, one way or another, these are questions which many people now have in mind.
Today is one stage in the process, and it will be followed by other stages.
I hope that increasing numbers of us will align ourselves with this move for change.
(Applause)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Solana, there are few occasions on which it can have been so important that the truth of the matter, the whole truth, emerges in a parliamentary debate as this one.
The vast majority of countries that comprise the European Union, whether they are members of NATO or not, participated in various military and police operations in the Balkans, through their armed forces and security forces.
They did so because they felt that this was the most appropriate way to protect civilian populations and their fundamental rights and to contribute to peace and to the country' s reconstruction and democratic rehabilitation.
The situation is that in some of these countries, including my own country, Portugal, several worrying cases have arisen.
In Portugal, these cases are of leukaemia and other pathologies associated with radiation in soldiers who served either in Bosnia or Kosovo, one of which has already proved fatal.
These cases have raised and continue to raise, in medical, scientific, military and political circles and consequently in the mind of the public of these countries, justified concern at the possible relationship - which, I emphasise, has not been proved - between exposure to depleted uranium contained in used missiles and the outbreak of the diseases I have just mentioned.
It is therefore crucial to ascertain the truth of this relationship, first of all because important human values that require respect and serenity in the face of the legitimate concerns of the soldiers and their families are under threat.
Secondly, because scientific information is as yet incomplete and we need to establish beyond a doubt whether there is a cause and effect relationship between the use of weapons containing depleted uranium and the health problems that we have been seeing.
Also, because it is unacceptable that there should still be controversy over the degree of information that NATO claims to have given the governments and military authorities of the countries participating in missions in good time and the conditions under which their armed forces and the security forces took part in military and police operations.
Lastly, because it would be incomprehensible and even paradoxical for our countries to have participated in missions for peace and to promote human rights in the Balkan region and to possibly left there an unsolved public health and environmental problem that affects precisely the populations that they seeking to protect.
This is a matter which, in any event, must be taken seriously and to its conclusion, regardless of the consequences.
Mr Solana, I thank you for your first speech, not least because of the spirit of openness that you demonstrated.
You were Secretary-General of NATO at the time of the military operations under question and you are now responsible for the implementation of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy.
You are therefore in a position, if you like, to make an enormous contribution to the European Parliament's ability to find, together with the governments of the Member States, NATO and other international organisations, the best solutions to this case at scientific, political or even military levels.
That is what we hope for from the Council and from you.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1950, when I was 20 years old, a campaign exploded throughout the entire world: in Europe, in our universities, in schools - they attempted without success as yet to penetrate the churches - and it was the campaign against Ridgway, the "Plague General".
It was the time of the war waged by the US, by the West, by the capitalists in Korea against the rights of the Koreans. The entire communist organisation, the entire hypocritical structure of you good old communists of the '50s, '60s and '70s, mobilised itself to inform us that Ridgway, the "Plague General", was on the 50th parallel - this was before the Atlantic Alliance in the Far East - and was using chemical and bacteriological weapons to defend the unjust, capitalist society oppressing the Third World and his own people.
Communist campaigns, socialist campaigns - for then you had the Stalin Peace Awards at various crucial moments, between 1950 and 1953 - a few trembling papists here and there, would you mind conceding us a moment of respite from your retrospective moralising, from your constant quest to apportion blame?
You conceded very little.
Of course the Dresden bombings in the Great War may not have been necessary and may have been criminal, but the truth is that you do not gloss over this: you communists will not leave us alone with your pacifist line-up.
Well then, a European Parliament which is now faced with a motion calling for such respite is cowardly, reckless, antidemocratic and irresponsible: antidemocratic in any case because it is disregarding the commitments called for by parliaments and governments in times of need.
We cannot wait to find out the scientific truth about these weapons, but if they had been used to prevent Vukovar being raised to the ground as it was, we would have spared the lives of tens, hundreds of thousands of Bosnians, Kosovars, Serbs and others in Croatia.
I therefore thank you, Madam President, and I await the revelation of the truth which must be ascertained in the face of our tendency to distort and abuse it ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, we need to establish the facts in this case.
We have received certain assurances from Mr Solana but we know, and our Italian colleagues in particular will remind us of this, that it will be difficult for those whose sons have died of leukaemia to accept that assurance unreservedly.
These days we cannot easily accept death when better health and prosperity seem to have brought us so near to immortality.
We now need to reinforce Mr Solana's assurance with repeated testing offered as widely as possible and with the maximum openness from the American authorities.
I have been asked, particularly by my colleague Lord Inglewood, who represents the area of Cumbria where test-firing of these weapons has taken place, to insist that the question as to the possible effect upon the civilian population should be taken into account when this testing is carried out.
If he is going to reply to this debate, Mr Solana might like to address that point.
There were a large number of British soldiers in the Balkan War and, of course in the Gulf, and as a British Conservative I will say this: Of course, we are concerned about the possible impact of the use of depleted uranium, but against the background of Mr Solana's statement, we do not believe that NATO should adopt a moratorium on the use of such weapons.
We have to fight terrible wars against terrible people.
Such a moratorium could place our forces at a potential disadvantage and thereby potentially endanger more lives than the NATO forces.
As Mrs WallstrÃ¶m has said: The real and immediate danger in the Balkans comes from general environmental degradation following years of neglect, corruption and war.
This is what the European Union needs to address while we monitor very carefully the results of medical testing.
In conclusion let me say that Mr Wurtz's contribution was very revealing of the constant agenda of the left which aims to separate the European Union from the United States and would result in depriving Europe of any real influence in the world.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a quite remarkable as well as a cynical debate that we are holding here.
I am almost inclined to resist any involvement in a discussion about which type of lethal ammunition is the better.
And yet that is what we are doing today.
I have never taken any part in debates about which wars are expedient and which are unavoidable either.
That is not our subject today.
We have a different subject to discuss.
In the past, we have repeatedly said that, if it is necessary to use armed force - and we have always agreed on this - we must ensure that our intervention has no more impact than is absolutely essential and that it does the least possible damage to the environment and to the health of those who survive it.
This, of course, is why we have constantly condemned and denounced chemical weapons, for example, and have always agreed that these weapons must never be used, because the havoc they wreak on the environment and on human health is out of all proportion to their military effectiveness.
If we are discussing today whether munitions containing uranium do or do not cause leukaemia, then I have no desire to hear anyone tell us, not even Dr Solana, whom I greatly respect, whether or not there is definitive proof.
We are not talking about definitive proof, and when we spoke in this House about our own health and about BSE, we certainly all agreed that the precautionary principle had to be applied, even though we were never able to prove that infected substances are the cause of new-variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease.
We recently discussed the precautionary principle and put it to the vote, and we said that we must ban particular substances or procedures if there are justifiable concerns about them, even if there is no definitive proof.
We know today that there are numerous cases of leukaemia.
And as long as the scientists are still arguing, as long as all of us do not know which of the scientists is correct, we must agree that this ammunition cannot be used until every last aspect of the issue has been resolved.
Surely nothing less than a moratorium on this ammunition would be an acceptable decision for us to take today.
But in addition to this we must also care for the people who live in the regions, for their health and the health of their children.
(Applause)
Mr President, I saw a short film on German television this morning which was produced on behalf of the American army before the Gulf War.
It literally said that dust which is released through the combustion of depleted uranium constitutes a danger if it ends up inside the body.
So the risks involved were known prior to the Gulf War.
Were the allies aware of this before the Balkan War and before the intervention, which, I hasten to add, I do not dispute?
Did the governments and the military know?
If so, why were soldiers not given warnings in a similar way?
Why are you now saying today that the alliance did not have any proof of risk?
People became ill having been to the Balkans, just as they did after the Gulf War.
Nobody knows how many more will fall ill in those regions.
Who will provide them with a convincing answer tomorrow?
The ban on the use of depleted uranium will be the only measure which can restore confidence.
Mr President, the evidence coming from Bosnia in particular points clearly to a massive increase in cases of cancer where bombings took place during the Balkans war and where ammunition rounds of depleted uranium were used.
It is now believed that the depleted uranium rounds were used by the bombers which carried out attacks on the suburbs of Sarajevo and elsewhere during the Balkans war.
The people of the Balkans are entitled to full and unequivocal answers with regard to the carcenogenic effects of the depleted uranium shells which were used during the war.
This Parliament and the European Union should, and must, be most vigorous in pursuing full answers to these most important public health and human rights issues.
On a separate but related matter, I was quite disturbed to read that depleted uranium shells have been fired into the Irish Sea by British Ministry of Defence forces at the Solway Firth between England and Scotland and also at a range on the Cumbrian coast, just seven miles from a British nuclear plant.
This depleted uranium has been used in Cumbria up to 1995, and it is believed that as many as 1400 depleted uranium shells have been fired into the Solway Firth, which is an inlet of the Irish Sea.
As a Member of the European Parliament, representing Leinster, which is along the Irish Sea, I am deeply concerned at these revelations.
I am calling on the British government to make a full statement on the matter.
I want to know whether there are any possible public health consequences from the use of depleted uranium shells in the location to which I have referred to today.
It is up to the British government to make a statement on these matters.
Mr President, the scandal of the depleted uranium missiles is just the latest chapter in the despicable war you have waged against Serbia.
Mr Solana, you are discussing transparency now that the scandal has emerged but you are two years too late.
Do you take us for fools?
Do you really think the United States will let you get away with this even though it has taken forty years to see the films, the documentation and the victims of the human experiments they carried out on their own forces on the ships irradiated following the Bikini nuclear tests?
All we know, at any event, is that you have paid little heed to the precautionary principle that people keep harping on about here.
All we know, as Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m has just said, is that the smiling face of your spokesman, Mr Shed, concealed the use of these shells.
All we know is that the incidence of leukaemia among our soldiers is abnormally high.
If a causal link were to be established, then you would be responsible for a war crime, as the statements made referred only to military personnel, as if the uranium were capable of differentiating between military and civilian personnel.
Quite frankly, ladies and gentlemen, if you want the truth, then look for it yourselves, and do not expect Mr Solana, the European High Representative, to condemn Mr Solana, the former Secretary General of NATO.
Mr President, today we are tackling an extremely important subject which requires great reflection over extremely long periods of time, and, moreover, we are doing so on the basis of a wave of emotion which, seeing as we are not specialists, is ill-suited to the politics we are obliged to carry out here.
With regard to the precautionary principle, to which previous speakers have referred, I am somewhat concerned because, although we are tackling the issue of BSE, I do not imagine anyone would ever contemplate saying that we should not eat any type of meat, even in the absence of well-founded scientific results.
As the Commissioner, with whom I am in complete agreement, said just now, we must first examine what the environmental situation in the region was, but we must also ascertain, with great care of course, the relationship of cause and effect between the equipment used - the weapons - and the impact on health.
I must, moreover, point out that depleted uranium is used in civil contexts in many other sectors, and we should certainly investigate these extremely thoroughly.
We must also bear in mind the risk of inciting panic, where strong positions are adopted, among those who send staff to the region and those who are sent there by the Member States.
It is my view that we should analyse this issue extremely carefully and confirm that we certainly all have good cause to be grateful to NATO for its past and future interventions.
We do not support the call for a moratorium.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are holding this debate today because of the concern we have for people.
Some of these people are the military personnel, our troops, who are there, but we are also concerned about the civilian population, the millions who live in Yugoslavia and in Kosovo.
We do not seek to establish here and now whether the war in Kosovo was justified or not.
It would be inappropriate to engage in such a debate.
What we must do - and I entirely agree here with the High Representative of the CFSP - is to examine with the utmost care and precision whether a link exists between the incidences of illness and the quantities of ammunition with depleted uranium which were fired during the war in Yugoslavia and Kosovo and in Bosnia too.
If we intend to do that, we must pledge ourselves to certain important principles, so that we at least, as elected representatives of the peoples of Europe, can restore the credibility which NATO has forfeited through this and similar episodes.
Foremost priority attaches to precise and independent tests by international experts with the aid of every possible scientific method.
Secondly, we need a radical change in our information policy, and in this respect I must thank the Council, and above all the High Representative of the CFSP, for their undertaking to make all information available to Parliament.
Thirdly, and finally, we must demand an immediate moratorium on all arms and ammunition of this type until we have the complete results of the tests we have commissioned, so that we can then take our decisions in a responsible manner.
Mr President, to become embroiled in a scientific debate, in which many see a link - and some do not - between the use of depleted uranium and an increase in the number of fatalities, is every politician' s nightmare.
There is the risk that in this way, the political debate tips over into a scientific one.
I believe we should uphold the task of the politician, which is twofold, in my opinion.
First of all, the European Union' s responsibility is towards the local population.
It is up to the Member States to assume responsibility for their soldiers.
In my view, it should be the EU' s responsibility to look after the local population out there.
The second responsibility we have is not to be tricked into focusing all statements on the use of depleted uranium.
There might well be other causes for the increased number of fatalities.
I therefore believe that a comprehensive enquiry should be instituted into all the abnormalities which occur locally and in the national armies.
Finally, something which irritates me no end is that Mr Solana, as well as a number of fellow MEPs, establish a false link between the end and means to used to reach the end, or the link between the war and the means deployed.
I was in favour of intervening in the war, but I am against taking irresponsible risks.
Mr President, the toxic nature of the DU shells, and the implications thereof for the military and civilian personnel that have been in contact with the effects of these in Iraq, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, is a matter that we must approach carefully and cautiously.
We must be cautious, as has been said, for, despite the research undertaken, it has not been possible to establish any clear correlation between the use of these arms and the cases of leukaemia that came to light following these military operations, but also, you should be aware, during the long process of developing and testing these weapons.
The veil of uncertainty must, of course, be lifted.
We can therefore only welcome the establishment of inquiry bodies at every level within our States, the Alliance and the European Union.
However, the commotion caused by the revelations of recent weeks must not push us down the path of what I would call "precautionary excess" at the very time, Mrs Roth-Berendt, when the European Union is devoting itself to defining the precise limits of the precautionary principle in order to prevent it being applied incorrectly.
Today, the DU shells stored in our various countries are the arms best capable of penetrating tanks, since technical developments in armour plating have made the use of hollow charges and tungsten shell ineffective.
You should be aware that the development of new arms will take many years.
During this period can we sacrifice our defence on the altar of unfounded fears?
I do not think so.
That is why I shall oppose the request for a moratorium which has been included in point 6 of the compromise resolution when it is put to the vote before this House.
I would concede that the present debate does have one merit: the fact that it demonstrates, if there were any need, that we must not dream of a clean war, something I have always considered as not merely an illusion but an outright perversion.
War is always dirty because its objective is to attack human life.
It can only be considered as a lesser evil when every other means of resolving or preventing attacks on human dignity and freedom have failed, and yes, Mr Solana, that was the case in both Iraq and Kosovo.
Mr President, we have a responsibility towards two parties: on the one hand, the young people who took part - commendably - in the military operations in Bosnia and Kosovo and, of course, their families, and, on the other, the beneficiaries of those peace-keeping missions, the Balkan peoples.
It is true, the direct or indirect relationship between the use of depleted uranium shells and the cases of leukaemia, which are multiplying, has not yet been proved indisputably, although the link appears more than likely, but these cases exist and are so numerous as to justify the greatest concern.
It is therefore right to pursue, with a coordinated approach, all the scientific investigations necessary to clarify the impact of this type of arm on health and the environment, but, in the meantime, it is also right to apply the precautionary principle, which has never been so appropriate as on this occasion, and that is why it is urgent and vital to impose a moratorium.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, daily, and indeed almost hourly, we receive new information about potential dangers.
That is why it is very gratifying that Parliament is dealing with this issue today.
I thank the High Representative for promising us complete information and transparency.
For us too, it is a new experience to be discussing matters of security and defence policy in this way.
It will certainly benefit European security and defence policy to be discussed outside the constellation that prevails in the Member States, where governments and oppositions are constantly trying to score political points on these issues.
In Germany, for example, the Red-Green coalition Government under their Minister of Defence has been trivialising all these risks, which is something that has certainly not been happening here in Parliament.
We in the European Parliament have an opportunity to receive factual briefings and information, and that is a very good thing.
What is damaging - and it has been a feature of this debate too - are belated recriminations about the Gulf War and the war in Kosovo.
Mr Wurtz, if you cite the Charter of Fundamental Rights and our high European principles in this context, I must remind you that, at the time when fundamental European principles were at stake, when ethnic cleansing, expulsions and terror were the order of the day in the Balkans, your political grouping stood helplessly on the sidelines.
This also has to be said in such a debate.
We are calling for relevant information to be collected, for the information available in the Member States to be coordinated at the European level with UN data through the specialised agencies of the United Nations and submitted to Parliament again.
An armed conflict must always be governed by the precept that no more force may be used than is necessary to achieve the military objective.
For this reason we need information and research on weapons systems which are less harmful than the one we have been discussing today.
This is where the European Parliament can exercise its responsibility in the framework of European security and defence policy by making its own constructive contributions.
Mr President, High-Representative, the mandate which you had for action in Yugoslavia was not a mandate to use weapons which the conscience of humanity rejects and condemns and the potential toxicity of which, as measured now, was known to military leaders at the time.
If now that disclosures have begun and more will follow, you feel alarmed by this fact, to seek accomplices in this Parliament that is, I am sorry to say, evidence of cowardice and bad taste.
Mr President, we are worried about the effects of these bombings in the Balkans, we are worried about the soldiers who took part and we are worried about the inhabitants of the areas which became battlefields. We call for a broad environmental inquiry into any deterioration in the environment throughout the Balkans.
Our concern has reached proportions which you cannot begin to imagine here in the House, at least among public opinion in my country.
The joint motion for a resolution also calls for a moratorium...
(The President cut the speaker off) (Applause)
Mr President, just three points, because a great deal has already been said.
First: I should like to say to Mr Solana that when, in 1999, we and some of our fellow members tried to find out if depleted uranium was being used in Kosovo, there was a cover-up and Mrs WallstrÃ¶m - I have the Minutes here - said in reply to a question that there was still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict.
That is what it says in the verbatim report.
Secondly: depleted uranium is a dangerous and harmful substance, especially when used in shells because on impact it vaporises, produces uranium oxide and turns into a cloud which can be inhaled and the uranium oxide is readily soluble and can get into the water and food chain.
Consequently - and you must know that there is no harmful cause which does not actually cause harm, even in small doses - an ongoing epidemiological study is needed both in the Gulf and in Bosnia and, of course, in Kosovo, although any results there, if they do appear, will not do so until a later date.
Thirdly: if we accept, and you Mr Solana accept, that this research is needed, in short, to uncover the truth, should the precautionary principle not apply?
If someone says to me, or to anyone for that matter, look, we need to carry out a survey because your house may collapse, am I going to stay indoors while the survey is carried out or am I going to get out and wait for the results?
It stands to reason and I do not accept that depleted uranium is the only weapon at NATO's disposal; it has a host of other efficient weapons in its arsenal.
Mr President, we here have now been assured from various quarters that information will be given and matters discussed openly.
Until now that openness has been missing.
Naturally we must have the right information to support our action, but I have the same opinions as have been expressed here with regard to putting the precautionary principle into practice.
We have as our next point for discussion the issue of a rapid reaction force.
In this connection we clearly have to adopt a position on our approach to the matter of people' s health, although we might not see a direct connection, for instance, with leukaemia.
It is very possible that other harmful effects, for example in connection with drinking water, will be evident in the long term.
Can we really work on the basis that when we do good and solve conflicts, at the same time we will be causing the civilian population so much anxiety and insecurity in the future?
Mr President, I find it slightly bizarre to talk about the precautionary principle in relation to weapons, which are after all designed to be bad for your health.
The problem, of course, is that you only have to mention the word "uranium" and there is an outbreak of what can only be described as mass hysteria.
Of course, the illnesses and deaths must be investigated and I welcome the action taken by NATO member states to that end, but we have to make a judgment on the facts and the facts are very clear at the moment.
There is no link between depleted uranium and the illnesses.
If we look at the study of Gulf War veterans that was done in the United States and compare that with the study of the control group, there is no difference in the death rates, or illness rates, or the rates of cancer between the two groups.
We must ensure that we are working on the basis of scientific fact and that is why it is not appropriate to call for a moratorium at the moment, when there is no scientific link between the two.
There are a lot of other issues to do with the Balkan War which we should be investigating, like unexploded cluster bombs and the environmental damage which the Commission has outlined, but let us stick to the facts.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank all the Members who have spoken, since the way they have spoken and their frankness clearly demonstrate that we all share the same wish for clarification on this situation.
The chief concern we all must have is undoubtedly for the people who are currently ill and those who may become ill and suffer in the future.
I therefore once again promise to provide all the information I can.
What you cannot ask me to do is to provide information when I am unable to do so or when I have no information.
This is an issue which by its very nature lies within the remit of national governments and we are necessarily therefore dependent on the information provided by the individual governments.
As I said in my opening speech, I am in contact with the governments and organisations working on this issue and once again I can assure you that the Council and I personally will make available all the information we have with the maximum of transparency.
It would be rather difficult to provide you with information we do not have.
Secondly, I would like to say that, as some of you have pointed out, we must keep all the variables open in the scientific analyses.
We must not focus on certain parameters and forget others which may have effects which are equally damaging to health.
I am therefore delighted to have heard both the Commission and some of the Members who have spoken express a willingness to analyse all the aspects which may have an environmental impact.
I can tell you that I, too, am a scientist, a physicist, by training.
I am not going to regale you with all I learnt at the time, even if I could remember much of it, but I do think it important for us to adopt a rational attitude to this problem and to wait to collate all the available information before assessing the full implications.
Right now, nobody should have any doubt but that all the countries and all the international organisations are doing their utmost to find a solution to this problem, bringing together the most relevant information as quickly as possible.
A great many things have been said, all very interesting.
I have taken note of everything, but I do not want to go through each point individually since not many actual questions have been asked.
I would, however, like to respond to some of the statements that have been made in order to prevent any misunderstandings.
Let me, in all frankness and affection, confirm that I received the letter from the representatives of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and - as they themselves know, because I spoke to them - I conveyed the message and made the letter available to the Heads of Government and Ministers of the Union.
The letter was answered verbally and not in writing, but you are aware that the decision which the governments took was to continue along the route they had already undertaken in May, which was the time I actually received the letter.
So, please do not think that no one paid any attention to the letter I received.
The message was taken into consideration, but the governments still decided upon a course other than that proposed in the letter.
Letters from any of the members of political groups in this Parliament are always taken into consideration, and I would like you to be assured of that.
I have two observations which are almost personal observations.
Firstly, I make a very clear distinction between ends and means.
I would not like to be accused of confusing the ends with the means.
I am perfectly capable of distinguishing between ends and means and I know very well that ends are the important thing and that achieving the ends depends very much on the means employed.
Different means, and our assessment of them, change over time.
There are occasions when the information available suggests that particular means may be useful or may have ceased to be useful, and in considering these cases we have to take account of the information available at the precise time when decisions are taken.
I would therefore like to make it clear that that I am not confusing ends with means.
I have never done so and I would hope never to do so.
I would like to say something to those who accuse me of having asked this Parliament for its complicity.
In no way am I asking Parliament for its complicity, not now, not ever.
You represent the will of the people of the European Union and you are responsible for your own actions.
What I have, and what I believe I must share with you, are the moments when we have agreed years or months ago.
That does not mean I am using Parliament or making it complicit.
If I say it once or if I say it a thousand times, I fully accept my responsibilities, I always have and I always will, that is my intention, without the need to make anybody complicit.
What I need to do is to ask you to accept your own responsibility.
I am accepting mine and you must accept yours.
And we cannot deny that the resolutions adopted by this Parliament gave me food for thought.
Your resolutions were important to me when I chaired the Council of Ministers of the European Union and also to the Heads of State and Government of the European Union.
That is not making anybody complicit.
That is sharing responsibility like the responsible Europeans all of us are here.
We must be able to share and to accept our collective responsibility.
I have nothing else to say.
I would like to thank you and also to inform you that I shall be coming back here on 31 January for a debate on the Middle East, but I shall remain at your disposal during the plenary session to continue discussing this very important issue since it is one in which we have a lot at stake, namely our credibility and also our ability to continue to make progress in the area of European Union crisis management.
In this respect, ladies and gentlemen, please be assured that you can count on me, at least on my good will.
That you can count on my knowledge is not so certain.
Mr President, I also want to start by saying thank you to all the Members of the European Parliament for their statements, because they have underlined the need to take seriously the fears and anxieties in respect of all those who suffer from symptoms and illnesses as well as the need to gather all available information and to examine also the long-term health effects.
The Commission, I assure you, will do all in its power and competence to establish a sound scientific basis in relation to this issue and we will also, of course, cooperate fully with other national and international bodies working in this field: NATO, UNEP, IAEA and the World Health Organisation.
The Commission's efforts will be integrated into our wider programme of support in the Balkans with respect to health and the environment, because we must look at the accumulated effects.
We also welcome the opportunity to report back to the European Parliament on the progress of our efforts to establish a solid scientific basis on the effects of depleted uranium.
We would like to come back to report to you and of course we are always willing to answer any questions that you might have.
Mr President, I just want to take the opportunity of asking Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m and others to speak in their respective native languages here in the Chamber - in Mrs WallstrÃ¶m' s case, Swedish.
Thank you very much, Mrs Eriksson. The Charter of Fundamental Rights says that the European Union is a union of free countries, and everyone is free to speak in whatever language he or she chooses.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I have just been looking at the text of the joint motion for a resolution.
I should like to point out that the name indicated as signing for the Liberal Group, the Lord Bethell, is most welcome to join our Group.
I should like to place on the record how pleased we are to have a new member today who signs on our behalf.
Well, by the time of the vote we shall have established which groups Lord Bethell does and does not belong to.
I should like to inform the House that I have received seven motions for resolutions under Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure as well as one joint motion for a resolution sponsored by six groups.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Perhaps we could just settle that point of order now.
Lord Bethell is, and remains, firmly a member of the British Conservative Group.
Mr Van Orden, I cannot allow you to make statements on behalf of Lord Bethell unless you have written authorisation from him.
Mr President, since we are discussing the joint resolution on the Balkan syndrome, I would just like to point out that my own name and that of my group have been included erroneously on this joint resolution.
Mr Wurtz, I explicitly said a joint motion for a resolution sponsored by six groups, not seven.
I am thoroughly familiar with the sensitivities of your group on this point, which is why I specified it quite explicitly.
Rapid reaction facility
The next item is the report (A5-0392/2000) by Mr Newton Dunn, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation [COM(2000) 119 - C5-0272/2000 - 2000/0081(CNS)] on the creation of a Rapid Reaction Facility.
Mr President, this proposal is about money for an instant, non-military response by the Union to crises.
It is first pillar - for those who understand Union jargon - and is driven by the Commission.
It is not a military, rapid reaction force, which is, of course, second pillar, and driven by the Council of Ministers.
However, I have been invited, lobbied and asked how I am going to deploy the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy's soldiers, tanks and planes.
I have been asked whether we are going to use naval bases in Cyprus and to address a conference of Canadian soldiers.
I want to make it absolutely clear that this is nothing to do with the military rapid reaction force: this is a financial facility for the Commission to respond to crises very rapidly.
Although the Commission will deploy the money as fast as is necessary, Parliament retains control as one half of the budgetary authority.
We shall vote the money and we shall look forward to the reports from the Commission on how it has spent the money.
We expect the Commission to spend the money on responding to crises by buying medicines, hiring doctors or nurses, chartering aircraft to carry the medicines, nurses or policemen - whatever is required - to the crisis, wherever it is - not necessarily within Europe.
In the past the Union has been rightly criticised for being slow in responding to crises.
We have failed to send an immediate response when it was most obviously required, and this proposal is part of Commissioner Patten's praiseworthy efforts to improve the Union's aid programme, which is in a bit of a mess, to say the least.
I hope very much that Parliament will support it, and I will come back to that.
We would be very interested to know whether, when the Commissioner responds to this debate, he would be able to outline the types of situations that he envisages this may be used for - although, of course, we have some ideas ourselves.
I have been asked by a number of colleagues who have read the report why, if it is such a good idea, there are so many amendments in it.
The original Commission proposal was dated April last year, but after that nothing happened.
It was blocked, it appears, by the French Presidency, with no explanation of what was happening.
So I tabled a question at Question Time asking for an explanation and miraculously - but maybe there was no connection - the French Presidency and the Commission got together to negotiate to remove the blockage.
They came up with an alternative text but, I am sorry to say, the Council has never had the courtesy to inform Parliament of the new version of the text.
So the many amendments in my report are an attempt to amend the original proposal and for us to comment on the new compromise text which we happened to obtain, even though it was never given to us officially.
Parliament has only one reading on this, which is another reflection which was not corrected at the Nice Summit of the democratic deficit.
It should, of course, be codecision, but it is not.
However, we were able to threaten to use our single reading to withhold it - like the famous isoglucose case some years ago - and if we withhold an opinion, nothing further can happen.
So we have an effective veto.
But, happily, the committee in Parliament has looked at this proposal in great detail and is in favour of it.
Hence the many amendments proposed by the committee.
Finally - I am not going to go into the details of the amendments - I am happy to say that the committee adopted the amendments almost unanimously, with the single exception of the British Conservatives.
They will no doubt explain why that was so.
That was the party which I felt obliged to abandon because it had become totally negative about Europe.
I very much hope that when we vote on this proposal they will at last feel positive and give it their wholehearted support.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets welcomes the proposed rapid reaction facility.
We support this Community mechanism, which is designed to make resources available for urgent non-combat activities related to crisis management and conflict prevention.
It is right and fitting that the European Union should help to preserve or restore public order and to facilitate dialogue, conciliation, mediation and the prevention of human rights abuses.
All of this, however, can only be achieved or become achievable if the facility really is able to respond rapidly.
That is why we emphatically support the Commission's proposal that implementation be based on the committee system, including the involvement of an advisory committee, with the emphasis on the word 'advisory'.
Now over the years, as you know, the Commission - with Parliamentary backing, I hasten to add - has been pursuing a strategy of gradually transferring activities from the ambit of the common foreign and security policy, in other words from the second pillar of the European unification process, to that of the Community, the first pillar.
This trend is continued by the current proposal for the rapid reaction facility.
So far, so good.
But the funds for this purpose must be allocated under Heading 4 of the Financial Perspective.
And all Members of this House have been made aware by at least the last two budgetary processes just how tight our finances are in the foreign-policy budget.
Every year, this allocation has been the subject of our bitterest budgetary wrangling with the Council.
We have no need of a crystal ball to predict a similar situation this year.
For that reason we have asked the lead committee to do two things: firstly, to call on the Commission and Council to outline their intentions and particularly to explain how they intend to divide up responsibilities between themselves in this field and how they intend to finance the relevant activities, and, secondly, to add a recital to the proposed text stating quite clearly that rapid reaction interventions must be financed within Heading 4.
Should that be impossible, provision must be made for a revision of the Financial Perspective.
In addition, we want an obligation to consult Parliament on each action to be financed under the facility.
The rapporteur and the lead committee have complied with these budgetary wishes.
For this we are very grateful to them.
Mr President, the European Commission boasts a whole raft of competences which are important in terms of a civil contribution to keeping those situations under control which threaten to get out of hand.
Those competences can be deployed in the stabilisation phase following a violent conflict, to prevent the situation from hitting crisis point again.
In addition to the usual aid personnel, these competences also involve monitors, the deployment of government officials, trainers and police.
They translate into projects and aid policy specifically designed to bring stability to a certain region.
We very much welcome the dimension of political and organisational coherence in all these civil instruments in the form of a rapid reaction facility.
In this way, the EU' s responsibility for the international legal order can be developed much more effectively.
Furthermore, it gives the Commission and the competent Commissioner a chance to bring forward their own initiatives and proposals in this field.
In our opinion, the interplay between the rapporteur and the Commission has led to an excellent resolution.
Particular efforts have been made to avoid introducing or maintaining superfluous structures which delay the decision-making process.
The rapporteur is right to point out the need for funding this facility and the need for a well-trained unit for financial management and implementation.
My group prefers the Commission text to the rapporteur' s amendments on a number of scores.
For instance, I find the list of examples and goals in Article 1 (1), which is what the rapid reaction facility will serve to achieve, very useful.
The report mentions the clear involvement of the European Parliament in the policy.
Given the fragmented commitment of the Member States, also in the future, the report is right to call for a system of information exchange.
Who knows whether more far-reaching coordination and guidance will be possible in the time to come.
We learn from our knock-backs, albeit with some delay.
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo are important examples where a great deal went wrong and, slowly but surely, we learnt from our mistakes.
The rapid reaction facility is, as far as this is concerned, an enormous step forward.
We hope, of course, that it will need to be deployed as little as possible, but that is wishful thinking.
We know that in politics, it is useful to have this option up your sleeve, as a complement to the rapidly mobilised military unit which falls within the remit of Mr Solana.
We think that in future, the European Union' s civil instruments will matter most in the sphere of maintaining law and order, and this is, of course, also what we want.
For we too, like everyone else, would like to choose civil instruments over military instruments, but we need not press this point too much in this arena, given the large degree of hesitation whenever the need arises to deploy military instruments.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Newton Dunn, who guided us so expertly through this complex preparation of the report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence, and has done so again.
By way of example and evidence, I can confirm that only one amendment was tabled for the plenary with regard to his report.
Our group will, incidentally, support that amendment.
The proposal to institute a rapid reaction facility by means of which financial resources can be freed up quickly, receives the unqualified support of my group.
It is our express preference to deploy civil instruments first in the event of a threatening conflict situation.
This is the second concrete step in that connection, after formulating the requirement of a rapidly mobilised police force.
We are waiting with bated breath for a detailed proposal for a total package with so-called "headline goals" in this area.
We would like to see a balance struck between the EU efforts in the fields of civil and military crisis management.
The EU must be able to respond quickly in emergency situations with a wide and well-attuned range of instruments at its disposal.
This is why simple procedures are being proposed for the rapid reaction facility.
Comitology can be avoided by remaining within the Community framework.
However, in theory this limits the number of countries where the instrument can be deployed, but we do not foresee any practical problems.
Where is the European Union not active?
In cases where the Commission makes a formal proposal - which is understandable - to deploy the facility so as to guarantee the implementation of EU programmes, we would like to see the term 'EU policy' added.
This will widen the scope.
In order not to hinder effectiveness, we have suggested not defining the financial boundaries beforehand, or including timeframes in the scheme.
The rapid reaction facility must be flexible by nature.
We would ask the Commission, especially in the beginning, to carry out many and frequent assessments, and to report on these to our Parliament.
In this context, we are also very keen to find out how the facility will relate to the ECHO programme.
This is a new instrument, and we can learn from its growing pains.
Finally, I should like to ask whether the Commissioner would be prepared to discuss possible scenarios for commitment at some point in the future, for we are now theorising about instruments, but we must also talk about the practical implications at some stage, and for this purpose, a scenario discussion would, I believe, be very desirable.
Mr President, when things go wrong in a certain region, the world has come to expect ever more from Europe, and rightly so.
We have the means, the organisational set-up and intention to help in emergency situations, and from that point of view, Africa can expect precious little from America under Bush.
That is why I welcome the Commission proposal to set up a rapid reaction mechanism alongside the military unit and to supplement ECHO.
This new mechanism will certainly meet a need, so much so that demand could soon exceed supply.
In my opinion, the resources available for this year are an insult to the serious commitment of the RRM.
Even if the amount is doubled or trebled in later years, it remains a joke compared to the many initiatives which can qualify for RRM action.
It is about fast decision-making, acting and funding.
The impressive list of operations from the otherwise excellent Newton Dunn report comes, therefore, as a bit of a surprise.
It contains many important tasks of a not entirely pressing nature, such as providing education, monitoring elections or clearing mines.
Could the Commissioner clarify what, according to him, the scope of application will need to be, also in the light of limited financial resources?
The RRM initiative, a first pillar construction under the remit of the Commission, appeals to me.
It is of utmost importance for our Parliament to be totally involved.
Will we be informed about proposed action in good time?
We often hear about issues of competence and rivalry between Mr Patten and Mr Solana; a distribution of tasks between the governments and the Commission in terms of military and civil affairs is very much an option on paper, but could well lead to major problems in reality.
Can the Commissioner give us any reassurance in this respect?
European politics, military and civilian action must be coordinated effectively. This is another expectation which the world has of us, and rightly so.
Mr President, ever since Amsterdam the Union has been proudly proclaiming its role as a fire brigade for crises in Europe.
The only problem is that it does not even possess buckets with which to draw water.
With the rapid reaction facility, the Union has now acquired some buckets at least, and I do welcome that.
However, I should have liked to see this fire brigade equip itself with hoses too, but Members of this House are among those who have told us that, while this fund does not meet all our needs, fire hoses are simply expensive commodities.
Nevertheless, the facility is a step forward, but I must re-emphasise that it is still a lopsided mechanism, because it only funds action after the event.
Far greater importance surely attaches to action before the event, to preventive measures.
Police forces alone cannot prevent crises, which is why we also expect funding to be provided for the European civilian peace corps that Parliament called for in its resolution of 1999, and we ask Dr Solana to pursue these things more persistently.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Newton Dunn on his report and for the ease with which the committee has taken on board all sorts of suggestions.
We consider the Commission' s initiative to be an important one.
Nevertheless, I must point out that, although in our Group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, there is, understandably, no single point of view on this issue, the majority of us are in favour of this rapid reaction force.
We believe that it is important, that it must be established as a European Community policy, and that greater emphasis must be placed on conflict prevention as part of Europe' s contribution to peace.
We would therefore have liked to have seen greater funding allocated, and better coordination between the various applicable programmes to improve their effectiveness, as well as greater co-responsibility when it comes to the eventual - and sometimes, unfortunately, necessary - military intervention, which would perhaps not become necessary if the earlier stages were carried out properly.
Mr President, the discussion on the rapid reaction facility is starting to drag.
Member States are still not agreed on the nuts and bolts of this mechanism.
Apparently, it will also be some time before agreement is reached, and that while the financial implications for the Member States are minimal.
There is no need for them to increase their contributions to the Union' s external policy, they only need to grant approval to facilitate the shifting of existing resources.
Laborious negotiations have once again shown that ambitious goals regarding one of the Union' s external policies evaporate in practice because of the firm positions held by the national Member States.
Removing the geographical restriction of programmes created by the Union is not a licence for the European Union to intervene anywhere in the world at will.
I therefore applaud the specifics which have been added to the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy with regard to this proposal.
This mechanism specifically focuses on actions within the context of European programmes.
This mechanism can provide help where the implementation of those programmes is at risk due to crisis situations.
However, I do not share the conclusions of the report on a different score.
Indeed, unlike the rapporteur, I wish to retain the crisis committee from the Commission proposal.
In this way, we will prevent a situation from arising where initiatives meet with insufficient backing within Member States.
Furthermore, we will lend the Union' s and Member States' initiatives the necessary coherence.
Not insignificant, in the light of all the criticism which the Union' s external action has had to put up with over the years.
I also have my reservations about the suggestions made in the explanatory statement with regard to the amendment of the legal basis of this regulation.
Article 308 is the only article on which this proposal can be based.
Moreover, I wonder whether the addition of Article 179 will benefit the speed of this mechanism.
It appears to me that codecision for Parliament will delay matters unnecessarily.
What we do need to be able to do is to call the Commission to account afterwards on the use of this mechanism.
Mr President, the proposal for a regulation creating a rapid reaction facility is one of those which are founded on thoroughly laudable intentions but which are liable to fail as a result of red tape and turf wars.
The European Union has played a rather unconvincing role hitherto in the realm of rapid reaction and conflict resolution.
The reason for this does not seem to lie so much in a shortage of manpower or financial commitment as in a failure to manage, plan and coordinate initiatives and activities.
Be that as it may, the declaration of intent to become more active in the resolution of conflicts and in crisis management must be interpreted as an important step in the right direction.
The EU has sometimes done marvellous things to improve the situation in crisis-torn areas, especially with financial resources.
But money is no substitute for political will and political influence.
If the EU wishes to play a more prominent role in future, it must have the political will to involve itself more actively in the implementation of appropriate measures.
I am only the representative of a small country, but I can assure you that Austria, with its long tradition of neutrality and non-alignment, has amassed a particular wealth of experience in the domains of political mediation and crisis management, which makes parties to a conflict more willing to accept it as a mediator.
Perhaps this is one of the very areas in which the EU should be making greater use of the experience of its smaller countries.
Crisis management and mediation attempts are not so much about huge financial resources and large bloated organisations as about the trust that warring parties are prepared to place in an offer of intervention.
And this is precisely where the EU has been failing.
We have an image problem in the eyes of the parties to the numerous conflicts in the world today.
That cannot be surmounted with new administrative units and financial plans alone.
What is really lacking is a credible desire to assume greater global responsibility in the realms of mediation and crisis management.
Mr President, I hope I have the Commissioner's attention, as he is in conversation with Mr Brok at the moment.
Throughout this Parliament we have been calling for the Commission to introduce more efficient financial management and administrative procedures so that it can deliver external assistance and implement its programmes such as mine action urgently, in times of crisis or when lives are at stake.
It seems to us that this was the underlying motive behind Mr Patten's proposal for the rapid reaction facility.
I hope this is the case and I would ask for a reassurance on this point from the Commissioner.
It is a pity that the term "Rapid Reaction Facility" has been used for what after all should be a procedural matter, a financial management instrument.
It is easily confused with "Rapid Reaction Force"; it has been confused in the media and even in Parliament's own session news this week.
Perhaps in the interest of clarity and to avoid confusion, the Commission could change the title to something like "Urgent Financing Facility".
We support the principle as I have described it, but one or two unfortunate elements seem to have crept in.
Firstly, instead of referring to the facility in the context of CFSP and the Commission's own first pillar external actions, it has been put into the context of the common security and defence policy.
Now we have expressed our concerns about the EU meddling in military matters on many occasions and our reservations have not been eased by developments at Nice.
This is a separate issue.
The Commission's financial facility should not be mixed up with these defence issues.
Secondly, there is a thread of political correctness running through the proposal.
I am baffled for instance by the idea that the fight against gender discrimination would fall into the crisis management category, triggering the use of the rapid reaction facility.
Thirdly, for us more importantly, Mr Newton Dunn, the rapporteur, has taken the opportunity to introduce an amendment in pursuit of one of his pet subjects, namely the establishment of a European public security force, in other words a European gendarmerie or armed police.
This is the main reason why we cannot accept this report.
We do not want a European army and we certainly to not want a European police force.
We do want the Commission to carry out its external assistance with greater efficiency and we welcome measures to that effect.
Mr President, the European Parliament has always upheld the need to increase the European Union' s non-military intervention capabilities.
We therefore welcome the Council' s proposal and support Mr Newton Dunn' s report, which puts forward proposals that improve the text.
These are clearly issues which come under the first pillar.
Nevertheless, we all know that, in the context of the second pillar, the military mechanism of a rapid reaction force, designed to fulfil Petersberg-type tasks, is being created.
It is envisaged that these tasks will be carried out in third countries where the non-military rapid reaction mechanism will also operate.
But how, and in what cases?
What kind of procedures will this relationship employ?
What kind of coordination?
I therefore think it would have been beneficial for the document to have addressed this aspect as well.
As a Member of this Parliament, I wish to contribute to the breaking down of some of the barriers that separate fields of competence from one another so that greater cooperation within the European Union is achieved.
Mr President, my party fully recognises the need for the developed countries to make available resources for international crises and for our response to be rapid and effective.
In this context, the Commission's proposal looks attractive in that it provides the mechanisms for affording a response to crisis situations.
However, we believe that for our efforts to be both rapid and effective, they should be planned, funded and executed on a truly international scale, utilising the resources and the capabilities of the whole free world, including the technical genius and the good will of the United States.
The mechanisms for ensuring this already exist in the form of the United Nations and its various agencies.
Although imperfect and always capable of reform, these agencies have provided good service and have relieved much suffering.
For the future, the way to ensure that responses are maximised is to continue working through these agencies, ensuring that resources are used wisely and efficiently.
As far as the Commission's proposal is concerned, this is simply reinventing the wheel, putting the political ambitions of the European Union before the needs of suffering people.
People in crises need a European rapid reaction facility as much as a fish needs a bicycle.
We should abandon these grandiose plans and instead support and develop the existing agencies which have a better track record that the EU will ever have.
Mr President, in discussing this matter I very much welcome the proposal from the Swedish Foreign Ministry that I have just seen today for a goal-oriented action plan for conflict prevention, because as I have said before, we in the European Union should be sending a philosophy for peace to areas of conflict and not just armies.
The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution and that is something we tend to forget.
Look at the last century: the first half of it was marked by the worst conflict the world had ever seen: two world wars and millions of people dead and killed.
Yet who could have foreseen that in the second half of that century those same people would come together in the European Union.
As I know from my own experience, the principles at the heart of European Union will resolve conflict wherever they are applied in the world.
Therefore do you not think it is a very positive and sensible suggestion for the European Union to have a department that does precisely that?
In other words, the Commission should have a department of peace and reconciliation and a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation to go to areas of conflict in advance and apply the principles of conflict resolution, particularly those principles at the heart of European Union itself.
Mr President, I am very sorry to have heard in the debate MEPs from my own region in the UK from different parties say that they will be opposing this report.
I am pleased to support the rapid reaction facility and I do so as a Member of Parliament's Development Committee.
In the week that 600 people lay dead after the earthquake in El Salvador, this European Union must be able to move more quickly just as we failed to do in response to the impact of hurricane Mitch in that same country back in 1998.
I ask Commissioner Patten in closing the debate, first to assure us that the facility will be utilised in response to crises world-wide in support of the EU's development goals and not just in Europe's own backyard.
Second, could he tell us how he could make such a promise when year after year the Commission proposes funding interventions in Central and Eastern Europe and in the former Yugoslavia at the expense of budget lines benefiting the developing countries.
Third, will he undertake to bring forward a detailed operational relationship between the rapid reaction facility and the financing of ECHO and indeed explain why he has not at one and the same time brought forward proposals to speed up our humanitarian assistance as part of the reform programme which he knows we support.
Finally, can he tell us is he shares our belief that development is the best form of conflict prevention and to commit himself to enhancing the EU's development programme to avoid the need for crisis intervention in future years.
N. Korea
The next item is the following oral questions:
B5-0560/2000 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council, on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
B5-0825/2000 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Commission, on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say a few words on the question tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, especially on the basis of the findings obtained by Mr Santer and other colleagues of ours on their visit to North Korea.
I believe that we in the European Union have a more important role to play there than we have previously done and that our policy cannot stop at support for the KEDO programme.
It is certainly regrettable that, with eight Member States having now established bilateral diplomatic relations, we have not been able to adopt a concerted approach in our dealings with North Korea.
Last year was an exceptionally interesting one in the Korean peninsula, especially on account of the rapprochement between North and South Korea and the reuniting of families that was made possible by this thaw in North-South relations.
We must be aware that this area still has the potential to be a major trouble spot, but there is nevertheless a real political opportunity now to achieve a lasting peace settlement.
That is why it is essential that the European Union, as an international player in a multipolar political world, should become active in this domain.
It is a matter of supporting a policy which can pave the way for democracy and human rights in North Korea and which, on that basis, can play a significant part in the development of ever greater understanding between the two parts of Korea, an understanding which, following the meeting between the two Presidents, has sparked off the first public debates about national reunification for many decades.
Such a policy must also be combined with a means of obtaining details of the food situation and the health system in North Korea and must enable us to incorporate appropriate measures of aid into a political strategy so as to bring about an improvement in the general situation and perhaps also to initiate the development on which the long-term peace of the region depends, for the peace of that region, of course, is of global importance too.
As an arms supplier, North Korea is an important player on the world stage, and its development of modern weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems makes it a country which could undoubtedly pose a serious threat to other parts of the Asian continent and to other continents.
Madam President, I believe that we must therefore seek improvements in these domains, so as to curb the proliferation of armaments and thus contribute to global stability.
I hope that you will support this motion for a resolution and that the Council and the Commission can agree on a coordinated approach with Parliament which will enable us to make our contribution in that part of the world, not least in our own interests.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, during the meeting held in Pyongyang between 25 and 27 November of last year within the framework of the political dialogue, the European troika emphasised the most important parts of the European Union' s strategies towards the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea - strategies which had been approved by the Council at its meetings on 9 October and 20 November.
Allow me just briefly to mention the three most important of these strategies.
First of all, the European Union' s support for work on achieving lasting peace between the two Korean States.
Secondly, the importance of the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea' s adopting a responsible attitude when it comes to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, as well as putting a stop to exports of missiles.
Thirdly, respect for the UN' s Convention on Human Rights.
When it comes to establishing diplomatic relations with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea, the Council agreed on 20 November of last year that the interested parties must consult between themselves and inform the Council of the content of their discussions with Pyongyang.
The Council has repeatedly urged the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea to comply fully with its commitments under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and cease to produce, test or export any missiles or missile technology.
The European Union has also called upon the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
Furthermore, the European Union has informed the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea that it expects concrete measures to be taken on these issues.
In all contacts with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea, the European Union has emphasised its great concern about the serious violations of human rights in the country, about the number of political prisoners, about the absence of national legislation and about the Korean authorities' refusal to cooperate with international mechanisms in defence of human rights.
Demands have been made for improvements on these issues.
We shall continue to highlight the importance of these issues.
The European Union welcomes the decision by the Democratic People' s Republic to resume its reporting under the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights during the year 2000 and hopes that the country will now, on the basis of its own report, be able to enter into a useful and constructive dialogue with the UN Human Rights Committee
On the issue of measures to be taken, the Council has called upon the Commission to begin dealing with the issue of technical measures of support which may be taken within those sectors to which priority has been given.
The Council and the Commission will, as soon as possible, be examining what measures are possible in order to open the European market to North Korean products.
Feasibility studies will be conducted in those areas regarded as having priority.
The European Union will make efforts to extend the political consultations with the Republic of Korea, whose efforts to effect a rapprochement between the two Korean States are fully supported by the European Union.
It is also a question of establishing areas in which joint measures might be taken, for example on the issue of technical aid and economic cooperation with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea.
Madam President, I very much welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this extremely important subject.
Recent events on the Korean Peninsula are of great interest and concern to all of us in Europe and the contribution that we make in helping to promote reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula, in helping to bring, as it were, the North Korean government and society in out of the cold.
Those efforts reflect the extent to which Europe has a global role to play and they match, in a sense, the role that Japan has been playing the Balkans - helping to support stability there.
We similarly have responsibilities in other continents.
A European Union approach towards recent developments in the Korean Peninsula was agreed at the General Affairs Councils of 9 October and 20 November last year.
This approach aims, as I have said, to support the inter-Korean reconciliation process in order to bring about peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
Taking this approach as the basis for Commission action, the Commission will maintain and is considering increasing its assistance to North Korea.
Overall, in the last few years, that assistance has totalled - including the contribution to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation - about EUR 275m.
However, any increases should be measured in response to signs of progress of the DPRK in areas of principal concern to us and, I know, to Members of this House.
Respect, for example, for human rights; non-proliferation issues; access for the population to external aid; better operating conditions for NGOs - a point I was able to make to the DPRK Foreign Minister in Bangkok last summer - and the opening up of the DPRK's economy and the structural reform that will be a necessary part of that.
This approach has been outlined to the North Korean authorities at the recent Senior Officials Troika meeting in Pyongyang at the end of November.
I understand that my services are keeping Parliament fully informed of this issue.
Parliament has shown an active interest in this subject for some time.
The humanitarian and food assistance delivered to the DPRK - around EUR 200m since 1993 - will continue.
A new food security programme for 2000, totalling EUR 20m, has just been adopted by the Commission.
I should point out that we have moved from regular food aid to structural food assistance and, in particular, the provision of inputs and technical assistance to enhance agricultural production.
The implementation of humanitarian projects approved in the year 2000 will extend well into the summer of this year.
Humanitarian aid - mainly medicines, water, sanitation and winter clothes - is planned to continue on a more selective basis, but at a level adequate to respond to real humanitarian needs.
We also have the scope to match, with additional assistance, any further progress made by the DPRK authorities, notably in terms of access to the most vulnerable populations and the improvement of working conditions for non-governmental organisations.
In addition, the Commission is now considering possible measures in the fields of technical assistance and trade, which could be gradually extended if North Korea makes progress in the areas I have mentioned.
As a first step, these measures include a general increase in the DPRK textile quota by 60%, 50% in the case of a few product categories.
A fact-finding expert mission will be sent shortly to assess needs and identify areas in which pilot technical assistance projects could be pursued.
But they certainly include an area which, I know, has been of interest to Mr Ford - that is the whole question of the energy industries in North Korea which will be so important to the country's economic future.
As to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the European Community and the DPRK, the Commission is considering the appropriate timing of such a step in close coordination with Member States.
Finally, clearly the Nobel prize-winner, President Kim Dae-Jung, has been typically visionary in the efforts that he has made to promote reconciliation on the peninsula.
Equally clearly, President Kim Dae-Jung has been very realistic about what can be achieved in the short term.
I do not think he makes extravagant claims about the pace and development.
What is important is to keep our eyes on the horizon and to keep working towards it.
We should take our inspiration from President Kim Dae-Jung, who is one of the great statesmen of our age.
I hope that with his encouragement the European Union will continue to play its part in ensuring that the Korean Peninsula, the region and, indeed, the world, enjoy peace and prosperity.
The consequences if we were to continue to isolate the DPRK, if the DPRK was to continue to be prepared to be isolated, are too grim to contemplate.
Madam President, the resolution on North Korea, on which Parliament is about to vote, has a political significance of the first water.
Not only will the European Parliament itself establish its position on the northern half of the Korean peninsula, but it will also have defined the new direction of this position for all the European institutions.
In my capacity as president of the ad hoc delegation, whose visit to North Korea inspired the drafting of this resolution, I should like to share three key considerations with you.
The first is the advent of a new era in bilateral relations between the two Koreas, characterised by the policy of rapprochement, or Sunshine Policy, of President Kim Dae Jung, who made an important initial gesture with his historic visit in June 2000 to Pyongyang.
Europe has a duty to support the efforts of the Korean people as a whole and the Korean political leaders with a view to achieving stability and lasting peace in Korea.
This is the context in which our policy on Korea must be viewed and the scope of our policy actions must be defined.
Secondly, Korea is the last nation in the world that is still divided by a wall.
Following the example of Germany and Yemen, Korea can now begin to see the prospect of cooperation with a view to overcoming this internal frontier.
Europe, which the two Korean states have asked to assist them in defining new economic and political relations within Korea, must accept the challenge and point the Koreans towards the path to integration after a long and difficult time as a divided nation.
The European example of the gradual creation of area without internal frontiers is being called upon to serve as an example in this instance.
Once again we have a political responsibility to provide every conceivable aid to a Korea which is slowly overcoming its historic divide.
Finally, I would like to tell you that, more specifically as regards North Korea, confrontation and isolation must be consigned to the past once and for all.
The North Korean leadership seems willing to be open and to pursue dialogue with South Korea, the United States, Europe and Japan, and although, in the final analysis, they must be judged on their actions, I am convinced that a European policy of dialogue, structured and critical dialogue, will make a significant contribution to changes in the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea that will benefit the entire world.
Madam President, can I say we have made enormous progress over the last three years in terms of relations with the DPRK.
We have now had three interparliamentary delegation meetings and the resolution calls for the Koreans to come here again to continue the dialogue.
We have seen the European Commission move from not talking to the North Koreans to having an ECHO representative in Pyongyang and we have now moved from five Member States with diplomatic relations to, I understand, thirteen in the process of establishing diplomatic relations with the DPRK.
I would like very much to see the European Community also establish diplomatic relations with the DPRK.
We give money to the KEDO project as Mr Patten has said, we give humanitarian and food aid and are hoping to give other structural assistance, a total of EUR 275 m.
It is crazy to be doing that without having the ability to have a political dialogue.
We need a dialogue on human rights, we need a dialogue on weapon sales, we need a dialogue on economic development.
The reality is that with the collapse of the Soviet empire, the failure to make the transition from the Stakhanovite heavy industries of the past to the new light industries and a series of natural disasters, the economy is in complete crisis.
Observers are estimating that the resulting food crisis has led to the premature deaths of 3 million North Koreans, one in eight of the population.
Today their only exports are raw materials and military hardware.
