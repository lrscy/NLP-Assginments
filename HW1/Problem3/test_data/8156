I am not sure how much that has to do with the apportionment of the way in which liability arises if pollution does occur.
If it occurs then we need to see how it is dealt with.
As other speakers have said, the polluter-pays principle must be the right one.
On the other hand, if one defines the polluter-pays principle, it is important that one does not just cast about to find some wretched victim who may have had some kind of association with what happened and heap all the liability on to him.
Perhaps that is why we disagree with some of the other speakers in this debate.
I can envisage circumstances where it is right and just that the government has a role, where pollution has taken place, and where it may not be appropriate to put the blame or impose the responsibility for what occurs on some other party.
Lastly, it is important in the context of the politics of this kind of debate not to have a knee-jerk reaction to any particular pollution incident in the recent past.
We often hear mention of the .
Of course that was a disaster, but when we are thinking about general rules against general problems, we must not be too specific.
Â Â  Mr President, my point of view is naturally closer to that of Mrs Gebhardt, who has spoken on behalf of the Socialist Group.
This directive represents a step forward in principle, but not in practice, because its application by the Member States has a time limit of three years, the possibility of examining an obligatory insurance system is left for a period of six years and there are provisions which will not enter into force for nine or ten years.
This at a time when these types of accident are happening constantly.
Specifically, in the field of responsibility for damage caused by ships and other things, there are international conventions which limit the responsibility of shipowners.
From a practical point of view, therefore, Community citizens are not going to see any difference now nor for many years to come.
This is a beginning â Parliament has been very cautious in accepting it in order to maintain the commitment of the States â but we must be completely realistic: there is no real progress here.
Accidents will continue to happen, causing immeasurable damage which is not insured, there is no way of obliging the shipowners or other sectors creating risks to take responsibility and there could be cases of regions, such as mine for example, which lives exclusively from its coasts, being faced with an oil slick which entirely wrecks the activity of the region without the possibility of receiving compensation nor of damage being covered by an insurance system.
That is the reality.
As always, however, this Parliament, in fulfilling its responsibility â which seems excessive because, since Parliament has codecision powers, it appears to be characterised by a high degree of responsibility â has preferred to suffer slings and arrows in order to accept the compromise â I would not call it a compromise, but rather a diktat â imposed by the Council and the Commission and, to ensure that the proposed Directive can go ahead, has accepted these conditions.
In this task, Mr Manders has done everything he could.
We are left with just a few verbal commitments.
Let it not be said, however, that we or the electors have been deceived: this is just the beginning.
Let us hope that the Commission does not wait for these long periods of three, six, nine and ten years, but that within a short space of time â probably as a result of another great accident, which will cause enormous damage in any part of the European Union, whether it be in the Baltic, the Mediterranean, the North Sea or any other place â it is obliged to present us, and to do so quickly, with a proposal which changes this and allows us to move ahead with much more precise rules.
Another issue which must be clarified is whether a Directive is the appropriate instrument or whether we need a Regulation which makes this type of rule obligatory, without waiting for the States to slowly fulfil their responsibilities towards their citizens.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too extend my congratulations on the important step to be taken at tomorrowâs vote.
I would remind you that, in the Conventionâs draft of the new constitution for the European Member States of the EU, we undertake to implement a policy intended to secure social, economic and environmental development on a sustainable basis.
In that the environmental liability directive deals with the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, I see it as a logical consequence of our commitment to the European model of the environmentally responsible market economy, and so I very much welcome the fact that the polluter pays principle will apply from now on, and that businesses or other operators will be obliged to prevent damage to the environment and, where they have caused any, to repair it themselves or bear any necessary restorative costs.
Reference has already been made to the evaluation process and to the agreement that has been reached to the effect that preventive and restorative work has to be carried out in close consultation with the operators.
There are two flies in the ointment that I would like to mention; one is that this directive does not deal with nuclear liability.
We find it incomprehensible that the polluter must be held liable for any environmental damage done by wind power, biomass, biogas and solar energy installations, but not, according to this directive, when such pollution arises from the operation of nuclear power plant.
I appeal to the Member States to ensure the exclusion from liability of normal operation permitted by the authorities and development risk, to neither of which it has as yet been possible to secure an explicit reference in law.
We endorse the joint text.
Â Â  Mr President, again on behalf of my British Conservative colleagues â my colleague Lord Inglewood, who worked on this, has spoken already â and my Group, I certainly welcome very much the excellent work of Mr Manders over a long period and also through conciliation.
I am bound to remark, as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, that the decision that our committee should undertake this work, much contested by colleagues in other committees, has been more than amply borne out in the practical and pragmatic response that we have had, and I think we have a workable proposal.
However, as a number of colleagues have said â and this is a time for looking forward rather than backwards, because we have the agreement on the table â there is a lot of work to do to establish the clear responsibilities with organisations and to ensure through the so-called competent authorities in Member States that companies' operating processes and anyone involved in potentially environmentally damaging activities are fully aware of their potential responsibilities under this directive.
I want to encourage the Commissioner â who, I hope, will leave something in place as part of her legacy as five years as Commissioner â to start to encourage Member States to exchange practice, firstly, about how they are going to establish their competent authorities or, indeed, how they are going to allocate responsibilities to existing environmental agencies that many of them have already established; and to establish the sort of networks of sharing of best practice that we are seeing in a number of other pan-European regulatory environments, such as energy and communications.
There seems to me no reason why that process should not start at once, and also why communications to affected organisations should not also start.
This directive, as a number of colleagues have said, has a very slow-burning fuse to it.
Member States have quite a generous three-year timescale. There are also long timescales before review.
However, if, as we all believe, prevention is what we are after â rather than clearing up damage afterwards â we need to start action straight away and there is no excuse for delaying on that.
So I welcome the agreement.
However, this is only the start and I am sure â and hope â that the Commissioner will leave that structure in place for us to follow through.
Â Â  . Mr President, allow me to interrupt briefly.
I wanted to know whether my offer of a date is being accepted, because if so, we can make an arrangement via the Bureau.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I hope we can allow ourselves to feel proud today.
This issue has been with us and with those before us for many years.
It is a complicated and politically sensitive issue.
We have managed to establish the platform and although we have all said that it is a first step, it is a very important first step.
It also establishes the attitude and re-establishes the polluter pays principle.
We can only build on that and take it further, which is why it is such an important first step.
I wanted to answer Mrs SchÃ¶rling directly because the Commission statement about looking at the financial security again in 2006 is not formally legally binding, but you might call it politically binding.
I hope that means as much as if it had been legally binding.
It is an obligation and a commitment from the Commission so, of course, we will have to come back on this.
I am sure we have only seen the beginning.
It is so important, for the reasons you have all mentioned.
Thank you again, and all right, I will come for a drink!
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0177/2004) by Mr SjÃ¶stedt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the European Parliament, and especially the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and by thanking the rapporteur, MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt, for the work that he has put into his report at first reading.
Waste from extraction can be of such a composition and volume as to pose a serious threat to the environment and human health if it is not managed correctly.
This has of course been seen in the major accidents in AznalcÃ³llar in Spain, inÂ 1998, and also in Baia Mare in Romania, inÂ 2000, when tailings ponds burst, releasing large quantities of toxic substances.
This had an extensive environmental, economic and social impact.
The aim of this proposal is to introduce EU-wide rules to prevent water and soil pollution from long-term storage of waste in tailings ponds or heaps.
The stability of disposal facilities must also be ensured in order to prevent the occurrence, or reduce the impact, of accidents.
Combined with the amended Seveso II Directive on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, and a document on the best available techniques for the management of ponds for tailings and waste rocks, this proposed Directive will guarantee the appropriate management of waste from extraction throughout the EU.
The Commission shares the views of those who have said that the proposal must have a sufficiently broad scope, and that some exemptions, for example concerning waste from prospecting, should therefore be removed.
In this context, the exemption for inert waste should not be extended to cover all non-hazardous waste, as that would weaken the proposal.
Contamination from mines can indeed pose a problem, but it cannot be regulated by this proposal, which concerns waste.
Regarding historical waste, the Commission supports the amendments containing requirements for the most contaminated sites to be inventoried.
In our opinion, however, it should be the Member States which make the decisions on the rehabilitation of these sites.
We also support the amendments emphasising the need to make appropriate plans for the closure of disposal facilities as early as the design phase.
I should like to conclude by pointing out that the Commission is striving for a directive that is sufficiently comprehensive to enable the achievement of these important environmental objectives.
Â Â  Mr President, before I go into detail on this proposal and Parliamentâs suggested changes and improvements, I should like to recapitulate on the background to this Directive.
It was prompted by the serious environmental disasters in Spain and Romania that the Commissioner also mentioned.
We should be aware that the problem of collapsing mine dams is something that recurs almost yearly in different parts of the world, including in the EU.
At the same time, it can be said that an environmental disaster is lurking, in the form of the leakage into the environment of old mining waste, about which we often know very little, chiefly heavy metals.
All things considered, this could be said to constitute a considerably greater environmental problem than the mining currently in operation.
At the same time, EU legislation in this field has been inefficient, as the existing directives on waste, some of which currently apply to mining waste, are ineffective and ill-suited to this type of industrial production.
This makes it perfectly clear that a new directive is needed in this field.
Hence, we should like to thank the Commission for its proposal.
This has many good points, for example regarding the safety of ponds and the effective prohibition of the method involving a high cyanide content, which had been used in Romania.
This Directive will make that method inadmissible in future.
As a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and as rapporteur, I should also like to see further improvements.
Firstly, it is important that this cover all relevant types of waste.
For that reason, we have chosen to remove a number of exemptions, for example concerning waste from prospecting.
I also think that it is important that it cover waste that is removed from the nearest production site.
I am especially grateful that we have been able to agree on a definition that I think works well, because the definitions issue was rather complicated in this case. There is now agreement on this within the political groups.
I should also like to mention inert non-hazardous waste.
It is important to realise that even waste that is not intrinsically or chemically hazardous can cause major environmental problems.
This can happen if it is incorrectly stored, if it is allowed to contaminate water resources, or in the case of soil acidification.
It is important that this waste, too, be covered by rules requiring that it be restored and managed properly.
I do not think that the decision taken by the Committee on the Environment goes far enough in this regard, and have therefore tabled Amendment NoÂ 98, which would put this right, in my view.
One of the key points in this report concerns historical waste, which is perhaps the greatest environmental problem of all.
It is not sufficient to just make an inventory.
We must also ensure that we really do address this issue, otherwise we are only going halfway towards tackling environmental problems.
In my opinion, it is important to include this in the suggestions made in the report, so that we are also able to use Structural Funds to really address this.
This will represent an opportunity for the new Member States, in particular, to address these quite significant environmental problems.
I also think that this should be seen as an opportunity for new technology and for that research and development currently taking place in the EU that to some extent already leads the world in this field and, above all, can do so in the future.
On the subject of financial guarantees from companies, too, we opted for a compromise among the political groups even before first reading.
This involved our allowing Member States considerable freedom to give shape to these financial guarantees.
This is a good thing, as many countries already have effective systems in place.
At the same time, Commission approval will be required so that the guarantees meet requirements, which is only reasonable.
Regarding technical solutions to the various provisions of the proposal, my aim as rapporteur was that we avoid going into technical detail and shackling these proposals to various technical solutions: that would hinder adaptation to technological developments.
I believe that we have indeed achieved this result.
Another point that I should like to mention is that, from a global perspective, a large proportion of the least responsible mining takes place in the very poorest countries.
We have inserted into the report words to the effect that, where EU funding is granted for mining projects, for instance from the European Investment Bank, compliance with the requirements laid down in the Directive will be a prerequisite for this aid.
Another point that I have chosen to emphasise concerns the monitoring of dams.
Despite construction requirements, there are often shortcomings in that dams are not adapted later, nor are they monitored as required if the production conditions change.
We have also seen this in these accidents.
Another important point is that we want planning to take place right at the beginning, before the closure phase.
Taken as a whole, I think that the Committee on the Environmentâs draft strengthens the Commissionâs work significantly, whilst still being fully in line with it.
I hope that these proposals will enable us to address the fundamental problems that I mentioned at the beginning: preventing major dam collapses, making leakage of pollutants into the environment a thing of the past, and establishing legislation in this field that is effective in practice and comprehensive.
The framework for doing so is now in place.
I should like to take a couple of seconds to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the representatives of the Commission for their constructive cooperation.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the main issue in this directive is the definition of waste in the extractive industry sector, where waste is either non-hazardous or hazardous.
The way some of the amendments have been worded with regard to inert waste only serves to confuse the whole situation, resulting in a sea of endless questions.
Non-hazardous waste, which is the kind of waste associated with extractive industries, is indeed non-hazardous, because it is material that has its origin in nature.
Natureâs own environmentally non-hazardous material, waste rock, cannot be waste, especially if it is still being used as filler material in mines and quarries, for soil improvement or road construction.
Making waste rock subject to a waste tax in Finland could only cost the jobs of hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
European extractive industries will bring remarkable added value for the European Union.
The socio-economic impact of the new extractive industry will be of crucial importance, especially for sparsely populated and peripheral regions.
It is by no means a matter of insignificance how this branch of industry should be handled.
Telephones, windows, glasses, crockery, cutlery, transport and building, to name just some goods and sectors of industry, are all based on this industry.
Now it is a question of whether we want to keep this industry in Europe under our own supervision and in compliance with the principle of sustainable development, or drive it outside the Union, where its environmental implications are beyond our control, through legislation that is too constraining and unfamiliar to the sector.
It is crucial that an explicit Minerals Policy for the European Union is drawn up, taking into account environmental and economic factors.
Once again this would be a task for the Commissioner responsible for competition.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe being a well-ordered, clean and ecologically-minded place, there is particular interest in waste policy, and this evening we turn our attention to the waste produced by mining.
Needing as we do the riches of the earth in order to live, we seek them out, process them and use them.
They are of differing value, and it is their utility value that is decisive.
The question arises of whether all of what we do not at present use or process is to be categorised as waste.
I do not believe that it is.
In order to get at the material deeper below the surface, good soil, earth and overburden are removed, transported away and later tipped back onto the excavated sites, thus guaranteeing the return of fertile fields and meadows, in other words, that the earth will be as good as it was before.
What made discussions in Committee so difficult was the definition of waste, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in its report, the SjÃ¶stedt report, has opted very firmly for the definition that is already in the Waste Framework Directive.
We are in favour of real waste â polluted material or stones â being properly removed and disposed of.
Overburden and topsoil â at least as the terms are used in German â constitute reusable materials that are vitally important elsewhere, in that, without them, opencast mines could not be properly filled in, and recultivation would be impossible without topsoil.
All those who engage in extractive work, or who make incisions in nature, are also under an obligation to leave behind them tidy, orderly and, above all, hazard-free land when their work is done, so it is right that the plans should include a contractual provision for renaturation and recultivation with effect from the commencement of work.
We lay down sureties for this; these must, however, be both secure and flexible.
This is where the Member States are under an obligation to lay down criteria, which must then be approved by the Commission.
We are, above all, concerned about the misdeeds of the past, the incorrectly decommissioned mines, the tailings that were piled up; this is what we term historical waste.
It is right and proper that we should speak up in favour of making an inventory of the one and removing the other, but this requires more time.
There is a need for criteria that are capable of being met and put into practice.
In Amendments Nos 71 and 72, the rapporteur does not go far enough.
A directive on mining waste does not have to repeat and recapitulate everything that is already regulated in other European Union directives, such as the Landfill Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the Waste Framework Directive.
I would again like to point out, by way of conclusion, that all our efforts must have sustainability as their objective.
Environmental, economic and social considerations must be weighed in the balance, no less when approving plant than when restructuring it and imposing conditions on waste management plans.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have arrived late, but that is because we currently have not only mining waste to deal with, but also â basically, indeed, anticipating the next parliamentary term â and again, with our REACH system, in other words with chemicals policy.
I have just been spending the evening with BASF, a major chemicals business, and have had to leave them in a rush in order to get here.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists is very happy with the legislation we now have on waste from the mineral-extracting industry.
What we in Europe need is unified standards for the management of this waste, which will not only lead to greater similarity between the conditions under which companies compete in the Member States, but will also, at the same time, improve the publicâs living conditions and their environment.
The Committeeâs deliberations generally focussed on the definition of what is meant by waste and on the financial guarantees to be provided by the industry, but a broad majority backed what we agreed on, and there was general agreement on it; we hope that the plenary will tomorrow follow us in that agreement.
We want every company to be obliged to ensure that it is able to repair any damage to the environment for which it is responsible.
We do not insist that only one form of financial surety should be possible.
Although we have left a great deal of leeway and many options, the Member States and the Commission must guarantee to us that this will work.
When it came to defining mining waste, we took on board everything from everyone who engaged in the discussion process â the industry, the environmental NGOs, the Court of Justice, and, not least, the Commission.
There is no question of us in the Committee having voted to reinvent existing legislation; quite the contrary, that is precisely what we have avoided.
We have made a number of improvements to the Commission proposal with environmental considerations in mind.
We have made the connection between ecology and economy, something that Social Democrats have always been keen to do.
The fact that the plenary has only 20 amendments from the groups to vote on testifies to the good work we have done in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I found working on this dossier with my fellow Members of the Committee a very pleasant experience; the Commission, too, was very helpful on many occasions, and so let me now express my warm thanks for that.
Â Â  Mr President, my Group very much supports the rapporteur's position on this issue.
We feel it is an extremely important area.
Mining and quarrying waste accounts for nearly 30% of the annual EU waste, which equals hundreds of millions of tons of waste.
I come from a country which encouraged mining activities without looking at the long-term consequences of these activities, and some of the mines have left a history of major problems which will reach far into the future; for example, Tynagh Mines in Ireland is one of the most obvious cases.
There has to be accountability here.
Because of the lack of proper control, mining companies have been able to get away with leaving behind, when they have finished their operations, a legacy which continues to pollute our environment and our water.
This directive goes a long way towards ensuring that this does not happen.
All extractive waste has to include inert waste. That is extremely important.
In relation to historical waste, that is particularly important in countries like my own where mining activities are not as prolific as they have been in the past.
I support everything that the rapporteur has said.
It is a very important report, and a very important position has been adopted by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I hope that the Commission can accept the rapporteur's amendments, which improve the Commission's proposal.
It is also in line with many of the environmental groups around Europe who feel that this is crucial, as well as the rapporteur's recommendations.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin, like everyone else, by thanking the rapporteur for his report.
He has done a good job over a relatively short period of time.
This is a much-needed report and, for obvious reasons, the accidents in Romania and Spain, but also other incidents that have taken place around the Union over time, have demonstrated quite clearly that this kind of material poses a real danger to human health and to the environment if it is mismanaged.
This proposal deals with those environmental industrial problems.
Many of us were somewhat surprised by the number of amendments initially tabled on the proposal, but in many ways that simply reflects the importance and the seriousness of the nature of this proposal.
Sadly, we in the UK have long been aware of the dangers of mining waste since the terrible disaster of Aberfan in 1966 and the terrible deaths that occurred there.
Consequently, our national legislation has been particularly strict and strong with regard to mining waste.
However, there were parts of this new legislation that were new, innovative and worthy of adoption.
There were some, though â particularly the extension of the scope to inert waste â which I felt were misguided.
Nevertheless, I felt that the need for a registry of closed sites and previously occupied new sites was particularly important if we were really to establish the full extent of the problem across Europe.
In the end, we have a good result.
I commend the proposal to the House.
It will fit neatly alongside the complementary legislation â IPPC, Seveso, and landfill â and make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment, human health and sustainable development.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to mention the definition of waste.
This proposal does not contain a specific definition of waste from the extractive industries, but instead reproduces the general definition of waste from the Waste Framework Directive, 75/442/EEC.
This does not prevent such waste being reused for a beneficial purpose, for instance in construction materials.
It is important to make this clear.
I should like to give the Commissionâs reaction to important amendments.
The Commission can accept Amendment NoÂ 32 fully, and Amendment NoÂ 26 in part or in principle.
The amendments concerning the scope of the proposal are of course of particular importance.
Amendment NoÂ 15 concerning ArticleÂ 2.3 proposes that material such as unpolluted topsoil and waste from prospecting be covered by the limited requirements pursuant to this Article.
The Commission can support this course of action, as it increases legal certainty and also improves environmental safeguards.
We also support the amendment to the effect that disposal facilities for inert waste should also be covered by the provisions on serious accidents.
Amendment NoÂ 15 proposes that the limited requirements of Article 2.3 should include non-hazardous waste.
That part of Amendment NoÂ 15 would have a significant impact on the overall effectiveness of the proposal, and the Commission cannot accept that.
For different reasons, the Commission cannot support the amendments that introduce certain measures for exhausted mine voids that have been allowed to fill up with water.
We think that this issue should be resolved under the Water Framework Directive.
It is necessary to manage the great burden from the past presented by closed and abandoned disposal facilities.
The Commission has proposed an exchange of information on methods for charting and rehabilitating these facilities.
Amendment NoÂ 71 would make this information obligatory at EU level.
Drawing up inventories to identify the worst sources of pollution is a major step on the way to solving this problem.
The Commission can support this strategy.
Decisions on the rehabilitation itself should, however, rest with the Member States.
Another issue is the requirement for financial guarantees to cover the costs if operators can no longer be held responsible.
The Commission can support the clarifications in Amendments NosÂ 66 and 67, but cannot accept the part of Amendment NoÂ 66 that stipulates that these procedures be approved by the Commission, as this falls within the Member Statesâ competence.
Nor can we accept amendments concerning the form of these guarantees, as the text should retain its present flexibility.
A transitional period has been granted for disposal facilities granted a permit before the entry into force of this Directive.
Amendment NoÂ 74 contains an attempt to introduce certain requirements during that period, including by referring to the Water Framework Directive.
The Commission thinks this unnecessary, as the provisions of EU water legislation and also the general requirements of the Waste Framework Directive apply.
In addition, the rationale behind the transitional period should not be undermined.
Amendments NosÂ 29 and 35 underline the need for appropriate management of the closure and after-closure of disposal facilities.
A number of amendments also propose making reference to EU standards for evaluating environmentally friendly management.
Amendments NosÂ 32 and 57 establish a direct link to the objectives of the Water Framework Directive, and Amendment NoÂ 46 establishes a direct link toprotected areas.
Finally, Amendment NoÂ 7 also explains the role of this Directive in EUdevelopment aid.
The Commission supports these amendments, which have the same objectives as the Commission proposal and which increase consistency with other important EU legislation.
I am going to leave a complete list, giving the Commissionâs opinions on the amendments, with the Secretariat(1), and I should like to express my thanks for this initial debate on this important proposal, which will raise the profile of both these problems and our proposed solutions.
As many Members have said, action is needed, as these problems are much more common than we think, as are the recurrent accidents in Europe and around the world.
The problem must be tackled.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12Â noon.
(2)

Â Â  â Mr President, on the way from the Chamber to a meeting of my group yesterday, I was pushed into a corner by a camera team, prevented from continuing on my way, and hurt my back in the process.
I would ask you, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that Members can go about their business in this House without interference from representatives of the media.
Â Â  I will have the services look into that to ensure that we can go about our business as we ought to be able to in the House.
Â Â  â Mr President, as I am sure you are aware, next Wednesday the world will commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Rwandan genocide.
Nearly one million people were slaughtered, and international intervention came only too late.
Even now, we have to ask if there is the political will to put in place the measures likely to prevent future suffering on this scale.
You will, I know, agree that there must never be a 'next time', and I would therefore request that tomorrow we remember the events in Rwanda ten years ago and that we have a minute's silence in support of the need to never stand aside again.
Â Â  I take note of that for the opening of tomorrow's sitting, Mrs Kinnock.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the European Council and security:
- European Council report and Commission statement â European Council meeting (Brussels, 25-26 March 2004) and
- Council and Commission statements â Security of citizens in Europe following the Madrid bombings.
Â Â  âMr President, President Prodi, I am very pleased to be here with you today to report on the outcome of last weekâs spring European Council.
When I last had the honour to address this House in January on the priorities of the Irish presidency, I said that the overriding objective of our presidency was to secure outcomes that would have a positive impact on the lives of Europe's peoples.
I believe that last week's European Council has contributed to securing positive outcomes in a very real way.
The European Union has shown, yet again, that it has the ability to address new challenges.
It has shown that when we move together, we can make a real difference to people's daily lives.
The significant progress made at last week's European Council was due to many factors.
One important factor, I am convinced, is the excellent working relationship that has been built up between the Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament.
The theme of the Irish presidency is 'Europeans â working together'.
The European Council has clearly shown how much can be achieved when we succeed in doing this.
At the meeting, as honourable Members will be aware, the European Council adopted a Declaration on Combating Terrorism.
We agreed to resume our negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference and to reach agreement no later than at our meeting in June.
We identified what needs to be done in practical terms to promote sustainable growth and more jobs.
We discussed a range of foreign policy issues, including the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Balkans and Russia.
Sadly, as we are all too well aware, last week's European Council took place in the shadow of the terrible attack in Madrid on 11 March.
I want to express, yet again, my sympathies to the families of the victims.
I know that all here will agree with me when I say that this attack was a grave challenge to all that the European Union stands for.
In considering how to respond to this threat, the European Council wished to ensure that everything that can be done is being done to protect our citizens from the scourge of terrorism.
At the same time, fundamental human rights in our democracies must be protected.
I believe that the Declaration on Combating Terrorism adopted by the European Council strikes the appropriate balance.
It highlights our existing cooperation, it seeks to improve and emphasise the need to implement what we have agreed.
I am glad to say also that the Declaration endorsed a proposal made by European parliamentarians to declare 11 March a European Day commemorating the victims of terrorism.
The Declaration contains a number of specific areas for action.
These include measures to improve intelligence sharing, to strengthen border controls and the security of travel documents, enhanced protection for our transport systems and measures to counter the financing of terrorism.
It also contains a commitment to effective cooperation with third countries and other international organisations, in particular the United Nations.
A Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Mr de Vries, has been appointed, reflecting the need for coordinated action across the European Union.
The European Council will look again at the Action Plan on Terrorism in June and we will all agree the key tasks and the deadlines by which these tasks are to be achieved.
The European Council also agreed a Declaration on Solidarity against Terrorism.
This commits the Member States to act jointly in a spirit of solidarity if one of them is the victim of a terrorist attack.
The Declaration represents an important political signal of our solidarity in the fight against terrorism.
I appreciate very much that President Cox participated in the first session of our meeting on terrorism.
The solidarity shown by the institutions of the Union conveyed an important message.
The threat of terrorism is a threat to our security, our democracies and our way of life in the European Union.
We will do everything in our power to protect our people from this threat.
I am particularly pleased that there was major progress in the Intergovernmental Conference.
On the basis of my report, the European Council requested the presidency to continue its consultations.
It also requested the presidency to arrange for the resumption of formal negotiations in the IGC as soon as appropriate.
It decided that agreement on the new Constitution should be reached no later than the June European Council.
When I spoke here in January, I made clear my commitment to seizing any opportunity to take forward the IGC, and, if possible, to conclude it during our presidency.
But at that time, and indeed up until the European Council itself, it was not clear how far we would be able to go.
We were not certain that it would be possible to relaunch the IGC, even though we very strongly wished to do so.
Indeed, many people, during the initial stages of our presidency, told me that they thought there was little chance.
We could not have reached agreement on a timeframe for the conclusion of the IGC without the political commitment of my colleagues in the European Council.
Last week, we all rededicated ourselves to the Constitution, and acknowledged its value and importance.
The sooner it is in place, the better.
We also recognised that, even though the final negotiations will be difficult, there was no reason to believe that they would become any easier in time.
Indeed, there was a general sense around the table that delay might even create further complications.
There was also a sense of the need for flexibility and compromise on all sides.
The development of this positive and constructive spirit made it possible to decide to go for it now.
This is a huge step forward, and great credit is due to this Parliament.
You have consistently urged the Member States collectively to drive forward the negotiations.
Your very positive endorsement of the presidency's strategy has been deeply appreciated, and I look forward to continuing to work with you and your representatives over the period ahead.
In our consultations with all delegations, we have been able to confirm that the great bulk of the Convention's text is not in dispute.
We have also ascertained that many of the additional proposals made by the Italian presidency would have been acceptable to partners in the context of an overall agreement.
There are still several outstanding issues, which vary considerably in complexity and sensitivity.
We have, however, also been able to identify possible ways forward and believe that all of them can be resolved.
This will not be easy.
It will require give and take from all sides. But I believe that the key ingredient â the political will to reach agreement â is now there.
Parliamentâs representatives, like those of all other delegations, have made clear to us which issues are of particular importance to you.
It is not possible for me to say that any delegation will secure every point it has raised.
However, I can assure you â as I can assure everybody else â that the presidency will be open and even-handed in its dealings with everyone.
I can guarantee that you will not be bypassed or blindsided in the negotiations.
I want all participants to be able to recommend the final outcome to the people of Europe as fair, balanced and positive.
As I said in my report, the most difficult issues remain the size and composition of the Commission, and the definition and scope of qualified majority voting.
At last week's meeting, we did not enter into detailed discussions on these issues, nor did I try to draw conclusions.
But I offered my broad sense of which avenues for compromise might be most productively explored.
I recognise that the Commission must be both effective and legitimate.
I feel that these two perspectives should be reconciled through maintaining for an extended period a Commission comprising one national of each Member State, moving thereafter to a reduced size on the basis of equal rotation.
It is clear that only a voting system based on double majority can command a consensus.
It is also vital that we keep the requirement for increased efficiency firmly in view, while paying due regard to balance among the Member States and to their specific concerns.
It should be possible to reach an outcome that meets the concerns of all.
I believe this could be done through some adjustments of the population and Member State thresholds and through arrangements for confirmation of the transition to double majority.
But clearly, further consideration of the details is required.
As regards the scope of qualified majority voting, there is a general desire â shared, I know, by Parliament â for its extension, with a view to promoting efficient decision-making in a larger Union.
At the same time, there is also a need to take account of the particular concerns of Member States in relation to a number of specific issues.
I believe that a satisfactory overall outcome, which will involve a growth in the number of areas subject to QMV and codecision, in comparison with the present Treaties, will be found.
These issues are unlikely to be finally resolved until close to the end of the negotiations.
However, in the period ahead, it will be essential to reach agreement on as many subjects as possible, to boil down to the minimum the number of outstanding questions.
In this process, the presidency intends to make use of the full range of channels, including bilateral meetings and official-level discussions.
But the IGC is, of course, conducted at political level, and I will be asking Foreign Ministers to take forward work on a range of issues during the final negotiations at the level of Heads of State or Government.
Like you, I would very much wish to conclude the IGC at the earliest date.
However, account will have to be taken of a number of factors, including the formation of new governments in some countries and the number of issues still to be resolved.
I assure you that if we discover that there is a real opportunity to finish before June, we will do so.
We should not underestimate how far forward we have come.
Only a few short weeks ago, few would have been optimistic about our chances of finishing by June at all.
So far, as presidency, we have sought to keep expectations modest but ambitions high.
No ambition is higher than the achievement of our common objective of a Constitution that will deliver for our citizens and help make the Union more effective at home and in the wider world.
With your help, I look forward to reaching that goal.
When I spoke to this House in January, I set out the high priority that the Irish presidency was giving to the Lisbon Agenda and of our firm determination that the spring European Council should serve to revitalise and reinvigorate the Lisbon process.
I was greatly encouraged by the response of the European Parliament to our ideas at that time.
I am pleased to report that the European Council had a fruitful discussion last week.
We focused on the key issues where action is crucial if we are to re-inject momentum into the Lisbon Agenda.
My colleagues agreed with my proposal that discussions should be on two overarching themes â sustainable growth and employment â as the key challenges needed to be tackled urgently.
The European Council agreed that we need a balanced approach if we are to ensure that future growth will be sustainable.
We need to maintain sound macro-economic policies while promoting greater competitiveness and innovation.
At the same time, social cohesion must remain central to our approach.
Equally, future growth, to be sustainable, has to be environmentally sound.
The European Parliamentâs constructive engagement with the Council has been pivotal in enabling us to make real progress on all aspects of the Unionâs work, not least in legislative work directly related to the Lisbon Agenda.
Legislation agreed in recent weeks ranges from financial services to rail market opening, to intellectual property rights and to environmental liability.
I look forward to more results in the weeks immediately ahead.
It is highly important for the continuing credibility of the Lisbon Agenda that we meet our objectives.
I am delighted in this context to welcome your approval yesterday of two important legislative proposals â the Financial Instruments Markets Directive and the Transparency Directive.
A key challenge identified at the European Council was in the services sector, which remains highly fragmented.
Success in creating a true single market in this area will yield considerable benefits for the European consumer.
The services sector has accounted for 70% of job creation and growth over the past ten years.
I am pleased to report that the European Council, seeing the potential for expansion in this area, agreed that the draft directive on services, currently under consideration in the Council, should be agreed as a matter of high priority.
The development of better regulation will lead to enhanced competitiveness and productivity.
The European Council welcomed the four-presidency initiative led by Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the UK, which will drive this issue forward as a priority over the next two years.
We will return to the issue of better regulation at the November 2004 European Council.
If we are truly to encourage competitiveness, innovation and entrepreneurship throughout Europe, we must have a strong science and research capacity.
Progress in the research area is a central element of the Lisbon Agenda.
We must work to ensure that researchers remain in Europe, and are attracted to working in Europe.
The European Council agreed, as a first step in this process, that the European Framework Programme for Research and Development should be made more user-friendly, to facilitate greater R[amp]D investment by small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies.
The European Council also stressed the need for investment in basic research.
Such research is an essential building block for innovation and competitiveness.
Growth must be not only economically sustainable but also environmentally sustainable.
One of the most interesting new areas in this regard is that of environmental technologies.
The European Council recognises the importance of enabling companies to exploit new technologies, and has called for the rapid implementation of the Environmental Technologies Action Plan.
We have also invited the Commission and the European Investment Bank to see how financial instruments could be mobilised to promote such technologies.
The Commission is to prepare a report for next yearâs European Council on progress in this area.
Of course, growth and competitiveness are not ends in themselves: they are the means to secure and develop the European social model, with its emphasis on sustainability and inclusion.
Protecting the most vulnerable members of our society is an essential part of the Lisbon Agenda.
The European Council placed employment at the very core of its agenda.
Creating more and better jobs is the most urgent issue to be addressed over the coming year.
The European Council agreed that Member States should give urgent attention to four particular structural challenges, identified by the Employment Taskforce and reinforced in the Joint Employment Report.
These are to promote greater adaptability by companies and workers, attract more people into the labour market, improve the quality of employment, and encourage greater investment in human capital.
There is a real benefit from taking action now to maximise employment opportunities.
High employment will boost growth and also provides the best route out of poverty and social exclusion.
Next yearâs spring European Council will review progress made in this area over the course of the year.
Particular attention will be given to the extent to which national actions have boosted progress towards the Lisbon employment goals.
The Council and the Commission have been invited to jointly prepare a concise synthesis report, drawing on the joint employment report, specifically for that discussion.
As I indicated earlier, Parliamentâs role has been pivotal in enabling us to advance the Lisbon Agenda.
One of the areas on which we hope to make progress over the coming weeks is that of a mobility package aimed at enabling workers to move more easily between Member States.
We have worked together cooperatively on Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 which, once agreed, should bring significant benefits in terms of better coordination of social security systems and easier access to entitlements.
I hope that we can finalise this dossier jointly before the end of the term.
Equally, I look forward to fruitful cooperation on the related dossiers of Europass and the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications Directive, which are aimed at making it easier to have educational qualifications recognised in other Member States.
Governments alone cannot bring about the range of changes required to reach the Lisbon goal.
All stakeholders have a vital role to play in progressing and facilitating change.
To this end, the European Council agreed to the presidency's proposal to establish Reform Partnerships in each Member State, according to national arrangements and traditions, involving the social partners, civil society and the public authorities.
These partnerships will provide a useful mechanism for building commitment for change and reform.
We all recognise that much more needs to be done if Lisbon is to be implemented within its original timescale.
Next year's mid-term review will provide a critical opportunity for us to take stock of what needs to be changed if we are to speed up the implementation process.
We need to build our preparations for the mid-term review on a good foundation.
To this end, Heads of State or Government invited the Commission to establish a high-level group, chaired by Mr Wim Kok, to carry out an independent review to contribute to this exercise.
Wim Kokâs appointment will provide continuity with the earlier work of the Employment Taskforce.
His unparalleled experience will provide a vital and invaluable impetus for the mid-term review.
We have asked the High Level Group to report by 1 November of this year, to enable the Commission to bring forward its own recommendations to next yearâs spring European Council.
The European Council reviewed a number of issues on the international agenda and adopted conclusions on the Middle East Peace Process, Iraq, the Strategic Partnership with the Mediterranean and the Middle East, Russia, Afghanistan and the Ivory Coast.
We also considered Cyprus.
The European Council reviewed the situation in Kosovo following the recent outbreak of ethnically motivated violence.
The situation appears to have stabilised, but remains tense.
It is essential that the primacy of the political process be reasserted and that local politicians take responsibility for that situation.
The European Union remains fully committed to a stable future for a secure, democratic, prosperous and multi-ethnic Kosovo.
The Union will continue to support fully the efforts of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General, Mr Harri Holkeri, and the Standards before Status process.
The Council also discussed the situation in the Middle East, which continues to be of grave concern.
The presidency is maintaining close contact with the leaders of the principal Arab States to ensure that momentum in the peace process is not lost.
Foreign Minister Cowen has visited Cairo and Damascus in the last two days and has emphasised the need for a concerted effort to advance our common goals of peace and security in the region through a just resolution of the conflict.
On Afghanistan, the European Council looks forward to the international conference on Afghanistan that is taking place today in Berlin.
The European Union remains firmly committed to the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
Foreign Minister Brian Cowen is representing the EU at this important conference together with Mr Javier Solana and Commissioner Patten.
The negotiations on a Cyprus settlement are in the final phase as we meet here today.
The accession of a united Cyprus on 1 May remains the strong preference of the European Union.
In our conclusions, the European Council reiterated the Unionâs support for the UN-led negotiations and reaffirmed our readiness to accommodate the terms of a settlement in line with the principles on which the European Union is founded.
This European Council took place at a critically important time in the history of the European Union.
As we set out in our presidency programme, the first half of 2004 represents a time of great change and challenge, but also of great hope and opportunity for the Union.
The first of May will mark the end of the post-war division of the continent and enable us to move forward together towards a better, more inclusive Europe.
Terrible events like those of 11 March only serve to reinforce our determination to work together to forge agreements that will, in every sense, make Europe work.
I look forward to continuing to work in full cooperation with the European Parliament and the European Commission.
I particularly thank you today for all your cooperation over the last months.
As we stand on the threshold of enlargement, we can continue to show that the new Europe, working together, has both the will and the determination to deliver the positive outcomes and decisions that our people deserve.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the process of European integration began life as a peace process.
Over the last half century the peace objectives have evolved and stabilised, and today all the players in our united Europe share some deep-felt principles, because being part of the Union means respecting the fundamental rights of the person, regulating public life democratically, and developing and protecting our political, economic and social development model.
I have been thinking about these principles a lot recently while reflecting on the internal and external challenges facing our Union, mainly because when confronted with the increasingly horrific threats of terrorism we seek common points of reference.
The European Council which closed in Brussels last Saturday followed the same instinct.
As you know, the Spring Council is the focus for the economic governance of the Union.
Recent events, however, led to profound changes in the agenda, principally the Madrid attacks on 11 March, in the wake of which the Council adopted a number of measures to ensure our safety against the threat of terrorism.
Once again, the attack struck down innocent citizens, and once again our first thoughts must go to them and to the victimsâ families.
The aftermath of the attacks has affected all Europeans: it has affected us personally and it has affected our civic and political institutions.
Terrorism is the worst challenge since the Second World War ever to confront both the democratic, civilised principles regulating public life and our societies themselves, based as they are on respect for human rights.
I am pleased to be able to tell this House that the Council has decided to face this threat with the greatest determination that is physically possible.
The Declaration approved in Brussels leaves no room for doubt: the European Union Member States are forming a united front with the shared objective of completely eradicating terrorism.
I therefore wholeheartedly welcome the measures to coordinate and unify intelligence, police and security systems that were agreed upon last weekend.
At this historic stage, remember that this is the highest level of coordination possible, since it was not possible to set up a single European security agency.
That would perhaps have been wonderful, but it was not feasible in practice.
I am sure, however, that this is just the first step on the way to even greater integration.
Looking to the future, the goal is in fact to set up joint operational structures at a European level.
The most important thing at the moment, however, is that Europeans have realised that force alone is not enough to defeat terrorism.
It takes force and it takes intelligence to understand and resolve its underlying causes.
Alongside the military force and repression option, we also have to follow the political route with equal determination.
Both options must be pursued multilaterally, since unilateral approaches are no longer enough.
First, as the Declaration solemnly states, it means strengthening the bond of mutual trust between Europe and the United States, which is already close and loyal.
Without this strong alliance there can be no hope of keeping world peace.
It is, however, just as fundamental to ensure that the United Nations has both a central role to play and the credibility that this requires.
The UN must be actively involved in any intervention on the ground and in any political projects aiming at restoring stability in crisis regions.
The European Union, for its part, has the opportunity to make the most of its experience of peace-keeping and dialogue accumulated over almost half a century of its existence.
Our contribution must be to involve and mobilise the resources of all countries in order to isolate terrorist groups.
The aim is to drain terrorism of its lifeblood, and that means preventing recruitment and cutting off any technical, logistical and financial support.
Terrorism also has an ideological component, however aberrant it may be, as well as a political agenda, and so it is necessary to confront the crisis situations that split the world and threaten its stability.
First â and I am pleased to go along with what the , MrÂ Ahern, said just now â a solution must be sought to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: this is the topmost priority of all.
The success of our strategy against international terrorism in fact depends on peace in the Middle East.
Then we have to work towards achieving a breakthrough in Iraq.
Both these initiatives â in the Middle East and in Iraq â have to be concluded and carried through under the aegis of the United Nations.
The objective is, of course, to restore Iraq to the Iraqis in as short a time as possible, whilst ensuring security, independence and the highest levels of democratic involvement.
Ladies and gentlemen, as I have said, the Spring Council is devoted to the governance of the Union, and the session on the economy has further strengthened this role.
For some years, however, the European economy has been in difficulty and this threatens one of the pillars of our Union: our economic and social model.
Four years ago, in Lisbon, the Union decided that in order to maintain and develop our way of life we should put in place a thorough reform of our economic systems.
The Councilâs conclusions reveal that there is very broad convergence in analysing what needs doing, as contained in the report that the Commission submitted to you in January.
We all agree on benchmarking, coordination and the priorities to encourage growth and competitiveness.
We have been repeating them for years: we need to invest in research, development and human resources.
It is not enough, however, to agree on the things that need doing; we also need serious, hard work and the means to implement them, but we do not have either.
Indeed, I am very sorry to say that we have not yet succeeded in progressing from words to deeds.
Most of the decisions that have been taken have not yet been transformed into concrete action at Member State level, and there has not been the expected shift of resources into those investments that we all â I repeat, all â consider necessary.
These uncertainties and the paucity of financial commitment demonstrate the two basic problems with the system of governance of the European economy: on the one hand, the Lisbon process lacks a strong point of authority at Community level, which is the only way to coordinate measures; on the other, we have to reckon with the dynamics of modern political organisations.
Investment in human resources and knowledge, which we all consider indispensable, does take a very long time to provide a return.
The trend in politics, however, is increasingly to favour measures that produce a visible return before the end of the electoral term, which is much shorter.
To be fair, I have to say that some Member States have initiated major, even painful reforms, demonstrating a sense of responsibility, foresight and political courage.
The Council has reaffirmed the need to stay on this path because everyone has realised that the future of Europe is at stake.
I hope that the reforms that have been started can, this time, be finished and can be extended to the fields of knowledge, training and research.
For the time being, it seems that the political will has been found to implement the European Growth Initiative quickly, which includes a raft of quickstart projects in research and development, transport, energy and information technology.
These are clearly defined measures that have already been approved by the European Council and can all be put into motion quickly.
Real progress is needed starting this year, and by next year we need to have made up for the delays in transposing the Lisbon directives into national laws.
I am sorry to have to make these points, but I believe it is only right and proper to do so.
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall end this speech with some brief thoughts on the European Constitution, the same thoughts with which the started his address.
We have seen that external and internal challenges are threatening to undermine the pillars supporting the home that we live in together.
In these difficult times we must set aside our differences and provide the European Union with the means required to build a more solid framework of cooperation, one which will allow us to make joint decisions and to pool our resources.
Let us not fool ourselves: we can only confront the challenges facing Europe today if we remain united.
No European country, however big and strong, has the means to do so alone.
In this respect, the Spring Council has brought us some good news, which I am pleased to be able to end on today, and it also keeps up my reputation of being the eternal optimist.
All told, I have not been wrong in being an optimist in recent years.
The stage was set in Brussels for the resumption of negotiations on the constitutional treaty in the near future and for their conclusion before the end of the Irish Presidency, thanks to some extraordinary mediation by the Presidency, to whom I extend my praise and admiration.
Positive signals had been arriving in recent weeks from various governments, saying that they were ready to compromise.
Confirmation came during the Council that things were finally moving in the right direction â from a psychological and human point of view as well.
The toughest problem to solve is still the one that caused the previous deadlock: the thresholds required for qualified majority voting.
It is not just a matter of percentages, of course, but of something on which the whole future of our integration process depends: the enlarged Union must simply be able to make decisions.
If the threshold required for a majority decision is too high, the Union will no longer be able to make decisions about fighting terrorism, economic governance or anything else, because a small group of countries will be able to block any proposal.
That is the point, quite simply, and up to now the discussion has focused on the size of this blocking minority.
I ask you all to think carefully about the fact that one cannot have an institutional debate while thinking about the ways and means by which Member States can block any decisions.
The discussion should, instead, centre on the opposite question: what are the best ways and means to make decisions, not to block them?
Judging from the latest developments, another failure seems to have been averted; it therefore seems likely that we will soon have our long-awaited and beloved Constitution.
Nonetheless, I appeal for the final compromise to be a good one that will allow the enlarged Union of the Twenty-Five to operate efficiently.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Brussels Summit had as its focus and main subject the terrible events of March 11, 2004 in Madrid, and it was good that it drew from them the necessary conclusions.
As one who can still well remember how the US President John F. Kennedy in 1963 said in a divided Berlin: âIch bin ein Berlinerâ, I think that, as Europeans, we must adopt a similar attitude towards our Spanish partners and friends.
We must say that this attack in Madrid was not only an attack on Spain, but an attack on Europe as a whole, on the entire Western world, the entire world.
So it is in sympathy and solidarity with Spain that we must commit ourselves to action and to clear and decisive promotion of the European Union and the unity of Europe.
This must be our answer to terrorism.
I would like to thank you at this point very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for your leadership, which has made it possible for this signal to be sent out from Brussels.
Europe is now to act!
Europe wants to be united, and Europe wants to find its way to the future together!
It is right that the summit has accepted the solidarity clause in the version of the Constitution.
This is a solidarity clause against terrorism.
However, Europe must show solidarity in general, when faced with external attacks, and, now more than ever, we know that domestic and foreign policy form an integrated whole and that the one cannot be separated from the other.
We also welcome the appointment of a coordinator for matters of internal security, and, in Mr Gijs de Vries, a former Member of this House, we have found an excellent candidate for this position.
I look forward to collaborating with the Coordinator for Internal Security!
Let me also say, however, Mr President-in-Office of the Council â and this intervention will certainly not be the last word â that we would have welcomed it if the office of the security coordinator had been established not in the area of foreign policy and intergovernmental collaboration but, as the Commission wanted, in the area of the Community institutions, so that it would also be subject to Parliamentary and legal control.
I think this is important for the future, and, whilst I would not wish to put a question mark against the creation of this position, it will also be necessary for us not to treat it simply as an alibi in order to be able to say that we have done enough in this area.
What is now needed is a very specific policy for us to implement in internal security.
For this reason, I very much regret that the European arrest warrant is not yet in place, and we urge the five Member States who have not yet ratified to do so.
We must also build up Europol, which would be much more effective if these difficult financial negotiations did not have to be conducted between the Member States of the European Union whenever we want to give it money.
Why do we not make Europol, too, subject to the Community method, so that it can be financed from the Community budget?
That would make everything much easier.
I also think we should accept the Community method in this area, too.
I believe that the most important thing, in discussions of internal security and terrorism, is that we should tell the Arab world that we do not identify terrorism with them or with Islam.
Let me say this now â permit me to say this as a German â I remember the discussions after 1945, when there was talk of the collective guilt of the Germans.
That was rejected, and rightly, because not everybody was responsible for the crimes of National Socialism.
In just the same way, we should not today make the mistake of equating terrorism with the Arab and Islamic world as a whole.
We want cooperation; we want collaboration with the Arab and Islamic world.
For this reason too, I emphatically agree with the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, who has said â as you also have done, Mr President-in-Office of the Council â that peace in the Middle East with security and dignity for all people in Israel and Palestine is absolutely crucial in terms of peace in the world and peaceful relations between Europe and the Middle East and the Arab world as a whole.
We must counter contempt for humanity with the dignity of man, asserting our principles of life against their principles of death, and, in place of hatred, our desire for collaboration.
The message must now be â and I must thank you warmly for it â that we are gaining a Constitution, of which our group is very decidedly in favour, and the entire European Peopleâs Party has declared it to be the topmost priority.
We would like to say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that it would be a magnificent achievement if, under your presidency â we would like to see it before the European elections â you were to be able to bring the Constitution to a successful conclusion.
We wish you every success.
We support you.
The right answer to give the world is that Europe is determined and united.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, above all as a person from Madrid and speaking on behalf of my fellow countrymen in this House, please allow me to express my gratitude for the expressions of support, solidarity and condolences received not only from Europe but from the whole world.
I would like expressly to address President Cox, because his institutional declaration on behalf of Parliament had an enormous impact in Madrid and in Spain and was a match for the dramatic circumstances we are living through.
We have shown that we are building Europe through the minutes of silence all Europeans held following the tragic events in Madrid.
If the â who, unfortunately, shares with me and with others a long experience of fighting terrorism â will allow me, I would like, as well as expressing gratitude for these gestures â and this applies to both sides of the Atlantic â to say that we must not confuse stoicism and resistance with cowardice and appeasement; that terrorism must not only be fought with tanks, planes and invasions; it must be fought with dignity, with resistance and also with the necessary coordination of intelligence services and with legislation such as that we have been trying to create in the European Union since 11 September.
In this regard, I must say to the Council that Parliament worked extremely quickly and that the Council, in this case, has taken a step forward with the appointment of Mr De Vries â and I agree with Mr Poetteringâs criticisms with regard to the circumstances of this appointment â but it is notable that, at the moment, five Community countries have yet to transpose the arrest warrant into their national legislation and that we still have problems in terms of the application, specifically, of measures to combat money-laundering.
This demonstrates that we are not working seriously to combat terrorism and that we have to take very important steps, because we feel solidarity but we are all threatened.
Having said this, Mr President, please allow me to move on to the second issue, which is the Constitution.
I believe we should welcome the step forward taken by the Irish Presidency and I believe that the announcement of the candidate to the Presidency of the Spanish Government, Mr Zapatero, has been a significant step forward in terms of unblocking this situation.
He has stated that the Spanish, the Government of Spain, believe we must be back in Europe and, furthermore, taking the approach which governments of my political colour have always followed.
In relation to this point I would like to point out, on the one hand, something which is very important: qualified majority and codecision, which are essential issues in terms of European democracy.
Furthermore, I would like to address the President of the Commission and say that the circumstances in which he finds himself must lead us to reflect on an important issue, which is the role of the Commission.
Because he has very good Commissioners, President Prodi is at risk of almost always being âon the raft of Medusaâ at the end of the term of office.
We already have at least three or four Commissioners who are returning to their countries â which demonstrates that there is life after the European Union â but this is raising a serious problem: we cannot continue with a situation in which a Commissioner is in office for just ten months.
That is not sustainable.
I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the Greek Commissioner, Mr Dimas â and I do not believe this is his responsibility â has spoken in plenary before moving on to the hearing in the relevant committee.
We must all try to take care to respect the way things are done, that is essential in a democracy.
With regard to the Constitution, Mr President, I would also like to thank the former Mayor of Rome, MrÂ Rutelli, for the gesture of solidarity and dignity he has shown in proposing an amendment â which I hope will be approved today in Parliament â which gives this treaty we must approve, the European Constitution, the title of âConstitution of Madridâ.
I believe this is a gesture we can all be proud of and naturally I intend to support it.
Finally, with regard to the important issue of Cyprus, I would like on behalf of our group to reiterate our unconditional support for the efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to find a solution to the issue of Cyprus and by doing so to help the enlargement process to be successful.
I believe we must call on both parties to take this historic opportunity and to unify a country which has been divided for 40 years, thereby removing the last remaining wall in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, it has been a while since everybody left a European Council meeting smiling.
I congratulate the presidency on a focused summit that delivered in many respects.
This summit suggested that there is another Europe: one that can actually get things done.
European Liberal Democrats and Reformers welcome the new will to reach agreement on a European Constitution by the June European Council.
President-in-Office, a combination of events and canny diplomacy have paved the way for agreement.
In the words of an Irish blessing, 'may the road rise up to meet you'.
This House badly wants a deal, but our terms have not changed and will not change.
We expect a treaty based closely on the Convention text.
We expect the Council to respect the budgetary powers of Parliament and extend democracy in our Union through qualified majority voting and greater codecision.
We expect the Council to make the difficult compromises needed in good faith and then go back to sell those compromises at home.
This show will not be over in June.
Ratification is a mountain still to climb.
This summit also acted decisively to fix the way we protect ourselves against terrorism in Europe.
My Group welcomes the appointment of Gijs de Vries as anti-terrorism coordinator and demands that he be given a clear mandate to ensure he can get the job done.
The next step is to reinforce the resources at Europol and set it to work: no new bureaucracy, no duplication, no more foot-dragging from European intelligence agencies who do not like to play with others.
If this is not our frontline defence against terror then it is just a cheap gamble with the safety of Europeans.
Liberal Democrats and Reformers also back a strong commitment to ratifying existing instruments such as the European Arrest Warrant.
We have proposed an implementation league table that will name and shame states which take lightly the safety of their citizens.
The weekend's decisive tone has to translate into action.
Let us be clear about that new decisive tone.
Let us remember what Europeans â what MadrileÃ±os â had to endure.
This House has been urging a more concerted policy on terrorism since before 11 September 2001.
Let us recall that when the Commission asked for EUR 15Â million for counter-terrorism intelligence last year, the Council offered EUR 1 million.
Europeans deserve better.
A counter-terrorism policy conceived in panic is far too likely to invade private lives and erode public freedoms.
On biometrics, on passenger data transfers â that is what we are in danger of getting.
My Group wishes to remind the Council that it has once again ignored the explicit demand of this House that it discuss detention without trial at Guantanamo Bay and that it commit to raising that issue with the Americans at the EU-US summit.
Any European government that reckons on the issue going away has not reckoned on the will of this House.
My Group welcomes the commitment in Council to speeding up the pace of reform on the Lisbon Agenda.
We remind the Council that 40% of the single market directives have not been implemented in all Member States.
We remind the Council that the Growth and Stability Pact must be revived this year so that Europeans can have confidence in the sound management of Europe's economy.
The tone of public debate in Germany and France suggests that European governments are not properly making the case for reform at home, whatever they may say in Brussels.
Before this summit I called for a sense of urgency on three areas: terrorism, the IGC and economic reform.
To paraphrase W. B. Yeats, of our quarrels with others we make rhetoric, of our quarrels among ourselves we make poverty.
The summit showed a willingness to get back to the business of Europe.
Let us hope the political will holds and the momentum lasts â for all of our sakes.
Â Â  Mr President, the conclusions of this Spring Summit show that government leaders are stubbornly pursuing a policy that is indifferent to the worsening economic and social situation, that turns a blind eye to the high levels of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion and the increase in social inequalities and a deaf ear to the protests of workers threatened by the relocation and restructuring of multinational companies.
We saw an example of this only yesterday, with the Canadian multinational , which is seeking to close many of its production units in countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Portugal, and which, where my own country is concerned, is the only company engaged in producing rolling stock and train carriages.
It is clear today that, four years after expectations were raised by the so-called âLisbon Strategyâ, which was approved during the Portuguese presidency, the socio-economic situation is considerably worse and not a single one of the social aims has been attained.
This is demonstrated by the new Commissioner for Social Affairsâ acknowledgement that only 10% of the âLisbon Strategyâ objectives have been achieved.
This has not stopped the Council from announcing more of the same, however, despite the fact that we are less than two months away from the accession of a further ten countries whose economic and social situation is less than rosy.
The Councilâs recipe for success is still to commit to this âcompetitivenessâ, to promoting what it considers to be business culture, to greater job flexibility and insecurity, to lower labour costs and wage moderation and to attacking public services â in other words, to the neo-liberal agenda of economic and financial groups, instead of being concerned with peopleâs living and working conditions, with sustainable development, with greater economic and social cohesion and with providing fresh impetus for public and social investment, specifically in the railways, in health, in the environment, in education and in research.
The Council suggests that the priority should be to speed up the pace of reforms in the fields of employment, social security and health, despite growing public opposition to measures that, in some of our countries, are jeopardising fundamental social rights.
What is being promised is ongoing support for the process of liberalisation and privatisation in many sectors, demonstrating blatant prejudice against the public sector.
Continued intervention in this sphere cannot be allowed, because this threatens the existence of high-quality public services and employment, which are crucial to combating poverty and to guaranteeing social inclusion and a high standard of living for the entire population.
Economic and monetary policies must be revised, liberalisations must be halted and the Stability Pact must be reviewed in order to prioritise the social criteria, employment, training, education and research, which are all areas crucial to Europeâs sustainable development.
What is needed are effective measures to put a brake on the relocation of multinationals and to give European employeesâ organisations the right to a âsuspensiveâ veto.
Working people must be treated with dignity and well-being and social progress must be placed at the heart of Community policy-making.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it has been said that this was a European Council of newly-discovered cohesion in the wake of the terrible tragedy in Madrid, which has left us in no doubt that today we are all potential victims of indiscriminate terrorism, whereby blasphemous criminals manipulate a great religion to their own bloody ends.
We hope that there really was cohesion but, after reading the conclusions and listening to the President-in-Office of the Council, and especially after observing the measures taken by the Member States and the proposals made by the Commission regarding asylum and the protection of their citizensâ personal data, I must express our deep concern.
We call on MrÂ Prodi and the Council to take note of the resolution that Parliament is to adopt today in this respect.
It is cast in very different language from yours, gentlemen.
Europe can and must choose a different path to combat terrorism from that of the United States, with its lies, its arms race, its pre-emptive wars and its Guantanamo Bay.
We need a path that sets democratic stability, respect for human rights and a rejection of emergency measures as preconditions for action on the international stage and for cooperation in matters of internal security.
What do we see today instead?
We see the pathetic inability of the Member Statesâ governments to cooperate, hiding data and information from one another, as Mr Javier Solana has pointed out; we see the Commission making startling, untenable proposals about asylum which are clearly in breach of international conventions, and proposing to give away citizensâ personal data to mysterious US administrative bodies; we also see the umpteenth good man, MrÂ De Vries, placed at the head of a vaguely defined, once again wholly intergovernmental working group, while not a single clear idea emerges for a plan of action based on common, democratically approved rules.
It is thus quite clear now that we do not really want our police and secret services to cooperate in fighting terrorism, but we do want to set up generalised surveillance systems for passengers and citizens, under the illusion that this means we are monitoring everything.
How serious we are about the fight against terrorism can also be measured by the European Unionâs ability to give itself a constitution, as we have all said here today: a constitution able to keep its promises of effectiveness and democracy.
The positive spirit of this European Council does not, however, rid us of our concerns, which were strengthened today, Mr Ahern, by your ambiguous message about the Italian Presidencyâs well-known or, rather, infamous 82 items, which every so often pop up as a basis for negotiations and are just as often forgotten.
If that is the case â and please tell me if it is â then the new Constitution will just be a pale and untenable copy of the Treaty of Nice.
The European Council talked a lot about the economy and growth.
This flood of words is also found in the conclusions, which list so many fundamentally important issues that one cannot actually see which ones are the real priorities.
The only thing we are sure of is that the environment is a non-priority, and for us that is a great setback.
It is not surprising, then, that in this stalemate, and for lack of any real, practical plan of action and any true political leadership, it was decided to do something typical of the socialist tradition â even though most governments today are centre-right â which was to set up another working group, chaired by yet another great man, Mr Wim Kok.
They never choose a woman, mind you!
I think that would actually be a good idea.
Our objective â I have to point this out â is in fact a shared one.
We have to take steps to get the European economy out of the vicious circle of low growth and high unemployment.
Again, however, we express our scepticism at the approach supported by this European Council and also, alas, by the European Parliament in its resolution, which in this respect we cannot support, an approach that makes competitiveness an absolute dogma.
In comparison with whom should we be competitive?
Ask the voters who have just voted in France and Spain; ask them what they think of the systems and conditions of work and welfare in the United States and in developing countries.
You will realise that the strategy we need is very different, one that is well within reach for the European Union.
Of course, it would be possible if the decision was made to get out of a stability pact that is now dead but still very much alive in political rhetoric, if the decision was made to make use of potential forms of sustainable growth that we are still ignoring, and if the decision was made to invest in sectors of the future, like research, clean energy, ecotourism and public transport.
This is what we are asking for; this is the path we are asking you to follow to achieve growth.
Something other than bridges and motorways!
Â Â  Mr President, I too share the view of the previous speakers that the summit of European Union leaders was a success across a number of fronts.
Firstly, there is clearly good will among European Union leaders to secure an agreement for a new European Union Treaty, and I would like to commend the efforts of the President of the Council, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, for the very positive role he has played in moving these negotiations forward in recent times.
The Taoiseach has certainly intensified the series of bilateral negotiations with other European Union governments with regard to the provisions of a new EU Treaty, but, as the Taoiseach said himself in Strasbourg in January, this is a job one cannot do on one's own.
It requires the good will and the support of many from both the smaller and larger Member States within the European Union.
The IGC is now moving forward at a strong pace.
We must now consolidate the good will there is, secure agreement with regard to the bottom-line issues and try very hard to strike a deal before 17 June for the new European Treaty.
I fully understand and believe that this is not going to be an easy task, but we must not underestimate the challenges that lie before us.
We must be realistic about one particular situation.
If an agreement for a new European Treaty is not reached in or around the time of the next European Council meeting of EU leaders, then agreement may be difficult to reach in the medium term.
This is primarily the case because the dynamics within the European institutions are going to change.
There will be a new President of the European Commission, perhaps half the Commission will be replaced, and the composition of the European Parliament is going to change by July of this year.
That could mean two out of every three Members present at this Parliament being replaced.
I would like to urge the European Union governments to go the extra mile and strike an agreement which will ensure effective operation of the European Union for many years to come.
As Mr Prodi said here this morning, our European Union must be able to take decisions.
He said no small group of countries should be able to block decisions, and this is so.
We need a Treaty which will ensure that the European Union institutions can take decisions in a simplified and effective manner for many years to come.
We have seen too many treaties from the European Union in the recent past.
Indeed, they were coming so fast at one stage that they were being discarded before they were implemented.
We all look forward now to the historic occasion of enlargement on 1Â May, but we need to change the manner in which we take our decisions so as to ensure that the European Union as a political and economic entity becomes stronger.
The scourge of international terrorism must also be tackled head on, and I agree wholeheartedly with the views and comments expressed by the previous speakers.
I welcome the strong support from EU governments for closer cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs.
Appointments of key new personnel in Europe to tackle international terrorism in Europe are to be welcomed, but we must remember that democracy is fragile and we must be strong in our efforts to promote the rule of law and protect democratic institutions.
Al Qaeda represents evil of a barbaric nature and for AlÂ Qaeda human life means absolutely nothing.
From its perspective, the more people Al Qaeda can kill to weaken democracy in the western world, the better.
AlÂ Qaeda has bombed America, it has bombed Africa, it has bombed Asia, it has bombed the Middle East and it is now bombing Europe.
However, I want to reiterate what Mr Poettering and others have said: we must not in any way believe that all Arabs are terrorists.
That is not so and we should never allow anybody to say so.
Only by collective resolve can we defeat the evil of terrorism, and I welcome the recent measures taken by European governments in this regard.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European elections will â as you perhaps know â be held between 10 and 13 June, but it is to a perfect travesty of democracy that approximately 300 million voters in twenty five countries will be summoned.
Indeed, what is really at stake will be carefully hidden from them.
The Constitution?
Move along, there is nothing to see here!
We shall reveal it to you after the elections, after several days, to show what kind of contempt we have for universal suffrage, or, rather, what fear it instils in us.
Oh, yes, this Europe of yours, more democratic, more transparent, closer to its citizens, is off to a good start â with a cover-up.
The entry of Turkey, which would change the very nature of the European project?
Move along, there is nothing to see here.
We shall inform you of our decision after the elections, and many of those who are preparing to open the doors of membership to this country in October will campaign in June by swearing to God â and you can say that again â that they are opposed to it.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a great responsibility falls to you today: you must move the June Council forward before the European elections â a week would be sufficient â so that the first elections of the enlarged Europe would not be yet another hoax.
Because if such were the case, on such a scale, do not doubt, Mr President, that the backlash would be equal to the insult to democracy in Europe.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, on the subject of the Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, I believe it is a delusion to take the shortcut of getting the national bureaucracies to cooperate without any democratic or judicial control.
As with Europol, with Eurojust it is not just a matter of individual rights and freedoms, however serious these issues may be, but also a problem of effectiveness: indeed, you have not succeeded in conferring true powers on this coordinator for the fight against terrorism.
This is not consistent with someone who wants to see more effective counter-terrorism measures and a faster reaction capability, someone who wants not less democracy â which is the dream of all bureaucracies â but more democracy and more rule of law.
If creating MrÂ Counter-Terrorism is to be the paradigm for the new Constitution that we want, any modest increase in powers at the expense of giving up democracy and the rule of law is not the road that we want to go down.
A final word on Iraq.
The European Union is calling for the UN, but it is calling for it to cover up its own inability.
The terrorists have a political agenda, a political goal, which is the withdrawal of Europe â or what is left of Europe â from Iraq.
We would have preferred it if the European Union had had the strength to choose, to propose and to decide to do the opposite of what the terrorists want.
Â Â  Mr President, the terrorist attack in Madrid was an attack on all of us who believe in democracy.
I welcome the resolution from the spring summit to appoint a counter-terrorism coordinator.
All our Member States must cooperate fully to minimise the risks for all our citizens.
My Group leader, MrÂ Poettering, is right: we must not equate the Arab world with terrorism.
We must do all in our power to work with the many leaders and spokespersons in the Arab world who feel as strongly as we do in the West about these atrocities.
The key, of course, is resolution to the intractable problem of the Middle East.
We must never forget that terrorism is rooted in poverty and social exclusion and, as we discuss the economic governance of the EU at the spring summit, we must realise that our economic growth depends on peace and stability which, in turn, depend on our efforts to ensure economic stability and growth in those parts of the world where poverty and social exclusion are the norm for millions of young men and women.
Countering terrorism is in large measure countering poverty.
As far as the Lisbon agenda is concerned, I say to our Taoiseach that we have failed yet again to deliver progress on our much-quoted ambition for the EU to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
Your words, President-in-Office, about fruitful discussions, re-focusing on key issues, sustainable growth in employment etc. etc. etc., could be those of any President-in-Office over the last four years: they have all said exactly the same.
I am afraid there has been no progress on practical transposition in our Member States.
You have only to look at the fact that 400Â 000 EU-educated researchers are working in the United States today.
We educate them, we give them knowledge, and then they leave.
The benefit of that knowledge is developed elsewhere in the world.
President-in-Office, why did an Irish presidency choose to initiate diplomatic relations with the military dictatorship in Burma?
Why now?
We have avoided it for very good reasons for many years.
Please answer me, but do not tell me that as President-in-Office you had no option but to negotiate on behalf of the EU.
I object strongly, as I am sure do many Irish people and colleagues here, to Ireland initiating diplomatic relations with a military dictatorship that controls the Burmese against the will of its people.
Finally, may I echo the words that my colleague MrÂ Watson used and say 'may the road rise up to meet you' â '.
To all those involved in the Irish presidency, may you achieve the signing of the Constitutional Treaty in June.
You have all our good wishes.
Thank you for the progress on consultation you have made to date.
Thank you, as Enda Kenny said recently in the DÃ¡il, to the Permanent Representation and all the civil servants behind the scenes who made this technically a very good presidency.
Â Â  â Mr President, , every man and woman here will welcome the fact that you have been able to resurrect the issue of the Constitution.
Although it is not a breakthrough, what you have achieved is a really major step forward.
You can rely on our support for every further step in the Constitution-making process.
There are three matters that still particularly concern us: the first is the qualified majority.
We are glad that the principle of the double majority seems to have been accepted.
However, in the design of this double majority, the crucial objective is not strengthening the blockade minority, not making it easier to hold the European Union back, but strengthening its capacity for decision-making.
Please do not accept shoddy compromises in this area.
The second matter is the qualified majority in internal and legal policy.
In view of the need to be able to act against the threat of international terrorism, , it cannot be the objective again to expand unanimity, but the task must be to introduce majority decisions in the area of internal and legal policy also.
This is necessary also â but not only â to make the struggle against terrorism more effective.
Thirdly, you will be aware of our reservations, our worries and our demands where the European Parliamentâs budget rules are concerned; I would like to remind you of them, since the result of the Convention, the Convention draft, is itself a compromise, and one that has not found great favour with this House.
However, I say to you now that a Constitution tending to reduce the intrinsic right of any Parliament, namely the right to set the budget, cannot be acceptable to us in the European Parliament.
Finally, a particular comment, , on the Irish presidency: for what you must do in the next three months, there is no better symbol that the Irish harp.
This is because all the peoples of Europe are like the strings of a harp; each country with its own tone, but all needing to be plucked if a tune is to be played. , seize the strings, get your fellow Heads of Government to vibrate and sing!
Finish up in June with the tune which all Europeans are expecting, Beethoven's Ode to Joy: ââ!
Â Â  Shamrock diplomacy from an unexpected quarter!
Â Â  Mr President, it is of course a great tragedy that it should take acts of terrorism of the kind seen in Madrid for Europeâs leaders to pull themselves together.
Despite the fact that terrorism has reared its ugly head in several Member States on previous occasions, we have perhaps naively believed for a long time that these major attacks could never happen to us.
We are now realising that the fight must take place at global level, but also by means of intensified European cooperation.
Therefore, it is good that many important steps were taken at the summit at the weekend, even though they are insufficient.
We must create much better preconditions for the coordination of intelligence services and also, in time, create a kind of European FBI that is also operational.
Where miscreants and criminals operate across borders, so must the long arm of the law.
The most important work in the fight against terrorism, however, is the work on peace and development, and there is much that the EU can do in this regard.
A cohesive foreign policy is an important means to this end.
It is very important, therefore, that the Conventionâs proposals in this field be adopted.
I should like to thank the Presidency for the work it is doing in this field.
Â Â  Mr President, it is with emotion that we receive and share the solidarity with the victims of the terrorist attacks of 11Â March expressed by the Council, the Commission and particularly by you, Mr President Pat Cox.
Furthermore, we support the proposal to dedicate that day to the memory of the victims of terrorism each year.
We believe that the measures on police and judicial coordination and information, as well as the creation of a person responsible for combating terrorism at European level, are positive elements in the fight against terrorism, but we must not fall victim to the controlling and suspicious hysteria which the United States has demonstrated through the Patriot Act, with measures which violate human rights and the foundations of democracy and freedom.
In fact, together with creating terror, that is one of the objectives of terrorists: to undermine democracy.
In this regard, we do not agree with the proposals for police control which involve biometric and similar data.
We believe that the response of Spain and Europe, which is so different from that of the United States following 11Â September, is the right one.
Instead of turning to aggression, military reaction and reducing freedoms or invading countries, we have placed the emphasis on police investigations in order to bring these criminals to justice.
Europeâs international role can and must be aimed at achieving a fairer and more cooperative world, without poverty or inequality, which deprives the attackers of democracy and freedom, who must always be condemned, of any justification.
Amongst these measures, with a completely different approach to that of the United States, are those which involve putting an end to the illegal and unjust occupation of Iraq and the recognition of the State of Palestine, in order to put an end to another equally murderous illegal occupation; that of Palestine by Israeli troops.
We must hold a world conference against terrorism under the auspices of the UN, where the different measures can be explained: cooperation amongst police forces; structural problems: poverty, debt, inequality; the role of the financial institutions and also of the different commercial bodies; combating tax havens and money-laundering.
These measures have also been mentioned by Mrs Doyle.
Finally, with regard to the possible and desirable modification and completion of the European Constitution â which has been opened up following the appointment of Mr Zapatero as candidate for the Presidency of the Spanish Government, together with other movements in Europe â we believe it is important to take this opportunity, together with the necessary reform of the decision-making process, to achieve more democracy and solidarity in the European Constitution, with scrutiny by Parliament and by popular sovereignty with changes to the Stability Pact, which will lead to progress throughout Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, on 11 March, all we Members of the European Parliament came to this House horrified by the news of the terrorist massacre in Madrid at 7.30 in the morning.
Please allow me, firstly, to express my condolences and solidarity with the victims and their families, and also to reject all forms of terrorism.
That morning I had felt particular anguish, added to so much blood and so much anguish, at the realisation that the attack could have been the work of the ultra-radical Basque fanatics of ETA.
At midmorning, I heard a Belgian television station point out the possibility that it may have been carried out by Islamic terrorists.
At midday, when an oral amendment was presented to the House declaring 11 March the European day against terrorism, the Member presenting that amendment blamed ETA.
By then there had already been the early call to the police by the witness who saw three hooded men in AlcalÃ¡ de Henares and the van containing detonators and verses from the Koran had been found.
And there had also been statements denying the attack and the involvement of ETA from the spokesman of Batasuna.
It was already known that the attack had not been by ETA and, despite that, pressure was applied and the involvement of ETA was artificially maintained in the Resolution of the European Parliament and in that of the United Nations Security Council.
For all of these reasons, I believe that the Spanish Government of Mr Aznarâs Popular Party was trying to evade its responsibility for having participated in the invasion of Iraq, against the wishes of the Spanish citizens, of the United Nations and international law, and once again took the opportunity to blame ETA and nationalists for the problems which authoritarianism and intolerance such as theirs has created in Europe and in the world.
Neither did the discovery of a rucksack with detonators and a mobile phone used by Islamists do anything for their argument; nor the repeated communications claiming that the Al Qaeda organisation was responsible for the attacks.
The Popular Party continued to blame ETA, by means of personal calls by Mr Aznar to the main daily newspapers and by the Foreign Minister to Ambassadors, and also by means of the ineffable public appearances by Minister Acebes.
To make matters worse, millions of European citizens and governments of other States were shamelessly deceived by the Popular Party Government, who did not care a jot about the risk of further attacks and deaths in other cities, provided that the Spanish people did not know until after the elections of Sunday 14 that the horrors suffered in Madrid were a response to the unjust and illegal war in Iraq.
Fortunately, the Spanish citizens were able to demand the truth and get rid of the government which tried to deceive them.
And let us hope that we can convince ourselves soon that the best recipe for combating terrorism is to put an end to injustice and poverty, of which there is so much around the world, and in that way we will be able to live in peace.
Â Â  â Mr President, 25 countries have now agreed to prepare an EU Constitution by 17 June.
Compromises have already been negotiated behind the scenes, and a double majority, with population as a decisive element, has been approved as a principle.
What are now being negotiated are the percentages for the number of countries and the number of citizens.
There are also negotiations concerning a smaller Commission from 2014, so that not all countries will any longer have a member of the Commission.
What cannot be agreed upon now can be decided later by qualified majority.
We propose instead that all countries retain one Commissioner, and that the Commissioner be elected by, and be answerable to, the national parliaments in order to uphold the democratic principle.
We also propose that 75% of the countries, at the same time representing 50% of the population, shall be required as a qualified majority.
We also want to see the EU slimmed down, with most of the 100Â 000 pages of EU legislation scrapped and the Member States legislating on all matters that do not have a cross-border dimension. Instead, the EU should focus on what the countries themselves are unable effectively to legislate on.
In cases where we are ourselves unable to act, we have no democracy to lose, but we can instead gain joint influence where we should otherwise be powerless.
The minority's proposals from the EU Convention may be laughed at in this House.
My experience from all the group visits and meetings is that the minority's fifteen points correspond much better to the attitude of the majority of voters.
Anyone who is in doubt about this can look at the regional elections in France, where the great leader and Sun King from the EU Convention will soon be the former chairman of a council.
Adieu, Giscard d'Estaing.
See you at the referendums on the EU Constitution.
Finally, I should like to congratulate Bertie Ahern on the appointment of our old colleague Mr Gijs de Vries as Counter-terrorism Coordinator.
He has always fought for openness and citizensâ rights.
He is someone in whom I have confidence, in contrast to the head of OLAF, who steals computers and telephone and address books to reveal journalistsâ sources.
Â Â  Mr President, given the short time that has been allocated to me, I should like to confine myself to one aspect, and that is the problem that many people in Europe have with defining the problem of terrorism.
Terrorism is not simply a problem in isolation; it should, for the most part, be seen in the context of Islamic extremism.
This can be seen worldwide and I need not give recent examples of it.
We need to learn to accept this and take it into account when determining counter-terrorism strategies.
We should therefore put a stop, in the first instance, to growing Islamic extremism within the EU.
In Belgium, for example, the state security service complains that it lacks the necessary means to monitor Muslim fundamentalism.
Recently, the Belgian Government appointed eight well-known fundamentalists to the Muslim executive, of which they will make up half.
Meanwhile, in some mosques, as everywhere else in Europe, jihad is being proclaimed.
Today of all days sees the presentation to this House of the report on anti-Semitism by EUMC, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia.
This is the cleaned-up version, because in the original version, it was pointed out that anti-Semitism occurs mainly among Islamic immigrants and that is why we have now started censoring our own reports.
As long as we remain wedged in this politically correct autism, we will be unable to develop an efficient strategy against the terrorism that is threatening us.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the MEPs of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to express my gratitude for the countless expressions of solidarity, and thank you personally for your support and company during these times of anguish.
We are constantly thinking, naturally, of the victims and their families.
Therefore, together with other colleagues, we in the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are taking the initiative of recommending to the European Union that it establish a day in memory of the victims.
Plenary decided that it should be 11 March and I am glad that this proposal has been ratified by the Council almost unanimously.
MrÂ Ortuondo did not support it and he will know and explain why.
The European institutionsâ support for the victims must not just be moral, however, but also material.
In order to cover these needs, my group requested the inclusion, for the first time in the 2004 budget, of a line of EUR 1Â million for the creation of a pilot programme to support the victims of terrorism and their families.
Unfortunately, circumstances demonstrate that more must be done and, without prejudice to the measures to assist victims, which the Council has approved, I would like to express our desire for the financial contribution for the pilot project to help victims to be significantly increased, raising the status of that project to a wide-ranging Community action.
That, Mr President, is the commitment of the PPE-DE Group which has been included amongst the political priorities for the next legislature and which provides for the creation of a European fund for compensating the victims of terrorism.
Ladies and gentlemen, following 11 September an action plan to combat terrorism was approved but, nevertheless, on 11 March 2004, some of the measures laid down in it had not been transposed into national legislations.
I repeat the request made by several colleagues, because it is essential that the Member States cooperate by quickly incorporating the measures adopted within the framework of the third pillar.
It is vitally important to improve security in the prevention sector in Europe.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to point out, on the basis of my country's experience, that it is not easy to defeat terrorism.
It requires persistence and tenacity, but it is an inescapable challenge facing all Europeans if we want to continue to live in free and democratic societies.
Nobody is free of this threat and it would be a tragedy if some people tried to evade it by looking the other way.
We will overcome it if we face it together, with democratic conviction and with the force of the Rule of Law.
Â Â  Mr President, following 11 September this Parliament worked quickly and very seriously supporting the Commission and calling on the Council for a series of measures to confront terrorism.
The Union's institutions worked efficiently to achieve a common definition of the crime of terrorism and to achieve and implement the European arrest warrant.
In this and other Community institutions great statements were made in favour of better police cooperation, a strengthening of the task force of police chiefs, an operative Europol under effective judicial control; furthermore, efforts were made to achieve the establishment of minimum judicial guarantees and, finally, to create a framework providing us with greater security and speed in situations such as the one which had arisen in the United States.
Furthermore, this happened during the debate on the new Constitution, which was creating a framework providing significant opportunities to improve the legal area for police and judicial cooperation and to subject it to the essential parliamentary control.
But the moment passed and the measures proposed only moved forward by inertia, at a pace, Mr President, which has not yet taken us anywhere.
We have had to experience the recent horror in order to return to this issue in formal session, on a Wednesday morning.
Mr President, on 11 March we all had a sad role to play.
If there is one thing the citizens expected from us it was cooperation in order to offer certainty, and what we displayed, for various reasons, and with differing degrees of responsibility, was complete confusion.
The European Commission is right to say that we do not need new ideas.
We only need to implement those which are on the table, which are already boring and hackneyed.
Even so we have succumbed to the temptation for a new one and we have created a âMrÂ Terrorismâ, and I do not know what he will do unless we improve the global framework of mutual trust.
Europe can and must act differently.
We do not need a European Patriot Act.
We can and must offer more security on the basis of mutual trust and close cooperation while strictly respecting the freedoms and rights that terrorism aims to destroy.
I hope that the next time we talk about this we are not still drying our tears, but that we have a firm will to face up to todayâs world. A world in which Europe, working to promote internal cooperation, can also offer a path and a guide in order â within the framework of the United Nations and multilateral action â to deal with the significant dangers we are facing.
Â Â  Mr President, the Taoiseach says that he believes that the principle of the dual-majority system is now accepted.
But it seems to me that it is not yet accepted in practice because one sees the various ministers trying to supplement the dual-majority formula with further qualifying clauses which would permit a specified number of Member States to form a blocking minority.
My strong advice to the presidency would be to reject such superfluous complications.
It would be far better to achieve a simple formula, say 55/55, which dispenses with the need for a third key.
Europe cannot be built upon mathematical equations, but on political trust.
Â Â  â Mr President, the criminal attacks in Madrid clearly show that Europe has become the direct target area of international terrorism.
This puts the European Union in a new position.
The political world must take account of this, in both the short- and the long-term.
Unfortunately, the Heads of State or Government are confining themselves exclusively to the short-term, to exaggerated activism, which at the end of the day produces only an illusion of security rather than the real thing, and we also run the risk of ending up in an Orwellian Big Brother state in which the basic rights of citizens are increasingly sacrificed.
It is not simply that â as we are also currently experiencing in Germany â each day âa new security policy idea is run through the roostâ.
Benjamin Franklin, the father of the American Constitution, was right to say that a person who is prepared to surrender his freedom to win security will lose both.
It is not possible to prevent terrorist attacks by military means, that is to say, by war.
My main criticism of the resolutions of the European Council relates above all to its failure to understand the basic truth that combating terrorism is one of the European Unionâs strategic tasks. This is because terrorism and criminality can only successfully be combated if political action is taken to address their causes in the breeding-grounds of the prophets of hatred and violence.
Poverty, exploitation, despair and loss of rights and contempt for religious feelings and cultural traditions are what prompt terrorism and violence.
So I say that the best prevention and the best protection against terror, violence and war is a just international order.
Europe must therefore develop a convincing policy, one that seeks a peaceful and just balance of interests between the rich north and the southern hemisphere and puts an end to the plundering of the so-called âthird worldâ.
The immediate tasks include the withdrawal of the USA and its allies from Iraq, the peaceful resolution of the Middle Eastern conflict, and also an embargo on European arms exports.
Such are the long-term strategic tasks that the European Union must set itself in the struggle against terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Summit in Brussels last week gave a mandate to the Irish presidency to complete the negotiations for the Constitutional Treaty by the next summit on 17 June.
To move from a Union of 15 Member States â soon to be 25 â to a single state with legal entity, whose laws will have primacy over the laws of those Member States, is a development which my party â the UK Independence Party â believes should not be concluded without the express will of the population by a referendum.
Our politicians in Westminster voted yesterday to deny the British electorate that right.
That decision will certainly lead to public discontent.
We shall continue to put pressure on our government to concede a referendum.
Opinion polls show that the British people, if given the chance, would reject this Constitution.
It is my party's unambiguous view that Britain would be better off out of the EU, and the first step towards that position would be to deny Mr Blair a mandate to sign the Constitution.
If he does sign up to it, let us be clear: it will mean the end of our right to self-government.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the summit was â as has been frequently stated today â held under the shadow of the attacks in Madrid.
It is a positive signal that an antiterrorism coordinator has been appointed and the solidarity clause from the draft Constitution has been brought forward.
These are signs of the necessary European collaboration, which can be entered on the credit side of the account.
However â hand on heart â the knowledge that police and security services must cooperate and that the results of investigations must be exchanged across borders is not new.
Since the attacks of September 11 there has been a lot of talking but not much action.
Europe moves slowly, as Robert Schuman once said.
How true!
The Lisbon strategy of 2000 has the ambitious objective of making the EU the strongest economic area in the world.
We are still waiting for the results.
In Laeken, the starting gun was fired for a Constitution, but Poland and Spain, and also France and Germany, have not played a distinguished role at the Brussels Summit.
Is the end of the blockade in sight?
Hopes for this are not unjustified.
The Irish presidency has so far done good work.
Nevertheless, I am realistic and I see that many chapters in the draft Constitution are still controversial: the question of how many Commissioners there should be for each country, the principle of rotation, the weighting of the votes.
There is no questioning the fact, though, that the enlarged Community must be able to take action â at least in terms of lip-service.
I hope that actions will follow!
Â Â  Mr President, I want to associate my party and our 37 members here in the European Parliament with the words of the Council communiquÃ© expressing sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the terrorist attacks in Madrid, with their families and with the Spanish people.
On Lisbon, I welcome many of the points in the Council statement: the need for substantial structural reform, the completion of the internal market, better regulation and sharing of best practice.
However, current European economies remain so restrictive and inflexible that progress will be hard to achieve.
There remains, I must say, a deafening silence on our own inability to reduce the tide of regulation, which gravely damages our competitiveness and destroys jobs.
Good intentions, sadly, are no substitute for practical measures.
On the Constitution, Mr Watson and Mr Duff's party leader in the UK has joined my party in calling for a UK referendum on a Constitution.
On Monday in the House of Commons he argued that a Constitution was needed in order to define and make clear the limits of EU power.
The question, he said, is: does this Constitution have constitutional implications?
The answer he gave was an unequivocal 'yes'.
You have argued, Taoiseach, that Member State governments must show flexibility and compromise on all sides â I noted your words.
However, in that very same debate Mr Blair said that the issues of tax, social security, the UK abatement, foreign policy, defence, and criminal justice are all parts of our nationhood, and we will be insisting upon them.
Therefore there are two further questions.
Firstly, on asylum and immigration in that debate, Mr Blair assured the people of Britain that it was absolute rubbish to suggest that the EU would have any role in determining any policy decisions or laws in this area.
Secondly, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, he assured the British people that the European Court of Justice would have no jurisdiction whatsoever to enforce this Charter or the rights that were expressed within it.
I think it is a rather different legal situation and would be grateful for your view.
It is hardly surprising, when our Prime Minister denies that a Constitution for the EU has any constitutional implications, that people find it rather difficult to trust him.
That is why my party says that we should trust the people and have a referendum.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency, the Taoiseach, Minister Roche and Minister Cowen for the progress they have made on the European Constitution.
It is rare that I have an occasion to welcome the work of this government, but when it is earned I am willing to do so.(2)
Having congratulated the Irish presidency, I should also like to extend my congratulations to the commitment and professionalism of the Irish civil service and the diplomatic corps, without whose support it would not have been possible to make progress.
An enormous step forward has been taken, but we still must reach a conclusion on the text.
As one of the 200 parliamentarians from every corner of Europe who prepared this text in open forum, may I say that what we have is a qualitatively different treaty proposal from any treaty that has ever been put before the people of Europe.
It is therefore important that any further negotiations or any intent to change difficult compromises are made in as open a forum as possible.
I believe that it will not be acceptable to this Parliament, or to the people of Europe, for deals to be done, behind closed doors, which seriously damage the coherence, the values, the objectives and the capacity to act that the current text provides.
It is important, if we are going to have ratification by all 25 states, that the process in which the presidency is now engaged seeks to ensure that the people are also involved in that process.
With regard to the issue of terrorism, it has been correctly emphasised here that intelligence is the key to defeating terrorism.
I would suggest that we need to take the notion of 'intelligence' in its broadest sense.
The collection of information is important to prevent awful atrocities, such as those we have seen in Madrid.
However, the use of our intelligence is also necessary to undermine the sense of alienation and injustice felt by many of those who are recruited to commit these kinds of awful acts.
It is not enough for us to simply seek to improve our capacity to arrest, detain, charge and imprison, important as that is; we must guard against those actions that undermine the very rights that we seek to defend.
We have to ensure that we also improve our intellectual capacity to analyse and understand exactly what is driving this new form of terrorism.
It is not the same form of terrorism we have experienced in France, Ireland, Spain and elsewhere, by ETA and other terrorist organisations.
We need to look seriously and seek to engage with those sections of the communities of Europe that are alienated to the point of murder and terror.
Â Â  Mr President, the intention has always been for the spring European Council each year to be devoted to economic and social affairs, growth and development.
There was very little of that this year.
I admit that there were subjects to discuss that were important in themselves, but I wish to object to the almost total disregard for economic and social development.
The Lisbon process is not at all functioning as intended, and the problems are great.
Unemployment is high, investment is not what it could be, and so on and so forth.
Vigorous policy efforts in the Member States would of course be required, as it is there that economic policy must be given tangible form.
Instead, the only guidelines originating from Europe that carry real weight are found in the Stability and Growth Pact, which does the opposite and puts them in a straitjacket.
I fully share MrÂ Prodiâs view that the Stability and Growth Pact is idiotic.
It is high time that we did something about it and made economic development in Europe rather more dynamic.
Nor is the social aspect of the Lisbon process functioning as it should.
Everyone is talking about lifelong learning, but in reality the Member States are investing nothing at all in education; on the contrary, they are making cutbacks.
Something should really be done, and the electorate is reacting.
In both Germany and France, we are seeing how the electorate is protesting against an economic and social policy that is now being left to its own devices.
Â Â  âMr President, we all were deeply affected by the attack in Madrid, and I am very pleased that the European Council of last 25 March responded to it by anticipating the solidarity clause.
Indeed, this principle of solidarity, above and beyond any procedures that can be discussed, must have unanimous support from us.
In addition, the Council has set 17 June as the deadline for the end of the negotiations on the draft of the European Constitution.
This decision is less simple than it seems, because compromises on some essential points have still not yet been reached.
Its intention, it seems, is above all to exert pressure on the recalcitrant countries.
This decision also seems to have very little respect for universal suffrage.
Indeed, whether the agreement will be announced after the European elections or whether it is achieved a fortnight before does not change much.
In any case, the result is that there will be no time to organise a concrete debate.
Once again, Mr President, this method speaks volumes about the sort of Europe that this Constitution heralds.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, regarding the conclusions of the European Council, I would like to take the liberty of emphasising three points.
What we expect in response to terrorism, and after the tragedy at Madrid, is determination and effectiveness.
Whilst we are satisfied that a coordinator for the fight against terrorism has been appointed, it is still necessary that he should be able to be effective.
I wonder, therefore, about the powers he will have.
We are demanding more efficiency for Europol and Eurojust, just as we can only regret that certain countries have not yet given their opinion on the European arrest warrant.
Mr President-in-Office, this will have to be settled if things are to change, because, in Madrid, it was not Spain that was attacked, but all of Europe.
These events lead us to ask the question: what do we want to make of Europe?
A simple market, a free trade zone, or a genuine, united political Europe?
Europe is a boat that is moving forward, it is not being built on fear, but on ambition and will.
The time for hesitation is past.
We need more Europe, we need a constitution as soon as possible, because Europe must propose a contract of trust to the Europeans.
Finally, our political action must be coherent, effective, and sustainable.
Priority must be given to economic and social issues; we need to re-establish economic prosperity in order to resolve the social question.
Our immediate objective should be economic prosperity, on which employment depends, and which is the sole source of social progress.
It cannot be invented or decreed; achieving it depends on the space left to the creators of wealth.
The thread running through all our policies should be a refusal to discourage the spirit of enterprise, which means that it is necessary to tackle even more resolutely the brakes that are preventing this change of outlook.
Returning to economic prosperity by an increased freedom of enterprise is a desirable priority, but it cannot be continued if it is not accompanied by a new social contract based on clear partnerships and a modern trade unionism, more interested in reform than in entrenching its own status or defending vested interests.
In view of the confusion of some of our fellow citizens, the action of reform can be understood only if it appears to be benefiting the greatest number and putting an end to injustice.
This is how we will get our fellow citizens involved in the European project.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is moving forward with its responses and, after the drama in Madrid, after the one in New York, we have made, and are continuing to make progress in the fight against terrorism.
After New York we had a long and difficult negotiation on the European arrest warrant.
We had consolidated the advances concerning Europol and Eurojust.
Behind the scenes, though, implementation is so slow and so heartbreaking for our fellow countrymen that it is necessary to find other means to force the hands of the Heads of State or Government.
Indeed, having given their agreement to the Council, they then forget to implement the subject of the agreement in their own countries.
Take the European warrant; it is not right that so many States have not yet ratified this essential tool as we wanted them to do after New York.
Today, after Madrid, Mr de Vries, a former Member of this House, has been appointed coordinator.
Everyone is delighted, because everyone knows his determination in these matters, everyone knows his determination to work to establish a European prosecutor.
If, though, he has neither the necessary resources or a clear mandate, we shall be left powerless.
It was under the pressure of events that a coordinator was appointed, even though, in fact, there is an underlying idea, an intuition, one that inspired many of us within the Convention itself: the idea that, with regard to matters where the Heads of State or Government are entitled to their say and must be able to cooperate actively with the tools of a European vision, tools that are in the hands of a Commission, better coordination between various European authorities is needed.
What we have done for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, we understand that, in a way, we shall have to do in the field of justice, security, and freedom.
In fact, this coordinator is a foretaste of what must one day, doubtless, be implemented.
Today, though, he has no relation, no link with the Commission.
I believe that it is necessary to reflect on this if we want to be effective in coordinating the resources of the fight against terrorism.
In this spirit, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have in your hands the future of the European Constitution, because you now have a defined mandate with a somewhat difficult schedule, one that is certainly welcome in so far as it provides Greater Europe, which will be finally reunited on 1 May, with a Constitution in the short term, but that is, all the same, somewhat problematic in view of the elections to the European Parliament.
Put simply, what I want to do is to draw your attention to the elements that this House regards as essential.
There is, as others before me have said, the question of Parliament's budgetary powers.
Beyond this, though, I see a risk of backing down with regard to what was enacted in theÂ Convention: I want to speak about the prospect of a European prosecutor, I want to speak about qualified majority voting where it was possible to get it, in the fiscal and social area, even though this is not enough.
I see a risk of backing down in the field of increased cooperation and linking clauses.
I see a risk that the revision of the Constitution may not be dealt with.
This would be very serious.
Finally, Mr President, you have a very serious problem where the composition of the Commission is concerned.
I know the tendency: it is to give one commissioner per Member State.
I again want to draw your attention, however, to a proposal that is on the table, that of not specifying the number of commissioners in the Constitution, and leaving to the President of the Commission, with the European Council, the freedom to define the balance of the composition of the Commission, by simply imposing a limit of one commissioner per Member State at the most.
Perhaps, for a certain time, this will lead to a Commission of 25 that will have to get organised, but at least we would leave ...
Â Â  â Mr President, Europe has woken up to the subject of terrorism, although it still leaves a bitter taste in the mouth to realise that this only happened after the massacre by Al Qaeda butchers of workers, children and ordinary people in Madrid.
What is surprising, however, is that in this morningâs speeches and also in the 18 pages of the Declaration on Solidarity against Terrorism there was no explicit reference to it.
I had to wait until the speech by MrÂ Claeys, a Flemish Member, to hear anyone spell out the danger posed by Islam, fundamentalism and the terrorism arising from it.
I shall confine myself to making two points, the first of which is a moral imperative.
If we want to be able to face the memory of the victims of this terrorism, we must address the problem of European Union aid to the Palestinian Authority and the destination of that aid, so that it does not end up funding terrorists, suicide bombers or even those purportedly social activities like training camps, which are actually schools for fundamentalism and extremism.
We must also address the activities that go on in European mosques: in recent days, not just in Rome but throughout Europe, hundreds if not thousands of mosques have been holding prayers for Sheikh Yassin, the theorist and instigator of suicide bombings and terrorist murders.
Â Â  Mr President, it is clear that the conclusions of the Spring Summit have been affected by the terrorist attack in Madrid, which has not just had political consequences, but also obvious economic consequences in view of the uncertainty, instability and insecurity that all terrorism brings, as the citizens of Madrid are well aware, having suffered this terrible attack, and as the Spanish citizens of the Basque country are also aware, since for more than 20 years there has been a nationalist government which throughout this whole period has not been able to guarantee either the security or the most fundamental rights of the citizens and whose President, incidentally, was the first political leader in Spain to blame the attack on the terrorist group ETA.
I would like to say, Mr President, with regard to the constitutional issue, that I do not agree with the opinion expressed this morning in the House that the change of government in Spain has led to the new climate created.
This new climate has actually been created as a result of the attitude of the Member States â including the most reluctant â in view of the new circumstances and I would like to stress that Spain has always been prepared to negotiate to make its conditions more flexible.
Europe wants and needs a constitution, but it must be a constitution in which all European citizens are recognised.
It is important to point out, Mr President, that, not only in view of the phenomenon of terrorism, but also of the crisis with the Stability Pact, the appreciation of the Euro and the challenges and opportunities raised by enlargement, the climate in the European Union at the moment is not at its most optimistic.
The media has stressed that Europe has lost one point in competitiveness over the last ten years in comparison with the United States and that today the prosperity of the average European Union citizen is 30% lower than the prosperity of the average United States citizen.
What elements do we need in order to recover the path of sustained growth and increased employment?
Mr President, apart from the structural reforms required by the Lisbon strategy, the most important thing, the qualitative leap which Europe must make, is to relaunch the European project, not as a mere monetary union, not as a mere single market, but the real political project, and, to this end, we are counting on the Presidency of the Council and, in particular, the Presidency of the European Commission.
Â Â  â Mr President, in one respect this Spring Summit has given us renewed hope.
We can say: âRopes away, full steam ahead with the good ship !â
I very much hope that it will be possible to find a satisfactory solution to the critical points that have already been mentioned by others here today.
The fact is that we need this European Constitution in order to make it clear that Europe is not only a market, that we are not just an economic and currency union, and that not only do we have a single currency, but we also want to speak with one voice as a Community of values and rights.
We must also speak with one voice in another area, in which the diversity of voices is much too great.
The Lisbon strategy is not yet lost.
We are still interested in sustainable growth, full employment and social cohesion.
However we are far from the objectives which we have set ourselves: the economic spring has not yet arrived, we have mass unemployment with more than 14Â million people unemployed, and more than 55 million people are living on the edge of poverty, and, if we consider investments, we must really speak of an âinvestment moratoriumâ in Europe.
Internal demand has not been stimulated either; certainly it is not just because of the feeling of uncertainty as a result of globalisation, or the uncertainty as to how Europe will advance, but also because of the fears of terrorist attacks, that European consumersâ willingness to buy leaves much to be desired.
We also lack the necessary stimulus actually to achieve production growth, which we can implement only through a higher purchasing rate, that is to say, through a reduction of unemployment, in the European Union.
The European Union needs a new dynamism.
Even if it were to be the case that tomorrow the European Central Bank, in view of the low inflation rates and the low growth of money supply, were to use its scope for manoeuvre and reduce interest rates, even that would not be sufficient.
Further political measures are required.
This does not mean speeches at summits, or agreements reached at them. It means implementation measures in the Member States.
We will lose success and credibility if nothing is done about this!
Mr President, Europe needs more projects like the Airbus, which has shown that public-private partnerships, different countries, different employees, different companies can work together.
Why cannot Europe organise other successful projects with these values, which would really create hope, which would really create specific jobs, which would quite specifically promote the European lead in specific technologies of the future?
For this, the investment drive, the Quickstart programme, is certainly a step in the right direction, but it is not sufficient; it is simply too little.
We must continue to strive for reforms; we must dismantle barriers to trade and in particular services, but we must also concentrate on investment, and the Pact must not be an obstacle to this.
The continued lack of a Community patent is also a deterrent factor for leaders in research and development.
Although the Heads of State or Government have now seriously promised that it will come, it still cannot come this year!
Only visible and specific results will convince the citizens of Europe of the advantages and added value of Europe.
Europe is once again at the crossroads.
Either we increase the rate of purchasing, muster optimism and dynamism and banish unemployment, or the credibility of the European unification process is in jeopardy.
Â Â  Mr President, may I, too, congratulate the Irish presidency on the way it has handled the IGC negotiations.
The Taoiseach referred just now to the importance of give and take in these negotiations.
I return to the issue of give and take in relation to one specific point â the budgetary powers of the European Parliament.
The text of the Convention involved a bit of give and take.
