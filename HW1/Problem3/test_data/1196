It is a case in which I myself was involved and the delays there were, in my view, unforgivable.
I have noted with interest the question of participation in European and local elections and the democratic deficit.
As we approach the European elections, it is in all of our interests to encourage and to ensure the highest possible turnout of all eligible voters.
Participation is at the very heart of democracy.
Unfortunately, it is clear from public opinion surveys, poor voter turnout in European Union elections and media reporting that many Europeans feel disconnected from the European Union and consider that they are not sufficiently informed about the EU.
For this reason the presidency has decided to convene a Ministerial Conference on Communicating Europe which takes place next week.
The Conference will have two key objectives: to discuss how people might be better informed about the European Union and to assess how we might promote greater engagement by all Europeans in deciding how our Union develops and moves ahead.
Once again I would like to thank you for the opportunity to participate in this debate and, on a personal level, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what I regard as a very fine and an extremely significant report.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to pay tribute to Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs for an excellent report that bears clear witness to Parliamentâs continuing efforts to establish a genuine policy of fundamental rights within the European Union, which we want to build together.
Once again, this document is based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, although the rapporteur has chosen a subject-based overview of the Charter, analysing the criminalisation of vulnerable social movements and groups.
In the context of the fight against terrorism, which is, unfortunately, a highly topical subject again, and one that affects us all deeply, we must ensure that fundamental rights and public freedoms are respected.
I can assure you that I cherish this principle and I hope that after the tragic events of 11 March in Madrid we shall be able to overcome some of the difficulties encountered in the past and adopt legal rules for the protection of individuals, including the common procedural guarantees in the matter of criminal procedure that are essential for building mutual trust and applying the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions.
The measures taken to protect democracy and the rule of law in Europe against all forms of crime and against terrorism must strike a clear balance between the protection of fundamental rights â especially the rights to security and freedom, which are inseparable â on the one hand and social protection measures on the other.
Clearly, the European Union has reached a very important juncture so far as the protection of fundamental rights is concerned.
By enlarging, laying down its constitutional rules and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, it is about to define its true identity.
Your report serves a very important purpose, namely to monitor the observance of fundamental rights by the Member States, which is very important in itself, and also by the European institutions.
The report will also help to promote fundamental rights, and that is essential for the future.
All of your recommendations to the Commission will be looked at very closely to ensure that they are acted upon in the most appropriate way.
I shall now address a few points in greater detail.
First of all, the Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights has just completed its report for the year 2003.
The Commission has just received the final version of this report, which will be forwarded to you officially as quickly as possible.
I would like to emphasise that in response to Parliamentâs request made last year, the Network has this year sent us the 25 national reports on which the summary report on the whole Network is based.
Like the Networkâs first report, the 2003 report, which expresses the views only of the Network of Independent Experts and not those of the Commission, focuses not only on a number of concerns relating to respect for fundamental rights but also, it must be said, on positive aspects, in particular the good practices developed by some Member States that might be the inspiration for similar solutions in others.
The Network of Experts is anxious to preserve the link between the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is their benchmark, and the more general trends in international human rights law, in particular changes to the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Networkâs report covers an enormous range of issues.
The Network stresses the contribution that the EU can make, in exercising its powers in criminal matters, towards safeguarding fundamental rights in several respects, for example in the fight against racism and xenophobia, the fight against trafficking in human beings or the fight against impunity for serious crimes under international law.
The Network makes valuable comments on the development of asylum policy in the Member States and in the EUâs instruments.
In this connection, Mr Roche has just pointed out that the Justice and Home Affairs Council reached agreement yesterday on a vital directive bringing the definition of refugee into line with the 1951 Geneva Convention, approximating the systems of subsidiary protection in all the Unionâs Member States and covering the crucial and delicate question of persecution by non-State agents.
The Networkâs report also expresses concerns about the slowness with which European law is adapting to changes in the laws of some Member States concerning the definition of the family.
I turn now to the question of the Human Rights Agency.
As Mr Roche has just reminded us, the December European Council decided to extend the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia to make it a Human Rights Agency.
The creation of a Human Rights Agency has also been called for by this House, in Mrs Swiebelâs report on basic rights in the European Union in 2001, for example.
The Commission had already begun to consider whether it was appropriate to create an agency of that kind.
The idea was also put forward in the Commission communication on Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, which we presented to Parliament last October.
Around July, the Commission will be presenting a discussion paper so that the idea of setting up a Human Rights Agency can be the subject of a wide-ranging public debate.
We believe the agencyâs creation should be preceded by a wider debate on its aims and how it should operate.
To allow the next Parliament to take part in the discussion, the dialogue with civil society will continue until October and will end with a Commission-organised public hearing, on the basis of which we intend submitting a draft regulation on the new agency in spring 2005.
I cannot commit myself on the substance of the regulation at present, but I can assure you that the agencyâs creation will in no way compromise the study of racism and xenophobia; these will continue to be important pillars of the agencyâs activities, and of its political visibility.
It cannot be otherwise when fears of growing racism and xenophobia are again being felt in Europe, as evidenced by the Vienna Monitoring Centreâs work and, in particular its reports on anti-semitism, which will be presented to Parliament today.
It is also clear that the agencyâs creation must not be allowed to upset the existing institutional balance.
Finally, we are not planning to extend the agencyâs mandate beyond the territory of the European Union for the time being.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, European policy on fundamental rights is taking shape.
The year 2000 saw the proclamation of the Charter and, following the European Parliamentâs recommendation, in 2002 we set up the Network of Experts, which I mentioned earlier.
The entry into force of the Treaty of Nice was an important staging post for the application of Article 6 and Article 7 of the Treaty.
The new constitutional treaty will make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding and will allow the Union to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights.
In its communication on Article 7, the Commission presented an outline analysis of the conditions for applying that article in the future, with the emphasis on prevention; this will involve, inter alia, cooperation between the institutions and with the Member Sates and dialogue with civil society.
The future of European integration depends on the common values of fundamental rights, the rule of law and democratic institutions.
All activities in the field of justice and internal affairs must be rooted in those common values.
Thought will have to be given to how the internal and external dimensions of human rights can be addressed coherently.
I am firmly convinced that with the Constitution we are profoundly changing the Unionâs legal and political environment.
I hope that, together, the Commission and Parliament will be on the right road towards building a genuine fundamental rights policy within the European Union.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Boumediene-Thiery on her far-reaching report.
I should record that in many ways my party is not altogether happy with the Charter of Fundamental Rights as it came in and, especially in view of what we have heard from both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, we have concerns that it could become yet another framework for regulation and bureaucracy, when common sense and good manners should be allowed to have their individual way.
With the imminence of our elections, we are all aware that the largest party in Europe is now the apathy party.
We are very conscious that the forecasts for turnout in June are going to be even lower than in the past.
A major task facing the next Parliament will be to bring the citizens of the new Europe to a greater understanding of, and involvement with, the institutions.
And they are institutions, not institutions.
There are a number of methods by which citizens can make their voices heard.
They can apply directly to their elected national governments, which make up the Council; to their Commissioner nominated by their elected government; to us, as elected representatives; to the European Ombudsman; and also to the Committee on Petitions of this Parliament.
It is on behalf of that committee that I have submitted an opinion on this report.
We in the Committee on Petitions have noticed how often we are able to sort out things which should have been sorted out at a national, or even sometimes a regional, level.
However, the continuing existence of the Committee on Petitions provides a very useful safety valve and stopgap, and, uniquely among Parliament's committees, its work will continue over the interregnum into the new Parliament.
Some of you may have noticed that there is a work of art â I assume it is a work of art â in the centre of the tower building courtyard: a glass globe, approximately two metres in diameter.
From a distance it seems simple and transparent, but the closer you get to it, the more complicated the construction appears and the more opaque the surface.
This is a superb, but ironic, symbol of both this Parliament and the European Union.
I therefore suggest that it is the job of the new House and the new Commission to make the present institutions work and to simplify their relationships with citizens.
This would do much to meet the objectives laid out by the President-in-Office and to ensure that we, when we are re-elected, have the support of our citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, this report, on which I should like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, confirms the pattern of human rights violations and human rights problems in the European Union, which we have also identified in the four previous reports during the life of this Parliament.
Misconduct on the part of government personnel and police officials, conditions in prisons, unequal treatment, discrimination, racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and particularly recently, the increasingly-threatened erosion of civil rights, such as the rights of suspects, the presumption of innocence, and last but not least, privacy â all of this under the guise of the fight against terrorism.
Mrs Karamanou will say something more about this in a moment.
All in all, these reports, and particularly the last one by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, prompt us to reconsider what should be the political response of the European institutions to all of this.
That is why I am especially pleased that Minister Roche, present here on behalf of the Irish Presidency, has stated in no uncertain terms that the European Union must be prepared to search its own heart.
I very much appreciate this statement.
Other presidencies have avoided the issue or have failed to turn up at all to debates of this kind, and it appears to me that such honesty should be very much appreciated, so all honour to him for that.
Nevertheless, we should question whether the EU can, as yet, be considered to possess a fully-fledged human rights policy.
The fact is that it does not.
We are moving in the right direction, but what we have at the moment is fragments and building blocks all the same.
In a relatively short space of time, over the past five years, important normative and institutional parameters have been moved.
As various speakers have already pointed out, although changes have been made, all of these combined efforts still have not led to a coherent human rights policy.
Allow me to outline the various points in the remaining time that is allocated to me.
First of all, we have a Charter which explicitly states the human rights obligations of the Member States. That is truly wonderful.
Secondly, we have a European Parliament which uses this Charter as a basis for its reports. That too is commendable, because that makes the process systematic and verifiable.
Thirdly, as the Commissioner rightly pointed out, there is a network, and that has not only made the reporting, but also the analysis and advice-giving much more professional.
We should certainly continue down this road, for that is a major achievement.
Fourthly, we have Article 7 of the Treaty, to which the Council in Nice added a warning mechanism.
That too is enormous progress, because to put it bluntly, it takes more than an atom bomb to wage war.
Fifthly, we have received the Commissionâs communication of October 2003, which fleshed out this revised Article 7.
As a result, we know what the Commission thinks about how this should be handled, although we are still waiting for the Councilâs opinion on this Commission communication.
I assume that Parliament will be discussing it during the next session.
As the Commissioner has already pointed out, the sixth building block we have is the Human Rights Agency.
This is the outcome of a decision reached by the Council back in December.
I am pleased that it has made a first step in the course of decision-making to be followed.
I will contribute to this myself, as far as I am able to do so.
Seventhly, this has also been mentioned, we will soon have a Constitution in which the article on values will be reinforced and in which the Charter will be included.
That is all wonderful, but they are mere building blocks, and do not yet form a coherent whole.
What we really need is a coherent human rights policy covering all goals, institutions, instruments and finances.
Moreover, I should very much like clarity in the question as to what extent the human rights problems in one Member State are actually an issue for the European Union as a whole, so that countries and Member States, and we too, dare to call each other to account much more honestly than we have done to date.
Let me once again say how delighted I am with the contributions by Mr Roche, on behalf of the presidency, and by Commissioner Vitorino.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Roche, I should like to begin by thanking MrsÂ Boumediene-Thiery for her good work on an important report.
What is the situation like in the EU-15, which is a Union founded on the equal value of all human beings, humanism, tolerance and human dignity?
I should think that the vast majority of us in this House can see cracks in the EU faÃ§ade.
Welcome to our Union: refugees are insulted and excluded and run the risk of losing their lives on the way to a better life in Europe.
An important step towards a common policy on refugees was taken yesterday, as the Minister said, but it has been a long time in coming, and the proposals do not go far enough.
Eight hundred thousand women and children are bought and sold as commodities in a loathsome sex trade.
Women suffer genital mutilation, risk being forced into marriage and suffer abuse daily just for being women.
Freedom of the media and of expression are being reduced.
Homosexuals suffer discrimination.
Anti-semitism is on the increase, and Jews are hearing the same slogans that resounded through Europe in the 1930s.
There is evidence of hatred and violence in the report being presented today.
Racism and implacability towards immigrants are growing.
Millions of immigrants are excluded from society.
Muslims are being persecuted.
Islamic fundamentalism is growing strong in the suburbs of our towns and cities.
Indeed, it was in our Union that 190Â ordinary Spaniards lost their lives on their way to work on an ordinary day.
It is true to say that freedom has never been stronger than this spring, when Europe is united and old wounds are healed.
At the same time, however, we know that our EU-15 will bring many shortcomings along with it into the new EU on 1Â MayÂ 2004.
I should like to conclude by saying that it is regrettable that virtually all Member States are introducing restrictions on the new Member States.
European leaders should have been able to prevent this together by being better prepared and having adapted the acquis communautaire in time.
Many of our new friends are justifiably disappointed by this.
In conclusion, I should like to say that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party requests the support of the House for two amendments on the European arrest warrant and the French ban on headscarves.
Â Â  â Mr President, this report on the situation as regards fundamental rights in the European Union contains references to a large number of abuses in different areas.
In view of the recent meeting of justice and home affairs ministers and their messages, I would like to concentrate on the protection of refugees, that is on Article 18 (Right of asylum) and Article 19 (Protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The report, on which I sincerely congratulate the rapporteur, accuses the Member States of so far being unable to agree on a directive on asylum procedures and the status of refugees.
This very week, the home affairs ministers have now agreed to this.
It is good that the new directive will also give people who are fleeing their homelands because of persecution by non-state agents recognised status in all EU countries.
That is something that I and many non-governmental organisations and citizens have worked for.
At the behest of my government, unfortunately, refugees â but not victims of political persecution â are being disadvantaged when it comes to access to the employment market.
I cannot see any objective reason for that and I also think it is counterproductive economically because refugees with so-called subsidiary protection will be forced to work illegally in order to survive.
Those who preach about fundamental and human rights to the outside world must also look at their own performance and not be always looking only at ways their neighbours could improve.
That is right and I am glad the President-in-Office also sees it that way.
Europeâs own record on migration and asylum is in my opinion downright shameful, as the report clearly shows.
I would like to draw particular attention to the fact that people who have made their lives here in the European Union still do not have the right to vote, even though the European Parliament has called for it on many occasions.
I also want to point out that the concept of a safe third country will make it virtually impossible for refugees to enter the European Union legally in future.
The only way to get asylum here will be to jump out over Europe with a parachute.
I would therefore like us in Europe to have the courage to make a change of policy so that we will not again have a report criticising the European Union for so many different serious violations of human rights.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like to congratulate MrsÂ Boumediene-Thiery on the work she has done, which was also very important for the subsequent debate that took place in the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
I feel I must point something out: for years now this annual report has been getting more and more like a copy of itself.
We see persistent infringements, always of the same rights; there is always the same debate, but we never get to the crucial point raised by Mrs Swiebel.
Do the Commission and the Council really want respect for fundamental human rights to be a proper policy?
We expect a reply to this.
Should the reply be, however, that we already have Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, then you must understand right now that that is a false answer.
Even though the conditions for implementing it exist, Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union has never been implemented and never will be in an institutional context in which the European Commission, for obvious reasons, will never have the strength to go against one of the Member States.
Therefore, in view of the recurrent infringements denounced in these reports and in the absence of sanctions, it is inevitable that we shall yet again see this picture deteriorate even further next year.
The so-called counter-terrorism initiatives should be added to all this.
In recent times, the only practical consequence of all the initiatives taken by the Council, or which the Council would like to take, despite their stated purpose of fighting terrorism, has in fact been to repress citizenâs freedoms.
As regards the only truly useful initiative, that of breathing life into a European intelligence agency, we have read the statements by the Italian Minister for Internal Affairs saying that that is not possible because each national agency is possessive about its own data.
If this is how the European Union protects its citizens from the dangers of terrorism, how can it ever have the strength and the ability to protect its own citizens from the infringements committed against them by the Member States themselves?
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to start by echoing the point made by Minister Roche in his introduction that it is to the European Union's enormous credit that we can produce this critical self-appraisal, this report on human rights within the EU.
It is very easy to criticise other parts of the world; it is more difficult, and to our credit, that we are prepared to look within the European Union, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the governments working together to make a more democratic institution â not by any stretch of the imagination a super-state that needs to be feared, as we might read in the papers.
As Commissioner Vitorino quite rightly said, there are many positive points that we can take on board from this; and we can build on good practice from one country to another.
I also agreed both with him and with Minister Roche when they spoke of the need to develop a modern interpretation of the Geneva Convention on refugees.
The situation today is different from the post-war era of 1951, but the challenges may be similar, even if the practicalities will be different.
We all need to cooperate if we are to implement its principles.
Nothing could be more important for an EU of 25 countries than to have a common European policy on immigration and, alongside but separate, a common European policy for asylum.
The rapporteur has referred to the need for this and I commend her on her work.
As she says, it must not be based on the lowest common denominator; rather, a system that will gain the most respect and be the least subject to criticism will be based on the highest possible standards, will respect families, and will respect human rights.
Â Â  Mr President, I too share many of the views and proposals put forward by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery.
To be brief, I should like to confine myself to the worries associated with the ultra-security-conscious approach that has just been confirmed by the last European Council.
Following the American model, this positioning is dangerous and menacing; more to the point, it does not get to the roots of terrorism.
Under the guise of fighting this curse, the legislation piling up in each of our countries is already giving rise to new infringements of human rights.
I am thinking, for example, of the so-called preventative measures concerning the issue of visas in Germany, of the measures authorising the quasi-deportation of twenty-six thousand people in the Netherlands, of the measures in France that have brought about an increase in expulsions of more than a third in comparison with the start of 2003.
The European position is getting further and further away from the universal principles of asylum and solidarity.
Have not the Heads of State just flouted these principles by authorising de facto, as from 2005, the keeping of systematic records on all people living in Europe?
The same attitude prevails in the draft directives aimed at harmonising asylum policy.
Should we not therefore be worried, as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has just made clear, about the concept of safe third countries to which refugees can be passed on without any certainty about their safety?
Finally, the same can be said of the European charters, which our Parliament has fortunately just rejected.
On the contrary, the future of human rights in Europe will involve a genuine policy of welcome, equality of rights, including the right for everyone to vote and to be elected in all elections, and complete respect for the freedom of expression, including freedom of association.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has discussed a whole raft of reports on constitutional rights.
On every occasion, it is remarkable how each rapporteur manages to outshine their predecessors in criminalising millions of Europeans who are faced with the tragic effects of unbridled immigration.
It will not do to blame the few politicians and governments who make timid attempts to do something about the huge implications of asylum abuse, for a lack of solidarity.
It is intellectually unfair to systematically fling the reproach of racism and xenophobia in the face of politicians who believe that our densely populated societies can no longer deal with fresh waves of immigration without catastrophic social effects.
Less than two weeks ago, young immigrant gangs caused senseless destruction to various private properties here in Strasbourg, and they have done the same thing every Christmas for years.
Maybe some rapporteur might be able to include in their report on constitutional rights a paragraph on the rights â to physical integrity, safety and ownership â of the Europeans who live on the outskirts of our cities.
It would be more useful than the umpteenth hollow and irrelevant document about how badly we as Europeans tend to treat our fellow citizens.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is true that this report on the situation as regards fundamental rights in the European Union is in danger of becoming almost a routine appointment.
So as not to repeat what has already been said on other occasions or by other Members, I shall therefore focus my speech on three topics in particular.
The first, inevitably, is the family.
Speaking not only for myself but also on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I strongly reject paragraphs 102 and 103, which yet again call repeatedly for legal recognition of cohabiting couples, even same-sex ones.
We also reject Amendment No 157, which adds to this demand the right even to be able to adopt children normally.
It seems that some people will never learn the old lesson that on this issue it is pointless to attempt to go against the European Treaty, which clearly attributes to the Member States the power, the competence and the sovereignty to decide on this sensitive issue themselves.
A second topic that I should like to address is that of press freedom and pluralism, which only yesterday was the subject of a heated debate in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
Once again, in language quite unsuitable for this House, paragraph 63 says that in Italy the notion of pluralism is trampled underfoot with the greatest cynicism.
Come on, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, that is a sentence for an electoral manifesto, not for a debate in the European Parliament!
We therefore strongly reject Amendments Nos 84, 85 and 86, which reiterate this misunderstanding and in the end put Italy in the firing line all by itself, as if all media problems were concentrated in our country.
They start, it is true, with assumptions we can all share, such as the criteria of pluralism, freedom and access to the press for all, but then they reach conclusions so restricted to the individual case of Italy that they end up discrediting all their noble assumptions as well.
You just have to read the report by Reporters Without Borders, who certainly did not get together within the Italian Prime Ministerâs organisation but are, as you know, an organisation of left-wing journalists.
They carried out some research in Italy in April 2003, which they later published, in which they arrive at very different conclusions from those that characterise yesterdayâs unbelievable report from the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, with its even more unbelievable amendments.
For example, there is a conflict of interests in Italy, it is true, but it is being resolved these days â I might say right now as we speak â in the Italian Parliament, the only forum where this issue can be discussed seriously.
A reform bill is on the point of being passed, a reform that the Italian left never had the courage or even the ability to propose during their seven years in government.
Reporters Without Borders say that the press in Italy â I am quoting them directly: I am not making this up â is âfree and pluralistic, although weakened by the hegemony of televisionâ.
In contrast to what happened yesterday in the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, they do not talk about censorship or media tyranny.
On the political orientation of television news broadcasts, both public and private, they write that they are âsubstantially balancedâ; the only explicit criticism is the distancing from the screen of public figures like MrÂ Biagi, MrÂ Santoro and MrÂ Luttazzi, whom â I assure you if you do not know them â nobody in Italy misses, except perhaps the political bosses who pay them.
A final word, this time, after so many negatives, to recommend the adoption of Amendment No 199, tabled by Mr Borghezio and myself, on the compensation due to Italian military detainees for the forced labour they did in Germany between 1943 and 1945.
Only the Italians have not been compensated.
We call on Germany to compensate those Italian citizens who worked hard against their will in factories and labour camps, even though it is now really very late.
I should like to tell Mr Schroeder to do so quickly, because the youngest of them is 80 years old, and 10% of them die each year that passes.
Â Â  Mr President, the annual report on fundamental rights comes along at a difficult time, marked by the recent terrorist attack on Spain and the violation of the right to life of dozens of innocent people.
At the recent European Council, discussions and decisions unfortunately focused on the after-effects and failed to address the essence and causes of the new situation created by the war against democracy, as President Pat Cox called terrorism.
I am certain that the repressive measures being promoted not only fail to get to the root of the evil, the massive inequalities and discriminations in the modern world, but also threaten to sweep away fundamental freedoms and democratic rights, thereby strengthening the objectives of terrorism from another quarter.
In other words, we are being driven with mathematical precision into a sorry situation, in which the protection of personal data will be non-existent and privacy will be permanently under the scrutiny of big brother.
Terrorism is being used as an alibi to increase spending on security and convert modern democracies into autocratic police states in which every citizen is treated as a potential terrorist.
While all this is happening on the terrorist front, another terrible crime being committed on a daily basis against thousands of women and children in the form of a modern slave trade has recently been added to our political agenda.
Fundamental rights and democratic freedoms in the European Union are indeed under serious threat.
Â Â  Mr President, this annual report on human rights policy draws attention to the increasing numbers of infringements that take place in the EU, and makes concrete proposals on how this situation might be resolved.
The report raises many valid points, of which I should like to highlight the reference that it makes to the fact that many women are denied the right to abortion in the EU, as is currently the case in Portugal, where, indeed, they are still subject to criminal proceedings.
I applaud the rapporteur when she calls on the Member States to guarantee access for all women, including young, poor and immigrant women, to safe and legal abortion, emergency contraception, affordable reproductive and sexual health services and sex education.
I hope that the Portuguese Government â and the prevailing political climate in my country â will finally take this proposal on board.
I should also like to highlight the way in which the report condemns all forms of violence against women and calls on Member States to combat and eliminate violence against women and children in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the rapporteur mainly for her continuous commitment to human rights.
However, in the report there is no recognition of a crucial and urgent issue â the torture of Basque political detainees.
Yesterday, a young girl, Ainara Gorostiaga, was released on the orders of the Spanish Judge Baltasar GarzÃ³n, after spending two years in prison.
She had been kept incommunicado from February 2002.
Miss Gorostiaga admitted all the charges against her, but then retracted, saying that the statement had been extracted under torture. Judge Baltasar GarzÃ³n now recognises that she is not guilty.
Three other youngsters have already been released because there was no evidence against them either.
Two years incommunicado because of torture!
Ladies and gentlemen, ?
Â Â  â Mr President, if good intentions and earnest words could change the world, MrsÂ Boumedienne-Thieryâs congenial report would constitute a revolution.
When, however, I read about all these rights couched in long words, I am led to think about a Danish politician who, back home in our windswept country, got elected on a programme designed to give a boost to cycle paths.
It is the same refrain that underlies this report, namely the notion that rights are derived from words.
In fact, rights are derived from social practice, struggle and political activity.
What also strikes me in this report is a detail of the tribute paid to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I have nothing against rights â quite the contrary â but why was the European Union as such not allowed to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights?
Its doing so would have achieved the same result.
The reason is that there is another agenda whereby these rights are, to the very greatest degree, concerned with the actual process of integration, and it is this duplicity in the agenda that prompts me to make this observation.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hypocrisy of the talk about fundamental rights in this House can hardly be surpassed, especially when it comes from the Right.
When the Council and governments initiate more and more new surveillance programmes, plunging thousands of migrants into sheer despair with their Fortress Europe policy, leaving them stuck at borders, allowing them to drown at sea, and the few that make it are then interned in the EU only to be removed again as soon as possible, the European Parliament, which claims to be the guardian of fundamental and human rights, actually applauds.
Unfortunately, the reality looks rather different to all those who are deprived of their most elementary civil rights.
State, police and racist violence are everyday occurrences in the European Unionâs capitalist society.
The blatant justification of torture in Germany by numerous politicians and representatives of the judiciary and police in 2003 is a specific example of this.
Unfortunately, when my draft resolution condemning this justification of torture was rejected in the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, this was brought about by those groups that are now defending their political friends.
Â Â  . Mr President, the debate was very interesting.
I concur with the view put forward by many that our Union is rooted in a shared commitment to freedom, human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law.
Our Union must be an exemplar in all of those areas, otherwise we are an exercise in hypocrisy.
I mentioned that in the Tampere programme the Council reaffirmed the importance that the Union and the Member States attach to the absolute right to seek asylum, mentioned by several Members.
It agreed to work towards the establishment of a common European asylum system.
That is very important and absolutely correct.
Mr Evans, for example, said that the system we establish must have clarity.
He is absolutely correct in that regard.
Given the debate that has been raging in a number of Member States, I want to touch upon the issue of migration, an issue raised by a number of Members.
There is a disturbing rise in xenophobic comment, particularly in some parts of the popular media.
Europe is open to migration.
Indeed migration into Europe is both necessary and desirable, along with migration within Europe.
The development of a common EU migration policy is therefore of particular importance.
Both Mr Evans and Ms Kaufmann touched upon this.
It is important that we have a clear-cut policy on legal migration in order to help put an end to some of the disturbing hysteria.
The Irish presidency will continue to support an initiative by the Commission to combat trafficking in human beings, especially bearing in mind the work of the expert group in this area and the Brussels Declaration.
Quite a number of speakers made reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the draft Constitutional Treaty.
It strikes me that the Charter of Fundamental Rights elements in the draft Constitutional Treaty are one of the great pillars on which that Treaty is based.
The Charter provides an additional safeguard for citizens of the Union in their dealings with the institutions of the Union or those of Member States when they apply Union law.
I simply cannot understand how this can be portrayed as anything other than positive. I was therefore surprised by the contribution by the Earl of Stockton in this regard.
I do not think it is correct to portray the Charter as a negative; it is positive in every regard.
The Earl of Stockton made the point that common sense and good manners are the best protection.
Perhaps he would be right if we lived in an ideal world, but we do not.
We live in a less than perfect world.
My personal experience is that common sense and good manners have failed us on more than one occasion.
Several Members made reference to the importance of a free press in the protection of civil liberties.
A free press is fundamental to the protection of civil liberties.
The same Members, however, mentioned concerns about excessive concentration.
Concentration is a fact of life right across the European Union, and to the extent that it interferes with the free exercise of comment or dulls the capacity of a free press to act as a protector of all our liberties, such concentration is a cause for concern.
I thank Members for the very interesting and stimulating debate.
I also want to thank Members for the kind words they had to say about the Irish presidency.
I can assure you that the presidency, in carrying forward the Council's work, will give careful consideration to the points that have been made today.
I congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
We may not agree with every single word and every comment in the report, but it is incredibly important that we hold a mirror up to ourselves from time to time to see if we can meet our own high standards.
This report certainly helps in that regard.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as this debate and this report both clearly demonstrate, fundamental rights unfortunately continue to be violated in the EU.
I feel, however, that for Members of this House, who are soon to go before the electorate in elections that are especially important for the EUâs future, it is worth recalling that the extraordinarygains of the past five years in the area of human rights are something to be proud of and may, indeed, encourage the citizens to take part in the electoral process, given the prospects for establishing a European policy on fundamental rights.
The Convention that approved the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Parliamentâs annual role in identifying problems in fundamental rights â sometimes a highly ideological debate, but certainly always a topical one â the amendment of Article 7 of the Treaty of Nice, the fact that a Fundamental Rights Agency has been established and, as the President-in-Office of the Council Mr Roche has just said, the prospect of giving the Charter of Fundamental Rights a central role in the draft Constitutional Treaty, constitute, in my view, a range of aspects that will show the citizens that this body, which they elect directly, has always placed the issue of fundamental rights at the forefront of political debate and activity.
My second observation concerns the references made to asylum policy.
We cannot hide the fact that Member States have differences that are sometimes difficult to surmount, and that sometimes the price we have to pay to get over these differences is an agreement based on the lowest common denominator.
We have always viewed such agreements as one part of a gradual definition of asylum policy and migration.
We cannot close our eyes to this, but let us not be defeatist.
Today, I must confess â and it pains me to say this â the day after the Council of Ministers finally adopted a directive defining the concept of refugee, aligning systems of subsidiary protection and recognising that non-State agents can be agents of persecution, in which case refugee status can also be granted; we welcome this directive, which contains excellent proposals in the area of international protection and is a major step forward in defining a European concept of asylum.
Let us, today at least, not be defeatist and let us recognise the positive elements of the steps that have been taken.
My third comment concerns the protection of privacy and fundamental rights in the war on terror.
We are not in the process of creating an Orwellian world.
It cannot be denied that we face a threat and in order to protect our open way of life we must prevent terrorism and protect our citizens.
To this end, we must make use of the technology that proves to be the most appropriate.
We must not tilt at windmills, nor must we fight technology merely for the sake of it.
What we must do is ensure that this technology is used in accordance with the law and the required safeguards as regards privacy and guarantees of fundamental rights.
This is the challenge facing us, and Parliament must, accordingly, be involved in defining the legal rules governing the introduction of biometric data on passports and visas, and of data cross-checking in the area of security.
Lastly, the key frame of reference of the policy of protecting fundamental rights in the EU is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but is not solely confined to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We do not wish to be cut off from the general development of the protection of fundamental rights across Europe as a whole, notably in the scope of the Council.
There is, therefore, no conflict between conferring constitutional status on the EUâs Charter of Fundamental Rights and at the same time advocating that the EU should join the European Convention on Human Rights.
The future European Constitution points in this direction.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the World Bank Extractive Industries Review.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is an interesting debate, because we are discussing a report of the World Bank.
The Extractive Industries Review launched by the World Bank Group in 2001 will guide the Bankâs involvement in the oil, gas and mining sectors.
The consultative process is a significant element of the Groupâs overall review of its activities in this area.
It is important to note that the result of this initiative â in the form of the comprehensive consultation report produced by the review team, led by Dr Salim â is being examined by the World Bank, and its response to that review is awaited.
So in a sense, we are discussing something that is a work in progress.
The process must be allowed to take its course in view of the significant recommendations in the review.
The importance of protecting and managing the resource base of economic and social development was reaffirmed by Heads of State and Government at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002.
Raw materials, such as minerals and petroleum, provide the foundations for economic growth and well-being, both in industry and in our everyday lives.
They are essential in manufacturing, transport, heating and other activities and, most important of all, they are essential in the countries in which the extractive activity takes place.
While mineral extraction makes a substantial contribution to economic development, the benefits must be balanced by measures to foster the environmental and social pillars of sustainable development through good governance.
This is the area most Members will probably be concerned about, because good governance has not always been present.
In recognition of the need to balance these demands, actions were agreed in relation to managing the natural resource base in a sustainable and integrated manner.
The World Bank is not alone in recognising the need to address all elements of sustainable development.
In many ways this review parallels work carried out by the European Union in recent years, such as strengthening the governance of mining through, for example, amendment of the Seveso Directive and a proposed new directive on the management of extractive industry waste â an issue that is of concern right across the Union.
The European Union is also taking forward policy on sustainable development through initiatives such as the planned Thematic Strategy on Sustainable Use of Natural Resources.
At its meeting on 2 March, the Council of Environment Ministers gave broad policy orientations in relation to the future development of the Thematic Strategy.
The Extractive Industry Review recognises the potential contribution of mining and petroleum to the World Bankâs primary mandate â i.e. the alleviation of poverty â and proposes a considerable number of measures in this regard.
They merit some detailed consideration.
I note also that the World Bank has endorsed the Transparency Initiative launched at the Johannesburg Summit.
This is a particularly important initiative.
This, again, is a complex issue and there is a need for greater clarity on how taxes and royalties for such operations are distributed.
I should also say that there is probably a need to consider whether they are properly or appropriately distributed â but that is for another time.
Detailed environmental protection measures in the Extractive Industries Review include proposals such as closure planning and guidelines on tailings management in extractive industries.
In many ways these reflect concerns that we are also addressing.
The European Union guidance note on best available techniques for mining wastes is very advanced and will set out best practice in this area.
Many local factors, such as climatic conditions, determine the most appropriate ways to mitigate potential adverse impacts.
Nevertheless, our work in Europe will make a useful contribution to better environmental practice and standards in managing mining waste, as well as the Cyanide Code of Practice developed by the UNEP through multi-stakeholder consultation and participation.
We support the conclusions of the Johannesburg Summit and the Plan of Implementation, including the specific commitments in relation to the mining, minerals, metals and energy sectors.
We also support the promotion of corporate responsibility and accountability, and the exchange of best practices in the context of sustainable development.
Our position on these issues is clear and, I expect, well known to all interests, including the World Bank.
Nonetheless, our interests and concerns in those areas are worth underlining and restating.
Climate change remains one of the most significant environmental concerns for the Union.
The Union remains fully committed, for example, to delivering on the Kyoto Protocol target.
As parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and ratifiers of the Kyoto Protocol, the European Community and its Member States are eager to ensure that the activities of the World Bank are in harmony with the European Unionâs objective of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere at safe levels.
According to the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global emissions of greenhouse gases will need to be drastically cut over the rest of this century if this goal is to be achieved.
The recommendations of the Extractive Industries Review in this regard are consistent with a recognised need to move to less carbon-intensive sources of energy.
The promotion of cleaner and less greenhouse-gas-emitting energy sources in developing countries, with a particular focus on the promotion of renewable sources of energy, are in keeping with meeting the objectives of the EUâs long-term climate change objectives.
In conclusion, we look forward to the response of the World Bank to this review.
As I said, the response is still forthcoming.
We welcome the wide-ranging and transparent nature of the consultation involved in this process and appreciate that the work now under way by the Bank is well informed by Dr Salim's report.
The European Unionâs progressive approach to sustainable development is well known, and we also anticipate a response from the World Bank that will be consistent with its overall mission, in particular in poverty reduction and the promotion of sustainable development.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Extractive Industries Review, commissioned by the World Bank, is an important report and its recommendations should be carefully examined by the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Commission.
The Commission is a grant donor focusing on poverty alleviation.
Extractive industry support within the European Community development programme has virtually ceased.
The specific instrument in the mining sector, Sysmin, was discontinued under the Cotonou Agreement.
Under the Ninth European Development Fund, any programmes in the mining sector have been defined by partner countries themselves, in line with the ownership concept.
Less than six percent of funds have been allocated to mining activities in national indicative programmes.
In addition, increasing environmental concerns within the European Union have led to the generalisation of the use of environmental impact assessments since the 1990s.
This also applies to cooperation with financial institutions such as the European Investment Bank or the World Bank.
The OECD discusses guidelines for officially supported export credits.
It recently announced an agreement to strengthen common approaches for evaluating the environmental impact of infrastructure projects supported by the export credit agencies of OECD governments to ensure that they meet established international standards.
As Parliament is aware, the European Union launched an 'EU Energy Initiative for poverty eradication and sustainable development' at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002.
The initiativeâs secretariat is housed within the Commission.
It aims to respond to the very issues raised by Parliament, by contributing to providing the access to energy necessary for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
This objective will be achieved within the context of activities driven by participating developing countries, through the provision of adequate, affordable, sustainable energy services.
Although the initiative does not have a technology focus, it strives to promote the provision of affordable and sustainable energy services.
In doing so, it seeks to promote the choice of the most economic solutions on the basis of economic, social and environmental impacts.
This involves the promotion of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuel technologies.
The Commission also houses the secretariat of the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition.
This Coalition aims to enhance renewable energy deployment within developing countries.
Let me conclude by assuring you that the Commission supports the call for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Extractive Industries Review, which relate to the sustainability of investments, the promotion of good governance, popular consent, social and environmental impact assessment and the respect of human rights and core labour standards.
Â Â  Mr President, this is the second time today that we have discussed mining and quarrying.
This morning it was MrÂ SjÃ¶stedtâs report, and now it is this resolution that indirectly concerns the mining and quarrying industry.
I agree with both MrÂ Roche and Commissioner Vitorino that the energy, mining and quarrying industries are of great importance to the economies of many poor countries.
At the same time, however, we know that this type of industrial activity often takes a form that has not been of direct benefit to the poor majority, has often given rise to serious environmental damage and has also, unfortunately, resulted in the income from the concessions granted chiefly ending up in the pockets of various ministers rather than in the treasury, where it could have contributed to development in these countries.
The study to which we are referring here is interesting and important.
It points out the opportunities for these industries, and also the risk of the activity not taking place within a framework of social, environmental and human rights criteria.
The consequences often turn out to be an increase in poverty and the destruction of the environment.
We met DrÂ Salim a week or so ago when he was passing through.
He gave a large number of examples of difficulties for the local population in various project areas: forced displacements, environmental damage, and so on.
It is important that the World Bank bear in mind the criticism levelled by the study, and I note that both the Council President and the Commission agree with many of its recommendations.
It is very important that the EU Member States, the governments of which make up a large proportion of the Bankâs Board, coordinate their activities in this field and ensure that the Bank bears the recommendations in mind.
I think that the Presidency could play a very important role in this.
If it is now important that the World Bankreconsider matters, it is of course equally important that a number of other financial institutions also do so.
Commissioner Vitorino indicated that a certain amount of agreement has been reached on the activities of export credit agencies.
This may be so, but it is extremely flimsy at present.
We need much stricter criteria for their activities, above all with reference to the social, environmental and climate situations.
To give an example: between 1994 and 2000, the export credit agencies in our OECD countries guaranteed investments in new energy production equivalent to approximately USDÂ 100Â billion.
All of that activity was fossil-fuel based; not a single cent was spent on energy efficiency or renewable energy.
A number of measures are needed in this regard.
Without elevating this report and this study to absolute truths, they are nevertheless a good basis for pushing on and tightening up policy in connection with both poverty issues and sustainable development.
Â Â  âI do not for a moment doubt that sooner or later the economic war that Shell is waging in the Niger Delta will be exposed and that the crimes that have been committed in this war will be punished.â
Those, Mr President, were the words of Ogoni leader Ken Saro-Wiwa ten years ago.
In the West Saro-Wiwa is now, ten years on, still the best known critic of the extractive industries.
Shell has since changed parts of its policy for the better and the Extractive Industries Review is mainly concerned with projects of the national industries.
The present analysis of the extractive industries shows that much remains to be done before the World Bank can operate effectively in this sector.
The struggle of the Ogoni people in Nigeria is symbolic of one of the main conditions for World Bank participation, that is the guaranteeing of the right of the indigenous peoples, without coercion and properly informed, to assent in advance to projects that are funded by the World Bank.
For many developing countries raw materials are their primary source of income, but even if they have liquid or solid gold in their soil, the indigenous peoples of these countries see very little of the proceeds from it.
Poverty, a high mortality rate, civil war, corruption and totalitarianism frequently stand in the way of development in these countries.
Apart from the indigenous peoples, the environment also comes off second best to the rapid profits that raw materials bring.
It was the same Ken Saro-Wiwa who remarked that the fish in the Niger Delta taste of oil.
This is why it is of the utmost importance for the PSE Group that the European Council and the Commission discuss this report and set tough conditions for World Bank participations and extraction projects, so that they can only take place if the standard requirements in relation to the social, economic and ecological consequences of raw material extraction have been met.
Paramount must be that decisions on projects are subject to good governance requirements.
Only in this way can these raw material-rich countries develop as a whole.
This can also be done by supporting the publish-what-you-payinitiative, by which insight is provided into payments and income and the indigenous peoples have the guarantee that the proceeds do not simply disappear into the pockets of the rich, but actually benefit the indigenous peoples.
This can also be done by refusing to fund projects in conflict areas and finally this can be done by strengthening existing natural habitatpolicy and not investing in projects in protected wildlife areas, but investing positively in renewable energy sources.
Â Â  Mr President, following the UN report on the situation in the Congo and the US Government report on global warming, a report commissioned by the World Bank itself has now confirmed the fears that the Greens have been expressing for some time.
What has happened is that the World Bank set up a study on the extraction industries, which, after two years of consultation with public bodies, governments and business, has produced a report which is damning with regard to its development policy.
The report highlights the deficiencies and counter-productive effects of the World Bankâs policy in countries rich in natural resources.
In the words of the study itself, the World Bank has attracted too many investors, without taking any real interest in helping the countries to develop their abilities to convert their natural riches into means of combating poverty.
Similarly, the Commission has emphasised the lack of action on the part of the World Bank in terms of environmental and social supervision.
In this respect, the study states that, if the full force of the market is unleashed without any robust frameworks, the resultant damage may be extremely serious.
There are numerous examples of loathsome financing.
The Yanacocha gold mine in Peru is the prototype toxic tragedy.
Managed by an American company, the mine has flattened five mountains, displaced thousands of people and polluted with cyanide the water throughout the entire region.
The World Bank has also given its support to the Chad-Cameroon pipeline, which we were alone in combating, and which has had disastrous social and environmental consequences: massive migration, an increase in the unreliability of food supplies and an increase in prostitution, with a consequent increased prevalence of AIDS.
Can we really speak of a development policy?
The exploitation of oil, gas or mines is not necessarily the same thing as poverty reduction.
In countries still subject to a high degree of corruption, where the legal frameworks are still unreliable and democracy is uncertain, the World Bank unfortunately is doing nothing to encourage sustainable development.
On the contrary, in numerous countries, the extraction industries have been associated with violations of human rights and civil conflicts, as has been seen in Burma.
Even worse, more than 80% of the World Bankâs oil financing is actually going to the North and not to poor countries.
The consequence of this blind and generous investment: countries with disappointing results outnumber the countries making substantial progress.
The Greens, in line with the studyâs recommendations, are advocating a moratorium on the financing of oil projects until 2008, the cessation of financing for coalmines in order to combat greenhouse gases, the encouragement of clean and renewable energy along with energy efficiency.
The European Union has a major role to play here in demanding, through the Member States, that the World Bank should take account of the studyâs recommendations.
The World Bank has been on the wrong track for too long and it is time for it to change course so that development policy can at last benefit those most in need.
Â Â  Mr President, we did not ask for this debate simply in order to tell the World Bank what it should do.
We also need to know the position of the Council, in which 15 Member States â all playing a very important role in World Bank decision-making â are represented.
We want to ask the Council what position it is going to take on this extractive industry report and whether or not it intends to coordinate the position of the Member States in this respect.
In the Mr Roche's interesting remarks I did not hear the answer to this question; the very reason we asked for this debate.
We are convinced that we must have parliamentary scrutiny of what the World Bank does, and also that we, as a European Union institution, need to know what our Member States do when they are in the World Bank.
So the World Bank is not something outside this institution or outside your institution, Mr Roche.
Mr Vitorino said very clearly that he thought, and that the Commission thought, that the most important recommendation had to be supported.
I repeat: I would like to know what the position of the Council is, if any, and if there is any intention of having any kind of discussion on this point.
We think that discussion of this issue in the Council is absolutely crucial for two reasons.
Firstly, because the conclusions of the report say very clearly that investing in the oil, mining and gas sectors does not in itself reduce poverty.
Sometimes, as you heard in the report, it is detrimental, and this is also of importance to the European Union.
Secondly, we are convinced that if the World Bank's objective is to reduce poverty and alleviate the exclusion of indigenous populations and poor people, we cannot continue to support a method of financing a project that is detrimental from this point of view.
So please, Mr Roche, tell us what you are going to do.
Â Â  Mr President, as the end of the parliamentary term approaches, we should be very civil to one another, and I note that debating the issue of the World Bank report is a very good initiative.
We are also aware that we have an expert in our midst, as MrsÂ Frassoni is a member of the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank.
It is quite right, therefore, that we should discuss this issue and endeavour to coordinate the approaches of the EU Member States.
Speaking of the World Bank in general terms, it unfortunately appears that, in some respects, it has the worst record when it comes to the management of development projects.
When I was in Niger around a month ago, all the parties in Niger had put their work on the Education For All plan in order; except the World Bank.
Its management is so concentrated that it does not work.
I hope that MrsÂ Frassoni will be able to address this matter, too, as part of her work with the other members of the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank.
We know that the World Bank has experience in this area, as it said long ago that it is access to resources of this kind that leads to increased conflicts.
We must take its recommendations seriously, therefore.
They must serve as a guide in our grants for projects and our decisions on various nations and the degree to which we choose to help them.
Â Â  . Mr President, it was a short but very interesting debate.
I would like to say at the outset that I did not mean to disappoint Mrs Frassoni, but I did make in my own contribution a number of points relating to measures that have been taken.
However, I accept the point she made regarding the World Bank not being something from which we are disconnected as absolutely valid.
Indeed, Mr Wijkman commented on the protection of vulnerable countries and communities and in particular protection where the temptations of corruption are huge.
Of course this is true, and as regards good governance, the World Bank has a responsibility to ensure that.
We know from the cases cited here what is happening.
We know of the environmental degradation suffered particularly by powerless indigenous peoples.
Mr van den Berg also spoke very dramatically about what he described as the silent and hidden ecological war, and another Member made a point about gold mining and the degradation it has caused.
In fact it is quite correct.
These matters should be of concern to the World Bank and to the international community.
Mr van den Berg rightly spoke of the need to balance development on the one hand with the rights of indigenous peoples and, equally important, the need to ensure that monies from exploitive and extractive industries are dedicated to the service of the peoples of the region, a point touched on also by Mr Rod.
I would like to make the point that this is a relatively new area of concern to the Council, but the Council is ensuring that the European Union continues to play a role in global fora as a leading partner in favour of sustainable development.
That is the most important point, and sustainable development is the term that covers all of these issues ranging from the impact on, for example, indigenous peoples to the impact of environmental degradation and it also includes the disappearance of the yields of this development through corruption.
At the meeting of 2 March, the Council reiterated that the implementation of the commitments to the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development must continue to have the highest priority and to be integrated into all relevant internal and external policies of the European Union.
I take that point as relating specifically to Mrs Frassoni's point.
The Council expects that all Member States will defend these common views in all international fora, including the World Bank.
If I disappointed you in my earlier contribution, I hope I have made up for it now!
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on international organ trafficking.
I give the floor to Minister Roche, on behalf of the Council.
Â Â  . Sorry, Mr President, I was a little distracted â Mrs Frassoni was flirting with me there.
It just goes to show that on occasions the European Parliament can be a much more pleasant place to be than DÃ¡il Ãireann; I have not had that experience before!
We now turn from humour to something quite horrific â the modern equivalent of Burke and Hare, namely the trafficking in human organs.
As medical science has progressed in the area of organ transplantation there is a growing demand for organs, with a resulting problem in trafficking in human organs.
This is an appalling and disgusting practice and is a serious violation of human dignity and physical integrity.
It also has serious implications for the combating of organised crime, because as in everything else, organised crime has managed to get into this particular area.
We know of the involvement of criminal gangs in this quite extraordinary activity.
I am aware that this has been an issue of concern and debate in Parliament.
In fact, I commend Parliament because it has been very much to the fore in condemnation of this practice.
It is also an issue of concern to the Council and it is important that in addressing this we do so properly and are clear on the scope of the problem.
This is a complex and multi-dimensional issue and requires careful consideration.
A proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the prevention and control of trafficking in human organs and tissues was presented by the Greek presidency in February 2003, in the framework of the Justice and Home Affairs Council.
The aim of the proposal is to contribute to combating trafficking in human organs and tissues as a form of organised crime.
The draft Framework Decision contains proposals to require Member States to ensure that the removal of an organ from a donor using force, threats or fraud, or the removal of an organ from a donor who has consented because of payment, become criminal offences.
Also included as offences are the recruitment, transportation or harbouring of a person where use is made of force or threats or where payment is made for the removal of an organ or tissue.
It also proposes that participation by medical or nursing staff in the transplantation of an organ in the knowledge that it has been acquired by any of these means will be a criminal offence.
The proposition in the framework document will be quite wide.
The proposal has been discussed on a number of occasions by relevant Council bodies.
Several Member States questioned the need for an instrument at this time.
It has also transpired that Member States have no precise information on the scale of the problem, within the European Union or involving it as a destination.
In this regard, the findings of the Falcone project, which includes a 13 Member State study of the matter, will be of interest.
The Irish presidency will continue to monitor Member Statesâ views on the usefulness of a measure such as this at the level of the EU with a view to establishing whether progress might be made in respect of such a measure.
Turning to the related issue of the legal use of organs for transplantation, very specific issues arise because of the shortage of organs.
There is a need to ensure high standards of quality and safety.
The Commission has indicated that it will conduct a thorough scientific evaluation regarding the situation of organ transplantation.
It will present the conclusions of this evaluation as soon as possible and we look forward to receipt of that report.
I can summarise by saying that at this stage we are very much at the beginning of a process which may well take a long time to reach any form of finality.
But the fact that we are debating it is an indication that there is an awareness and a concern about the issue.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission welcomes the debate here today on a problem that gives rise to serious concern, that of trafficking in human organs.
The victims of this type of crime are particularly vulnerable human beings, in particular children.
Illicit trafficking in organs can lead to significant health risks for both the donor and the recipient.
Trafficking in human organs is an obscene violation of the right to physical integrity and, in the most tragic circumstances, of the right to life, as recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
The Commission has recently been increasingly informed about alleged situations of illicit trafficking in human organs in Mozambique and Albania, not least through written questions recently addressed by MrÂ Ribeiro e Castro and Mrs Karamanou.
It has also been alerted by increasing rumours in the media.
These alleged situations of trafficking are particularly worrying and the Commission is following them very closely, through the Commission's delegation in the regions concerned and in close dialogue with Member States locally, in particular in the context of the political dialogue with these countries.
In relation to the situation in Mozambique, the Commission has contacted the Office of the Attorney General, who has assured it that investigations are under way.
The Commission also reinforced its concern at a meeting in Brussels with the Ambassador of Mozambique.
The reality shows that trafficking in human organs tends to move from the south to the north and from the poor to the rich, not excluding, however, movements within a particular region.
Regional and international cooperation are essential to tackle this phenomenon successfully.
The criminals in this type of activity benefit from the weaknesses of local police, often undermined by corruption, which therefore does not prevent the transboundary illicit trade in organs; as well as from inefficient judicial systems.
It is worth mentioning that the Commission has been emphasising how important it is for Albania to take the necessary steps to conclude an agreement with Europol.
Albania, as I mentioned earlier, is one of the countries alleged to be the scene of activities of trafficking in children's organs, whose destination is, allegedly, the European Union.
In order to prevent the entry into the European Union of human organs resulting from illicit trafficking, the measures taken to improve cooperation between Member States' police services and customs administrations and to strengthen external border controls are of great value.
However, specific measures directed at this type of crime seem currently to be inadequate.
It was in this spirit that Greece, during its presidency of the Union, presented an initiative for the adoption by the Council of a framework decision concerning the prevention and control of trafficking in human organs and tissues.
The aim of this initiative â as already mentioned by the presidency â was to define which types of conduct should be punishable in all Member States and to establish minimum rules relating to the penalties for such offences.
The Commission was largely supportive of this initiative, while recognising, however, that more in-depth legal and factual examination and knowledge of the situation in the Member States was necessary.
In this context, and in view of the weaknesses detected when trying to move forward the Greek initiative, it is important to mention that Europol's competences were extended in January 2002 to include illicit trade in human organs and tissues.
Europol is currently studying this phenomenon and collecting relevant information and data concerning the legal and illegal aspects of trafficking in human organs.
Europol can indeed have a great added value in this common fight.
As far as the collection of information is concerned, I should also refer to the fact that the Council of Europe has recently looked at the issue of trafficking in human organs and that it produced a report in December 2003 that provides a useful insight into the current situation in Europe regarding this phenomenon.
Under the Commission's AGIS financial programme for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, it is also possible to support projects in this particularly delicate area of criminality, which has still not been fully examined.
In addition it is important to stress that the Commission recognises that the severe shortage of organ donors remains a major obstacle to preventing the full development of transplant services and imposes a severe limit on the number of patients who are able to benefit from this form of therapy.
This shortage of organs can encourage illicit trade.
The Commission is fully aware of the consequences resulting from the shortage of organs and, for that reason, it has indicated as a priority action in its work plan for 2004 for the implementation of the programme on Community action in the field of public health 2003-2008, the development of a strategy for the European Union in order to raise awareness and increase availability of organs used for transplantation.
Indeed, the Commission has already conducted a survey of the current practices and legal requirements related to organ transplantation in the Member States and the acceding countries and is in the process of analysing the results.
This analysis will be communicated to the European Parliament, as well as to the Member States, as soon as it is concluded.
In conclusion, a number of initiatives have been launched to combat illicit trafficking in human organs and the Commission will continue to support such initiatives as are appropriate in order to combat this unacceptable trade.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, trafficking in human beings is one of the most sickening manifestations of the growing phenomenon of international crime, and the trafficking of children is more sickening still.
The trafficking of children in order to remove organs is the most gruesome part of this immoral and repulsive business.
From the point of view of ethics, I have no interest in discussing the reasons behind this criminal activity, whether it be for reasons of witchcraft, organ trafficking or whatever.
There are human beings who need our support and our protection, people who lose organs or even their lives as a result of this practice.
Information has recently come to light on the continued practice of this type of criminal activity in Mozambique, which is, of course, cause for great concern.
In addition to the human dimension of these events, we Portuguese have linguistic and cultural ties with that country.
I therefore welcome both this debate and the one that took place yesterday in the Portuguese Parliament, on the initiative of Mrs Morais, a Member of the Portuguese Parliament.
I was also pleased to see that the Prime Minister of Portugal, Dr DurÃ£o Barroso, raised the matter with the Mozambican President during his ongoing State visit to the country.
I should like to make three points on the matter.
Firstly, we must combat this crime wherever it occurs.
I do not believe we can take any other stance.
Trafficking in human beings and, especially, children for removing organs, is a despicable trade that must be combated and is one of the worst manifestations of the growing phenomenon of international crime.
All specialists agree that most organised networks are international; like other types of crime, this goes beyond national borders.
If we are to tackle crime effectively, to identify criminals and to protect victims, international cooperation must be strengthened.
This brings us to my second point.
We must not feel embarrassed at our level of development.
I have read that the reluctance on the part of some countries to recognise that this type of criminality goes on in their territory is down to the narrow-minded notion that it only happens in developing countries.
The truth of the matter is that this type of appalling activity occurs everywhere, given that it is a crime to buy, just as it is to sell, human organs and that there are fewer and fewer borders in international crime.
On 23Â October last year, in this House, we debated a proposal for a framework decision on promoting the fight against trafficking in human organs and tissues, to which both the President-in-Office of the Council and Mr Vitorino referred.
At the time, I expressed our concern at the emergence of this phenomenon, and mentioned the alarming number of abductions in Brazil and Guatemala, as well as similarly worrying news from accession countries such as Hungary and the Czech Republic.
I called for an integrated Community approach and for the definition both of offences in the trafficking of human organs and tissues and their respective penalties to be harmonised.
Thirdly and lastly, we must not be afraid to help.
We have an obligation to help, both on behalf of the humanitarian causes to which we subscribe, and in the interests â which must be common interests â of putting a stop to this unholy trade and of dismantling the existing international networks.
We therefore say clearly to the Commission and to the Council that we have a duty to help.
We note the statement on the matter made by Commissioner Nielson at the time, to the effect that our help had not been requested, thus far, by the Mozambican authorities.
We would therefore like to say to the governments, to the judiciary and to the police forces of the countries concerned that there is nothing to fear from international help to combat these crimes.
In so doing we are not diluting, but strengthening the instruments and resources to combat this common evil.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are pleased to see that the question that we raised on the trafficking of human beings and children in Mozambique has sparked a broader debate on the illegal trafficking of human organs and tissues, not only in the EU, but on an altogether wider scale.
There is, indeed, nothing more abominable than tampering with the human form â which should be a finished article in itself and whose integrity and dignity must be protected â and turning it into an object in which you can look for an organ to transplant into another person.
This practice is so gruesome that the EU should be duly alarmed and we â that is, Parliament, the Commission and the Council â must do all we can to provide ourselves with the means to stop such trafficking from proliferating any further, from becoming any bigger and from making a few unscrupulous people and their criminal networks any richer.
I should like to speak about Mozambique.
In Mozambique, mystery surrounds Nampula Province.
Child trafficking has taken place there; fifty children are known to have disappeared, probably abducted and sacrificed, be this for the purposes of removing organs for witchcraft, magic rituals or satanic rituals, of sex slavery, or of removing organs to sell them on some international network.
Mystery surrounds the existence or otherwise in Mozambique of an international child-trafficking network for obtaining organs.
The Mozambican church says that the suspicions are well-founded and that there is a fear that the network is indeed functioning.
The Mozambican authorities have made contradictory statements on the matter, which range from statements, designed to allay peopleâs fears, that there is no proof that such trafficking takes place, to suggestions that there are indeed signs that the network exists.
I should therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, Mr President, to call on the Mozambican authorities to clarify the matter.
The matter needs to be clarified, and the people of Nampula, and the children of Nampula, and Mozambique as a whole, need to be helped, so that they can live in peace.
Â Â  â Madam President, the chilling reports arriving from Mozambique, particularly the Nampula area, where the inexplicable disappearance of children hides an obscene trade in human organs, might seem unbelievable because they are so repugnant to any human being.
Unfortunately, however, even the Holocaust could seem unbelievable, and yet it happened without disturbing the sleep of those who must have had the means to know or intervene and yet did not do so.
After such a terrible experience, we must make a commitment today to stop this obscene trade with all the means that the international community has at its disposal.
We must raise our voices as individuals and Members of this Parliament against those who connive or do not oppose it with sufficient determination and in favour of those who risk or even lose their lives to denounce and try to stop this modern massacre of the innocents.
It is the members of civil and political society and not only religious society who should take charge of this problem.
Questions have already been asked, but they are not enough.
All the prominent people in this world who share the ability to influence the destiny of so many have the ethical responsibility to take practical, urgent steps to guarantee the safety of children and the people who protect them.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the trafficking of human organs is the new piracy of modern times, which is a particularly sordid and brutal form of piracy.
It can lead to persecution, abduction and even murder.
At its root is greed, and it knows no scruples.
Combating this phenomenon must be firm, far-reaching and unflinching.
Not all cases are the same.
There are cases in which the authorities turn a blind eye to the trade in organs, whereby a person can sell, say, their own kidney for a fistful of dollars.
Even in such cases, freedom is illusory and the reality is still a sordid form of piracy that exploits the helplessness of the poor, wretched donors.
Quite apart from the violence of this unholy trade, which violates human dignity and integrity, it also supports a gruesome market and stimulates highly dangerous criminal activity and the development of international mafia networks.
As this gruesome market is allowed to operate, when insufficient numbers of organs appear for sale, the criminals then, in cold blood, bridge the gap in supply by abducting, or even killing people.
The principle of free organ donation for transplants is one of the fundamental principles of civilisation, and a fundamental requirement of peopleâs dignity and of our security and freedom.
Where organ donation is not free, we are all, in theory, potential victims of this all-out assault on the human body.
The EU must apply the principle of free donation across its territory, must make strenuous efforts to enshrine it in law and must ensure that it is complied with throughout the world.
Where organ donation is not free, the threat of crime may rear its head or the criminals may already be operating.
The EU must also take the lead in combating this modern scourge at international level, since it is one of the most gruesome manifestations of international crime in modern times.
The framework decision proposed by the Greek Presidency must be approved without delay, in order to ensure that all Member States can eradicate this trafficking, as suppliers, as receivers or as a field of operation.
We must react promptly and effectively whenever and wherever in the world such crime comes to light.
Recent attention has focused on certain regions of Mozambique, in East Africa.
The facts of the case have yet to be clarified, yet we must, for this very reason, continue to take action until there is complete transparency and until peopleâs minds can be put at rest.
We must respond in kind to the courage and tenacity of religious bodies and human rights activists in bringing attention to dozens of unexplained disappearances of children and young people, some of whom have since been found dead, their bodies mutilated.
We must not allow ourselves to demur on action because of any misplaced concerns, or because of a lack of total transparency.
It is possible that in Nampula there has been not one but many tragic events, possibly involving the trafficking of human beings and children, or the trafficking of organs for witchcraft or other non-medical uses and the trafficking of human organs to support international networks.
We do not know, yet we cannot tire in our efforts merely because we are not in possession of the full facts.
We must work ceaselessly to combat what is, in all its forms, a despicable crime.
Those authorities faced with such terrible crimes sometimes appear to be embarrassed; they begin to contradict themselves or appear hesitant when cases come to light.
Nobody likes to see the name of their country associated internationally with this situation.
We must understand this and must always treat any country involved with respect.
This is precisely, however, why we must put across, with patience and perseverance, the notion that it is not the embarrassment that is the problem; the problem is the trafficking and the crime.
Everyone, throughout the world, must collaborate in investigating and combating this perfidious piracy, which has no country of origin.
The threat is international and affects every one of us.
Whether it be Israel or South Africa, on the Asian, European or American continents, whether it has its origins in Mozambique or in the poorer regions of Brazil, in Moldova or Albania, in the fragmented Balkans, in the vastness of Africa, in depressed Central Asia or in the poorest outskirts of Asian or Latin American cities, we know where this trafficking is going to attack.
Like a vulture, this all-out assault on the human body seeks out regions of human poverty, and places where the Stateâs authority is weak.
It preys on areas where people and communities are at their weakest; it senses the weakest and poorest members of society and attacks them.
These are the areas where we must act, in cooperation with the competent authorities, in order to raise awareness, to offer encouragement and practical help, to process and exchange information, to prise out the whole truth, to put peopleâs minds at ease and to dismantle the networks, wherever they may appear.
The Commission and the Council must work hard and I should like to see the Council act with the same level of diligence that the Commission has already shown here, whether cases appear in Mozambique or in any other part of the world.
Â Â  Madam President, I have been listening to this debate, especially to Minister Roche, and it has been something of a surreal experience.
I have been increasingly puzzled as it has gone on.
Mr Roche, you concluded your remarks by saying that this process was at its beginning.
This rather begs the question: what is the coordination between the presidencies of the European Union?
You referred to the framework document produced, in February 2003, by the Greek Government, because it was a Greek initiative.
I was the rapporteur for this Parliament on the framework document, and the Greek Government was very anxious to get it through during its presidency in the first half of last year.
The process is far from its beginning; in fact, this time last year we were hoping it was near its end.
Some governments â perhaps the Italians, the Irish, and certainly some of the Scandinavian ones â were putting a spanner in the works and stalling on this.
My report was adopted by 420 votes to nil in the European Parliament.
Are you aware of that report on trafficking in human organs?
Have you read it?
Mr Coelho referred to it earlier on.
Certainly, my report would answer some of the problems that you raised.
I could tell you a great deal about this situation â over 1000 European Union citizens a year, allegedly, going to poorer countries in the world to seek human organs, whether it be India, Pakistan, Albania or some of the other countries that have been referred to.
There is much information already in the market; we are not starting from scratch.
What chance is there of real progress?
Indeed, what point is there in this debate?
What is the research that has gone into your statement, if you have not taken account of all that has gone through this Parliament already, if you have not read in depth the work that has been done and the reports that have gone through this Parliament, in consultation with the Commission and other governments?
The danger is that all the good work and good intentions that colleagues have spoken about here will come to nothing if presidency after presidency does not build on what has happened already.
Â Â  . Madam President, we have had an interesting debate.
There is not any point in trying to turn a debate in which there has been no disagreement into an adversarial matter.
I referred to the point that was made in an excellent contribution in the documents that there is still a lot of information needed in this area.
I do not disagree that excellent work commenced during the Greek presidency.
My personal view is that it is a pity that more concrete steps have not been taken to date.
It is an astonishing debate.
Commissioner Vitorino rightly cited a concern about this particular trade that would exist in any civilised community.
He outlined in considerable detail the efforts that have been made.
I was very impressed by Mr Coelho, who demonstrated the need for the Union to act in a coherent way to address a policy.
Mr Lage and Mr CalÃ² made similar points.
I agree with the point made by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, when he suggested that we should not allow ourselves to demur on action because of any misplaced concerns.
At the end of the day, the reality is that the Union has not progressed in this matter.
It was introduced and put before the Union by the Greek presidency.
There are reasons why it did not progress any further.
I am not quite certain that any Member States put 'spanners in the works'.
If they did, I am sure they may have done so because they felt that there were good and cogent reasons for doing so.
Nonetheless, with the exception of that final fractious point, this was a good debate.
It has helped to highlight the need for concerted Union action.
It illustrates how, if the Union were to act in a concerted manner, it could bring to an end what is clearly an evil trade.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to reiterate that the Commission will continue to monitor closely the cases that have been mentioned, relating to Mozambique and Albania, and to remain vigilant, in close cooperation with the embassies of Member States in both of those countries.
Secondly, I must point out that, from a legal point of view, Greeceâs initiative during its presidency raises certain questions that require political debate.
Our studies have shown that, in fact, the illegal trafficking of organs has not been criminalised in all Member States.
The information at our disposal shows significant discrepancies in the appropriate classification of offences.
Thirdly, there is a certain complexity as regards the enforcement of criminal measures, given that, as we know, the beneficiaries of the transplants of illicitly obtained organs are, more often than not, European, although those transplants are carried out in third countries, which raises the question of criminal punishment based on the principle of the national territory in which the criminal act was committed.
Consequently, these questions were raised during the presentation and the first debate of the Greek initiative for a framework decision applicable to the illegal trafficking of organs, and a study was carried out within the scope of the Falcone Programme, in order to identify what exactly were the fundamental questions that required legislative treatment at European level.
As you are aware, and as I have just mentioned, this was not a Commission initiative, and in some ways, the crux of this debate is the lack of continuity of Member Statesâ initiatives, which enjoy a certain momentum when the country concerned holds the presidency, but which have no guarantee of continuity thereafter.
For our part, we have put together this study and today we are better equipped to identify, more comprehensively than the Greek initiative was able to, the key areas that must be the subject of any legislative intervention in this area.
Â Â  âThank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0060/2004) by MrsÂ MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the protocol amending the fourth protocol laying down the fishery conditions included in the agreement on fisheries between the European Economic Community, on the one hand, and the Danish Government and the Local Government of Greenland, on the other.
Â Â  . Madam President, with regard to this Fisheries Agreement with Greenland, perhaps the first thing we should remember is that it is the second most expensive agreement signed by the European Union, after the Agreement with Mauritania.
Furthermore, there is a difference between the two agreements I have mentioned, which we call the difference between the ânorthern agreementsâ and the âsouthern agreementsâ.
The northern agreements have a whole series of characteristics, which I will explain during my speech, which differentiate them from the southern agreements.
A lot has been said about this Fisheries Agreement with Greenland, all kinds of things have been said and almost all of it is true.
For example, the Court of Auditors emphasised that the Fisheries Agreement with Greenland did not respect certain basic budgetary rules, fishing opportunities, for example.
Of the EUR 42.8Â million this agreement costs, just 28 were spent on fishing opportunities and furthermore this included paper fish, so called because they were fish that, although they were paid for, did not exist in Greenlandâs waters because they had disappeared long ago.
As well as the fact that the use of fishing quotas was very low and was far from achieving the value expected for fishing opportunities, only four Member States could and can fish within the framework of this Agreement: the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Denmark.
The other Member States were and continue to be excluded from these waters.
It should be pointed out that this exclusion and this non-use of fishing quotas paid for caused and continues to cause a series of distortions such as, for example, the case of certain Member States benefiting from the agreement having tried to re-sell unused quotas, because they are not of interest to the consumer market of that Member State, but they are of interest for consumption in other States.
In addition to this distortion (the attempt to re-sell something already paid for), there has been and there still is fishing of unused quotas by vessels flying the flags of those Member States, but which in reality are not from those Member States or any other Member State, but which are third-country vessels.
The fact is that there is a desire to acquire these unused quotas, or at least to begin fishing, though of an experimental nature, on the part of certain Member States which are not included as beneficiaries of this agreement or which were excluded â such as the Iberian fleets: the Spanish and the Portuguese â at the time of our accession to the European Community, despite the fact that we have been fishing in those waters for centuries.
The Commission recognised all these distortions in its document and proposed a mechanism according to which the Commission could temporarily transfer unused fishing opportunities to another Member State, only during that particular year and without prejudice to the allocation of quotas in future years.
We thought this was a good mechanism, above all because it was a trial mechanism and it would be possible to verify whether it worked or not as time passed.
However, in the Committee on Fisheries an amendment was approved, presented by nationals of certain Member States involved, to the effect that the Commission could establish consultation procedures between the Member States, but that it would be the States which had the quotas who could determine or decide on their distribution or allocation to other Member States which are not beneficiaries but which have an interest in fishing in that area.
I believe that, in reality, the central debate in relation to this issue is whether the Commission only plays a facilitating role or whether, since we are talking about a Community fisheries agreement, it must ensure the best possible level of use of fishing opportunities which, as I have said, have been acquired and paid for from Greenland by the Community, within the framework of this Fisheries Agreement.
I believe we are talking essentially not about national issues â because, in the fisheries agreements, in general â and those of us who are here are well aware of this â national issues are always very prevalent and they always cause many tensions â but about the principle of good financial management, the Gordian knot of this issue.
It is a question of defining this principle in relation to principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and ensuring compliance, by means of the monitoring of performance indicators, which are established by activity and which furthermore are measurable, so that the results achieved can be observed.
I say this from the standpoint of somebody who has worked on this Agreement for a long time and who I believe has a thorough knowledge of it.
Furthermore, Greenland is entirely in favour of the approach I have just expressed here â in fact, it has already reached an agreement with the Commission â and I believe this would be a good signal for us to send to two Community fleets: to let them fish â not everything, but at least a bit â in those waters.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I should like to thank the Member for her report on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol modifying the Fourth Fisheries Protocol between the EU and Greenland.
I am happy to note that the Member supports this proposal.
The Greenland Protocol has been subject to serious criticism in the past.
I believe that the revised version of the Protocol is an important step in the right direction.
On the basis of the mandate given by the Council on 24 February 2003, the evaluation report done by the Commission services and the report of the European Parliament adopted on 2 September 2003, the Commission initialled the modified Fourth Protocol on 18 June 2003 in Athens.
I should like to highlight the main new elements,
A substantial adjustment of quotas has been carried out in order, among other things, to delete cod 'paper fish' and align the fishing possibilities with scientific advice: no more cod, redfish in Western waters or blue whiting; and, in the European Union fishing capacity, no more 'paper fish'.
Licence fees have been introduced in order to have burden-sharing between the Community and ship owners. This is in line with the reform of the common fisheries policy, aligns the agreement with other third-country agreements and, last but not least, gives the Commission the possibility of monitoring the fishing effort.
As a response to the lack of transparency, a budgetary support programme has been introduced, and the Greenland Home Rule Government has committed itself to performing a structural reform of its fisheries policies.
The Greenland authorities have committed themselves to restructuring their fisheries sector towards more privatisation and fewer subsidies.
They have also committed themselves to increasing substantially the budget of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources so that it can increase its scientific capacity.
Experimental fisheries are promoted and extended to cephalopods and clams.
If successful, this may be the answer both to the diversification needed in Greenland fisheries and to the new species to be included in the next European Community â Greenland agreement.
With regard to the problem of low utilisation of fishing possibilities and the waste of Community funds, the standard transfer clause making it possible for the Commission to reallocate under-utilised fishing possibilities to other non-quota older Member States has been introduced. This is in full respect of the principle of relative stability and Article 20(5) of the basic regulation.
This is a crucial new element which not only gives the Commission the means to ensure the sound financial management of Community funds and optimal use of tax-payers' money, but also brings the Greenland Agreement into line with other third-country agreements with financial compensation.
Â Â  â Madam President, the agreement with Greenland is important in several respects.
We have been told that it is and we can only agree.
Firstly, as regards catches and financial compensation it is one of the EUâs most important fisheries agreements ever.
Secondly, it is an excellent example of sustainability and balance in the waters of the North Atlantic.
Improvements have definitely been made.
Thirdly, it is also an expression of the special relationship between the former EC member Greenland and the Union.
I am not of course telling you anything new when I say that the European fisheries policy is a genuine Community policy, with all that entails.
There are Community legal bases and principles that are binding.
These include, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, the principle of relative stability which was confirmed only recently as part of the large-scale common fisheries policy reform.
I find it highly questionable and unhelpful to be seeking an amendment by the back door, as I see it, and to give way to sectional interests as seems to be the manifest intention of many here in this House on the Greenland question.
The EU fishing nations that are party to the Greenland agreement have committed themselves to sustainable and responsible fishing.
Otherwise, this agreement would never have come about.
They have been given quotas which they can use themselves and which they can exchange.
That cannot be changed.
We cannot now withdraw those quotas with coercive measures that impinge upon the Member Statesâ substantive rights.
Just imagine if a football team does not use its possibilities for substitution and for that reason is not allowed any substitutes in the next game but is allowed to field a team with twice the number of players.
In a word, it is absurd.
It cannot be justified by talking about supposedly economic and fair grounds.
We do not need imposed redistribution; what we need is partnership and cooperation.
Everyone involved has repeatedly assured us that they want to make the best possible use of quotas, and we believe them.
As we have seen, Germany, where I come from, has been exemplary in its cooperation in the past few years â I am pleased to be able to say that â and has transferred parts of its quotas for stocks that are in good condition to other Member States.
That is the way to have a sustainable fisheries policy.
For the future I am in favour of closer cooperation over quotas; that is something I can concede, but the Member Statesâ and Commissionâs powers must be preserved.
I also fully support an improved procedure for consultation between Member States over the exchange of quotas from agreements with third countries.
I also ask my fellow Members to support that.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the modification of the Fourth Protocol, laying down the conditions for fishing between the EU and Greenland, is a step in the right direction, as its guiding principles are truth, transparency and reciprocity.
As you say, Commissioner, we no longer have paper fish or virtual fish.
We can, accordingly, establish a relationship between the EUâs financial contributions and the fish that can actually be caught, because there are fish to be caught.
I therefore welcome this modification and Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramosâs report, which is appropriate and well structured.
The words in her intervention were similarly welcome, as they enabled us to focus on the central political issue at stake here.
I also welcome Commissioner Vitorinoâs intervention.
His knowledge of fisheries does not surprise me, given that his many talents allow him to speak about fisheries with a remarkable breadth of knowledge.
Here was me thinking that all he knew about fish was what he found on the plate ...
Seriously, though, I hope that Commissioner Vitorino can come and teach us about particle physics and molecular biology (); he has the talent and intelligence to do this.
Returning, however, to the political question raised by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, the removal of the Spanish and Portuguese from the Greenland fishing zones is both unjust and âanti-historicâ â now that âthe destiny of historyâ has gone out of fashion, please allow me to use the term âanti-historicâ.
If the Spanish and Portuguese were the first to discover fishing routes across the globe, then they must also have discovered the fisheries in Greenland, from where they have now been banned.
We now have the chance to rectify this injustice, and this opportunity to rectify injustice consists of allowing quotas not taken up by the States holding them to be used by Portugal and Spain.
This must not mean that these two countries must be subordinate to the authority of the countries holding the quotas.
This is not some kind of modern-day feudal law invented alongside the quotas that are assigned to one country, which later passes them on or not to the EU Member State that, within the scope of Community policy, wishes to use them.
I therefore wholeheartedly support the position of MrsÂ MiguÃ©lez Ramos that the European Union and the Commission can assign unused fishing quotas to countries wishing to use them, such as Portugal and Spain.
Â Â  Madam President, my Group welcomes some of the changes that have been made in this report insofar as a distinction is now being made between money for fishing rights and money for development.
This should be applied to all fisheries agreements and not just this one.
We feel that we need a clear separation with regard to what the money is there for.
In development, the money would go to surveillance and scientific analysis etc., and there should also be the possibility of an audit of how the money is spent.
There is a major vacuum here in that European taxpayers' money goes to fund these fisheries agreements without the possibility of looking to see how the money has been spent, particularly when it is in the area of development and surveillance.
We â and European citizens â would like to see guarantees that this is where this money is going, rather than taking it at face value.
In many cases I do not believe that we have a guarantee that the money has gone where we expect it to go.
Most of the access in this agreement is for northern countries, and in the Commission's proposal it says that this may be reallocated.
Members in the committee wanted the wording 'shall be reallocated'.
This idea that if it is not being used up then it has to be reallocated to other countries is a bad idea, as we need first of all to look and see how we can try to reduce capacity, and if it is not being utilised, there may be very good valid reasons.
For example, maybe there is not enough fish.
So why should we say that it should be reallocated regardless of the reasons for its not being utilised?
We should be trying to reduce fishing effort because we know that the oceans do not have the capacity to deal with the pressures that are being put on them by the fishing industry in the European Union and elsewhere.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I regret to have to begin my speech on this occasion without being able to congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
The MiguÃ©lez Ramos report, in the form it is being presented to plenary today, is worse than the Commissionâs proposal.
This is why we voted against it in committee, as did the rapporteur herself.
I sincerely believe that the Commissionâs proposal was good and sufficient, and I believe that it should have been accepted by a majority in the Committee on Fisheries, in which case it would not have been necessary to present amendments to Article 3, since, for the first time, the Commission was responding to a long battle by the PPE-DE Group in this European Parliament and by the Spanish Government for the same criteria to be applied to the Fisheries Agreement with Greenland as to the âsouthern agreementsâ and for there not to be fishing opportunities paid for but not used, thereby allowing the Commission directly to re-allocate these unused fishing opportunities to other Member States which request it.
Mr Vitorino, I would ask you to communicate to Commissioner Fischler that he should go ahead with his proposal, because it is reasonable, fair, equitable and in accordance with the principles of good governance, which the Court of Auditors called for so strongly, favouring the mutual interests of Greenland and the European Union, and, above all, it is a Europeanist proposal, since it protects the common European interest, unlike the current MiguÃ©lez Ramos report, which is anti-Community, since it prevents the Commission from directly defending the common interest of all the Member States in re-allocating unused quotas and obliges it to give in to the desire of certain States which do not use those quotas to negotiate bilaterally.
We therefore believe the report to be a step backwards and we will vote against it again if the new Amendment No 5 is not adopted, since it is better than the Amendment No 2 which appears in the current MiguÃ©lez Ramos report.
Â Â  Madam President, although I support the first four amendments, I reject Amendment NoÂ 5.
I believe that amendment was originally lost in committee but has been re-tabled.
My reason for rejecting the amendment is quite simply that it undermines the principle of relative stability.
That principle is at the heart of the Scottish and British position on fisheries policy and, I believe, that of other northern states.
Any measures which threaten this principle, or put it at risk, I cannot support.
The concept of relative stability is vital to the Scottish fleet, as it guarantees historical rights, and Amendment NoÂ 5 puts that at risk.
Amendment NoÂ 5 also transfers competence to the Commission over quota swaps, which, I believe, is against the basic CFP regulation.
Competence should rest with the Member State, allowing new entrants to existing fisheries, leading to pressures to reallocate currently guaranteed quota shares.
It also ignores the basic differences between southern fisheries agreements, where fishing licences are at stake, and northern agreements where quotas are at stake.
I find it interesting that some people want the Commission to have more responsibility over fisheries, yet when it comes to certain proposals over which the Commission has responsibility, they want to reject it outright.
Amendment NoÂ 5 is dangerous to northern fishing interests, it goes against the CFP regulation and risks reducing the amount of Greenland quotas that can be used in exchange for quotas for Norway on which the United Kingdom industry relies heavily.
I am sorry to disagree with the rapporteur on this occasion.
Â Â  Madam President, I note that Commissioner Fischler is unable to be with us here today.
I hope that is because he is extremely busy trying to remedy the problems that have been inflicted upon Scotland by the December Fisheries Council in Brussels.
On the subject of Greenland, I am sure that many Scots in fishing communities these days would look enviously towards Greenland because it is outwith the CFP.
However, while in Scotland we are still stuck with the CFP, it is absolutely essential that the founding principle of relative stability is not violated in any way whatsoever.
This report, and its proposal that quotas should be reallocated to different Member States, and reallocated by the Commission, is totally unacceptable.
It is a very dangerous precedent that could, and would, be used to undermine relative stability.
It is not helpful that in December 2002 the UK Government and the Scottish Labour and Liberal Government supported reform of the CFP giving equal access to waters and resources.
If Commissioner Fischler had been here I would have asked him to comment on how relative stability can live with equal access to waters and resources.
The two are not compatible, and I just hope that we can get out of the CFP before relative stability is reviewed or revoked.
Â Â  Madam President, I had better be careful what I say about Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, in case she now becomes the Fisheries Minister in Madrid; so I will be nice to her from now on.
We in the Committee on Fisheries recently had presentations from an eminent scientist, Dr Chris Reid from the Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation at Plymouth University.
He was explaining to the Committee on Fisheries that global warming, which has caused a rise in the temperature of the North Sea by a significant amount over the last 20 years, has driven the plankton on which the cod feed northwards.
It is not surprising, then, that we are witnessing a collapse in cod stocks in the North Sea which has led to the crisis that the Scottish fleet in particular is now confronting, and to the cod recovery plan that the Commission has implemented.
Nevertheless, when you look at the table of proposed fishing opportunities under the modified Fourth Protocol for the Greenland Agreement, you see a reduction in fishing opportunities; a dramatic reduction in cod for a start, which perhaps gives some question to the science on which Dr Chris Reid was informing our committee.
It at least indicates that in Greenland waters we do not have the vast abundance of fish that was once indicated.
The good thing about this modification to the Fourth Protocol is that at least now we have no paper fish: we are paying for genuine fishing opportunities.
We are relating the money that we pay from the European Union to the actual reality of the fishing opportunities that are there.
If such fishing opportunities exist, the people who most require to benefit from those opportunities are the beleaguered fleet operating at present in the North Sea.
For that reason regrettably I have to say, adding my voice and echoing what my colleagues have said this afternoon, that I agree that we cannot support Amendment No 5.
Not only does that undermine the principle of relative stability, as Mrs Stihler and MrÂ Hudghton have eloquently explained, but it would also transfer those potential fishing opportunities away from the North Sea fleet and give them to fishing fleets outwith the North Sea, which would not be acceptable to the fishermen in the UK.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramosâ good report on the modification of the protocol to the fisheries agreement with Greenland shows once again that justified criticisms can be made of its content and application.
These come not only from the rapporteur of the Committee on Fisheries, but also from the Committee on Budgets.
I agree with the rapporteur when she calls for the financial expenditure for this agreement to be adapted to the actual situation.
Her call for a general evaluation report and a cost-benefit analysis also has my full support.
Parliament has been calling for this for a long time for fisheries agreements with third countries.
I cannot, however, support the rapporteurâs call for the Commission to reallocate unused fishing opportunities to another Member State on request, even if that allocation were limited to just one fishing campaign.
In my opinion, this would have a very serious effect on the common fisheries policy principle of relative stability.
The possibility of transferring or exchanging allocated fishing quotas must continue to be a Member State competence.
After all, the sustainable use of fish stocks benefits from unused fishing opportunities.
If parts of allocated quotas go unused because of particular foreseeable circumstances, however, then bilateral contractual arrangements between the Member States are still the appropriate way of dealing with that.
The Commission may be allowed to intervene here in a regulatory capacity.
Anything more than that, however, would seriously undermine the basis of the common fisheries policy.
I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 2 but to vote against Amendment No 5 in tomorrowâs vote.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I wish to begin by making it clear that I have inherited my knowledge on this subject from my colleague, MrÂ Fischler, who, unfortunately, cannot be here today.
However, I will gladly take on board what has been said and try to address as far as possible the arguments put forward in this debate.
Firstly, I shall try to clarify the Commission's position concerning the amendments that have been tabled.
First of all on Amendment No 1: the financial compensation of the agreement is one single compensation, which corresponds to access to the waters, as well as compensation for the impact caused by the activity of European Union vessels in third-country waters.
The fact that the third country in the framework of a fisheries sector dialogue accepts to commit a part of the financial compensation to activities in support of a reform of its own fisheries policy, does not constitute an argument for a differentiation in two different financial envelopes.
The approach of differentiating financial compensation would result in the refusal of the third country to commit itself to reform its fisheries policy.
Therefore the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 1.
On Amendment No 2, which, to a certain extent â if I have understood you correctly â is connected with Amendment No 5, considering the fact that the Commission is responsible for the sound financial management of the Community funds, Amendment No 2 cannot be accepted.
Indeed, the budgetary authority must give the Commission the means and the legal basis to ensure the sound financial management of this agreement.
Despite some transfers made in 2003 by the quota-holding Member States, experience shows that these have not been sufficient to ensure the optimum utilisation of the fishing possibilities and thus sound financial management.
With respect to the argument put forward, how can we guarantee that the principle of relative stability and Article 20(5) of the basic regulation are adhered to?
I would like to underline that the temporary transfer of fishing possibilities from one Member State to another by the Commission is contrary to the principle of relative stability, because, in accordance with Article 20(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 on the allocation of fishing possibilities among Member States, such a transfer will not have an effect on the allocation of fishing possibilities between the Member States in Greenland waters in the future.
The allocation continues â and will continue â to be ruled, on the basis of the distribution keys, as before.
The Member States that benefit from a temporary transfer cannot exploit the catches made for the changing of the basis of the allocation for the future.
The determination of the fishing possibilities is made on the basis of scientific reports.
One innovation of this agreement is precisely that all quotas are now subject to an annual revision, if scientific advice so requests.
Also, I cannot accept the idea that with this mechanism we are creating a precedent.
The transfer clause exists and is implemented in all other third-country agreements with financial compensation, without any problem.
The only agreement that does not have this kind of article is precisely the Greenland agreement.
That is the situation we want to change now.
I want to say that in 2003 the commercial value of the catches, including the real catches of the transfers made to Norway, Iceland and the Faroes amounted to EUR 50Â million. Compared to the current financial compensation of EUR 42.82 million, this is not satisfactory.
In an agreement with financial compensation, it is unacceptable that the Commission does not have the means to ensure that Community funds are not wasted.
Having said that, the Commission welcomes the last amendment â Amendment No 5.
We are responsible for ensuring the sound financial management of Community funds.
Amendment No 5 shows the willingness of the budgetary authority to provide the Commission with the legal basis to ensure such a ground management without prejudice to relative stability, as I have said before.
On Amendment No 3, we agree with the spirit thereof, but we believe that the Commission already complies with the transmission of this kind of information in line with both the current interinstitutional arrangements and, in particular, with the framework agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament.
Therefore, Amendment No 3 is not necessary.
Finally, we cannot accept Amendment No 4.
I recall in this respect the established principle regarding the nature of a protocol to a fisheries agreement.
In light of the fact that this is an annex to the framework agreement, its periodic renewal does not require a new mandate.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  . In 2003, a new Protocol was agreed with Greenland, covering the period from 1Â January 2004 to 31Â December 2006, within the scope of the mid-term review of the Fourth Protocol, which lays down conditions provided for in the Fisheries Agreement between Greenland and the European Community.
This review introduces a range of adjustments, but does not alter the level of financial compensation, which remains at EUR 42Â 820Â 000 per year.
The review does, however, make a clearer distinction between amounts set aside to compensate fisheries possibilities and support for structural reform.
We welcome the increase in halibut quotas, which means that national fleets may now catch 800 tonnes of Greenland halibut.
It should be noted, however, that, at the time of the decision, Portugal was excluded from this agreement, despite its historical fishing rights in the area.
Given the extent to which quotas are under-used, we must ensure that the principle of good financial management is applied, in other words, that the fisheries possibilities offered by the international fisheries agreements are used effectively, without undermining the principle of relative stability.
The report and the Commission proposal open up the possibility of redistributing quotas that are not fully used in a given year.
We feel, however, that the wording of Amendment No 5 is more acceptable, and that this Amendment should, accordingly, be approved in plenary.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0211/2004) by MrÂ Schmitt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Kingdom of Spain with a view to the adoption of a Council directive on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for me the report before us today and this agenda item are among the most difficult of the past legislative period.
Not because the report is so wide ranging, but because the procedure has proved to be extremely difficult.
Since the Kingdom of Spainâs initiative to oblige carriers to communicate passenger data was presented, that is since the first document appeared early last year, every month has brought unofficial new versions with the promise of another official one shortly.
That dragged on really until the start of this year and since we are coming to the end of this legislative period, I presented a report at the beginning of February, based on the old proposal.
Then in the middle of February, the Council suddenly produced a new document as a result of which I then had to prepare a completely new report.
To the point in hand, my group agrees with the starting point of saying that it may make sense to oblige carriers to communicate data on persons entering the EU from third countries to the competent border control authorities in advance.
As presented, however, what the Council has produced is technically far from convincing.
It is true that the Council went on to correct itself in many respects.
Originally, for example, it wanted airlines to be obliged to report to the authorities anyone who failed to use their return ticket within 48 hours of the planned date.
That means that any of us could be suspected of staying somewhere we were not entitled simply because we had not used our ticket, at least not at the planned time.
On some points the Council has recognised that it is on the wrong track, but in my opinion it has still not provided the necessary tool.
To this day, for example, there has been no dialogue with the carriers concerned as to how this might actually be done technically, what it will cost and who in the end will pay for it.
I can only point out that if we want to prevent illegal immigration, we are dealing mainly with third countries that are not exactly wealthy.
Think about those third countries, we also know that checking in there is in many cases still done manually, the boarding card is not printed out by computer, but you are given a pre-printed card and the seat number is stuck on to it.
In those cases, airlines would be involved in considerable expense.
I think that if we have such expectations we must first seek a dialogue with the carriers about how that might be jointly organised.
Secondly, it does not explain at all convincingly whether the border control authorities will really be able to do anything useful with the data provided.
In other words, will it make controls easier and more effective?
This question has not been examined at all, either in committee meetings or in the document.
Moreover, this document contains no justification at all, the Council initiative is unreasoned, there is neither a general justification nor a detailed justification for the individual articles.
One very central point for which I have still not been given a satisfactory explanation is the question of whether the data collected really will make for more effective controls in the country of entry.
That is why my report and the initiative having been rejected in committee, my group will be abstaining in the vote tomorrow, because our position is that basically we find the idea interesting and it may be expedient, but the technical side of it must be cleanly worked.
So far, this Council initiative has not done that, and that is why I do not believe we should continue any further down this path.
It is my sincere wish that we should take a final vote on this initiative tomorrow and not refer it back to committee.
Tomorrow, at any rate, I shall not be proposing that we do this.
I believe the road we should take together is that the Commission should submit a sound proposal based on the original Council document (it has already suggested as much itself in a committee meeting) and that we should then have an informed discussion and find a sensible solution.
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like first of all to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Schmitt, for the work put in with a view to producing his report and the draft resolution.
You said that the expression of the initiative has changed several times and I think that, following my intervention, you are going to say that it has changed once more at the last minute.
In fact, in order to be quite clear, the Commission shares the objectives of strengthening controls at external frontiers and combating illegal immigration, which are clearly indicated in the text of the Spanish initiative.
It is a matter of harmonising practices, which are already in place in several Member States, concerning the transmission of APIS type data, which is not to be confused with PNR type data.
The personal information in question is in fact limited to elements entered in all passengersâ travel documents, which they have to present in any case when crossing external frontiers.
Furthermore, the level of data protection offered by the text on which the Parliament is being consulted is sufficiently high and has received the approval of the ArticleÂ 29 Committee.
However, at yesterdayâs Justice and Internal Affairs Council, the draft directive was subject to a political agreement following the insertion of amendments proposed by the United Kingdom aimed at authorising the retention of data beyond the period of 24Â hours initially laid down in the initiative and their use for more extensive purposes.
These amendments, which change the scope of the directive, gave rise to doubts on the part of the Commission, which were expressed in a statement attached to the final text.
In this statement, the Commission asserts that the directive should be interpreted in the light of the objectives imposed on it, namely the strengthening of controls at the frontiers and combating illegal immigration.
Also, in the statement, the Commission regrets that the provisions added at the request of the United Kingdom could not be examined as part of the measures that the Commission has undertaken to present for JuneÂ 2004.
These measures concern the protection of data and the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities in the light in particular of the statement adopted by the European Council on the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, the Commission is sensitive to the worries of carriers asked to take part in this joint effort.
However, it is essential not to overstate the logistical and financial consequences which might result from the implementation of the measures put forward by this proposal.
Apart from the fact that the personal data in question are limited to the information mentioned in passengersâ travel documents, which carriers are already obliged to check at the time of boarding, it should be noted that these data will only be transmitted, according to the provisions of the directive, at the request of the competent national authorities.
In any case, the Commission is willing to enter into dialogue with the carriers on this matter.
Â Â  Madam President, at a time when migration flow management and the fight against illegal immigration are becoming ever more complex, it is very difficult for us to accept this Spanish initiative in either substance or form.
As regards the form, to accept this initiative would be to condone the Councilâs working method, which consists in constantly amending texts proposed to Parliament.
I applaud the work of the rapporteur and his admirable consistency.
He was in fact given new versions when he had already drafted his report, so that the earlier text became null and void.
This is quite unacceptable.
Quite apart from the energy and time that have been wasted, such an attitude betrays a lack of coordination within the Council and contempt for Parliament and the representatives of the people of Europe, which gives us cause for dismay.
One may then question the result obtained.
Is it really effective?
Reading the last official text of the Spanish initiative, one comes across the words âobligationâ and âpenaltyâ in practically every paragraph.
The objective is clearly defined; it involves the fight against illegal immigration.
The penalties should, therefore, essentially concern smugglers of clandestine migrants.
But no!
Penalties and obligations apply to the airlines and we cannot accept that the states should abandon their responsibilities, handing them over to private companies in this way and then penalising them if the work is not done properly.
In fact, obliging private companies to collect data with a view to controlling illegal immigration means requiring the carriers to take over the obligations of the states.
The objective of reducing illegal immigration is a legitimate one, but how can the proposed text be effective?
There has been no demonstration of its actual operational usefulness, and the fact that only the air carriers are concerned has already weakened its objective.
This text, if accepted as it stands, would completely disrupt the work of the airlines, since the transmission of data, which is obligatory for these companies, represents a considerable burden in terms of costs.
In some countries, passports are not machine-readable; in other countries, the machines are not yet available: in order to rectify these failings, Member States do not provide for any system of compensation.
Also, the system of penalties would be terribly onerous and would not take account of the efforts made by the penalised companies with a view to meeting these obligations.
In conclusion, then, illegal immigration must of course be combated, but there are, in my view, many other ways.
We therefore, in fact, reject this initiative and we should like the Commission to make us a proposal in the future, a coherent proposal, and one that respects competences and the publicâs rights and duties.
We trust that the Commission will be able to do this.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this House should not withhold its support for the report by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which rejects the outgoing Spanish Government's initiative.
After all, we have already adopted two important decisions at 12 noon today.
This House â with good reason â has already clearly rejected any communication of passenger data to the US border protection and security authorities, and, thank God, it has today also rejected collective expulsion through joint European flights.
Why, may I ask, should a measure raising so many concerns about data protection suddenly become quite unproblematical as soon as it 'only' affects the European Union?
Or are all methods now supposed to be acceptable in combating 'illegal' immigration?
Do fundamental rights not count any more?
The fundamental right to decide for oneself what is done with oneâs personal data is a valuable asset, one with which we must not deal lightly.
It is derived very clearly not only from the Member States' national constitutions but also from Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
The Community's Data Protection Directive sets high standards for the communication of personal data.
The Spanish initiative, on the other hand, makes combating illegal immigration through stringent surveillance methods the primary goal â and it is unfortunate that the rapporteur supports this.
Yet, as all experience has shown â and this must be made very clear â illegal immigration is tackled not through police repression but solely by establishing peaceful conditions worthy of human dignity in other parts of Europe and the world.
The intention to allow airline companies to collect and communicate passenger data is extremely problematical for a variety of reasons.
Private companies would thus be granted sovereign rights which, until now, have been reserved solely for government agencies in the Member States â for example, in the event of imminent danger or other cases which must be specifically justified.
I do not think we should have a situation in Europe in which the movements of millions of people are being spied on.
What happens if the data are misused?
Let us not even think about that.
The claim that this measure is designed to combat illegal immigration also lacks any credibility.
I think it is patently absurd to assume that the poorest of the poor who come to Europe generally take the plane â the most expensive route.
The reality is very different: the large numbers of people who drown as they attempt to cross the Mediterranean or border rivers â and this happens every day â tell a very different story.
I think it is important to call a halt at last to the authorities' data-collecting zeal, which is spiralling out of control.
We should not be embarking on a course which, in the USA, is rightly criticised by all civil liberties organisations.
Europe does not need uninterrupted surveillance of its passengers and borders.
What Europe needs is genuine protection for the basic rights of every individual who resides here.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, it is better to stop half way than to persevere in an error.
This is the feeling I am left with in this matter.
Spainâs original proposal, to block illegal immigrantsâ path to the mainland, was less fitting than the plan currently proposed.
There is a similarity however in that the carriers are still subject to tough requirements.
Requirements that are unjust.
It cannot after all be the intention that duties of customs agencies are simply transferred to the carriers without proper debate, without a mandate.
If that happens, it should happen so that the effort involved and the financial damage are kept to a minimum.
This was still not the case in the last proposal either.
Even more important however is the point that carriers have to know where they stand, they have to know with what legislation they have to comply.
It is the responsibility of the legislator to communicate this clearly and to remove any duplications or contradictions.
This is a crucial point in the discussion of the requirements the American authorities are imposing on carriers.
At the moment it seems as though airlines flying to the United States are working in a legal minefield.
Any step to one side or the other can have undesirable and far-reaching consequences.
It is not a worthwhile contribution to their position to impose a further set of requirements regarding the passing on of information.
Which is why we are not sorry about the rejection of Spainâs initiative.
While this may not necessarily create a clear situation for the airlines, it does prevent an accumulation of different obligations.
It is up to the responsible agencies to lay down clear and uniform requirements of the information that airlines are to provide in the interest of everyone on this and the other side of the ocean.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be held tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0205/2004) by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders as regards access to the Schengen Information System by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his report.
This proposal for a regulation follows the path laid out in 1999 by the directive on vehicle registration documents, aimed at combating the legal trafficking in stolen vehicles, and must improve the functioning of the internal market, offering the service responsible for registration of vehicles better access to the biggest European database of stolen vehicles, namely the Schengen Information System.
Very important financial interests are at stake, as we all know, because every year millions of cars are registered in the States of the Union and thousands of these are stolen.
Furthermore, by introducing more effective mechanisms for combating vehicle theft, the proposal will have an impact on the security of citizens and consequently on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.
Specifically, it provides for the possibility, before the registration of the vehicle, for the national services responsible, under certain conditions to consult the SIS database of stolen vehicles and registration documents and check whether the vehicle in question has already been registered in another State party to the Schengen Agreement.
This information will make it more difficult for thieves to sell stolen vehicles in another âSchengen Stateâ and at the same time will increase the possibility of victims being able to recover their stolen vehicle.
The authorities currently lack the resources to verify the origin of at least a million vehicles registered every year.
The proposal currently being debated will allow for systematic access to the database, and therefore search for vehicles and registration documents and, in order to have access to it, a series of common rules on transparency and a series of principles on data protection will have to be adhered to.
Compliance with those rules will be monitored in a similar way to other searches carried out within the same SIS database.
For the sake of data protection, it has been proposed to provide different access for public services and for private services responsible for the registration of vehicles.
Officials of the public services responsible should have the right to directly consult the Schengen database, while, despite carrying out a public administration function, when the services carrying out this activity are private, they will have restricted access to it, via the police, like the other existing vehicle registration services.
I would like once again to thank the rapporteur and Parliament for the work you have done.
Â Â  . Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we must fight fraud and the illegal trade in stolen vehicles and this is the purpose of this proposal.
Car theft in the Member States has increased to one million, two hundred thousand vehicles per year.
Indeed, this figure has been exceeded in previous years, and considerable losses have been incurred, totalling EURÂ 15 million.
It is therefore essential that we fight this type of crime, which causes not only financial loss, but also physical and psychological damage, in view of the various forms of violence associated with car crime.
Furthermore, as you have just stated, Commissioner, it affects the citizensâ sense of justice and security.
More than 3Â 300 vehicles are stolen every day, which corresponds to approximately one theft every 25 seconds.
Since I began this speech, two vehicles have, in all likelihood, been stolen and I hope that neither of these belongs to any of the Members present.
The purpose of modifying the Schengen Convention is to allow the public vehicle registration authorities direct access to certain categories of data contained in the Schengen Information System (SIS).
Private vehicle registration services may only have the right to indirect access, via an authority with access to the SIS.
The SIS will thus become an even more important instrument in the fight against crime, enabling the authorities to check, quickly and efficiently, whether the vehicle whose registration has been requested has been stolen, misappropriated or lost.
The functioning of the internal market will thus be improved, as the principle of free movement of goods is strengthened, and this, in turn, will help towards the progressive establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice and the implementation of the common transport policy.
Why direct access?
In order to prevent, in good time, vehicles stolen in one country from being registered, and thereby legalised, in another.
It is calculated that 30% to 40% of the vehicles concerned are stolen by criminal organisations, which then transform them and export them to other countries both inside and outside the EU.
The whole operation usually takes less than 48 hours.
There are two key arguments in favour, the first of which is efficiency.
Several million cars are registered in the EU.
It would be too much for the police to check all these cars systematically in the SIS.
Some 15 million vehicles per year are presented for registration.
Direct access, accordingly, makes it quicker and easier to check the legal status of a vehicle, which means greater efficiency.
The second argument in favour is transparency.
Currently, Member States have all found some way to ensure that it can be checked at the moment of registration of the car whether it has been stolen.
The information that they receive is reasonably reliable, yet these methods are relatively opaque and complicated.
Including an article in the Schengen Convention would confer greater transparency on the entire process.
What kind of data are we speaking about?
Access should only be given to data concerning vehicles with a cylinder capacity above 55Â cc, and data concerning trailers and caravans with an unladen weight exceeding 750Â kg.
It is proposed to increase access to data that are not yet covered by the SIS, namely data concerning registration certificates and number plates that have been stolen misappropriated or lost.
This is the only way in which the desired aims can be achieved.
The Spanish initiatives, which we welcome here, concerning the SISâs new functions, in particular in the fight against terrorism, already provided for integrating these data in the SIS, but have yet to be adopted due to a parliamentary reserve by Denmark.
We trust that those initiatives will be adopted as soon as possible.
I propose the deletion, however, of the proposal on access to data concerning issued identity papers, in accordance with the advice of the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority, along with data concerning blank official documents.
The scope of such a concept would be too wide-ranging and too vague.
The set of data accessible to vehicle registration authorities is, therefore, clearly defined and limited to what is necessary and appropriate.
Access to those data deemed too sensitive will thus be removed and will be limited to objects, in other words, the vehicles themselves.
I should like to call on this House to endorse this initiative and to reject the proposal tabled by the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Pacciotti, of the Socialist Group, which advocates keeping the current system of indirect access in place.
Should that proposal be adopted, nothing will change and we will not make any headway in combating these crimes.
I trust that I have set out the case clearly by giving evidence of the numbers involved, which are ample illustration of the need to establish new ways of combating automobile crime.
The situation, as it stands, must not be allowed to continue.
Mrs Paccioti fears that by allowing direct access we will increase the risk of the misuse of personal data.
I have always advocated the most rigorous protection for the fundamental rights of our citizens, including the right to the protection of personal data.
In view of amendments that I have tabled to the Commissionâs original proposal â all of which have been approved by the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs â I do not believe that the protection of personal data is jeopardised.
The access given to the public vehicle registration authorities will be clearly defined and limited to what is necessary and appropriate, in other words, solely concerning objects, in other words, the vehicles themselves, in order to ascertain from the system whether or not the vehicle in question has been stolen.
Mr President, to reject this step would, to my mind, be a bad decision, as we would remain ineffective in combating this type of crime.
It would also send out the wrong signal to our citizens, who want to see closer cooperation and greater efficiency in combating crime and in ensuring their security.
Â Â  â Mr President, I must thank the Commission representative and the rapporteur, who have been extremely clear in expounding their views.
It is surely inevitable that, when databases are set up to store a large amount of information, there is then a temptation to use them for a wide variety of purposes.
This may be useful and legitimate on certain conditions, particularly with regard to the citizensâ fundamental right to the protection of their personal data, as enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
A demand has now arisen for vehicle registration agencies to be able to check whether a vehicle has been stolen and whether an applicantâs documents are genuine by obtaining all the necessary information stored in the Schengen Information System.
Problems connected with the legal basis would seem to prevent the use of data relating to identity papers, according to the rapporteur, and so the information should be confined to data on motor vehicles.
The draft regulation remains useful even with these limitations.
What I cannot agree with is that the information should not be supplied by the police or customs authorities who have responsibility for storing and processing Schengen data, but should be acquired directly by public registration agencies through direct access to the SIS database.
This access by the huge number of vehicle registration bodies in the 25 Member States would be a serious threat to the protection of personal data stored in the Schengen system.
The nature of the services responsible for citizensâ security, the rules and controls to which they are subject, and the purposes for which they may use any data that may come to their knowledge are very different from those relating to administrative bodies, in the public sector or otherwise, that take care of vehicle registration.
Besides, I cannot see what urgent need there is to allow direct access to Schengen data, given that this would not be allowed for any registration bodies that were private rather than public in nature under the rules of different countries.
This would cause a disparity in rules that would increase confusion rather than make the provision more effective.
It would be better, then, to regulate the use of Schengen data by vehicle registration agencies by allowing all of them the same indirect access, which would avoid any risk of abuse and would respect the principle of proportionality.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, according to the report, this modest proposal is aimed, of course, at combating fraud and the illegal trade in stolen motor vehicles, and the means to be used is increased access to the Schengen Information System.
I quote the report: â[The proposal] will make the SIS an even more prominent instrument to fight crime andâŠ [promote] work towards the progressive establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice.â
Despite this, the legal basis for the proposal is transport policy â to which I am returning â namely Article 71.
It pains me to say it, Commissioner and MrÂ Coelho, but this is a legal and juridico-political farce.
I shall confine my remarks to three points.
First, regarding the Schengen project in general, which of course constitutes the most extensive system in world history of supervision and political and social control.
