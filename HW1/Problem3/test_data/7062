Firstly, Parliament has supported the inclusion on the Cancun agenda of the so-called Singapore issues, in other words, issues relating to investment, competition, trade facilitation and public procurement. This goes against the interests of the poor countries.
Secondly, Parliament has missed an opportunity to take a stand against the complaint relating to GMOs that the United States has lodged against the EU and to reject the slanderous propaganda that has accompanied this complaint and which fools no one.
We only have to recall the unacceptable stance the United States has adopted on the issue of accessibility to medicines.
Thirdly, the idea that the world's public assets, such as water, must be considered to be the common heritage of humanity has not been accepted.
Lastly, Parliament has not upheld the principle of the hierarchy of laws between WTO law and international environmental and social law, or the principle of the primacy of the United Nations.
Of course we wish to promote a more multilateral approach, but the context of the Cancun meeting is still a source of great concern.
I can only hope that my reservations are unfounded and that unlike at Doha, we will achieve our aim without having to wait for another round of negotiations.
Mr President, I have abstained on the Blokland report and on the amendments tabled by my group because I am not at all unhappy about the recently adopted reform on voting arrangements in the ECB.
I do not think that a system based on Member States' share of total GDP would be any fairer or more efficient.
In particular, I am not going to condemn the fact that the Council has disregarded Parliament's decision to reject the ECB's recommendation.
On the contrary, this recommendation was very well thought-out, extremely balanced and I am delighted that the Council of Ministers has rallied around this proposal.
This is why I have abstained on the Blokland report and voted against an amendment from my own group.
The scant importance accorded to Parliament's reports on monetary policy is understandable.
Instead of conducting a genuinely critical analysis of the implementation of monetary policy, the same old arguments are repeated, regardless of the economic climate.
It is no surprise, then, that this report should begin with the words '[c]ongratulates once again the ECB for a successful introduction [of the euro]', and concludes cheerfully 'that the ECB reacted correctly to economic and financial developments'.
All this is always packaged in the dogmas of service, support for the Stability Pact and flexibility of the labour market.
We know that a rigid monetary policy means that adjustments made to overcome economic crises are reflected in salaries and employment, affecting internal demand and increasing inequality, poverty, and social exclusion.
One cannot help but notice that the present climate of recession in the EU, and the disparities between inflation rates, demonstrate that a single monetary policy cannot respond effectively to the needs of Member States at different stages of economic development.
I therefore insist once more on the need for an in-depth review of the guidelines for monetary and budgetary policy. Their inflexibility has not only contributed to a failure to seize on the potential for economic growth in the last few years, but is also primarily responsible for the current recession and concomitant increase in unemployment.
That is why we voted against the report.
. (FR) The Blokland report welcomes the Euro's appreciation towards the dollar but warns that this trend must not endanger exports.
It also exposes a black hole in monetary union: no one knows exactly what the exchange rate target for the euro is.
It is certainly not up to the ECB to set this target, because the bank's sole task is to maintain price stability.
The call for a wide-ranging study of the euro's development confirms that the ECB itself does not appear to be taking much interest in this problem.
This acknowledged and even proclaimed ignorance confirms that our analysis of the euro is correct: this is not an instrument designed to support an economic policy that is better coordinated and more favourable to employment.
It is basically a tool for the economic police, intended to put pressure on salaries and social expenditure.
It is not surprising to note, therefore, that this report, like the GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm report, is insistent on calling for the strictest orthodoxy, particularly in budgetary matters.
Far from deploring the breaches of the Stability Pact, we consider that its principles are both inapplicable in practice and profoundly damaging in their effects.
This is why we have voted against these two reports, which do nothing but compulsively restate plans that the economic situation has long since proven to be irrelevant.
. (NL) The discussion on the annual report of the European Central Bank, with the visit by the President of the ECB, is the only time each year when we are not left with the impression that the note-issuing bank for 12 of the 15 Member States has been privatised.
Whereas this type of bank used to be nationalised in order to enable greater political control over policy, politics is now being left behind.
Interest rates, exchange rates, the implications for vulnerable regions, relations with the United States of America, and the position of the developing world are thus largely being decided outside parliamentary democracy.
This also applies to the influence of the ECB and the Stability and Growth Pact on pensions, social security and the level of public service provision.
The rapporteur, Mr Blokland, rightly shows that the success or failure of the euro should not only be assessed in terms of the speed of introduction of the euro banknotes and coins at the start of 2002, but also in terms of price increases for the provision of services.
I will gladly support him in his endeavours to have inflation forecasts, the influence of Member States' governments, and especially reporting on all meetings of the Governing Council published, including dissenting opinions and the balance of votes, and the obtaining of greater influence over the composition of the Governing Council on the part of Parliament.
This is the only way we can prevent the ECB from developing into an instrument that is at odds with the majority of the inhabitants of the EU.
. (FR) This report does not constitute a departure from the principle that applies when studying annual reports, according to which one is obliged to praise the institution concerned.
It is true that this time the 'courageous' rapporteur dares to decry the fact that the introduction of the euro has resulted in what he modestly calls 'effects' on inflation.
By the same token, the ECB is asked to keep an eye on the speed at which the markets react to or disregard its decisions on monetary policy.
So much for the 'negative' aspects of a report, which otherwise delivers a eulogy to the ECB's activities in the guise of an analysis.
Having been congratulated on reacting correctly to economic and financial developments, and on the euro's appreciation towards the dollar, the ECB is now receiving the dividends of its unswerving allegiance to federalist and monetarist dogma.
In these circumstances, no one will be surprised at the passages dealing with the ECB's independence and even less with the attack against the Member States that have failed to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact, which risks undermining the credibility of the euro zone!
Incidentally, it should come as no surprise that I have voted against this report.
I profoundly regret the fact that Parliament has not called for a report devoted exclusively to the first assessment of the introduction of euro notes and coins. I proposed such a report, incidentally, in my motion for a resolution (B5-640/2002) on the effects of the introduction of the euro, which is annexed to today's report.
While this report emphasises the success of the entire operation and insists on wider powers for the Eurozone, it also expresses disappointment with the inflationary pressures of the changeover to the euro, particularly in the services sector, and calls for an investigation into financial irregularities, just as I did in my resolution.
The Commission and the ECB recognise that the impact was greater than the 0.2% predicted but considerably smaller than the effects experienced by consumer organisations and than the information on inflation reported by some national central banks suggested.
Nevertheless, the report discusses developments in bank charges and commissions in the euro zone.
A full assessment is needed to investigate the introduction of excessive increases, especially for domestic payments, and illegal charges on crossborder payments. Such charges penalise consumers and increase the cost of transactions.
Banks cannot expect consumers and SMEs to meet the cost of lost foreign exchange revenues.
I therefore welcome the fact that my amendment has been adopted.
. (NL) The tightening measures proposed by the rapporteur are at odds with past experience.
It appears almost impossible for both Germany and France, the large Member States that have taken the initiative for the euro, as well as for southern Member States with a weaker economy, to observe the Stability Pact's strict requirements.
Low taxation combined with the discharging of public debts and the prevention of new budgetary shortages has disastrous effects on social security, public services and the problem-solving capacity of the government in general.
There will soon be no more money available for everything in which democracy requires the government to play an active role.
Weak areas become increasingly more dependent on the EU's structural funds, cohesion funds and the common agricultural policy, and here too, less and less funding will be available, proportionately speaking, in the long run.
The rapporteur is right to want to avoid price increases coinciding with the euro's introduction in the new Member States of the euro zone.
In fact, price increases are already a reality, because invariably, the payment of luxury goods and services is already being required in euros instead of the national currencies that are still valid there for the time being.
The abolition of small currencies, which is also advocated, will in practice lead to yet further price increases because figures will be rounded up by quite a large margin.
It is for these reasons that I reject this measure.
. (FR) Everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds!
This is basically the attitude of this report on the international role of the euro zone.
Whilst everyone is concerned at the euro's appreciation towards the dollar - a phenomenon that heavily penalises our exporters - whilst some are wondering about the criteria for interpreting the stability pact, and whilst the Commission is stepping up its threats against States that cannot meet the overwhelming constraints imposed by Maastricht, the rapporteur talks about the euro as a major success for European integration, which will lead to greater prosperity and to a European identity, and cannot see beyond the independence of the Central Bank and the policy of price stability.
In his opinion, the euro is so successful that a single representative for the euro zone should even be appointed for the international political institutions!
In short, the European Parliament has once again allowed itself to be carried away by an ideological and demagogic interpretation of the observable situation.
This is all quite mind-boggling and shows unbelievable short-sightedness where the economic reality is concerned.
This report is irrelevant and I shall, of course, vote against it.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
In yesterday's questions to Council, the President?in-Office of the Council did not answer my question on the number of victims of the war in Iraq. He said that he could not reply because he did not have the necessary information.
My supplementary question also met with a contemptuous and deafening silence.
I tabled this question on 14 May and we are now in July; if the Council had wanted to answer, it would have provided some information yesterday on the number of human lives lost.
I consequently deduce that the Council, rather than being unable to give information, does not wish to answer. This could be interpreted as demonstrating scorn for the fact that the European Parliament represents the people.
The victims of an unjust war must not be consigned to oblivion or to disdain by an institution such as the European Parliament.
I therefore ask you, Mr President, to support my request to defend the dignity of our Parliament and to support my request to find out how soon we will be able to get this information from the Council.
We will make a note of that in the Minutes, and the Council will be informed.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that it is an excellent political conjuncture to be debating women in rural areas just when the reform of the common agricultural policy is being finalised, the reform of the common fisheries policy is continuing and nothing in the planned reforms has been decided for women.
I thank the Conference of Presidents for approving the initiative of the Committee on Women's Rights to draft this report and all the political groups which, with their participation and amendments, have enriched the initial draft of my report.
I also warmly thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for supporting this report and cooperating with us by drafting an opinion, the most important points of which are included in the proposed resolution.
Today, in the European Union, we are looking for efficient strategies to develop rural areas on the basis of the new European standard and, at the same time, to combat local and regional inequalities.
Within the framework of this policy, we all recognise that human resources are a development factor of prime importance.
Our policies must therefore be based on the principle of equality between men and women if we really want to give development opportunities to all rural citizens, men and women alike.
The policies of the European Union to strengthen the role of women in rural areas have not had the anticipated results.
Today, in the European Union, the proportion of women working in agriculture is 37%.
This percentage varies from one country to another, but the situation on farm holdings and in social life in rural areas has more or less the same characteristics.
Only one in five farms are managed by women and the majority of these are small farms.
Over the last decade there has only been an increase in this proportion of 1%.
Approximately one in two women involved in agricultural production and life have the status of farmer's wife or partner, a status of invisible, unrecognised work which is not in keeping with the quality of work objectives of the European citizen and which does not provide any preconditions for personal development and the growth of local society.
The level of education of women is very low, both as regards basic education and as regards the level of full or partial agricultural education.
Social security differs from country to country.
In some places women farmers have derived [rights], in some places the same rights, and in this report we maintain that this issue should be dealt with seriously at European level.
We have had a shortage of tools to date.
Directive 86/613 on the application of the principle of equality between men and women, which also covers agricultural activity, is not binding enough and we therefore maintain it should be revised and brought into line with the new situation.
The Member States, for their part, must also recognise and safeguard the work of women farmers, as regards security and pensions, with contributions at levels compatible with family work.
Another proposal by our committee is that, within the framework of the programmes and the funding of the Structural Funds for rural development, especially the Leader Plus programme, particular attention should be paid to strengthening the role of women farmers.
At the same time, the Leader Observatory must be strengthened, so that it covers the gaps in European statistics as regards the situation of women in rural areas and completes them by collating additional figures and introducing networks so that we can track the situation as it stands today and measure the progress we hope there will be in the future.
Similarly, the resolution which I recommend that you approve proposes replacing the current method of calculating subsidies, funding for farm holdings, which takes account of the holdings and not the active persons, with the result that women working as the second member of the couple lose out under a system which takes no account of the total number of people working on the holding and their real contribution.
It is proposed to direct the funds obtained from redistributing direct support to programmes in favour of women farmers, while we call on the European Commission to make provision within the framework of the future programme for the Structural Funds for rural development, in the new programme period, for a special programme for women farmers, due to the fact that, so far, the horizontal lines in the Structural Funds have not achieved the expected results.
On the other hand, we call on both the European Commission and the Member States to make life in rural areas easier and more attractive to young women, young women farmers, because we see that the presence of women in rural areas is a declining demographic development.
You can find all the proposals and the explanatory statement in our report.
. (ES) First of all, I wish to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for having taken the initiative with this report, and I would also like to express my gratitude to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture on this report.
The committee has welcomed this report, with the content of which it largely agrees.
This is an own-initiative report and raises a set of issues that will help to place women nearer the centre of the Union's common agricultural and rural development policies.
The report pursues the same approach taken by the Agriculture Council in its conclusions of May 2002 on gender equality in the CAP and in rural development policy.
That document focuses on the need to consolidate the second pillar of the CAP and the Commission fully shares this opinion.
In fact, in our proposals for CAP reform, which were approved in Luxembourg last week, additional funds have already been set aside for rural development as of 2005.
Before making a detailed study of some of the points, I should like to recall that Regulation (EEC) No 1257/99 on rural development aid already allows Member States to include specific measures for women in their rural development programmes, such as investment in farm holdings run by women, aid to integrate young women farmers, training, the marketing and processing of farm products, aid for artesanal activity, rural tourism and other things.
Some Member States have already funded measures specifically targeting women or have integrated the principle of equal opportunities in their programmes for rural development, for example, including gender as a selection criterion for allocating Union funds.
For this reason, some of the measures that the report calls on the Commission to take, such as item 6, for example, should be requested by the Member States that are already in a position to implement them.
The Commission agrees fully with some of the requests made in the report.
I shall now address these.
First of all, in its procedures for approving relevant projects under the Structural Funds, Parliament asks the Commission to ensure that due attention is paid to the need to give women in farming a more relevant role to play.
From the beginning, in the 2000-2006 Structural Funds programming period, the Commission recommended that the principle of equal opportunities should be integrated into the Structural Funds and, more recently, the Commission published a Communication that includes recommendations to Member States such as awarding extra points in the selection criteria to projects that contribute to gender equality or to the application of specialist knowledge in this area in the funds' management.
The interim evaluation of the Structural Funds, due to take place at the end of this year, will take account of these developments.
The Commission also agrees with the European Parliament's insistence on the importance of the Leader initiative - items 12, 13 and 25 of its report - in promoting the role of women in rural areas.
The Member States are already obliged to reveal in their annual reports the number of local action groups in which women are part of the decision-making body, the number of women who benefit from Leader funds and the budget that is allocated to these projects.
The interim evaluation of Leader, which will be presented at the end of this year, will also give us a better understanding of how these initiatives are working.
Furthermore, the Commission intends, in line with the proposal you make in item 24, to ensure that one of the tasks of the future European observatory, Leader, is to compile and disseminate best practice on integrating and involving farmers in rural development.
The Commission agrees with Parliament on the need to create incentives to encourage women's participation in farm production and to promote a balanced representation of women farmers in the various decision-making bodies.
There are, however, some points your report makes with which the Commission cannot agree.
The report wants the Commission to attach priority to ensuring that resources obtained through the modulation of direct aid are reallocated to programmes that incorporate measures to benefit the social groups most in need, such as women in rural areas.
Nevertheless, as you know, it falls to the Member States to decide on the future reallocation of resources.
Nor can the Commission accept the request to create a unit responsible for equal opportunities in the Directorate-General for Agriculture.
This Directorate-General has already conducted a highly detailed study of the issue of equality, and consequently we do not see any need to go further.
Lastly, I wish to look at Parliament's request for a revision of Directive 86/613/EEC on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture.
The Commission is of the opinion that such a revision is unnecessary, since many aspects of this Directive, especially those concerning employment and working conditions, are already regulated in the recent Directive 2002/73/EC amending Directive 76/207/EEC, and, given that these recent amendments also apply to self-employed workers pursuant to Paragraph 1(3), we do not feel there is any need to go further.
Furthermore, applying the category of self-employed worker to spouses provides, in principle, adequate coverage for social security schemes, without discriminating on the grounds of gender since the applicable legislation would in this case be Directive 79/7/EEC, on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security, which would enable us to address such situations.
These are the observations I wish to make on this initiative, and I thank you very much for having undertaken this task.
Mr President, Commissioner, that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should entrust the drafting of its opinion to a man, and that the women on it should agree to that, is a demonstration of the importance we attach to this problem of equal treatment and equality of opportunity, as we take the view that these are issues not only - and here, 'not only' is not meant to be restrictive - affecting women's social, environmental and cultural achievements, for there is no doubt that they do, but also the economic development of rural areas.
Women play a decisive part in the economic development of rural areas.
Women's continuing role, especially on small farms, as invisible workers - to which reference has just been made - is also made apparent by agricultural statistics according to which the proportion of women varies slightly from 0.2% to 0.3%, although nobody can deny that, as there is such a wide range of tasks to be done, women may well do more work on farms than men.
This, then, is where we have to focus more on women's role in the labour force.
Commissioner, nobody will now expect the Agriculture Directorate-General to turn itself into an equal opportunities office for women - that would surely be to ask too much of it - but the programmes can of course include priorities that also take women into account, and I acknowledge that the Commission is already doing something about this.
If we consider the ways in which funds are allocated, it becomes clear that what we call bottom-up approaches - that is to say, those in which local labour is involved - provide specific opportunities for women.
On the whole, they are much more actively involved than are the men.
If we give our attention to this, we will enhance women's role as workers and give them greater economic clout, and that will benefit rural areas as a whole.
If I may, as a man, conclude my speech by saying so, women will of course - as they must - defend their own interests, and we see in rural areas that they are very well able to do this and that they are already playing their part in shaping agricultural policy.
Mr President, this report on women in rural areas is well-timed, as the role and position of women in agriculture and rural areas will become even more important in view of the fundamental change in the system of the common agricultural policy to which the agriculture ministers more or less agreed when they met in Luxembourg last week.
Now, at last, there will be improved opportunities for giving support in this area, although, of course, for the farmers whose income is to be cut, this is no substitute and not much of a comfort.
This is where women will come into their own, having, as is well known, a greater flexibility and more imaginative approach when it comes to taking on new tasks that can bring in some additional income.
This does of course depend on the right framework conditions being in place, and also on gender mainstreaming - or, to put it in comprehensible terms, equality of opportunity for men and women.
Serious attention needs to be given to this in this context, so that new potential sources of income can be opened up in labour, marketing, tourism and culture - areas in which women are especially efficient, and in relation to which there are many sensible suggestions in the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, whom I thank most warmly for her work.
I am particularly grateful that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in its opinion, harks back to my 1997 report on the situation of assisting spouses of the self-employed in agriculture.
Six years have passed since this House called upon the Commission to cause an amendment to be made to the 1986 directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture.
I regret that the Commission has taken no specific action in response to this report.
As Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just reminded us, we did, for example, demand the registration of working married couples, so that they would no longer be invisible in the labour force.
If I might say one last thing, Mr President, if you want to do something to keep women in rural areas, you have to ensure that they suffer no discrimination either as regards fair payment for their work or as regards social security.
We want and need mandatory insurance specifically for the millions of assisting spouses, and this is where I might, perhaps, recommend Luxembourg's approach as exemplary.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, I am speaking not as a woman, but as my group's representative.
You too, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, spoke as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Women make up some 40% of the fifteen million people who work in agriculture in the EU, and run one in every five farms - around 1.3 million - which, apart from a mere 3% larger ones, are small and medium-sized operations.
Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report gives more detailed information on this.
Although, of all the Community's policies, the CAP is far and away the most highly developed, there is still a positively criminal neglect of gender mainstreaming.
The consequence of this is that there is scarcely any visible sign of women in rural areas enjoying equal status and equal rights.
Although a number of instruments have been devised, any visible breakthrough in the CAP is still a long way in the future.
Even though, in my view, the reform of agricultural policy left the fields strewn with dead lobbyists, it does have a very apparent shortcoming in that women have not managed to get the systematic promotion of women in agriculture accepted.
Especially painful though that is, it is primarily in the restructuring of rural areas in the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe that even greater pain will be felt.
What is on our minds is the new working arrangements that have to be devised.
We are thinking about facilities that improve the balance between working life and family life, as well as about childcare facilities, and the provision of care for disabled and older people.
We are thinking about the need to further develop rural tourism, and about how to promote alternative energies, and regional marketing cycles.
These may be only ad hoc approaches, but they have added to the range of culture on offer.
Women have eventually found a small niche in all this and seized an opportunity, but I think of the state of Bavaria, from which I come and which the President knows well - there, in 2002, EUR 17 million from the rural development programme were not allocated, which - if we add in the co-financed sums that could have been used for specific projects, including for women - means that a total of EUR 34 million could not be paid out.
As regards many of the available resources, we still have to exert pressure on the Member States, and so I ask the Commission, when monitoring the programmes' operation, to pay much closer attention to the way in which gender mainstreaming is actually implemented, so that it does not remain merely a topic for pious utterances.
My group has endorsed Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report.
We have tabled amendments in the hope of extending it to cover the fisheries sector, in which a very large number of women work.
I speak also on behalf of the rapporteur when I ask the House to support us in seeking this, and I appeal to the Commission to include this dimension.
I too should like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on her sound report and, above all, would advise the Commission again to read it very carefully, particularly the statistical summaries, which paint a lamentable picture of the impact of women in rural areas.
Women have far too little power; far too few of them are at the helm of businesses, and in my country, the Netherlands, with 6% of female business managers, they are worse off than anywhere else; we should hang our heads in shame.
Moreover, one in two women farmers fall within the spouse or partner category, which is particularly detrimental to their entitlement to social security.
That should change; in that respect, I totally agree with what Mrs Lulling said about finally adopting the recommendations of 1997.
I should like, for a moment, to dwell upon the rural policy regulation.
Agricultural policy has indeed changed recently, and I do not know whether we should be that pleased with every aspect of this change.
When the whole dossier is finally analysed, the rural policy regulation appears to have become the cuckoo in the nest.
Mr Olsson too has already indicated in his report on rural policy how important this can be, for example, in order to give the switch-over to other sources of income, such as, agro-tourism, care farms, new energy sources, organic farming, local services and cultural manifestations a shot in the arm.
That is where opportunities lie, particularly for women.
This has already been said by other speakers and I should like to add something.
There are vast areas in Europe with large cities.
Particularly rural areas near large cities can develop a raft of special services, and so I urge that this rural regulation should include a rural policy criterion in relation to large cities.
I really think it is worth giving serious thought to this as a committee, and I have also raised questions in writing on this matter.
I should like to take this opportunity to warn against certain forms of rural pauperisation.
Although buildings, in particular, do, in fact, form part of the cultural heritage, they are in a bad state of repair in many areas.
I think that a sound rural policy could save a great deal, and especially for women, there are many opportunities to use these buildings for new services, such as cultural events, receiving tourists, and so on.
I was disappointed when the Commissioner said that he could not give any guarantees for channelling the resources from the CAP leg to the second pillar.
I know that the Commission wanted to put aside more resources for this in the first instance and that the Council cut these back.
I also know therefore, that we must sound the alarm, particularly in our own country, but nevertheless, I hope that the Commission will continue to insist on a greater shift towards the rural policy regulation.
Mr President, it is important to pay particular attention to women in rural areas of the European Union, who represent almost half of the agricultural workforce and almost 29% of the unpaid workforce in some countries, such as Portugal.
In many cases, however, their contribution is not properly recognised and they do not have the support they need for their quality of life to improve.
This report is thus very timely.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on the work she has carried out, and especially on her inclusion of proposals, some of them tabled by me, relating to the need to put particular emphasis on family-based farming, support for small and medium-sized farmers, and recognition of women from these areas in terms of social security. The latter includes women's right to a respectable retirement pension, though without their having to pay contributions which impose an excessive burden on family farms.
I cannot, I fear, offer similar congratulations to the Agriculture Council on its conclusions of 25 and 26 June, in relation to the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), because I believe that these conclusions pave the way for severe problems for family-based agriculture and small and medium-sized farmers. Women in rural areas play a prominent role in such farms, especially in less-favoured regions and in countries such as my own.
I would emphasise the special importance of the statement made in the report under debate here to the effect that the mid-term review of the CAP will only have a positive impact on equal opportunities if its objectives are substantially modified so as to ensure that family-based agriculture and small and medium-sized farmers are given particular prominence.
Equally important, however, are the proposals upholding the establishment of a specific programme devoted to the 'Women' project, as well as those proposals emphasising the need to pay particular attention to creating public infrastructures, community facilities and quality services, so as to ensure an appropriate network of rural services in all areas, including high-quality family planning, educational and training services and cultural facilities.
I would conclude by insisting also on the need to close the severe gaps in agricultural statistics. The appropriate measures could then be adopted to improve living conditions for these women and make it easier for young women farmers to establish themselves.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for her initiative.
I think, Commissioner, that the whole debate illustrates the fact that we are facing two major problems.
First of all, I should like to see the common agricultural policy as an opportunity to look at rural development in a new light.
For this purpose, we will need to employ all the forces in rural areas.
We will need to shape those forces.
Some of these forces are more flexible than others.
I know from experience that women are often much more open to innovation than men.
I therefore hope that projects will be set up whereby entrepreneurship - which women display in practice but which is often not recognised economically, politically or socially - will be promoted.
This recognition is, of course, necessary.
I would like to give the example of farm tourism in Australia, where agriculture stopped being profitable a long time ago.
Families there live by farm tourism.
What would become of this without the female entrepreneur?
This does, of course, require a proper social statute.
Do you not find it shameful that after all these years, as Mrs Lulling clearly stressed, there is still not one country, as far as I know, that has a proper statute for the self-employed helper?
This is all done in dribs and drabs.
It remains a major problem and I think that the Union should take the initiative to guarantee women helpers in rural areas at least a minimum social standard.
(Applause from the centre and left)
Mr President, I support measures designed to assist and encourage the continuing participation of women in the challenging work of agriculture and rural development.
In so doing I ask the House to reflect on and acknowledge their already outstanding contribution, in particular the sacrifices and generosity of previous generations of rural women, who silently toiled under the most difficult conditions with little or no recognition other than the satisfaction of ensuring the welfare of their families and instilling in them the culture, ethos and spiritual values of a profession that has no equal.
Society owes them a debt of gratitude.
In the context of CAP reform, and with the greater emphasis on rural development, the role of women in rural society is of increasing importance.
Their leadership qualities are crucial in the mobilisation of the human and physical resources of the rural areas of an enlarged European Union.
Equal opportunities for rural women are a necessary prerequisite if we are to achieve the full potential of rural development measures.
I would like to see, for example, the Early Retirement from Farming Scheme amended to provide for their greater security.
Not for the first time I express concern about the continuity of the EU family farm structure, of which women are an important component.
Uncertainty about the long-term economic sustainability of farming, coupled with the availability of more financially rewarding employment for young people, has led to a worrying increase in the age profile of European farmers, of whom 37% are women.
Of the 14.65 million people working on farms in the EU, 5.37 million are women.
The figure for Portugal, at 49%, is the highest and for Ireland, my own country, at 11%, the lowest.
Ireland's unique family-farm structure is, however, best demonstrated by the fact that 97% of Irish farms are jointly managed, with women playing an equal and important role.
If national governments are to achieve the desirable objective of restoring urban rural balance, already seriously out of hand, then the role of women must be adequately recognised and rewarded.
In conclusion, in Ireland there are many examples of women in leadership roles.
The Leader Programme is just one area that comes to my mind.
Likewise, the Irish Countrywomen's Association one of the oldest in Europe has played an historic role in advancing the cause of rural women and in bridging the rural and urban divide.
Mr President, this is a timely report and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur at the outset on her well-intentioned drive.
Given the short deadline, she has taken a very reasonable and consensus-based approach.
Last year, at the Third World Congress of rural women held in Madrid, the principle of equal opportunities for countrywomen was upheld as a separate requisite of sustainable development for the rural areas of Europe.
Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report follows that line.
She urges the Commission and the Member States, in cooperation with local government, to implement policies to improve the general living conditions of women in rural areas.
Although she clearly proposes the adaptation of the Leader+ programme to the new circumstances arising from the accession of the candidate countries, the Commission, as Commissioner Solbes said, will not necessarily go further and immediately extend this adaptation process to all Community initiatives, Interreg, Equal, Urban, etc. The accession of the new members of the European Union will overturn the current criteria and methods for maintaining the rural areas' internal balance, owing to the fact that the percentage of the rural population in the European Union will more than double this year.
Although we have no reliable statistics on the percentage of women in these areas, either in the European Union or in the accession countries, the Spanish Economic and Social Council has put forward its available statistics on the European Union's Member States.
To refer to just one statistic: half of all women working in rural areas only have primary school education.
Finally, it is quite evident that the Council of Agriculture Ministers needs to make a special effort actively to incorporate the gender dimension in rural development issues.
As the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, clearly urges, it is absolutely necessary to ensure that the old saying 'men for production, women for reproduction' no longer has any meaning.
Mr President, I am very happy with this document.
I believe that it opens the door to more profound and structural phenomena, which relate to women in rural areas.
I believe that we have so far had successes in relation to isolated aspects, projects such as Equal and many others, which represent bringing women closer, an intention to help women in rural areas.
But often society does not accept or support these efforts by the European Union to help women.
The Leader projects, for example, are not always led by women.
It is frankly difficult to find a woman sitting at the table: the social system rejects it.
What worries me in particular, however, are the structural problems.
For example, the depopulation of the countryside essentially goes hand in hand with the abandonment of women, because women have no place in the rural environment, their requirements are not socially recognised, they can neither exercise their rights nor develop themselves as individuals.
Studies have been done, in the University of Cantabria for example, which demonstrate that practically 99% of women with university qualifications do not wish to return to the countryside.
We must incentivise transversal policies for helping women.
For example, with regard to accessibility of services, we must support the policy of subsidised transport, because women in the countryside often live far from any opportunity, far from medical service, and their children are far away from education since school transport has been removed.
Amongst the transversal support policies we should promote access to IT systems and bring the wealth of the urban system closer to the countryside.
Similarly, I believe we should study the harm that will be done through the delocalised policy, because clearly, not only are women going to end up without work, as in the case of the milk crisis, for example, and many other agriculture crises, but also their moveable and immoveable assets - particularly the former - will no longer be in the market.
Furthermore, reforestation is all very well, but we should bear in mind that these people go to the city without any assets, which have been the inheritance upon which they have supported the development of their enterprise.
Mr President, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has done great work on this report, which I believe has been improved.
I have therefore changed my initial position and I am voting in favour of this final text.
The results of the Council of Ministers of 26 June 2003, however, have been insufficient in this regard.
I understand the efforts made today by Commissioner Solbes to present it in a positive manner.
I understand it because Mr Solbes, when he was Minister for Agriculture in Spain, was sensitive towards women in the field of rural development.
What has been agreed on the reform of the CAP, however, in no way takes women into consideration.
What is more, neither Commissioner Fischler in his proposals, nor what the Ministers have approved, makes the slightest mention of women.
I have studied all the agreements and only indirectly, by means of rural development or the mention of young farmers, can I see any improvement.
Bearing in mind, therefore, the importance of these agreements on the reform of the CAP, this is very serious and we must ensure that the regulations included in this reform take account of women.
The most interesting points in the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report, as it now stands, are the recognition and improvements for assisting spouses, men and women, the effective promotion measures, microloans, soft loans, and the proposal, which is very necessary, that women should participate in decision-making in professional and sectoral agricultural organisations.
It is necessary because the CAP is still sexist.
Mr President, the report mainly identifies the unfortunate position of women farmers.
However, it does not highlight the causes or who is responsible for this situation.
A conscientious effort is being made to disorientate by creating the impression in women farmers that their position can be improved within the framework of the even harsher anti-farming measures being promoted with the recent reform of the CAP.
The findings about the efficiency of programmes such as Leader I and II are also misleading.
It is a known fact that these programmes refer to complementary actions as far as farming and rural development are concerned and the level of funding under the so-called second pillar is not only trivial, but also mainly profits those who exercise a business activity in the subsidised sectors of these programmes.
The report essentially accepts the supplementary and unequal role of women farmers in agricultural activity, as well as the effort to remove women in rural areas from agricultural employment, which is why they are being guided to similar activities.
These proposals serve the European Union's objective to further shrink the agricultural population and desert rural areas, which already have huge abandonment problems, especially in Greece.
Finally, this being so, proposals such as creating crÃšches, cultural centres, public transport and so on range from the insignificant to the cynically hypocritical.
Women farmers' acute problems are the result of the CAP and anti-farming policies.
Consequently, only overturning them can safeguard the continuity of farming activity, a stable income and a dignified standard of living for women farmers.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, I too should like to warmly congratulate and thank Mrs Kratsa for her own initiative report.
She has made a very big contribution to promoting and highlighting the problems faced by a particular professional category of women, women farmers.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, understanding and valuing the particular contribution which women farmers can make to improving rural areas, organised a public dialogue on the subject on 18 March 2003.
Following the recent reform of the CAP, we expect, Commissioner, the additional funds which will be made available for rural development to target and improve the life of women farmers, which is downgraded and undervalued in all the regions of the European Union.
We particularly hope that the necessary infrastructures will be created which will allow women farmers to combine their working and family life and have quality of life.
Of course, we recognise that the third Community Support Framework helped enormously to create an institutional and funding action framework for rural development, which included women.
In Greece, thousands of women are benefiting from the Community initiative, Leader.
Nonetheless, legal and advisory support is needed for women in rural areas, with information and awareness-raising actions within local communities, training programmes, actions which will support the specific needs of women and local development objectives, in the aim of supporting and safeguarding employment and ensuring women farmers stay in their area.
Finally, I should like to refer to a very successful field of action in Greece, women's cooperatives, especially rural tourism cooperatives.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m. today.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
The presentation of the report by Mrs Kratsa, whom I congratulate on her excellent work, makes up for the culpable silence on the fundamental role of women in the strategy for rural development.
At a time when we are adopting 'gender budgeting', we can only insist on the need to be able to quantify and assess this participation accurately.
We must also consider the social protection available to women and the support which is necessary and specific to their professional development and to their quality of life.
This is all the more important on the eve of enlargement.
The aim of this recognition will only be usefully achieved if the Commission applies itself to submitting a revised directive that would finally enable a genuine policy of equality to be developed in this sector, which should lead to the balanced representation of women farmers in the various decision-making arenas, access to separate social rights, the principle of equal pay, particular focus on the needs of women in rural areas when actions are selected and extending the LEADER + programme to cover the new situations created by enlargement.
This is how we will bring working spouses out of invisibility and make democracy work.
The next item is the oral question (O-0049/2003 B5-0100/2003), put to the Commission by Mr Caveri on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and concerning the safety of coaches.
The question's author, Mr Caveri, is unfortunately unable to be present, so we will first hear Commissioner Solbes Mira on this question.
. (ES) Mr President, until now, coach passengers have not been obliged to use safety belts, but a new directive has been approved recently, in accordance with which the Member States will require all occupants over three years old in vehicles of categories M2 and M3 to use the safety devices installed in vehicles in service.
Passengers in these vehicles will be informed of the obligation to use safety belts when the vehicle is moving.
The Member States will adopt the legal, regulatory and administrative provisions necessary to ensure compliance with the directive by 9 May 2006.
In order to extend the obligatory installation of belts to all vehicles, including coaches, the Commission has also recently proposed a modification of three directives in force relating to safety belts.
Secondly, with regard to the issue of road infrastructure, the Commission intends to propose a directive on the guidelines to be adopted by the Member States in order to establish national systems for the identification and management of blackspots, safety audits and minimum rules on information for drivers for application within the trans-European road network.
The point relating to rail crossings, which is one of those raised by Mr Caveri, will be included in the procedures for the management of blackspots and safety audits proposed in this directive.
Finally, I would like to point out that the Commission has recently adopted a new action programme on road safety which includes a specific chapter on the safe transport of goods and passengers.
Apart from the directive approved recently on the training of professional drivers of goods and passengers by road, a legislative proposal is also being prepared, specifically a directive aimed at improving the application of the social provisions on driving and rest periods, as well as working hours.
This directive will lead to a considerable increase in the number of controls for verifying compliance with driving and rest periods.
Although the action programme does not include any specific measure on the construction of coaches, the Commission will carefully study the recommendations of ECBOS research project, which is producing a final report.
This project will make proposals aimed at improving the rules in force and will propose new regulations and standards for the construction of safer buses and coaches, in order, for example, to achieve better protection in the event of accidents involving overturning.
Furthermore, the Commission plans, in the near future, to propose an obligatory system for the approval of vehicles, for coaches and lorries, similar to the one in force for private cars.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over recent months, a series of accidents involving buses, some of them serious, has led to public disquiet and to many bodies now giving their close attention to the question of whether the present rules on bus safety are adequate or whether they have to be made more extensive.
In so doing, they have shed light on the position as regards the law, organisational issues, and the technical state of the art.
To sum all this up, there is a strong common interest in not damaging the buses' image as a basically very safe means of transport, with buses and coaches accounting for only 0.2 deaths per thousand million passenger-kilometres, compared with 6.8 for private cars and 0.6 for railways.
I would not want to let this opportunity go by without expressing my gratitude and appreciation to the many reputable bus companies and their drivers.
It would appear that the consensual view is that what is lacking is primarily attributable to the human factor on the one hand and to the way laws are implemented on the other.
Does the Commission think it possible that the situation may be improved, above all by influencing how people behave in road traffic and within enterprises, but also by the exchange of information?
Secondly, is it not the case that greater use should be made of the opportunities for monitoring vehicles and their drivers, in order to be able to identify those we call the black sheep and make them take responsibility for their actions?
I take the view that, thirdly, checks should be carried out to see whether the standards for testing currently in force are sufficient to ensure that the main examinations and safety tests on buses are carried out to a qualitatively high standard.
As the use of electronic components to ensure the stability and safety of vehicles increases, all the more necessary, I believe, does the regular inspection of this electronic equipment become.
Fourthly, I expect the Commission to give priority to the safety of buses and coaches when it submits its proposal on the Third Action Programme on Road Safety.
Mr President, ladies, gentlemen, and visitors, in the EU's 15 Member States, we tolerate 40 000 deaths on the roads every year.
This situation amounts to a war on Europe's roads, and it cannot be allowed to continue like this.
Over recent months, a series of accidents involving buses has occurred, in which people have died or been severely injured.
I believe this to be an issue with which we should concern ourselves more and more.
Buses and coaches - for which I, as a Green, have a particular fondness - are among the most environmentally friendly ways of travelling, but they must become even safer than they have been to date.
Another reason why we have to give attention to this issue is the fact that we will see much more traffic on the roads in the coming years as a result of the eastward and southward enlargement of Europe.
As shown by the people in the visitors' galleries, bus and coach travel is on the increase, as people make more journeys with them, and so we have to do more to make it safer.
If I may say something about human error, we know that social dumping on the roads presents us with a major problem.
Working times are not adhered to, which is another way of saying that legislation in this area is not stringent enough.
Nor are there enough controls.
I can do no other than appeal to the Italian Presidency of the Council to at last take the Markov report on working hours seriously and give it priority, rather than doing as the Greek Presidency did and putting it on ice for months on end.
Only if we improve working hours will we have better-rested coach drivers on the roads and be able to do something about exhaustion.
This will of course involve more controls, and I am glad that the Commission wants to do something about these.
The second aspect of safety that we have to get to grips with is the requirement to fit seatbelts, which at present applies only to new coaches.
We cannot wait ten or 15 years for coaches to be replaced by new ones.
We have to take action now and make use of all the technical possibilities offered by present-day coaches.
Accidents over recent months have shown that many people have died because they were catapulted out of coaches that had been overturned.
Safety belts will enable us to tackle this, and I hope that both the Commission and the Council of Governments will summon up the energy to do something about this.
Mr President, apart from the accidents in France and Hungary, we also had a terrible accident in Greece just after Easter, in which 21 pupils lost their lives in Tembi, between Thessaloniki and Larissa, while they were on a school trip in a coach.
It was an incident which shook all of us in Greece, it was widely reported in Europe and, together with the other tragic accidents, has brought us to today's debate.
There is, of course, the European Commission's ten-year programme, which we shall also be looking at and commenting on extensively within the framework of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, and there are other ideas which are already referred to in our motion.
It has rightly been stressed that we must look immediately at the question of safety belts.
It has also rightly been stressed that we must look at the question of coach specifications and I welcome the European Commission's position on this point.
However, we must, of course, also look at the question of driving times, because often drivers cannot do their job properly because they are exhausted.
The European Parliament has made a proposal here, which I hope the Council will deal with positively.
I, for my part, want to comment on two individual issues.
The first is the issue of speed limiters.
I highlight this because I myself was rapporteur to the European Parliament.
The legislation exists. And it is up to the governments to apply this specific legislation as quickly as possible.
It has been proven that by limiting speed, especially in the case of large vehicles, we also limit the possibility of accidents and their consequences.
The second thing I want to say, and this concerns the European Commission, has to do with the projects funded under the Community Support Framework.
We will need to pay particular attention to road projects in order to avoid poor workmanship.
I have the particularly sad experience of my own country, where new projects have very serious levels of poor workmanship, which is why they are dangerous and cannot always be used safely.
Consequently, the quality of works needs to be strictly controlled by the European Commission.
The next item is the Commission statement on the fine imposed on the FNSEA and other French federations in the beef sector.
. (ES) Mr President, as you know, on 2 April 2003 the Commission adopted a decision confirming a violation of the competition rules by six federations in the beef sector.
The appropriate fines were imposed to the tune of nearly EUR 17 million.
We are talking about an agreement made in France between four federations of farmers and two federations of abattoirs at the end of 2001.
The agreement consisted of a minimum price commitment and a suspension-restriction of imports from other Member States.
Initially it took the form of a public written agreement and then, once the Commission had sent letters of warning, of a secret oral agreement.
These agreements were made within the context of low prices in the beef market as a result of the crisis in the sector.
On the basis of data communicated by the Directorate-General for Agriculture, the Directorate-General for Competition opened up an investigation and sent demands for information in the middle of November 2001.
On this basis, the Commission - and I would like to stress this - initially did no more than send letters of warning at the end of November 2001.
All the parties to the agreement then assured the Commission, in writing, that they were putting an end to the illegal agreement.
But the Commission found evidence that the parties were maintaining the agreement secretly.
The unannounced inspections carried out in the middle of December 2001 confirmed the Commission's suspicions.
The parties were given the opportunity to present written and oral comments.
The decision adopted on 2 April 2003 concludes, on the basis of a repeated ruling of the Court of Justice, that, firstly, there is a price agreement which violates the provisions of Article 81 of the Treaty and that, secondly, there is an agreement to suspend imports from other Member States, which also violates Community competition rules.
The documentation discovered by the Commission during the course of the investigation demonstrates that, furthermore, all the organisations in question knew that the agreement they were making was illegal and that they were liable for intervention by the competition authorities.
The Commission imposed fines of EUR 12 million on the FNSA, the main French agricultural federation, and of up to EUR 480 000 on one of the federations of abattoirs.
Please allow me to remind you that, in the event of very serious violations of competition rules, the Commission imposes fines of the basic sum for each participant, in principle, of a minimum of EUR 20 million.
The three main criticisms levelled at the Commission's decision are: firstly, that this is an attack on trade union freedoms; secondly, that the fine is excessive, given the context of crisis; and thirdly, the Commission's lack of action over the second mad cow disease crisis.
I will try to respond to these three arguments.
With regard to trade union freedom, the Commission believes that the scope of the decision has been exaggerated.
Trade union freedom is a fundamental freedom, recognised by everybody. The Commission reiterates this in its decision.
But this freedom does not give the right to do absolutely anything: a trade union cannot legitimately make an agreement on prices and import restrictions violating the principles of the common market.
The decision says no more than that.
With regard to the size of the fine, it must be borne in mind that it is set in accordance with the seriousness of the violation and with the aggravating circumstances.
Well, in this case the violation was serious but so were the aggravating circumstances.
In this respect, we should remember that the farmers obliged the abattoirs to sign the illegal agreement through acts of violence.
We must also remember that the parties, having provided assurances that the agreement would not be renewed, in actual fact continued to apply it in secret.
Furthermore, the Commission did take into account the difficult economic context the agricultural sector was working within, the dual crisis of mad cow disease and foot and mouth disease, which Mr BerniÃ© referred to in his speech in this House on 7 April, and, it was precisely as a result of this very unusual context that for the first time the fine has been reduced by 60%, a not inconsiderable percentage.
The third criticism is that it was the Commission itself that did not adopt adequate measures to deal with the mad cow disease crisis.
In this regard, we should remember that the Commission multiplied its measures for market stabilisation.
The intervention mechanisms were used extensively, and the application conditions were increased, specific crisis mechanisms were created to allow the Member States to withdraw from the market additional quantities of channels.
In this way, in a few months, almost 10% of European consumption was withdrawn from the market.
More than EUR 1 billion of the Community budget was used for this operation and, furthermore, the Commission authorised the Member States to grant national aid to the worst affected farmers.
In the case of France, the Commission approved more than EUR 300 million in state aid.
Finally, we should remember that, although the crisis in the beef sector affected the whole of Europe, the Commission is not aware of any parties in any other Member State deeming it necessary to create an illegal cartel.
The decision, which explains the facts as established by the Commission and its illegal conclusions in detail, will be published shortly.
Mr President, Commissioner, when one considers your statement in technical terms, you are certainly right to say that price-fixing and quantity-fixing are offences against equality of competition in the European Union.
Although you do discuss this, the fact remains that livestock farmers were in an extraordinarily difficult situation.
The BSE crisis dealt the market a blow the like of which it had never before experienced, and this is something else for which the Commission has to assume its responsibility.
Let me remind you that this crisis was marked by repeated attempts by the Commission and, to a varying degree, the Council and some of the Member States, to pour oil on troubled waters, which had a negative effect on the market when disaster actually struck.
Let me remind you that it was this House and its investigating committee that had to force the Commission - and to some extent also the Council - to act in order that steps could be taken, not only to make provision for health care and to combat the disease, but also to compensate the farmers.
It is understandable that, in such a situation, people will look for ways of defending themselves, even those that are not legal.
I do not want to defend this, and they must be punished for it, but then we - by which I mean the Commission - must accept our own responsibilities.
Moreover, we must, in addition to the current measures for cleaning up and regulating the market, which you have described, take a good hard look at the agricultural policy.
At that time, the situation was that the 90-head upper limit for bull premiums, which had applied in France, did not apply in other countries - Germany being one of them - so that we were paid premiums for every bull that we could produce, while a limit was in force in France.
This meant that, in France, a stable market developed, and other countries tried very hard to get their exports onto it.
France and the livestock price therefore came under pressure.
This, then, is another area in which the agricultural policy must ensure that conditions are the same, in order that we do not end up with the same premium being paid for the twenty-thousandth bull as was paid for the twentieth.
The alternative is that this measure must apply in all countries.
Let me again remind you that this disparity within the agricultural sector gave rise to major problems, in that it stoked up competition within the agricultural sector.
If then, the Commission wants to avail itself of such penalties, it must always take the conditions into account and keep at least the amount of the penalty in line with them.
Commissioner, I asked the Commission to provide this explanation because I was so shocked at the fine that you wish to impose on French farming unions.
It punishes the unions twice: firstly you punish a sector for its ability to demonstrate initiative, which enabled it to provide assistance for coping with a quite exceptional crisis. You then threaten the very existence of the unions, because the size of the fine is greater than their budget.
The French beef industry employs 200 000 farmers, whose average income is less than EUR 8 000 per year.
In the autumn of 2001, prices fell by more than 45% whereas the price of beef for consumption continued, paradoxically, to rise.
Furthermore, there was no sign of any European solidarity and the French market was saturated by consignments of meat at giveaway prices arriving from other Member States.
In this context of exceptional crisis, there was no longer even a market.
French farming unions decided, with the agreement of the French Minister for Agriculture and of his Ministry, to set a minimum price.
This price was so low that it allowed for no profit margin at all.
There is no way that it was a secret agreement because, on the very evening on which the agreement was signed, the French unions held a press conference.
Despite what one reads in the press, therefore, this was not the setting-up of a cartel; it was instead an act of solidarity to prevent the disappearance of one aspect of farm production: high-quality beef.
If Europe had not failed in its task of ensuring market stability, French farmers would not have needed to take over from it.
In an exceptional crisis, exceptional measures are needed.
To conclude, Commissioner, I should like to ask you a few questions.
Can you specify what measures the Commission took and can you tell me why these measures failed?
Did you really understand the depth of farmers' concern and the risk that a high-quality sector might disappear?
Can you tell me on what basis you set the fine at EUR 16.7 million, a figure that I believe is astronomical?
Do you not think that the Commission's position runs counter to the principle of setting a minimum price?
Lastly, do you not think that in a context in which the farming unions have asked the European Court of Justice to arbitrate, the Commission should try to calm the situation, given the circumstances, by withdrawing these penalties?
Mr President, I totally disagree with your analysis.
We must remember the tragic situation facing the European Union in the autumn of 2001, when the appalling mad cow crisis emerged: exaggerated fears on the part of consumers led to a staggering fall in beef consumption and prices collapsed to unprecedented levels.
Institutional caterers, hypermarkets and slaughterhouses refused to accept beef.
Desperate farmers saw their livestock pile up and their feed stock disappear and threatened public order.
And what proposals did the European Commission come up with?
Feeble and ineffectual measures, which came nowhere near to addressing the scale of the crisis and the troubles that it was causing.
It proposed optional measures for slaughter and destruction, which some Member States did not implement, in particular Germany and the Netherlands, which exported their problems to France and refused to come to the aid of their own farmers.
In this context, the measures adopted in France by common agreement between the public authorities and the farming profession, which consisted of setting, in conjunction with slaughterers, a buying scale at prices that also matched the 'purchase for destruction' prices set by the Commission and of appealing to importers to stop importing beef were perfectly appropriate to the situation and had an immediate calming effect.
The Commission's accusation of an illegal agreement appears, therefore, to be completely out of touch and scandalous, given the seriousness of the situation at the time and, to be quite honest, both absurd and irresponsible.
I therefore urge the Commission to call off this action, which makes no sense and to dedicate all its energies to uncovering the real secret agreements which are the real threats to free competition.
.
(ES) Mr President, clearly Community rules must be applied; the system for calculating fines is regulated and I believe that in this case it has been applied in accordance with the established procedure and - as I have said - the special circumstances were taken into account and more favourable treatment given accordingly.
With regard to what the Commission did to resolve the crisis to which you refer, I mentioned in my initial presentation the sums allocated and the need to act in order to maintain the stability of the market.
Those are the arguments and naturally the Commission's decision will explain all these elements in detail.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon.
The next item is the debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0337/2003 by Mr Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, on the situation in Cambodia on the eve of the general elections of 27 July 2003;
B5-0343/2003 by Mrs J. van den Berg, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the elections in Cambodia;
B5-0346/2003 by Mrs Patricia McKenna, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on Cambodia;
B5-0349/2003 by Mr Hartmut Nassauer, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on Cambodia;
B5-0353/2003 by Mrs Luisa Morgantini, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the situation in Cambodia on the eve of the general elections of 27 July 2003;
B5-0357/2003 by Mr Graham R. Watson, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Cambodia on the eve of the general elections of 27 July 2003.
Mr President, the political situation in Cambodia is complex.
Only this morning, a Dutch aid worker over there told me that he would not know which party he would vote for in the general elections at the end of this month.
His message is clear and fair: Europe must treat all Cambodian parties with the same amount of criticism as we follow their progress to the ballot boxes.
In that sense, I am also waiting for the report of the EU election observers.
Meanwhile, Cambodia is undergoing a transition - from being a country primarily dependent on humanitarian aid to being a regular developing country.
There is still a need for assistance from the European Union.
I have heard very critical comments from the field about the coordination and effectiveness of this European helping hand.
The way to build a better future for the people of Cambodia is through decentralisation and the frequent involvement of co-financing organisations.
In short, the Echo investments, while useful, require a logical sequel in the form of the actual implementation of the EC strategy document for Cambodia.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it must indeed be recalled that an entire people were traumatised by the terrible years under Pol Pot's regime in Cambodia.
Some two million people lost their lives, while an incalculable number were displaced and deported.
Even the wearing of spectacles put your life at risk, and higher education meant that you were doomed.
If, today, you travel through this beautiful tropical country, with its impressive stone buildings that testify to the antiquity of its culture, then, wherever you go, you still come face to face with the physical and mental damage done to a tormented people, who, first, were terrorised by the Khmer Rouge, and then put under the yoke by their Vietnamese liberators, finally achieving a small measure of normality under the UN mandate.
The reason why I have been able to follow this process is that I have visited the country a number of times and was one of the many who observed the elections in 1998.
I might add that nowhere else in the world are there so many households headed by a woman in comparison to those headed by a man.
Even more than the women, it was their sons, husbands and brothers who fell victim to a system that held human life in contempt and in violent conflicts, including American bombs and Vietnamese landmines, which, time and time again, blew people to their deaths or left them gravely wounded - something that they continue to do.
What is left is poverty, need, a people torn up by their roots, and - it has to be said - a certain willingness to resort to violence.
The latter is now, of course, being manifested in the run-up to the elections, but I do believe that it has to be made clear - as has been unambiguously stated by, among others, the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Cambodia - that the situation is proving to be less hazardous than it once was, and the organisation 'Asian Network for Free Elections' notes a marked decrease in violence in comparison to previous elections.
As regards these elections, it will be very important that we keep an eye on how things develop before they are held, for it is clear that they will not pass without any friction whatever.
Nor, I believe, can we expect them to do so in view of the history on which this country can look back.
If, though, we can help to strengthen the forces of democracy in it, and deeply impress upon the population the significance of democratic elections, we will have taken an important step towards creating, in this region, something of an enclave journeying towards democracy, for we have to concede that conditions in neighbouring countries are no better - indeed, they tend to be even worse.
I therefore hope that Cambodia will find its way to democracy, a way to be humane and a way to renounce violence, and will be able to lead its neighbours by example.
Mr President, one of the big concerns is that since January apparently at least 15 people, mostly opposition supporters, have been killed in violence related to the forthcoming election in July.
When we in the ASEAN delegation were in Cambodia not so long ago, we met with some of the opposition parties and some of them were going to funerals of their members who had been killed.
This situation is completely unacceptable.
The human rights situation and standards have not improved in Cambodia in the last 10 years and human rights organisations have routinely pointed out that their big concern remains impunity for the perpetrators of human rights violations, notably members of the police and the military.
The only successful prosecution in Cambodia dates back to 1993, when under the UN administration someone was charged and sentenced; that was a Mr Ten Seng, who is still working as deputy chief in the prison where he committed his crimes.
There is also grave concern for the Vietnamese Montagnard refugees, who are still being returned to Vietnam to face ill treatment and unfair trials.
This was brought up before in this Parliament.
The legal safeguards exist but they are not being respected in Cambodia.
There is a provision to outlaw the use of torture and to provide mechanisms and safeguards within the judicial and penal system against different forms of ill treatment and to ensure sanctions towards the perpetrators.
That problem however, is still not being solved because there is a disregard for the existing safeguards.
I would hope that a new or future government and parliament would ensure respect for these laws and ensure that this kind of situation cannot continue.
There must be total freedom there.
It is also very important that the new future government or parliament will ensure the former leaders of the Khmer Rouge are put on trial.
It is quite incredible to think that these people are still getting off scot-free for mass abuses of human rights.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a new parliament is to be elected in Cambodia on 27 July, and some twenty political parties want to take part in this election.
That is in itself an indication of some degree of progress towards democracy.
At the end of the day, of course, what counts is the way in which these elections are conducted, as well as what happens before and after them, and whether the process is fair and deserves to be described as democratic.
It is this that we have good reasons to doubt.
Violence continues to overshadow the preparations for the election; opposition politicians are intimidated, two of them having been murdered in June alone.
Everything demonstrates the total power wielded by the autocratic Communist Party, which evidently cannot reconcile itself to the idea that other parties have to exist.
Rules on local elections are infringed, as a rule by the local authorities, and such breaches go unpunished.
The quality of a democracy depends on freedom of access to the media, above all to the electronic media, something that is not guaranteed, not least because the latter continue to be under the control of the Cambodian People's Party and the Prime Minister, Hun Sen, or of organisations and persons associated with it.
The European Union is sending observers to monitor the Cambodian elections.
To do so makes no sense unless they are able to do their work unhindered, and the country's government must ensure that they are able to do so.
By demanding all these things, we are not in some way illicitly interfering in the country's internal affairs, but are acting on the basis of a cooperation agreement, Article 1 of which states in clear terms that respect for the principles of democracy and for basic human rights are among the elements of this agreement and that they must be adhered to by both parties.
Since 1992, the European Union has been deeply involved in Cambodia.
Having invested some EUR 250 million in the country, we can legitimately make certain demands as regards the fairness of elections.
We therefore demand that the Cambodian Government should put an end to the violence and prevent the intimidation of opposition politicians and their parties.
Our further demand of the Cambodian authorities is that they should ensure that these elections can be held freely and without interference.
Cambodia has a horrifying and violent past.
The Cambodian people deserve a peaceful future.
This is why it is of great importance that the forthcoming elections should proceed in a fair and peaceful manner.
Moreover, the mass slaughterers should not escape their sentences.
My group has concerns on both counts.
We are receiving many reports on atrocities being committed in connection with the elections.
The Cambodian People's Party is omnipresent and the authorities go out of their way to intimidate the people, particularly at local level.
It seems that they can do this undisturbed and unpunished.
The electronic media are also in the hands of Prime Minister Hun Sen's party.
My group is particularly anxious that Sam Rainsy's party will not be given a fair chance as a result.
Given his great courage and his merits in respect of a democratic Cambodia, Sam Rainsy deserves the Sakharov prize.
The human rights situation is still bad.
It is also regrettable indeed that, despite considerable amounts of European aid, economic and social development is stagnating.
We are in favour of linking this aid to progress in the field of pluralism, human rights and free elections.
After all, democratisation and prosperity cannot be seen in isolation from one another.
We have to put the past behind us by doing now what is necessary to ensure a rich future for the poor Cambodian people.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, Cambodia is also important to its neighbours such as Vietnam and Laos in particular which, as Mrs Junker said, are facing much more serious situations.
I would like to thank all my fellow Members because I believe that this is a good resolution.
Having said that, it always comes back to the question of whether the glass is half full or half empty: as it happens, Mr Nassauer sees the glass as half empty and Mrs Junker sees it as half full.
Whatever the truth, I believe that the most important thing now is the elections.
The national electoral commission has set good standards and is doing a remarkable job.
We too have come a long way.
In January and February the situation was extremely worrying.
Violence is still taking place today.
If, however, we compare the situation today with what happened at the last elections, things are better.
It is true that access to the media is not perfect, but it is better.
This is where our resolution is so important: we must remain extremely vigilant so that between now and 27 July, the situation remains positive and elections that are as democratic as possible are able to take place.
. (ES) Mr President, the Commission has listened carefully to your speeches and the various contributions made to this debate.
We believe that the coming national elections will be a key moment in the development and consolidation of the democratic system in this country.
The Union is firmly committed to supporting this process, which will be backed up by the presence of international observers.
It is true, however, that in this regard we share Parliament's concern that the existence of acts of political violence and the creation of a climate of interference and impunity at the moment is creating tensions in relation to this electoral process.
Violence prior to elections is an issue which has been pointed out and highlighted by the Union during the elections of 1998 and 2002 and, although the majority of observers agree that the level of violence seems to be diminishing, there is still concern about its impact on the electoral process.
The Commission sincerely hopes that the measures adopted by the authorities to ensure that the law is complied with, without intimidation, harassment or violence, will have a positive effect and I can assure you that, in this regard, the Commission, in close coordination with the Member States, is continuing to monitor the process closely, in order to try to ensure that these situations do not arise.
The Commission is also concerned about the need for press freedom in order to overcome the difficulties resulting from a public media which is firmly controlled by the government.
In this regard, the Commission is insisting on the effective application of the positive measures adopted by the Cambodian authorities, and in particular by the national electoral committee, with regard to the media during the period prior to the elections.
There is no doubt that this issue will be of particular interest and concern to the European Union's mission of electoral observers, which began on 11 June, with the arrival of the basic team, headed by Mr Evans: 36 European observers have already arrived in Cambodia and 70 additional observers should arrive on 22 July.
The head of the mission of electoral observers will make a preliminary statement immediately after the elections.
With regard to our capacity for action in Cambodia, I must point out that the National Indicative Programme 2002-2004 allows us, by means of contributing resources, to try to have an influence on the processes of democratisation in the country.
In this regard, the whole concept of governance has been treated as a fundamental horizontal and transversal issue, in all areas of cooperation.
So far, we have allocated EUR 10 million to this field, which have allowed us, in particular, to support the electoral process.
All of these elements reflect the commitment of the Community and the Commission in the field of human rights and democracy, as demonstrated by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, which has treated Cambodia as one of the fundamental target countries for this experiment.
The NGOs, selected by means of invitations to tender, are acting as one of the main channels for the implementation of actions, within the context of this initiative, which are directly benefiting the Cambodian population.
These are the elements on which we are working, and this is the way we believe progress can be made on this process of consolidation and on achieving the fairest possible elections which will allow us to take a step forward in pursuit of this objective which we all share.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0336/2003 by Mr Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, on Laos;
B5-0345/2003 by Mrs Pervenche BerÃšs, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the arrests of European journalists, an American translator and their local companions;
B5-0348/2003 by Mrs Patricia McKenna, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the arrests of European journalists, an American translator and their local companions;
B5-0350/2003 by Mr Hartmut Nassauer, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on Laos;
B5-0354/2003 by Mrs Pernille Frahm, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the arrests of journalists in Laos;
B5-0356/2003 by Mrs Anne AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the arrests of Mr Faliste, Mr Reynaud, Mr Mua and four citizens of Laos, and on the general situation in Laos.
'For almost thirty years now, these people have been hunted down like wild animals' was the judgment of a journalist who managed to work his way through to the Hmong people.
In the northern mountainous region, many of the 300 000 'forgotten people of Laos' are still bearing the brunt of the Communist regime's vengeance.
Their political choice during the Vietnam War was considered 'treason' and is still an anathema justifying the present reign of terror.
The show trial and the absurd sentencing in Phonsavan of a French and a Belgian journalist and an American Hmong pastor is no isolated incident.
Cut off from the outside world, Vientiane is trying to break this people.
It appears that interest in, and recognition of, the conflict with the Hmong is unwelcome.
As such, Laos features on the obscure list of countries that commit serious breaches in respect of freedom of religion.
The Christian minority, in particular, is harshly persecuted, and their religion is even prohibited.
This violation of individual freedom and personal dignity cannot be justified in the name of any culture or country.
With the present resolution, I would therefore call on the Laotian authorities to end their repression against Hmong and other, particularly Christian, minorities with immediate effect.
Failure to respond to this request should prompt the Council and the Commission to reconsider every aspect of relations with Laos.
Mr President, Commissioner, the right to information is a fundamental right and freedom, which guarantees the continuation and the strengthening of peace and democracy in the world.
Once again, these rights have been flouted and today we are forced to condemn the situation in Laos.
Since 5 June, two journalists, one French and the other Belgian, have been imprisoned, together with their guides, in Vientiane in Laos.
They were arrested in the Xieng Khuang province whilst reporting on the situation of the Hmong minority.
After a trial that bordered on the farcical, on 30 June, Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud were sentenced to 15 years in prison for 'obstructing an official in the performance of his duties', as the case against them described it.
This fallacious charge on the one hand and the sentence handed down, on the other, contravene the provisions of the Laotian criminal code.
Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud were in fact convicted simply for carrying out their work as journalists and cameramen, filming a group of mountain people who have been hounded for years by an authoritarian regime that flouts every principle of democracy.
The resolution that we propose Parliament should adopt and which we urge its President to convey to the Laotian authorities and to all member countries of ASEAN calls first for the immediate release of the two journalists and their guides; secondly, for international conventions to be applied, including the convention adopted by French-speaking countries in the Bamako declaration, which Laos has ratified, in order to protect the rights of journalists, particularly those reporting in conflict zones. Thirdly, the resolution calls for the immediate suspension of all policies of persecution and repression towards the Hmong people and other minorities in Laos; and fourthly, for all economic cooperation between the EU and Laos to be reviewed, as soon as possible and with the European Parliament being kept informed, as provided for in the agreements to which our resolution refers.
I believe, Mr President, and I wish to state, on behalf of my entire group, that we cannot continue to assist and maintain relations with countries which, in full view of the whole world, breach human rights.
It is one of our responsibilities as the European Parliament to condemn things that are totally unacceptable and to say so relentlessly.
Mr President, the arrest of the European journalists and their Laotian companions raises grave concerns: first, about the freedom of the press.
If one looks at what has happened since, there have been restrictions on access to people in prison, their place of detention has been kept secret for more than a week now.
Clearly the trials did not respect their rights under international law.
They did not get a fair trial.
The situation in Laos is quite alarming.
Not only are these people suffering, but so is the rest of the country.
People's rights are not being respected: their civil, political and religious rights are not being respected.
There are no rights, for example, for people in prison.
Many of these people are unjustifiably in prison.
They do not have visitation rights.
This morning we met with a delegation from Laos.
The evidence that they gave us raised serious concerns.
Some speakers have said that we need to reconsider our relationship with Laos if the authorities do not take notice of the situation in their own country.
It is clear that there should be an immediate release of these journalists.
There should be freedom of the press.
They need to end the persecution of the Hmong and other minorities.
It must stop.
The court case was also criticised by Washington.
They called it a farce.
They called for a fair trial.
We need to be very careful here in respect of who is pointing the finger at whom, considering that Washington is responsible for the Guantanamo Bay issue.
Those people have not had a fair trial, nor have they had legitimate charges posed against them.
I doubt that this would happen in the European Union.
The Americans need to look at what they are doing before they point a finger at anyone else.
Mr President, important though they are, minorities and European journalists are not the sole foci of our attention today; our concern is with the people of Laos themselves.
Laos is an ancient kingdom and very rich in culture; it was, as a country, peaceful and tolerant, which, in the days when it was a kingdom, was a threat to nobody.
I am glad that the Laotian royal family are present with us today.
In the course of the twentieth century, the country became a victim - firstly of colonialism, then of the Second World War and, last but not least, of the conflict between East and West.
It was brutally wrecked by Communist occupation.
It must be clear to us that, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, our task is to ensure that Laos becomes a flourishing democratic country rather than ending up as a museum of real-life socialism.
We therefore declare that human rights and the rule of law need to be reinforced, that freedom of faith and conscience need to be respected, and that political prisoners must be set free.
As a matter of priority, Laos must become freely accessible to the media, so that the world can learn what is actually going on there, and so that the country's continuing deficiencies are not hidden from it.
We in the European Union seek cooperation with Laos.
We will abide by the trade and cooperation agreement if the human rights to which it refers are respected, but if this human rights clause is disregarded and treated as nothing but a joke, then we will have to put a question mark against our cooperation - with the regime rather than with the Laotian people - and make it perfectly clear that, while trade, business and cooperation are necessary, they are founded upon law, underpinned by human rights and by the values on which our global community depends.
It is for that reason that we make it our concern that Laos should once more be free, democratic and under the rule of law.
Mr President, we have just been informed by Reuters that the Laos Government is prepared to pardon the two journalists and the American interpreter who were arrested on 4 June and sentenced, on 30 June, to fifteen years in prison for unproven acts, which caused widespread indignation.
I have here the communiquÃ©, dated 1.30.p.m: 'the Laotian Minister for Foreign Affaires awaits a request from the governments of the countries from which the three men come: Belgium, France and the United States, for their pardon' - which will of course be granted if this has not already been done.
We can only welcome the effective role played by our Ministers for Foreign Affairs and by the diplomats in the area, a role which, without a shadow of a doubt, has led to the prisoners' imminent release.
Although we rejoice in the outcome of these actions, we remain extremely concerned at the fate of the four Laotians who were accompanying Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud and who, we are told, could face a sentence of twenty years in prison.
We also appeal to the clemency of the Laotian Government.
Too many journalists have paid with their lives or have been given stiff prison sentences for having done their job, which is to inform people.
We recall that freedom of expression is a fundamental right.
We expect the Commission and the Council to support the actions of our diplomats and we hope that our European office in the region will intervene to ensure that the four Laotian citizens are also released.
We wish to state, Mr President, before this House, all our solidarity with the journalists and with their families, who have been through such a hard time and assure them that the European Parliament, the guardian of freedom, will relentlessly defend the right to a free press, the right to free information and, more than ever, human rights, whatever regime is in power.
Mr President, there are reasons to feel deeply concerned about the physical and mental health of the detained journalists, the priest and the four Laotian citizens.
Their names and locations have not been published.
At the same time, we know that, on Monday 30 June of this year, they were sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, without their right to a defence being respected, for having, it was said, impeded an officer in the performance of his duties.
When we, here in the European Parliament, draw attention to the lack of democratic rights in Laos, we urge the authorities in that country to ensure compliance with the country's constitution that purports to guarantee religious freedom and freedom for religious groups.
We call upon the authorities in Laos immediately to put a stop to all policies involving the persecution and oppression of the Hmong people, other minorities in Laos and Christian population groups.
We also call upon the authorities in Laos to give the Red Cross permission to visit the political prisoners in order to assure themselves of their physical well-being.
We also believe that the Commission should investigate whether it is appropriate to continue with the ongoing cooperation with the authorities in Laos and that it should report to Parliament on this issue.
We request of the European Parliament that, if the imprisoned journalists have not been freed before then, the problem be added to the agenda of the next meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Allow me also to protest against the fact that the Laotian constitution has, in practice, wordings that impede religious freedom in the country by banning all acts that give rise to religious division or lead to a general division among the people.
Under these laws, 60 Christians were arrested in 2002, and an active campaign to close churches was conducted between 1999 and 2001.
Mr President, in the world rankings for freedom of the press compiled by Reporters sans frontiÃšres, Laos occupies the unenviable place of 133rd out of 140.
To give you some indication, Italy comes 40th, after Benin and South Korea.
In Laos, the media remains entirely in the hands of the only political party and its parliament is taking its time over adopting a law that will allow private media ownership, which was promised in 2001.
There is still no news of the five leaders of the October 1999 movement who have disappeared, including Thongpaseuth Kenakoun, the author of several articles and pamphlets on the situation in Laos and the need for democratic reform.
The case of Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud is not, therefore, a judicial accident.
It has arisen in a climate of ongoing breaches of human rights and the scandalous verdict that sentenced them to fifteen years in prison on 1 July raises at least two questions.
The first is that of the freedom of the press in general, which as we have seen is often flouted, even in Europe.
This freedom is one of the pillars of democracy and we must defend it at all costs.
The second issue concerns the democratic clause of the cooperation agreements, which could often be described as a clause in form only: a hollow shell.
Can we expect Europe to be taken seriously, however, when, having signed an agreement, it does not ensure that this clause is respected, by means of appropriate sanctions?
We know, as Mrs AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard has confirmed, that the joint pressure exerted by Belgium, France, the United States and the European Union will probably lead to the release of Falise, Reynaud and Naw Karl Mua, which will be a relief for everyone.
I call on Parliament, however, also to call for the release of Thao Moua, Tha Char Yang, the two guides, Pa Phue Khang, their driver, and a fourth, unknown Laotian, because they are neither reporters nor foreigners.
They are simply Laotians.
The sentences they received range from 12 to 20 years in prison and we cannot, Mr President, wash our hands of them.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to welcome their Royal Highnesses of Laos, who have taken their seats in the galleries, the Members of the Laotian royal family, the president of the Laotian movement for human rights and the president of the Hmong community in France.
I also wish to acknowledge their struggle, because it is as a result of that struggle that we in this Parliament are able to work; as a result of their tireless fight for democracy, for the rule of law, for freedom and also for national reconciliation in their country.
I think that everything has been said in this debate and Mrs de Keyser was right to insist on this point: Mrs AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard's news about the likely release of the Belgian, French and American journalists does not mean that the four Laotians who were accompanying them will be released; they will end up spending 10, 15 or 20 years in the gaols of Vientiane.
This business involving the journalists is the umpteenth such occurrence, the umpteenth proof that the situation in Laos is extremely serious, that this regime is totally corrupt, that this regime should be investigated by Interpol and all the international financial bodies, due to the scale of its trafficking, and that the European Union should change its policy vis-Ã -vis Laos.
Every complacent policy simply strengthens the extremist elements in the Laotian regime.
We must, by adopting a firm policy, do what we can to encourage those within the regime who wish to work towards a policy of democratisation, towards a policy of reconciliation.
This is crucial.
We have instruments in place; we give Laos EUR 160 million per year under trade agreements in the textile sector alone.
We have dozens of cooperation projects running.
We must undertake a very thorough assessment and tell the Laotian regime that, unless they undertake specific and practical reforms in the fields of justice, information, economics and politics, we will end all forms of cooperation.
. (ES) Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that the Commission generally supports the European Parliament's joint motion for a resolution which we are debating.
Secondly, with regard to the issue of the European journalists arrested, Mr Falise and Mr Reynaud, this issue is being dealt with at bilateral level by France and Belgium.
The European Union's ministerial troika, however, has had the opportunity to talk bilaterally through the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Laos, on the occasion of the recent Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum in Phnom Penh on 19 June.
The Commission is in close contact with the French Embassy and with the Belgian Consulate in Vientiane, and with other Member States with local representation or accredited in Bangkok, and the Commission has held an informal meeting with top officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Laos.
Of course, the Commission supports the diplomatic actions taken by the Member States in question to find a satisfactory solution to this case, a solution which - we agree with Mrs AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard - can only be found by means of a diplomatic and political solution.
Furthermore, we are prepared to take any necessary action to put pressure on the government of Laos at European Union level.
We do not, however, consider it useful to include an issue of this type on an agenda of a different nature, such as the meetings of ASEAN, since we do not believe it to be appropriate to raise this issue in high-level multilateral meetings.
We hope that the news given earlier by Mrs AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard will eventually lead to a good result.
A final comment on the general human rights situation in Laos and our position.
The Commission is closely monitoring the situation by means of our delegation in Vientiane and we are going to continue to analyse the human rights situation and its possible impact on the EC-Laos cooperation programme in view of the joint EC-Laos committee scheduled for next autumn.
In this regard, the Commission is always prepared to discuss this issue with the European Parliament.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0344/2003 by Mr Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation in Uganda;
B5-0347/2003 by Mrs Nelly Maes, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in Uganda;
B5-0351/2003 by Mr Mario Mauro, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on violations of human rights in Northern Uganda;
B5-0352/2003 by Mrs Yasmine Boudjenah, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the situation in Uganda;
B5-0355/2003 by Mr Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the kidnapping of children by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA);
B5-0358/2003 by Mrs Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on violations of human rights in Northern Uganda.
Mr President, until recently I believed that Uganda was one of the better African states in terms of human rights.
A fortnight ago Amnesty International, as part of Refugee Week, arranged for MEPs to be partnered with refugees for a day.
The reason for doing this was simply to allow politicians to understand at first hand the experiences of people who become refugees and to listen to why they had to escape from their home countries.
I had the privilege to meet a Ugandan refugee living in Scotland whose name is Innocent Jakisa.
He has been given refugee status to stay permanently in the United Kingdom.
His story was shocking.
I do not have the time to go into detail here.
He was not from the north of the country but was a disabled rights activist who spoke out against his government.
That is why Paragraph 5 of the resolution, calling on the Ugandan Government to introduce good governance and political pluralism, is absolutely vital.
Freedom of speech is essential for democracy.
Uganda has come a long way from the brutal dictatorship of Idi Amin, but there is still much to do.
The fact that there are no political parties in Uganda should be a cause for concern to us in the EU and although the president is supposed to lift this 17-year ban on multi-party democracy, subject to referendum, this process needs to be closely monitored by the EU.
As for the substance at hand in the resolution, the treatment of children in the northern part of Uganda is of serious concern.
Only a few weeks ago, a number of schoolgirls were abducted by the brutal rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army.
If they are not found their fate will be one of sex slaves to militia commanders.
According to Jo Becker of Human Rights Watch: 'The increase in abductions is dramatic and alarming.'
More children have been taken in the last ten months than in any previous year of the conflict.
Since the military offensive by the Ugandan Government, in just over a year, it is estimated that 5 000 children have been abducted.
In the year before it was less than 100.
In the 17 years of conflict between the Ugandan Government and the LRA, it is estimated that 20 000 children have been abducted.
Much needs to be done.
I hope that in future the children of Uganda will be able to live peacefully and that people like Innocent will have their human rights respected.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall continue where Mrs Stihler left off due to a lack of time.
She is right to denounce the serious situation in the north of Uganda, with a huge number of abductions of children who are used as child soldiers, sex slaves and carriers; in short, children who, under death threats and in life-threatening circumstances, are kept in slavery or are even required to kill.
Responsibility for this lies in various quarters.
It has already been stated here that the Ugandan Government is no soft touch.
It would be useful if the European Union looked closely at all unchecked budgetary aid that goes to Uganda, from the Member States and from us, because Uganda is no model state.
There may have been progress in a number of areas, but the reports of systematic cases of torture deserve a close inquiry.
This applies, for example, to the cause of death of a certain Mr Murisidi, who died in a police cell.
The government of Uganda leaves the population at the mercy of the terror of the 'Lord's Resistance Army'.
It is unable to guarantee the safety of the people of the northern province and neither has it succeeded in involving the LRA in peace talks, despite increased military expenditure on the part of Uganda and despite Uganda's military presence in the east of Congo where their presence is apparently more lucrative.
The government of Sudan, however, does not get off scot-free either.
Sudan denies any responsibility in the crimes of the LRA's rebels.
It is obvious that these receive weapons from the Sudanese army itself.
I have the testimony of religious leaders who described in detail a huge arms delivery, in mid-March 2003, of bombs, various types of grenades, and hundreds of boxes containing everything from bullets to uniforms.
It is clear that, as long as the LRA is armed, they will shoot, kill, and abduct children rather than negotiate peace.
Mr President, I am deputising for Mr Mauro, the author of the resolution.
The escalation of the conflict in northern Uganda is reaching unprecedented levels and is causing a genuine humanitarian crisis.
Approximately a million people have been displaced in Acholiland and in the Lango and Iteso regions.
At the beginning of the year, the Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative seemed to have achieved unmatchable results.
A number of meetings were held between the religious leaders and the rebels; a presidential peace commission was even set up with many responsibilities; the LRA and the government called for a cease-fire.
In May, for the first time, the Consultative Group Meeting discussed the crisis in northern Uganda as a national issue, and there were substantial contributions from civil society.
Despite these small rays of hope, the conflict has been deteriorating severely over the past two months.
For the first time since the start of this distressing affair, rebel activity has intensified and has carried on for over six months, breaking the traditional mould of cycles of violence which initially took the form of brief raids rather than permanent conflict.
Recently, it has become clear from the LRA's order to attack Catholic missions that the Sudanese Government has renewed its support for the LRA, providing sophisticated heavy armaments.
Joseph Kony, the leader of the so-called Lord's Resistance Army, spoke again last Monday, telling his men to kill mercilessly anyone who comes within range, including the elderly and children, to spare only pregnant women, to kill priests and missionaries in cold blood and to beat up nuns in cold blood.
The crazy orders were given over the frequency used by the network of two-way radios belonging to the Catholic missions of northern Uganda.
Indeed, the rebels are able to use the same two-way radios in their internal communications as those used by missionaries for they have plundered numerous Catholic parish churches in recent months.
Moreover, despite the fact that the humanitarian situation is getting worse and that rebel activity is clearly on the increase, the Ugandan Government has announced that the situation is still under control.
In this regard, I must highlight the prodigious efforts of the European Commission to help these people, not least through monitoring in the field.
At this confusing time, marked by violence, terror and war, the real danger is that of resorting to weapon-power as the only way of addressing this serious situation.
Moreover, there is also the risk that the international community and citizens will hide behind indifference, treating this disaster as the concern of the Acholi people alone.
We have to take notice of the cries of the people and the leaders of Acholiland: sadly, their story has already proven that peace can never be achieved by forcing a people into submission.
Commissioner, Mr President, I have to say that I am rather annoyed.
The issues that are addressed under the emergency procedure, and today provides yet another example of this, deal with extremely important matters.
I would, therefore, like us to consider the possibility of not always tabling human rights for Thursday afternoon, when only a few Members are present.
I believe that issues as serious as human rights and freedom of expression deserve that this item be moved from time to time to a more suitable point on the agenda, when more Members are present.
Turning to Uganda, this country has for a long time been considered to be a window onto development in East Africa.
Today, however, it is the worst location for attacks on physical integrity and for breaches of human rights.
Yesterday's slaves were kidnapped, thrown into ships' holds and traded for goods or money.
Having cleared their consciences - particularly in Durban where they condemned slavery as a crime against humanity - western countries ended up forgetting that other forms of slavery still exist.
Today, slaves do not wear chains or work in cotton fields, slavery does not need the colour issue to stamp its authority more thoroughly on black people whose souls have been destroyed.
No!
Slavery today takes the form of so-called resistance armies that claim to serve self-proclaimed 'lords' and all of this results in the tragedy with which we are familiar today: that of child soldiers.
Child soldiers, it should be pointed out, are children who, as Kourouma explains very well in his book, are forced to kill a member of their family in order to become a child soldier.
They are sexually exploited, as has already been said.
There are around 20 000 such children in Uganda today and one reason why this tragedy is allowed to happen is that a whole host of countries is giving logistical, financial and military assistance to countries such as Sudan and Uganda.
I wish to say that in this regard too, I have the feeling that our own policies employ double standards.
A few weeks ago, I visited Togo, a country to which, perhaps rightly, we have refused to give aid in the fields of health and education.
It is, therefore, being punished.
At the same time, a country such as Uganda is being supported by the United States.
At the same time, conventions that we have signed up to, such as 'Everything but Arms', are not being duly applied in Uganda, where arms trading still goes on throughout the country.
I wish I could be sure that all the conventions on trade on the ground, of weapons in particular, were being properly implemented in countries such as Uganda.
I also wish I could be sure that the various conventions that we have signed are more than just labels to ease our consciences, because signing up to the convention protecting the rights of the child or to an entire set of conventions intended to protect basic rights does not mean that we can carry on acting as if nothing were wrong.
If the serious attacks on human rights, the breaches of children's rights and the murders are the everyday lot of Ugandans, we must shoulder our responsibilities.
This does not mean conducting a policy that employs double standards; it means real sanctions and monitoring the aid with which we provide that country.
The situation in northern Uganda has been appalling for years.
Does the Ugandan Government's failure to exercise any military power result from unwillingness, from powerlessness or from both?
In any event, the Ugandan troops that are currently stationed in Congo must move to that region, because they only have other intentions in Congo.
There is total anarchy in northern Uganda, and the 'Lord's Army' does everything that God forbids.
It is inconceivable that these incredible villains can continue to descend on schools and kidnap women and children in order to turn them into sex slaves or forced soldiers.
Prisoners are forced to kill or torture one another if they try to escape.
For far too long now, the international community has been standing idly by; the atrocities simply carry on without hindrance.
The African Union is losing face by doing nothing, and it is high time that the Security Council got involved.
Sudan has announced it will no longer provide aid to the 'Lord's Army', but my group is not at all convinced that Sudan will keep its word.
To top it all, the threat of war with Rwanda hangs over the region.
How does the Commission assess this threat of war?
In addition, there is the question of what the European Union is prepared to do to protect the population there and provide humanitarian aid.
It is high time that the appalling rule of the 'Lord's Army' was brought to an end.
Mr President, we are devastated by the reports we hear about Uganda and the appalling acts of cruelty committed there.
When one sees all that is perpetrated by the loathsome armed sect which calls itself the 'Lord's Army', one is inclined to think that the Ugandan army had enough work to do when it comes to guaranteeing peace and security in its own country, without sowing discord and strife in neighbouring countries, where it intervenes to promote the interests of the great powers, economic and tribal interests, and so on and so forth.
It is, however, lamentable that, even if the Ugandan army were to concentrate on Uganda, that would not resolve the problem, as the Ugandan army and government are part of the problem rather than a means of dealing with it.
That is why we need a clear-cut policy here.
We must first see to it that the Sudanese attacks on Uganda, along with other interventions by outsiders, are stopped; then, secondly, we also have to get the Ugandans to put a stop to their own incursions into neighbouring countries; thirdly, Uganda needs to make a start on using the police and armed forces, under the rule of law, to do away with the criminal elements, a process that must go hand in hand with a process of reconciliation and negotiation, leading progressively to the setting up in Uganda of something like genuine democracy and the rule of law.
This country has had much to endure under various dictators, through several wars, and at the hands of diverse criminal elements.
It is vitally necessary to restore the precarious balance between the tribes and ethnic groups of this country, whose diversity is known to us from the days of the Kingdom of Buganda under the Kabaka, which also includes many, many other ancient kingdoms and tribes and will have a democratic future only on the basis of the rule of law and if the balance of races and ethnic groups is carefully maintained.
Mr President, I am not completely happy with the resolution.
First of all it says that the LRA has a complex political agenda.
The agenda is one insane man pretending to receive messages from the Holy Spirit that he should rule Uganda according to the Ten Commandments.
Since this agenda has no public appeal, Kony abducts children to lead his war.
He has no intention whatever of negotiating with anyone about a ceasefire.
The only way to stop the atrocities is to make sure that Kony has no way of receiving arms.
Nevertheless it is a fact that the Sudanese commander has supplied Kony with massive amounts of arms, which has enabled him to carry out the recent abductions.
Even if the Sudanese Government has no part in this, it is responsible for its army's actions.
I therefore urge Sudan to ensure that none of Sudan's armed forces will ever again be able to arm the LRA and bring about the unspeakable suffering of thousands of children.
. (ES) Mr President, we share the view that, despite having gone on for so long, the crisis in Uganda is to a certain extent a forgotten one.
The Commission is therefore pleased with Parliament's initiative to expose the suffering of the people of that region.
We agree with Parliament that we must condemn the campaign of terror being carried out by the Lord's Resistance Army, with its murders and kidnappings.
The lack of security created by its activity is a significant obstacle to humanitarian aid, since it restricts access and endangers both the humanitarian aid workers and the civilian population, in addition to all the other problems you have pointed out very effectively.
You have raised the issue of what the Union is doing.
At the moment the Union is providing significant humanitarian assistance and support, by means of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), in so far as the security measures allow it.
The assistance is being provided in the form of health care and food support, increasing the availability of drinking water and improving the sanitation system, providing seed and tools, in order to guarantee food security, and distributing basic necessities such as shelters and blankets.
This week, the Director of ECHO has been in the area participating in the tasks of increasing our resources, in order to deal with the current needs, and the assistance we are providing this year will be equivalent to EUR 4 million, double that of last year, and it will be increased by a further 2 million.
Providing aid is clearly not everything, however.
We will also have to see to what extent this aid can be used as a lever for achieving other results.
The main donor countries are holding a dialogue with the Ugandan Government in order to promote a policy in the north to facilitate the full integration of the northern districts into the rest of the country.
The Commission's delegation is chairing the group of donors which is studying the problems affecting the northern region and, especially, trying to resolve the problem of the children.
We are naturally using the lever of financial resources to make progress in the right direction.
The first tranche of budgetary aid, from the Eighth European Development Fund (EDF), was released once the condition not to spend more than 2% of the total budget for military purposes was fulfilled, and the decision to release further tranches will depend on what agreement can be reached with the government of Uganda on the appropriate conditions for its use.
Furthermore, the Commission is preparing, together with the government, a programme for the rehabilitation of the north, a particularly difficult area.
We believe that the difference in standard of living between the north and the rest of the country is one of the fundamental causes, as well as the consequence, of the persistent instability and insecurity.
However, we believe that, if we had other external support, our actions would be much more effective.
The Commission would therefore be very glad to see greater involvement by the African Union in the efforts to find a lasting solution to the problem, which would then allow us to deal with the problems faced in other areas which you have referred to in your speeches.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
Mr President, the resolution contains a slight inaccuracy: it talks about 'before' and 'after' the electoral period.
Since the electoral period has started, it should say 'during' and 'after' the electoral period.
Mr President, I would in fact like to put an oral amendment, or, as it might better be termed, a supplementary motion, namely that something should be inserted as Q a (new).
As printed in the joint text, Q has to do with the repression of Christian groupings and of Buddhist monks, but it is worthy of note that Islamic teachers have also suffered repression.
My group takes the view that, if we are to mention certain individual groups, we should also refer to all of those who suffer, or have suffered, repression.
That is why we want to add to it.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has indicated to me its willingness to accept this, and I believe that the other groups are able to do likewise.
I will now quote the oral amendment, of which you have the English version.
It is as follows:
Qa. ...
Mr President, I ask you to accept the inclusion of this additional clause.
Mr President, Article 12 proposes to call for a NEC (National Electoral Commission) meeting to be included on the agenda, as the representative of the Commission stated.
I do not believe this would be appropriate.
Since Laos is not a member of this Parliament, we could instead ask for the ASEAN assembly to be informed.
This is not exactly ASEAN's role, but at least Laos is a member of that body and we could take this matter to ASEAN, if the House agrees.
Furthermore, the original text contains a mistake, Mr President.
It talks about 'the American journalist'.
It should instead say 'the American interpreter', since that is what he was.
. (FR) Europe is now, once again, demonstrating its mastery of the art of the paradox.
Whilst on the one hand it destroys our agriculture by dismantling the CAP and the system of direct aid to farmers, it suggests in this report, that priority should be given to family farming and to support for small and medium-sized holdings, to stepping up actions to promote rural development and even to protecting women on farms and in the EU's rural areas.
Unfortunately it appears that, at a time when the death of our farming is pre-ordained - this is why all farming unions condemn the CAP reform that will come into force in 2005 - the wishes of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities will remain pious hopes.
This report rightly condemns the ageing of the female farming population, the low number of women who have the status of spouse-partner or assistant, which puts them in an extremely difficult situation with regard to their pay, their social security, their care under the medical system, their retirement and their professional development.
The report also notes the high unemployment rate in farming regions.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) We have, of course, voted in favour of this resolution which seeks to improve safety in coaches, whether this involves the wearing of safety belts, driver training or limiting driving time.
The series of fatal accidents that have occurred recently has once again highlighted the exploitation of drivers, who are often forced to drive to the point of falling asleep.
We also wish to condemn the scramble for profit which encourages the construction of coaches with ever-greater capacity, in particular, double-decker coaches.
Where transport sector employers are concerned, profit comes well before safety.
Mr President, I would just like to make brief reference to something that happened this afternoon, and which gives me pause for thought.
Specifically, I refer to a report to the effect that my group had lost a vote, even though, according to the Rules of Procedure, we had won it.
The vote was on Amendment No 17 to the Lisi report.
There were 457 of us here in the Chamber for the vote.
In Germany, there is a novel entitled 'Der Sommer, der ein Winter war' - I do not know what it was called when translated into other languages, but I think we can start writing a novel entitled 'The Thursday that was a Friday'.
I would like to ask the bureau to find out whether a majority of our Members want to ascertain whether the last 50 cents of our allowances were spent on a stamp or whether we might perhaps do some real legislative work here on a Thursday.
A vote by 457 Members, 160 of them voting against, means that we are, in some sense, neutering ourselves as a legislative body with the power of codecision.
This state of affairs has to be stopped, and measures must be introduced in order to do so.
Thank you very much for you comment. I have taken good note of it.
Parliament has come to the end of its agenda.
The Minutes for this sitting will be subject to the approval of Parliament at the beginning of the next part-session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 5.35 p.m.)
Statement by the President
Colleagues, after what has been a particularly violent summer, including ongoing attacks on military personnel in Iraq, horrendous attacks on innocent civilians in Mumbai, in Jerusalem, and again at the weekend in Najaf, it is my sad duty to recall in particular the bombing of the United Nations' headquarters in Baghdad.
On 19 August 2003 the UN Special Representative to Iraq, Mr Sergio de Mello, died together with UN personnel, Iraqi civilians and workers from other humanitarian aid and bilateral organisations attending a coordination meeting in the UN building at that time, on that day.
Immediately, on your behalf, I sent a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, expressing our most profound sympathy and solidarity with the families, friends and colleagues of the victims.
This time the United Nations has suffered a grievous blow.
We are aware that with the tragic death of Mr de Mello, the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, lost not only a uniquely competent representative and advisor, but also a close and valued friend.
Mr Annan should know that he has the full and determined support of the European Parliament in these sombre and testing times.
The tragedy of the lost lives has touched us in Parliament too in personal and direct ways.
Among the dead were a former parliamentary assistant to a Member of this House and the brother of a member of our staff.
The most fitting tribute to the steadfast courage of Mr Sergio de Mello and the others who lost their lives in Baghdad would be for the United Nations to achieve its aims of rapidly re-establishing in Iraq respect for international law and law and order, and decent living conditions for the Iraqi population.
I ask you to honour their memory with a minute's silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, August 28 2003 has been distributed.
The following change has been proposed:
Mr President, with regard to this proposal, please allow me to remind the House that, in my capacity as President of the European Parliament, in 1991, I had the honour of presenting the Sakharov Prize, in the absence of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, to her husband, a British citizen who has since died.
She has continued to fight for the same cause since 1991.
I believe that, rather than hold a topical and urgent debate, we should make an appeal and pay homage to the perseverance of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, and also support her just cause.
Clearly the House is fully in agreement with that sentiment.
(Parliament agreed to the request)
The order of business was thus established.
Mr President, I know there is a dreary repetitiveness about this, but could you tell us, now that poor old Ryanair has been prevented from flying to Strasbourg, whether Air France - about which this House has very mixed views - is prepared to reinstate its flight from London which it cancelled at the first sign of any competition on the route?
I raised this matter last week with the French Minister for European Affairs.
I understand that it will have her urgent attention.
If I have any further information on further contacts I propose to have this week, I will be happy to ensure that the House is informed.
I suppose we also have to learn from experience, which is another form of information in this regard.
Mr President, just to add to that comment, the spokesman for Brit Air, the subsidiary of Air France which operated the flight, opined in The Times newspaper last week that even if the judgement against the Ryanair subsidy was confirmed, they might not re-establish the flight to Strasbourg, since they might find more profitable routes.
This led me to write a letter that The Times printed, saying the European taxpayer would find it more profitable not to subsidise this EUR 169 million a year travelling circus to Strasbourg at all.
Mr President, I am sorry to have to denounce an unacceptable and disgraceful action by the Turkish forces illegally occupying the northern part of Cyprus.
Last Saturday, two Greek Cypriot teachers from the Greek primary school of Rizokarpaso, Alexia and Grigoris Koukotsikas, were expelled together with their children from Rizokarpaso, where they had gone to hand over the school building and requisites to their successors.
The Karpasia Coordinating Committee is conveying fears that any Greek Cypriots remaining in Karpasia will be expelled, starting with the families with children of secondary school age.
The committee has emphasised that, following a proposal to run a private secondary school in Rizokarpaso, the Turkish conquerors are also threatening to close the primary school in the village, which is the only Greek school open in the occupied territory.
I think there is no need, Mr President, for me to stress to this House how many and which fundamental rights and international agreements are being violated.
I call on you, Mr President, to intervene with the Turkish authorities in Ankara, the agents of which are again brazenly breaking the law in the occupied part of Cyprus.
Mr President, I would like to raise the same point.
For nearly 30 years the enclaved Greek Cypriot communities in the northern part of Cyprus have been denied secondary schooling for their children.
The result of this is that once their children reach school age, they have to go to other parts of Cyprus to attend schools.
This leads to the break-up of families and is designed purely to drive from their homes the few remaining Greek Cypriots in the northern part of Cyprus, which is currently controlled by Turkish authorities.
This is a matter on which the European Court of Human Rights has registered its protest and noted that this is a violation of Article 2.
I would call upon the House to appeal to Mr Denktash to reverse his decision not to allow the secondary schools to reopen.
For too long families in these enclave communities have been deprived of their human rights and deprived of the right to education.
Now that there are increasing signs of reconciliation between Cyprus' two communities, and on the eve of Cyprus' membership of the European Union, this is a very good time to show evidence of that reconciliation by allowing the secondary schools to re-open in the enclaved Greek Cypriot communities.
In response to the two Members, we will raise the matter with the appropriate authorities in both Ankara and Northern Cyprus.
Mr President, on behalf of this House, I ask you to convey your sympathy and commiserations to the family of Mrs Jean McConville, whose remains were accidentally found in the last week or so.
She was one of the nine 'disappeared' who the IRA in Ireland claims responsibility for.
This woman - a mother of ten children, a 37-year-old widow - was abducted, murdered and buried in a secret location nearly 30 years ago.
Five of the nine people for whose disappearance the IRA claims responsibility remain unaccounted for.
I also ask you to appeal to the Irish and British Governments to use whatever intermediaries they have with the IRA to seek more precise information about the location of those five unfortunate victims of IRA terror.
The peace of mind which the families of these 'disappeared' need is more important than the security and safety of the perpetrators of these murders.
Mr President, a week ago I was in the small town of Jogeva in Estonia and I witnessed the EU referendum campaign roadshow.
They had professional uniformed promotion girls distributing handfuls of tendentious propaganda.
One piece, with the imprint of the PPE-DE Group, featured a male model and was bizarrely headlined 'Vote yes for sexier men'.
(Laughter and applause)
A diplomat from the German Embassy in Estonia, Mr Carsten Wilms, made a speech in favour of accession.
This was a clear violation of Article 41 of the Vienna Convention 1961, which forbids diplomats from interfering in the internal affairs of host states.
Mr President, will you join me in condemning this breach of the Vienna Convention and will you write to foreign ministers of Member States reminding them of their obligations in this matter?
If I understood correctly, Mr Helmer, you remarked that the reference to 'sexier men' was on literature from the PPE-DE Group.
They must have known, sir, that you are associated with that group.
Mr President, allow me to observe that the military forces in Iraq, which you referred to at the beginning, are in fact occupying forces.
To my point now.
According to our information, the Romanian judiciary has deleted the Socialist Labour Party, which has 110 000 members and was represented in parliament until recently, from the list of recognised political parties in its country.
The decision to delete it is downright illegal, in that it violates Law 14 of 2003 on the operation of political parties.
It was taken following acute pressure exerted by the Romanian Government on the judiciary and following intervention in the internal affairs of the Socialist Labour Party on the part of the governing Social Democratic Party.
The Communist Party of Greece condemns the illegal and unacceptable action by the Romanian authorities, which is obviously intended to muzzle any opinion which defends fundamental rights and promotes socialist visions.
We cannot but correlate this illegal action with the installation of American military bases in Romania and with the imminent integration of this country into the European Union.
Mr President, with regret I would like to raise the issue of whistle-blowing.
I am referring to the case of a constituent of mine, Mr Robert Dougal Watt, who formerly worked for the Court of Auditors and who over a year ago communicated to many MEPs a deep concern about certain aspects of the conduct of business in the Court of Auditors.
Subsequently he went on sick leave and following that he became subject to disciplinary proceedings.
As his representative, I contacted the Secretary General of the Court of Auditors, not to express an opinion on the correctness or incorrectness of the points which Mr Watt had raised, but simply to draw to the attention of the Court that in my opinion, Mr Watt was, whether correct or incorrect, a public-spirited person acting for what he understood to be the public interest.
He ought to be treated with the respect that is due to those who do so.
I understand that subsequently the disciplinary board recommended that he be demoted, but, on 13th July 2003, I learned that he had just been dismissed.
This is the first opportunity I have to mention to colleagues my profound distress at the matter.
I believe that this House should look into the question of whether we have adequate protection for whistle-blowers in the European Union.
The rules have been changed and tightened but I am not satisfied that the situation works satisfactorily and I say this with great regret.
Those of us who believe most profoundly in the virtues of European integration have the greatest interest in ensuring that it is carried forward with unimpeachable integrity, taking into account the protection of individuals.
The issue to which you refer certainly deserves consideration.
Perhaps the Committee on Budgetary Control would be the most appropriate parliamentary body to consider that matter in the first instance.
Mr President, at the end of July and the beginning of August 2003 I attended the summing-up of the trial in Bogota of three Irishmen accused of training the FARC in Colombia.
Following the conclusion of the prosecution case, General Moro, Chief of Staff of the Colombian Army, went on television to call for the men's conviction, and this before the defence had even summed up.
The observers from the United States and Australia all concluded that there was no evidence against the men.
The delegation included lawyers, politicians and trade unionists.
This trial has been carefully watched internationally and if there is a negative verdict it will undoubtedly be a miscarriage of justice.
The Colombian authorities have made numerous serious prejudicial comments which cast doubts on the possibility of the trial being fair.
I would ask you, Mr President, to respond to the e-mail I sent to your office at the end of July concerning this issue.
Also, during our visit to the prison, the prison governor indicated quite clearly that these three men would not be safe in any prison in Colombia.
Therefore, now that the trial has come to a conclusion, it is very important, Mr President, that you, on behalf of the Members of this House, intervene on their behalf - as the British Government is doing in many cases where its own citizens are in difficulties.
I will respond to that.
Mr President, I was in Latvia a few weeks ago at the invitation of the Socialist Party of Latvia.
I had the opportunity to obtain information about certain very serious violations of fundamental human rights, the occasional progress reports on Latvia notwithstanding.
Thus, the Communist Party of Latvia is still outlawed.
Over 70 000 residents are deprived of all political rights and the right to obtain Latvian nationality, because eight months before the break up of the Soviet Union they had not left the Communist Party.
For the same reason, Latvian citizens have no right to stand for election.
Such is the case of Alfred Rubiks, the president of the Socialist Party, which is represented in parliament, and other important public figures.
Similarly, several hundred thousand out of a total population of 2 500 000 have no national identity, even though many have been living in Latvia for 100 years.
30% of the population have no voting rights and will not therefore be taking part in the referendum to be held on the European Union, meaning that the referendum is already null and void.
Although 45% of the residents of Latvia are Russian speaking, the Russian-speaking universities were closed in 1998 and although the full ban on Russian primary and secondary schools was ultimately revoked in the face of protests, it was limited nonetheless to just 40% of lessons.
In the face of this situation, the European Union is maintaining a stand of guilty tolerance, not to say consent.
Again we have the well-known policy of one sauce for the goose and another for the gander.
And this situation is not only in Latvia, it is also in Estonia and elsewhere.
How do you intend to react, Mr President, especially as there is a similar situation, as I said, in Estonia where, among other things, monuments are being erected to the SS?
I shall look into the issues you raised.
Mr President, you have already mentioned the tragic spate of terrorist bomb attacks against innocent civilians in Jerusalem and Baghdad on 19 August 2003, and the gruesome attack in Bombay on 25 August 2003.
Now we have Najaf.
I wish to address the serious issue that the Jerusalem bomb, which killed 20 bus passengers, including young infants, was carried out by the Islamist group Hamas, in spite of there being a cease-fire agreement with Israel at the time.
How is it possible that the EU continues to allow the political wing of Hamas to operate and gather funds for its activities and so-called charities in the EU?
Already America has placed it on the list of banned terrorist organisations and even the Palestinian Authority has cracked down by freezing its financial assets and closing down its newspapers.
Surely it is time for the Commission and the Council of Ministers to do likewise in our common cause of fighting international terrorism.
We will have a debate on the Middle East in the September II part-session.
This is an issue, among others, regarding the Middle East that can be raised with the appropriate institutions at that time.
Mr President, the European Union continues to keep quiet in the face of the major crime being perpetrated in Palestine by Sharon's mafia government.
In addition to the wall of shame, which is now 150 kilometres long - with the prospect of increasing to 350 km - and 8.5 metres high, Israel's policy is still to murder political rivals - Hamas cadres - in cold blood and bomb the Palestinians, resulting in death and injury.
My question is: why is the European Union still financing Israel and why has the European Union's High Representative, Mr Solana, who is in Israel, not condemned these murders?
Mr President, I wish to ask you about the fate that awaits the Laotian companions of Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud who, as we know, have fortunately been released after being arrested and sentenced to more than twenty years in prison.
We know nothing, however, about the fate of the Laotians who were travelling with them.
I should like to know whether it would be possible to obtain any information about them because logic would dictate that the men accompanying the journalists should also be released.
They appear not to have been fortunate enough to benefit from the action taken by Foreign Affairs Ministers and Ambassadors to ensure the journalists' release.
We will need to make inquiries on that, Mrs AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard, and then refer back to you and the House on the matter.
Mr President, before the August holidays I was in Romania, not least in order to carry out a task assigned to me by the Robert Schuman Foundation, of which I am Secretary-General.
While I was there, I met groups of entrepreneurs and, in particular, farmers and growers.
I received a complaint that I would like to pass on to the Commissioner and all the members of the delegation for relations with that country.
First and foremost, the farmers complained of unacceptable delays in the implementation of the ISPA and Sapard programmes, delays which they made it quite clear were due to the poor functioning of the government agency acting as a filter: a lack of basic information, no help in planning the projects, the arbitrary way in which the projects are transferred from Bucharest to Brussels, the exorbitant cost of the little advice available and unjustified delays imposed by a bureaucratic machine which penalises, above all, the outermost areas of Romania, which are certainly the poorest.
I would ask you, Mr President, to be so kind as to inform the members of the Romanian delegation of this issue at the Conference of Presidents, and I would ask the Commissioner to intervene as far as is in his power.
Mr President, I should like to report that we have arrived safely here in Strasbourg.
Five members of our group went the whole distance, all of the 530 km.
Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Turmes, Mr Bouwman, Mr Mayol and I would like to thank you for the support.
It was a real advertisement for cycling in Europe, both short and long distance.
It was also an advertisement for the European notion.
We crossed four national boundaries.
In that way, we met a huge number of people, and the local authorities welcomed us with open arms.
We invite you all to join us next year to do it again.
Mr President, setting aside the issue of the choice by the new Spanish caudillos regarding Mr Rajoy - which, by the way, reminds us of General Franco 34 years ago - I will focus on the meaning of the outrageous exclusion of my political party more than one year ago.
Political pluralism and cultural diversity are values preached by everybody in this House.
The banning of Batasuna is thus a European, and not just a Spanish, mistake.
That is so because, for the accession countries, it is vital that there should be an overall agreement on the principle that strong, assertive, renewed cultural and political diversity is, at the beginning of the new Millennium, a universal fact of European life.
European integration can never be reduced to the sheer assimilation of small nations: our cultural diversity and inner cohesion could be destroyed.
This Parliament cannot evade its responsibility on this crucial issue.
Those who have been outlawed will, all the same, stick to the political path, wrangling for rapid and efficient diplomatic action, without preconditions, towards a definite solution to the ongoing conflict in the Basque country.
Be sure, Mr President, of my personal commitment.
Mr President, towards the end of last year the Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee agreed on the final content of the second pillar of the Aarhus Convention, the Directive on public participation in decision-making on the environment.
I was in the role of rapporteur during the conciliation procedure.
Of key importance in the acceptance of the outcome of conciliation was the undertaking by the Commission to put forward a proposal on the third pillar of the Aarhus Convention during the first quarter of 2003, which is to say by the end of March this year.
In compliance with a decision taken by the Conciliation Committee, the Commission appended a declaration to the directive published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, in which it reconfirmed this undertaking.
At present, that undertaking by the Commission remains unfulfilled.
The Commission has still not adopted the proposal for a Directive on access to justice in environmental matters, even though the last quarter of the year is already upon us, which means the proposal is six months late.
The failure of the Commission to live up to the undertaking it gave is greatly undermining Parliament's confidence, and is indefensible and unacceptable.
For this reason, I would ask you, Mr President, to draft a letter to the President of the Commission without delay, containing a reminder by Parliament of the undertaking given, and in which you reprimand the Commission for not having kept to this undertaking of theirs or not even having shown they were in any way ready to explain the delay to Parliament, and in which you call on the Commission to adopt the missing proposals to be appended to the Aarhus Convention and present them to Parliament during September.
Please send a short note or e-mail to me with the relevant facts which I will communicate to the Commission, as you suggest.
Mr President, on 14 August there was a very serious accident at the oil refinery belonging to Repsol YPF in Puertollano, one of the main refineries in Spain, located in my region of Castilla-la Mancha.
The explosion and fire which followed it led to the deaths of seven workers. Many people were also injured, causing great distress in the city, in my province of Ciudad Real and in the whole of Spain.
Unfortunately, the deficiencies in the protection measures in such a dangerous industry have been demonstrated, but, above all, it has become clear that accidents and deaths resulting from them have increased as a result of sub-contracting and the general work insecurity in Spain, which is three times higher than the Community average.
I would like to ask the President to send a message of condolence and solidarity on behalf of this Parliament to the families of the dead and injured workers and the municipal, provincial and regional authorities which have played an important and worthy role in dealing with the accident and its consequences.
I would be happy to do that.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many of you have heard of Ingrid Betancourt, representative of Colombia's Green Party, whose relatives have visited this House on several occasions.
It is now a year and a half since she was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
The position of the family and the Colombian Green Party, as well as the European Parliament's Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, has been to encourage a humanitarian exchange, whilst criticising FARC and saying that it is unacceptable to propose a political exchange.
Yesterday, the Colombian press received a cassette containing a threefold message from Ingrid Betancourt: firstly, if you want to mount a military operation in order to set me free then go ahead, but be careful!
Secondly, humanitarian exchanges can only take place between armies and thirdly, as far as we are concerned - we, the politicians who have been kidnapped - only FARC can give us an unconditional release.
I believe that this message, surprising as it is, can be explained both by the extreme courage of Ingrid Betancourt on the one hand, who does not hesitate to take risks in the name of her political principles and, on the other, by FARC's desire to show that they are prepared to allow their prisoner to appeal to public opinion, even if only to say 'attack us!'
What I would ask, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, is that we give firm support to Ingrid Betancourt's third proposal, which is to clearly ask FARC to release all their political prisoners unilaterally, because it is unacceptable to take negotiators or representatives of the people hostage.
Mr President, the news from Britain that the future of the Thorp nuclear reprocessing facility is bleak is very welcome from the Irish perspective.
The people of Ireland have been totally forthright in their opposition to the existence and expansion of nuclear operations at Sellafield.
I have spoken on this many times in this House over the last 20 years.
I have had the privilege to visit that plant on behalf of my party in Ireland on two occasions, one of which was the NIREX inquiry.
However, we were particularly angered by the imposition of the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in 1993.
The Thorp plant has long been a nuclear white elephant for the British people, but the people of Ireland have been totally opposed to it for many years, and will continue to be opposed to it.
It was reported last week that operations at the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant may cease sooner rather than later.
I hope that the British Government gives the necessary clarification in this case.
